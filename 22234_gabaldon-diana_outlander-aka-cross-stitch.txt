diana gabaldon outlander aka cross stitch the first book in the outlander series to the memory of my mother who taught me to read jacqueline sykes gabaldon people disappear all the time ask any policeman better yet ask a journalist disappearances are breadandbutter to journalists young girls run away from home young children stray from their parents and are never seen again housewives reach the end of their tether and take the grocery money and a taxi to the station international financiers change their names and vanish into the smoke of imported cigars many of the lost will be found eventually dead or alive disappearances after all have explanations usually part one inverness chapter a new beginning it wasnt a very likely place for disappearances at least at first glance mrs bairds was like a thousand other highland bedandbreakfast establishments in clean and quiet with fading floral wallpaper gleaming floors and a coinoperated hotwater geyser in the lavatory mrs baird herself was squat and easygoing and made no objection to frank lining her tiny rosesprigged parlor with the dozens of books and papers with which he always traveled i met mrs baird in the front hall on my way out she stopped me with a pudgy hand on my arm and patted at my hair dear me mrs randall ye canna go out like that here just let me tuck that bit in for ye there thats better ye know my cousin was tellin me about a new perm she tried comes out beautiful and holds like a dream perhaps ye should try that kind next time i hadnt the heart to tell her that the waywardness of my light brown curls was strictly the fault of nature and not due to any dereliction on the part of the permanentwave manufacturers her own tightly marceled waves suffered from no such perversity yes ill do that mrs baird i lied im just going down to the village to meet frank well be back for tea i ducked out the door and down the path before she could detect any further defects in my undisciplined appearance after four years as a royal army nurse i was enjoying the escape from uniforms and rationing by indulging in brightly printed light cotton dresses totally unsuited for rough walking through the heather not that i had originally planned to do a lot of that my thoughts ran more on the lines of sleeping late in the mornings and long lazy afternoons in bed with frank not sleeping however it was difficult to maintain the proper mood of languorous romance with mrs baird industriously hoovering away outside our door that must be the dirtiest bit of carpet in the entire scottish highlands frank had observed that morning as we lay in bed listening to the ferocious roar of the vacuum in the hallway nearly as dirty as our landladys mind i agreed perhaps we should have gone to brighton after all we had chosen the highlands as a place to holiday before frank took up his appointment as a history professor at oxford on the grounds that scotland had been somewhat less touched by the physical horrors of war than the rest of britain and was less susceptible to the frenetic postwar gaiety that infected more popular vacation spots and without discussing it i think we both felt that it was a symbolic place to reestablish our marriage we had been married and spent a twoday honeymoon in the highlands shortly before the outbreak of war seven years before a peaceful refuge in which to rediscover each other we thought not realizing that while golf and fishing are scotlands most popular outdoor sports gossip is the most popular indoor sport and when it rains as much as it does in scotland people spend a lot of time indoors where are you going i asked as frank swung his feet out of bed id hate the dear old thing to be disappointed in us he answered sitting up on the side of the ancient bed he bounced gently up and down creating a piercing rhythmic squeak the hoovering in the hall stopped abruptly after a minute or two of bouncing he gave a loud theatrical groan and collapsed backward with a twang of protesting springs i giggled helplessly into a pillow so as not to disturb the breathless silence outside frank waggled his eyebrows at me youre supposed to moan ecstatically not giggle he admonished in a whisper shell think im not a good lover youll have to keep it up for longer than that if you expect ecstatic moans i answered two minutes doesnt deserve any more than a giggle inconsiderate little wench i came here for a rest remember lazybones youll never manage the next branch on your family tree unless you show a bit more industry than that franks passion for genealogy was yet another reason for choosing the highlands according to one of the filthy scraps of paper he lugged to and fro some tiresome ancestor of his had had something to do with something or other in this region back in the middle of the eighteenth or was it seventeenth century if i end as a childless stub on my family tree it will undoubtedly be the fault of our untiring hostess out there after all weve been married almost eight years little frank jr will be quite legitimate without being conceived in the presence of a witness if hes conceived at all i said pessimistically we had been disappointed yet again the week before leaving for our highland retreat with all this bracing fresh air and healthy diet how could we help but manage here dinner the night before had been herring fried lunch had been herring pickled and the pungent scent now wafting up the stairwell strongly intimated that breakfast was to be herring kippered unless youre contemplating an encore performance for the edification of mrs baird i suggested youd better get dressed arent you meeting that parson at ten the rev dr reginald wakefield vicar of the local parish was to provide some rivetingly fascinating baptismal registers for franks inspection not to mention the glittering prospect that he might have unearthed some moldering army despatches or somesuch that mentioned the notorious ancestor whats the name of that greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather of yours again i asked the one that mucked about here during one of the risings i cant remember if it was willy or walter actually it was jonathan frank took my complete disinterest in family history placidly but remained always on guard ready to seize the slightest expression of inquisitiveness as an excuse for telling me all facts known to date about the early randalls and their connections his eyes assumed the fervid gleam of the fanatic lecturer as he buttoned his shirt jonathan wolverton randall wolverton for his mothers uncle a minor knight from sussex he was however known by the rather dashing nickname of black jack something he acquired in the army probably during the time he was stationed here i flopped facedown on the bed and affected to snore ignoring me frank went on with his scholarly exegesis he bought his commission in the midthirties s that is and served as a captain of dragoons according to those old letters cousin may sent me he did quite well in the army good choice for a second son you know his younger brother followed tradition as well by becoming a curate but i havent found out much about him yet anyway jack randall was highly commended by the duke of sandringham for his activities before and during the the second jacobite rising you know he amplified for the benefit of the ignorant amongst his audience namely me you know bonnie prince charlie and that lot im not entirely sure the scots realize they lost that one i interrupted sitting up and trying to subdue my hair i distinctly heard the barman at that pub last night refer to us as sassenachs well why not said frank equably it only means englishman after all or at worst outlander and were all of that i know what it means it was the tone i objected to frank searched through the bureau drawer for a belt he was just annoyed because i told him the ale was weak i told him the true highland brew requires an old boot to be added to the vat and the final product to be strained through a wellworn undergarment ah that accounts for the amount of the bill well i phrased it a little more tactfully than that but only because the gaelic language hasnt got a specific word for drawers i reached for a pair of my own intrigued why not did the ancient gaels not wear undergarments frank leered youve never heard that old song about what a scotsman wears beneath his kilts presumably not gents kneelength stepins i said dryly perhaps ill go out in search of a local kiltwearer whilst youre cavorting with vicars and ask him well do try not to get arrested claire the dean of st giles college wouldnt like it at all in the event there were no kiltwearers loitering about the town square or patronizing the shops that surrounded it there were a number of other people there though mostly housewives of the mrs baird type doing their daily shopping they were garrulous and gossipy and their solid printclad presences filled the shops with a cozy warmth a buttress against the cold mist of the morning outdoors with as yet no house of my own to keep i had little that needed buying but enjoyed myself in browsing among the newly replenished shelves for the pure joy of seeing lots of things for sale again it had been a long time of rationing of doing without the simple things like soap and eggs and even longer without the minor luxuries of life like lheure bleu cologne my gaze lingered on a shop window filled with household goods embroidered tea cloths and cozies pitchers and glasses a stack of quite homely pie tins and a set of three vases i had never owned a vase in my life during the war years i had of course lived in the nurses quarters first at pembroke hospital later at the field station in france but even before that we had lived nowhere long enough to justify the purchase of such an item had i had such a thing i reflected uncle lamb would have filled it with potsherds long before i could have got near it with a bunch of daisies quentin lambert beauchamp q to his archaeological students and his friends dr beauchamp to the scholarly circles in which he moved and lectured and had his being but always uncle lamb to me my fathers only brother and my only living relative at the time he had been landed with me aged five when my parents were killed in a car crash poised for a trip to the middle east at the time he had paused in his preparations long enough to make the funeral arrangements dispose of my parents estates and enroll me in a proper girls boarding school which i had flatly refused to attend faced with the necessity of prying my chubby fingers off the cars door handle and dragging me by the heels up the steps of the school uncle lamb who hated personal conflict of any kind had sighed in exasperation then finally shrugged and tossed his better judgment out the window along with my newly purchased round straw boater ruddy thing he muttered seeing it rolling merrily away in the rearview mirror as we roared down the drive in high gear always loathed hats on women anyway he had glanced down at me fixing me with a fierce glare one thing he said in awful tones you are not to play dolls with my persian grave figurines anything else but not that got it i had nodded content and had gone with him to the middle east to south america to dozens of study sites throughout the world had learned to read and write from the drafts of journal articles to dig latrines and boil water and to do a number of other things not suitable for a young lady of gentle birth until i had met the handsome darkhaired historian who came to consult uncle lamb on a point of french philosophy as it related to egyptian religious practice even after our marriage frank and i led the nomadic life of junior faculty divided between continental conferences and temporary flats until the outbreak of war had sent him to officers training and the intelligence unit at m and me to nurses training though we had been married nearly eight years the new house in oxford would be our first real home tucking my handbag firmly under my arm i marched into the shop and bought the vases i met frank at the crossing of the high street and the gereside road and we turned up it together he raised his eyebrows at my purchases vases he smiled wonderful perhaps now youll stop putting flowers in my books they arent flowers theyre specimens and it was you who suggested i take up botany to occupy my mind now that ive not got nursing to do i reminded him true he nodded goodhumoredly but i didnt realize id have bits of greenery dropping out into my lap every time i opened a reference what was that horrible crumbly brown stuff you put in tuscum and banks groutweed good for hemorrhoids preparing for my imminent old age are you well how very thoughtful of you claire we pushed through the gate laughing and frank stood back to let me go first up the narrow front steps suddenly he caught my arm look out you dont want to step in it i lifted my foot gingerly over a large brownishred stain on the top step how odd i said mrs baird scrubs the steps down every morning ive seen her what do you suppose that can be frank leaned over the step sniffing delicately offhand i should say that its blood blood i took a step back into the entryway whose i glanced nervously into the house do you suppose mrs bairds had an accident of some kind i couldnt imagine our immaculate landlady leaving bloodstains to dry on her doorstep unless some major catastrophe had occurred and wondered just for a moment whether the parlor might be harboring a crazed axmurderer even now preparing to spring out on us with a spinechilling shriek frank shook his head he stood on tiptoe to peer over the hedge into the next garden i shouldnt think so theres a stain like it on the collinses doorstep as well really i drew closer to frank both to see over the hedge and for moral support the highlands hardly seemed a likely spot for a mass murderer but then i doubted such persons used any sort of logical criteria when picking their sites thats rather disagreeable i observed there was no sign of life from the next residence what do you suppose has happened frank frowned thinking then slapped his hand briefly against his trouser leg in inspiration i think i know wait here a moment he darted out to the gate and set off down the road at a trot leaving me stranded on the edge of the doorstep he was back shortly beaming with confirmation yes thats it it must be every house in the row has had it had what a visit from a homicidal maniac i spoke a bit sharply still nervous at having been abruptly abandoned with nothing but a large bloodstain for company frank laughed no a ritual sacrifice fascinating he was down on his hands and knees in the grass peering interestedly at the stain this hardly sounded better than a homicidal maniac i squatted beside him wrinkling my nose at the smell it was early for flies but a couple of the big slowmoving highland midges circled the stain what do you mean ritual sacrifice i demanded mrs bairds a good churchgoer and so are all the neighbors this isnt druids hill or anything you know he stood brushing grassends from his trousers thats all you know my girl he said theres no place on earth with more of the old superstitions and magic mixed into its daily life than the scottish highlands church or no church mrs baird believes in the old folk and so do all the neighbors he pointed at the stain with one neatly polished toe the blood of a black cock he explained looking pleased the houses are new you see prefabs i looked at him coldly if you are under the impression that that explains everything think again what difference does it make how old the houses are and where on earth is everybody down the pub i should expect lets go along and see shall we taking my arm he steered me out the gate and we set off down the gereside road in the old days he explained as we went and not so long ago either when a house was built it was customary to kill something and bury it under the foundation as a propitiation to the local earth spirits you know he shall lay the foundations thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it old as the hills i shuddered at the quotation in that case i suppose its quite modern and enlightened of them to be using chickens instead you mean since the houses are fairly new nothing was buried under them and the inhabitants are now remedying the omission yes exactly frank seemed pleased with my progress and patted me on the back according to the vicar many of the local folk thought the war was due in part to people turning away from their roots and omitting to take proper precautions such as burying a sacrifice under the foundation that is or burning fishes bones on the hearth except haddocks of course he added happily distracted you never burn a haddocks bones did you know or youll never catch another always bury the bones of a haddock instead ill bear it in mind i said tell me what you do in order never to see another herring and ill do it forthwith he shook his head absorbed in one of his feats of memory those brief periods of scholastic rapture where he lost touch with the world around him absorbed completely in conjuring up knowledge from all its sources i dont know about herring he said absently for mice though you hang bunches of trembling jock about trembling jock i the hoose and yell neer see a moose you know bodies under the foundation though thats where a lot of the local ghosts come from you know mountgerald the big house at the end of the high street theres a ghost there a workman on the house who was killed as a sacrifice for the foundation in the eighteenth century sometime thats really fairly recent he added thoughtfully the story goes that by order of the houses owner one wall was built up first then a stone block was dropped from the top of it onto one of the workmen presumably a dislikable fellow was chosen for the sacrifice and he was buried then in the cellar and the rest of the house built up over him he haunts the cellar where he was killed except on the anniversary of his death and the four old days old days the ancient feasts he explained still lost in his mental notes hogmanay thats new years midsummer day beltane and all hallows druids beaker folk early picts everybody kept the sun feasts and the fire feasts so far as we know anyway ghosts are freed on the holy days and can wander about at will to do harm or good as they please he rubbed his chin thoughtfully its getting on for beltane close to the spring equinox best keep an eye out next time you pass the kirkyard his eyes twinkled and i realized the trance had ended i laughed are there a number of famous local ghosts then he shrugged dont know well ask the vicar shall we next time we see him we saw the vicar quite shortly in fact he along with most of the other inhabitants of the village was down in the pub having a lagerandlight in celebration of the houses new sanctification he seemed rather embarrassed at being caught in the act of condoning acts of paganism as it were but brushed it off as merely a local observance with historical color like the wearing of the green really rather fascinating you know he confided and i recognized with an internal sigh the song of the scholar as identifying a sound as the terrwhit of a thrush harking to the call of a kindred spirit frank at once settled down to the mating dance of academe and they were soon neckdeep in archetypes and the parallels between ancient superstitions and modern religions i shrugged and made my own way through the crowd to the bar and back a large brandyandsplash in each hand knowing from experience how difficult it was to distract franks attention from this sort of discussion i simply picked up his hand wrapped his fingers about the stem of the glass and left him to his own devices i found mrs baird on a deep bench near the window sharing a companionable pint of bitter with an elderly man whom she introduced to me as mr crook this is the man i tellt ye about mrs randall she said eyes bright with the stimulation of alcohol and company the one as knows about plants of all sorts mrs randalls verra much interested in the wee plants she confided to her companion who inclined his head in a combination of politeness and deafness presses them in books and such do ye indeed mr crook asked one tufted white brow raised in interest ive some presses the real ones mind for plants and such had them from my nephew when he come up from university over his holiday he brought them for me and id not the heart to tell him i never uses such things hangins whats wanted for herbs ye ken or maybe to be dried on a frame and put in a bit o gauze bag or a jar but whyever youd be after squashing the wee things flat ive no idea well to look at maybe mrs baird interjected kindly mrs randalls made some lovely bits out of mallow blossoms and violets same as you could put in a frame and hang on the wall like mmmphm mr crooks seamed face seemed to be admitting a dubious possibility to this suggestion weel if theyre of any use to ye missus you can have the presses and welcome i didna wish to be throwing them awa but i must say ive no use for them i assured mr crook that i would be delighted to make use of the plant presses and still more delighted if he would show me where some of the rarer plants in the area could be found he eyed me sharply for a moment head to one side like an elderly kestrel but appeared finally to decide that my interest was genuine and we fixed it up that i should meet him in the morning for a tour of the local shrubbery frank i knew meant to go into inverness for the day to consult some records in the town hall there and i was pleased to have an excuse not to accompany him one record was much like another so far as i was concerned soon after this frank pried himself away from the vicar and we walked home in company with mrs baird i was reluctant to mention the cocks blood on the doorstep myself but frank suffered from no such reticence and questioned her eagerly as to the background of the custom i suppose its quite old then he asked swishing a stick along through the roadside weeds lambsquarters and cinquefoil were already blooming and i could see the buds of sweet broom swelling another week and theyd be in flower och aye mrs baird waddled along at a brisk pace asking no quarter from our younger limbs older than anyone knows mr randall even back before the days of the giants giants i asked aye fionn and the feinn ye ken gaelic folktales frank remarked with interest heroes you know probably from norse roots theres a lot of the norse influence round here and all the way up the coast to the west some of the place names are norse you know not gaelic at all i rolled my eyes sensing another outburst but mrs baird smiled kindly and encouraged him saying that was true then shed been up to the north and seen the two brothers stone and that was norse wasnt it the norsemen came down on that coast hundreds of times between ad and or so frank said looking dreamily at the horizon seeing dragonships in the windswept cloud vikings you know and they brought a lot of their own myths along its a good country for myths things seem to take root here this i could believe twilight was coming on and so was a storm in the eerie light beneath the clouds even the thoroughly modern houses along the road looked as ancient and as sinister as the weathered pictish stone that stood a hundred feet away guarding the crossroads it had marked for a thousand years it seemed a good night to be inside with the shutters fastened rather than staying cozily in mrs bairds parlor to be entertained by stereopticon views of perth harbor though frank chose to keep his appointment for sherry with mr bainbridge a solicitor with an interest in local historical records bearing in mind my earlier encounter with mr bainbridge i elected to stay at home with perth harbor try to come back before the storm breaks i said kissing frank goodbye and give my regards to mr bainbridge umm yes yes of course carefully not meeting my eye frank shrugged into his overcoat and left collecting an umbrella from the stand by the door i closed the door after him but left it on the latch so he could get back in i wandered back toward the parlor reflecting that frank would doubtless pretend that he didnt have a wife a pretense in which mr bainbridge would cheerfully join not that i could blame him particularly at first everything had gone quite well on our visit to mr bainbridges home the afternoon before i had been demure genteel intelligent but selfeffacing well groomed and quietly dressed everything the perfect dons wife should be until the tea was served i now turned my right hand over ruefully examining the large blister that ran across the bases of all four fingers after all it was not my fault that mr bainbridge a widower made do with a cheap tin teapot instead of a proper crockery one nor that the solicitor seeking to be polite had asked me to pour out nor that the potholder he provided had a worn patch that allowed the redhot handle of the teapot to come into direct contact with my hand when i picked it up no i decided dropping the teapot was a perfectly normal reaction dropping it into mr bainbridges lap was merely an accident of placement i had to drop it somewhere it was my exclaiming bloody fucking hell in a voice that topped mr bainbridges heartcry that had made frank glare at me across the scones once he recovered from the shock mr bainbridge had been quite gallant fussing about my hand and ignoring franks attempts to excuse my language on grounds that i had been stationed in a field hospital for the better part of two years im afraid my wife picked up a number of er colorful expressions from the yanks and such frank offered with a nervous smile true i said gritting my teeth as i wrapped a watersoaked napkin about my hand men tend to be very colorful when youre picking shrapnel out of them mr bainbridge had tactfully tried to distract the conversation onto neutral historical ground by saying that he had always been interested in the variations of what was considered profane speech through the ages there was gorblimey for example a recent corruption of the oath god blind me yes of course said frank gratefully accepting the diversion no sugar thank you claire what about gadzooks the gad part is quite clear of course but the zook well you know the solicitor interjected ive sometimes thought it might be a corruption of an old scots word in fact yeuk means itch that would make sense wouldnt it frank nodded letting his unscholarly forelock fall across his forehead he pushed it back automatically interesting he said the whole evolution of profanity yes and its still going on i said carefully picking up a lump of sugar with the tongs oh said mr bainbridge politely did you encounter some interesting variations during your er war experience oh yes i said my favorite was one i picked up from a yank man named williamson from new york i believe he said it every time i changed his dressing what was it jesus h roosevelt christ i said and dropped the sugar lump neatly into franks coffee after a peaceful and not unpleasant sit with mrs baird i made my way upstairs to ready myself before frank came home i knew his limit with sherry was two glasses so i expected him back soon the wind was rising and the very air of the bedroom was prickly with electricity i drew the brush through my hair making the curls snap with static and spring into knots and furious tangles my hair would have to do without its hundred strokes tonight i decided i would settle for brushing my teeth in this sort of weather strands of hair adhered stickily to my cheeks clinging stubbornly as i tried to smooth them back no water in the ewer frank had used it tidying himself before setting out for his meeting with mr bainbridge and i had not bothered to refill it from the lavatory tap i picked up the bottle of lheure bleu and poured a generous puddle into the palm of my hand rubbing my hands briskly together before the scent could evaporate i smoothed them rapidly through my hair i poured another dollop onto my hairbrush and swept the curls back behind my ears with it well that was rather better i thought turning my head from side to side to examine the results in the speckled looking glass the moisture had dissipated the static electricity in my hair so that it floated in heavy shining waves about my face and the evaporating alcohol had left behind a very pleasant scent frank would like that i thought lheure bleu was his favorite there was a sudden flash close at hand with the crash of thunder following close on its heels and all the lights went out cursing under my breath i groped in the drawers somewhere i had seen candles and matches power failure was so frequent an occurrence in the highlands that candles were a necessary furnishing for all inn and hotel rooms i had seen them even in the most elegant hotels where they were scented with honeysuckle and presented in frosted glass holders with shimmering pendants mrs bairds candles were far more utilitarian plain white plumbers candles but there were a lot of them and three folders of matches as well i was not inclined to be picky over style at a time like this i fitted a candle to the blue ceramic holder on the dressing table by the light of the next flash then moved about the room lighting others til the whole room was filled with a soft wavering radiance very romantic i thought and with some presence of mind i pressed down the light switch so that a sudden return of power shouldnt ruin the mood at some inopportune moment the candles had burned no more than a halfinch when the door opened and frank blew in literally for the draft that followed him up the stairs extinguished three of the candles the door closed behind him with a bang that blew out two more and he peered into the sudden gloom pushing a hand through his disheveled hair i got up and relit the candles making mild remarks about his abrupt methods of entering rooms it was only when i had finished and turned to ask him whether hed like a drink that i saw he was looking rather white and unsettled whats the matter i said seen a ghost well you know he said slowly im not at all sure that i havent absentmindedly he picked up my hairbrush and raised it to tidy his hair when a sudden whiff of lheure bleu reached his nostrils he wrinkled his nose and set it down again settling for the attentions of his pocket comb instead i glanced through the window where the elm trees were lashing to and fro like flails a loose shutter was banging somewhere on the other side of the house and it occurred to me that we ought perhaps to close our own though the carryon outside was rather exciting to watch bit blustery for a ghost id think i said dont they like quiet misty evenings in graveyards frank laughed a bit sheepishly well i daresay its only bainbridges stories plus a bit more of his sherry than i really meant to have nothing at all likely now i was curious what exactly did you see i asked settling myself on the dressingtable seat i motioned to the whisky bottle with a halflifted brow and frank went at once to pour a couple of drinks well only a man really he began measuring out a jigger for himself and two for me standing down in the road outside what outside this house i laughed must have been a ghost then i cant feature any living person standing about on a night like this frank tilted the ewer over his glass then looked accusingly at me when no water came out dont look at me i said you used up all the water i dont mind it neat though i took a sip in illustration frank looked as though he were tempted to nip down to the lavatory for water but abandoned the idea and went on with his story sipping cautiously as though his glass contained vitriol rather than the best glenfiddich single malt whisky yes he was down at the edge of the garden on this side standing by the fence i thought he hesitated looking down into his glass i rather thought he was looking up at your window my window how extraordinary i couldnt repress a mild shiver and went across to fasten the shutters though it seemed a bit late for that frank followed me across the room still talking yes i could see you myself from below you were brushing your hair and cursing a bit because it was standing on end in that case the fellow was probably enjoying a good laugh i said tartly frank shook his head though he smiled and smoothed his hands over my hair no he wasnt laughing in fact he seemed terribly unhappy about something not that i could see his face well just something about the way he stood i came up behind him and when he didnt move i asked politely if i could help him with something he acted at first as though he didnt hear me and i thought perhaps he didnt over the noise of the wind so i repeated myself and i reached out to tap his shoulder to get his attention you know but before i could touch him he whirled suddenly round and pushed past me and walked off down the road sounds a bit rude but not very ghostly i observed draining my glass what did he look like big chap said frank frowning in recollection and a scot in complete highland rigout complete to sporran and the most beautiful runningstag brooch on his plaid i wanted to ask where hed got it from but he was off before i could i went to the bureau and poured another drink well not so unusual an appearance for these parts surely ive seen men dressed like that in the village now and then nooo frank sounded doubtful no it wasnt his dress that was odd but when he pushed past me i could swear he was close enough that i should have felt him brush my sleeve but i didnt and i was intrigued enough to turn round and watch him as he walked away he walked down the gereside road but when hed almost reached the corner he disappeared thats when i began to feel a bit cold down the backbone perhaps your attention was distracted for a second and he just stepped aside into the shadows i suggested there are a lot of trees down near that corner i could swear i didnt take my eyes off him for a moment muttered frank he looked up suddenly i know i remember now why i thought he was so odd though i didnt realize it at the time what i was getting a bit tired of the ghost and wanted to go on to more interesting matters such as bed the wind was cutting up like billyo but his drapes his kilts and his plaid you know they didnt move at all except to the stir of his walking we stared at each other well i said finally that is a bit spooky frank shrugged and smiled suddenly dismissing it at least ill have something to tell the vicar next time i see him perhaps its a wellknown local ghost and he can give me its gory history he glanced at his watch but now id say its bedtime so it is i murmured i watched him in the mirror as he removed his shirt and reached for a hanger suddenly he paused in midbutton did you have many scots in your charge claire he asked abruptly at the field hospital or at pembroke of course i replied somewhat puzzled there were quite a few of the seaforths and camerons through the field hospital at amiens and then a bit later after caen we had a lot of the gordons nice chaps most of them very stoic about things generally but terrible cowards about injections i smiled remembering one in particular we had one rather a crusty old thing really a piper from the third seaforths who couldnt stand being stuck especially not in the hip hed go for hours in the most awful discomfort before hed let anyone near him with a needle and even then hed try to get us to give him the injection in the arm though its meant to be intramuscular i laughed at the memory of corporal chisholm he told me if im goin to lie on my face wi my buttocks bared i want the lass under me not behind me wi a hatpin frank smiled but looked a trifle uneasy as he often did about my less delicate war stories dont worry i assured him seeing the look i wont tell that one at tea in the senior common room the smile lightened and he came forward to stand behind me as i sat at the dressing table he pressed a kiss on the top of my head dont worry he said the senior common room will love you no matter what stories you tell mmmm your hair smells wonderful do you like it then his hands slid forward over my shoulders in answer cupping my breasts in the thin nightdress i could see his head above mine in the mirror his chin resting on top of my head i like everything about you he said huskily you look wonderful by candlelight you know your eyes are like sherry in crystal and your skin glows like ivory a candlelight witch you are perhaps i should disconnect the lamps permanently make it hard to read in bed i said my heart beginning to speed up i could think of better things to do in bed he murmured could you indeed i said rising and turning to put my arms about his neck like what sometime later cuddled close behind bolted shutters i lifted my head from his shoulder and said why did you ask me that earlier about whether id had to do with any scots i mean you must know i had there are all sorts of men through those hospitals he stirred and ran a hand softly down my back mmm oh nothing really just when i saw that chap outside it occurred to me he might be he hesitated tightening his hold a bit er you know that he might have been someone youd nursed perhaps maybe heard you were staying here and came along to see something like that in that case i said practically why wouldnt he come in and ask to see me well franks voice was very casual maybe he didnt want particularly to run into me i pushed up onto one elbow staring at him we had left one candle burning and i could see him well enough he had turned his head and was looking ohsocasually off toward the chromolithograph of bonnie prince charlie with which mrs baird had seen fit to decorate our wall i grabbed his chin and turned his head to face me he widened his eyes in simulated surprise are you implying i demanded that the man you saw outside was some sort of of i hesitated looking for the proper word liaison he suggested helpfully romantic interest of mine i finished no no certainly not he said unconvincingly he took my hands away from his face and tried to kiss me but now it was my turn for headturning he settled for pressing me back down to lie beside him its only he began well you know claire it was six years and we saw each other only three times and only just for the day that last time it wouldnt be unusual if i mean everyone knows doctors and nurses are under tremendous stress during emergencies and well i its just that well id understand you know if anything er of a spontaneous nature i interrupted this rambling by jerking free and exploding out of bed do you think ive been unfaithful to you i demanded do you because if so you can leave this room this instant leave the house altogether how dare you imply such a thing i was seething and frank sitting up reached out to try to soothe me dont you touch me i snapped just tell me do you think on the evidence of a strange man happening to glance up at my window that ive had some flaming affair with one of my patients frank got out of bed and wrapped his arms around me i stayed stiff as lots wife but he persisted caressing my hair and rubbing my shoulders in the way he knew i liked no i dont think any such thing he said firmly he pulled me closer and i relaxed slightly though not enough to put my arms around him after a long time he murmured into my hair no i know youd never do such a thing i only meant to say that even if you ever did claire it would make no difference to me i love you so nothing you ever did could stop my loving you he took my face between his hands only four inches taller than i he could look directly into my eyes without trouble and said softly forgive me his breath barely scented with the tang of glenfiddich was warm on my face and his lips full and inviting were disturbingly close another flash from outside heralded the sudden breaking of the storm and a thundering rain smashed down on the slates of the roof i slowly put my arms around his waist the quality of mercy is not strained i quoted it droppeth as the gentle dew from heaven frank laughed and looked upward the overlapping stains on the ceiling boded ill for the prospects of our sleeping dry all night if thats a sample of your mercy he said id hate to see your vengeance the thunder went off like a mortar attack as though in answer to his words and we both laughed at ease again it was only later listening to his regular deep breathing beside me that i began to wonder as i had said there was no evidence whatsoever to imply unfaithfulness on my part my part but six years as hed said was a long time chapter standing stones mr crook called for me as arranged promptly at seven the next morning so as well catch the dew on the buttercups eh lass he said twinkling with elderly gallantry he had brought a motorcycle of his own approximate vintage on which to transport us into the countryside the plant presses were tidily strapped to the sides of this enormous machine like bumpers on a tugboat it was a leisurely ramble through the quiet countryside made all the more quiet by contrast with the thunderous roar of mr crooks cycle suddenly throttled into silence the old man did indeed know a lot about the local plants i discovered not only where they were to be found but their medicinal uses and how to prepare them i wished i had brought a notebook to get it all down but listened intently to the cracked old voice and did my best to commit the information to memory as i stowed our specimens in the heavy plant presses we stopped for a packed luncheon near the base of a curious flattopped hill green as most of its neighbors with the same rocky juts and crags it had something different a wellworn path leading up one side and disappearing abruptly behind a granite outcrop whats up there i asked gesturing with a ham sandwich it seems a difficult place for picnicking ah mr crook glanced at the hill thats craigh na dun lass id meant to show ye after our meal really is there something special about it oh aye he answered but refused to elaborate further merely saying that id see when i saw i had some fears about his ability to climb such a steep path but these evaporated as i found myself panting in his wake at last mr crook extended a gnarled hand and pulled me up over the rim of the hill there tis he waved a hand with a sort of proprietorial gesture why its a henge i said delighted a miniature henge because of the war it had been several years since i had last visited salisbury plain but frank and i had seen stonehenge soon after we were married like the other tourists wandering awed among the huge standing stones we had gaped at the altar stone were ancient druid priests performed their dreadful uman sacrifices announced the sonorous cockney tour guide accompanying a busload of italian tourists who all dutifully took photographs of the rather ordinarylooking stone block out of the same passion for exactness that made frank adjust his ties on the hanger so that the ends hung precisely even we had even trekked around the circumference of the circle pacing off the distance between the z holes and the y holes and counting the lintels in the sarsen circle the outermost ring of monstrous uprights three hours later we knew how many y and z holes there were fiftynine if you care i didnt but had no more clue to the purpose of the structure than had the dozens of amateur and professional archaeologists who had crawled over the site for the last five hundred years no lack of opinions of course life among academics had taught me that a wellexpressed opinion is usually better than a badly expressed fact so far as professional advancement goes a temple a burial ground an astronomical observatory a place of execution hence the inaptly named slaughter stone that lies to one side half sunk in its own pit an openair market i liked this last suggestion visualizing megalithic housewives strolling between the lintels baskets on their arms critically judging the glaze on the latest shipment of redclay beakers and listening skeptically to the claims of stoneage bakers and vendors of deerbone shovels and amber beads the only thing i could see against that hypothesis was the presence of bodies under the altar stone and cremated remains in the z holes unless these were the hapless remains of merchants accused of shortweighting the customers it seemed a bit unsanitary to be burying people in the marketplace there were no signs of burial in the miniature henge atop the hill by miniature i mean only that the circle of standing stones was smaller than stonehenge each stone was still twice my own height and massive in proportion i had heard from another tourguide at stonehenge that these stone circles occur all over britain and europe some in better repair than others some differing slightly in orientation or form all of purpose and origin unknown mr crook stood smiling benignly as i prowled among the stones pausing now and then to touch one gently as though my touch could make an impression on the monumental boulders some of the standing stones were brindled striped with dim colors others were speckled with flakes of mica that caught the morning sun with a cheerful shimmer all of them were remarkably different from the clumps of native stone that thrust out of the bracken all around whoever built the stone circles and for whatever purpose thought it important enough to have quarried shaped and transported special stone blocks for the erection of their testimonial shaped how transported how and from what unimaginable distance my husband would be fascinated i told mr crook stopping to thank him for showing me the place and the plants ill bring him up to see it later the gnarled old man gallantly offered me an arm at the top of the trail i took it deciding after one look down the precipitous decline that in spite of his age he was likely steadier on his pins than i was i swung down the road that afternoon toward the village to fetch frank from the vicarage i happily breathed in that heady highland mix of heather sage and broom spiced here and there with chimney smoke and the tang of fried herring as i passed the scattered cottages the village lay nestled in a small declivity at the foot of one of those soaring crags that rise so steeply from the highland moors those cottages near the road were nice the bloom of postwar prosperity had spread as far as a new coat of paint and even the manse which must be at least a hundred years old sported bright yellow trim around its sagging windowframes the vicars housekeeper answered the door a tall stringy woman with three strands of artificial pearls round her neck hearing who i was she welcomed me in and towed me down a long narrow dark hallway lined with sepia engravings of people who may have been famous personages of their time or cherished relatives of the present vicar but might as well have been the royal family for all i could see of their features in the gloom by contrast the vicars study was blinding with light from the enormous windows that ran nearly from ceiling to floor in one wall an easel near the fireplace bearing a halffinished oil of black cliffs against the evening sky showed the reason for the windows which must have been added long after the house was built frank and a short tubby man with a clerical dogcollar were cozily poring over a mass of tattered paper on the desk by the far wall frank barely looked up in greeting but the vicar politely left off his explanations and hurried over to clasp my hand his round face beaming with sociable delight mrs randall he said pumping my hand heartily how nice to see you again and youve come just in time to hear the news news casting an eye on the grubbiness and typeface of the papers on the desk i calculated the date of the news in question as being likely around not precisely stopthepresses then yes indeed weve been tracing your husbands ancestor jack randall through the army dispatches of the period the vicar leaned close speaking out of the side of his mouth like a gangster in an american film ive er borrowed the original dispatches from the local historical society files youll be careful not to tell anyone amused i agreed that i would not reveal his deadly secret and looked about for a comfortable chair in which to receive the latest revelations from the eighteenth century the wing chair nearest the windows looked suitable but as i reached to turn it toward the desk i discovered that it was already occupied the inhabitant a small boy with a shock of glossy black hair was curled up in the depths of the chair sound asleep roger the vicar coming to assist me was as surprised as i the boy startled out of sleep shot bolt upright wide eyes the color of moss now what are you up to in here you young scamp the vicar was scolding affectionately oh fell asleep reading the comic papers again he scooped up the brightly colored pages and handed them to the lad run along now roger i have business with the randalls oh wait ive forgotten to introduce you mrs randall this is my son roger i was a bit surprised if ever id seen a confirmed bachelor i would have thought the reverend wakefield was it still i took the politely proffered paw and shook it warmly resisting the urge to wipe a certain residual stickiness on my skirt the reverend wakefield looked fondly after the boy as he trooped off toward the kitchen my nieces son really he confided father shot down over the channel and mother killed in the blitz though so ive taken him how kind of you i murmured thinking of uncle lamb he too had died in the blitz killed by a hit to the auditorium of the british museum where he had been lecturing knowing him i thought his main feeling would have been gratification that the wing of persian antiquities next door had escaped not at all not at all the vicar flapped a hand in embarrassment nice to have a bit of young life about the house now do have a seat frank began talking even before i had set my handbag down the most amazing luck claire he enthused thumbing through the dogeared pile the vicars located a whole series of military dispatches that mention jonathan randall well a good deal of the prominence seems to have been captain randalls own doing the vicar observed taking some of the papers from frank he was in command of the garrison at fort william for four years or so but he seems to have spent quite a bit of his time harassing the scottish countryside above the border on behalf of the crown this lot he gingerly separated a stack of papers and laid them on the desk is reports of complaints lodged against the captain by various families and estate holders claiming everything from interference with their maidservants by the soldiers of the garrison to outright theft of horses not to mention assorted instances of insult unspecified i was amused so you have the proverbial horse thief in your family tree i said to frank he shrugged unperturbed he was what he was and nothing i can do about it i only want to find out the complaints arent all that odd for that particular time period the english in general and the army in particular were rather notably unpopular throughout the highlands no whats odd is that nothing ever seems to have come of the complaints even the serious ones the vicar unable to keep still for long broke in thats right not that officers then were held to anything like modern standards they could do very much as they liked in minor matters but this is odd its not that the complaints are investigated and dismissed theyre just never mentioned again you know what i suspect randall your ancestor must have had a patron someone who could protect him from the censure of his superiors frank scratched his head squinting at the dispatches you could be right had to have been someone quite powerful though high up in the army hierarchy perhaps or maybe a member of the nobility yes or possibly the vicar was interrupted in his theories by the entrance of the housekeeper mrs graham ive brought ye a wee bit of refreshment gentlemen she announced setting the tea tray firmly in the center of the desk from which the vicar rescued his precious dispatches in the nick of time she looked me over with a shrewd eye assessing the twitching limbs and faint glaze over the eyeballs ive brought but the two cups for i thought perhaps mrs randall would care to join me in the kitchen ive a bit of i didnt wait for the conclusion of her invitation but leapt to my feet with alacrity i could hear the theories breaking out again behind me as we pushed through the swinging door that led to the manses kitchen the tea was green hot and fragrant with bits of leaf swirling through the liquid mmm i said setting the cup down its been a long time since i tasted oolong mrs graham nodded beaming at my pleasure in her refreshments she had clearly gone to some trouble laying out handmade lace mats beneath the eggshell cups and providing thick clotted cream with the scones aye i couldna get it during the war ye know its the best for the readings though had a terrible time with that earl grey the leaves fall apart so fast its hard to tell anything at all oh you read tea leaves i asked mildly amused nothing could be farther from the popular conception of the gypsy fortuneteller than mrs graham with her short irongrey perm and triplestranded pearl choker a swallow of tea ran visibly down the long stringy neck and disappeared beneath the gleaming beads why certainly i do my dear just as my grandmother taught me and her grandmother before her drink up your cup and ill see what you have there she was silent for a long time once in a while tilting the cup to catch the light or rolling it slowly between lean palms to get a different angle she set the cup down carefully as though afraid it might blow up in her face the grooves on either side of her mouth had deepened and her brows pressed together in what looked like puzzlement well she said finally thats one of the stranger ones ive seen oh i was still amused but beginning to be curious am i going to meet a tall dark stranger or journey across the sea could be mrs graham had caught my ironic tone and echoed it smiling slightly and could not thats whats odd about your cup my dear everything in its contradictory theres the curved leaf for a journey but its crossed by the broken one that means staying put and strangers there are to be sure several of them and one of thems your husband if i read the leaves aright my amusement dissipated somewhat after six years apart and six months together my husband was still something of a stranger though i failed to see how a tea leaf could know it mrs grahams brow was still furrowed let me see your hand child she said the hand holding mine was bony but surprisingly warm a scent of lavender water emanated from the neat part of the grizzled head bent over my palm she stared into my hand for quite a long time now and then tracing one of the lines with a finger as though following a map whose roads all petered out in sandy washes and deserted wastes well what is it i asked trying to maintain a light air or is my fate too horrible to be revealed mrs graham raised quizzical eyes and looked thoughtfully at my face but retained her hold on my hand she shook her head pursing her lips oh no my dear its not your fate is in your hand only the seed of it the birdlike head cocked to one side considering the lines in your hand change ye know at another point in your life they may be quite different than they are now i didnt know that i thought you were born with them and that was that i was repressing an urge to jerk my hand away whats the point of palm reading then i didnt wish to sound rude but i found this scrutiny a bit unsettling especially following on the heels of that tealeaf reading mrs graham smiled unexpectedly and folded my fingers closed over my palm why the lines of your palm show what ye are dear thats why they change or should they dont in some people those unlucky enough never to change in themselves but there are few like that she gave my folded hand a squeeze and patted it i doubt that youre one of those your hand shows quite a lot of change already for one so young that would likely be the war of course she said as though to herself i was curious again and opened my palm voluntarily what am i then according to my hand mrs graham frowned but did not pick up my hand again i canna just say its odd for most hands have a likeness to them mind id no just say that its see one youve seen them all but its often like that there are patterns you know she smiled suddenly an oddly engaging grin displaying very white and patently false teeth thats how a fortuneteller works you know i do it for the church fete every year or did before the war suppose ill do it again now but a girl comes into the tent and there am i done up in a turban with a peacock feather borrowed from mr donaldson and robes of oriental splendor thats the vicars dressing gown all over peacocks it is and yellow as the sun anyway i look her over while i pretend to be watching her hand and i see shes got her blouse cut down to her breakfast cheap scent and earrings down to her shoulders i neednt have a crystal ball to be tellin her shell have a child before the next years fete mrs graham paused grey eyes alight with mischief though if the hand youre holding is bare its tactful to predict first that shell marry soon i laughed and so did she so you dont look at their hands at all then i asked except to check for rings she looked surprised oh of course you do its just that you know ahead of time what youll see generally she nodded at my open hand but that is not a pattern ive seen before the large thumb now she did lean forward then and touch it lightly that wouldnt change much means youre strongminded and have a will not easily crossed she twinkled at me reckon your husband could have told ye that likewise about that one she pointed to the fleshy mound at the base of the thumb what is it the mount of venus its called she pursed her thin lips primly together though the corners turned irrepressibly up in a man yed say it means he likes the lasses for a woman tis a bit different to be polite about it ill make a bit of a prediction for you and say your husband isna like to stray far from your bed she gave a surprisingly deep and bawdy chuckle and i blushed slightly the elderly housekeeper pored over my hand again stabbing a pointed forefinger here and there to mark her words now there a wellmarked lifeline youre in good health and likely to stay so the lifelines interrupted meaning your lifes changed markedly well thats true of us all is it not but yours is more choppedup like than i usually see all bits and pieces and your marriageline now she shook her head again its divided thats not unusual means two marriages my reaction was slight and immediately suppressed but she caught the flicker and looked up at once i thought she probably was quite a shrewd fortuneteller at that the grey head shook reassuringly at me no no lass it doesna mean anythings like to happen to your good man its only that if it did she emphasized the if with a slight squeeze of my hand youd not be one to pine away and waste the rest of your life in mourning what it means is youre one of those can love again if your first loves lost she squinted nearsightedly at my palm running a short ridged nail gently down the deep marriage line but most divided lines are broken yours is forked she looked up with a roguish smile sure youre not a bigamist on the quiet like i shook my head laughing no when would i have the time then i turned my hand showing the outer edge ive heard that small marks on the side of the hand indicate how many children youll have my tone was casual i hoped the edge of my palm was disappointingly smooth mrs graham flicked a scornful hand at this idea pah after yeve had a bairn or two ye might show lines there more like youd have them on your face proves nothing at all beforehand oh it doesnt i was foolishly relieved to hear this i was going to ask whether the deep lines across the base of my wrist meant anything a potential for suicide but we were interrupted at that point by the reverend wakefield coming into the kitchen bearing the empty tea cups he set them on the drainboard and began a loud and clumsy fumbling through the cupboard obviously in hopes of provoking help mrs graham sprang to her feet to defend the sanctity of her kitchen and pushing the reverend adroitly to one side set about assembling tea things on a tray for the study he drew me to one side safely out of the way why dont you come to the study and have another cup of tea with me and your husband mrs randall weve made really a most gratifying discovery i could see that in spite of outward composure he was bursting with the glee of whatever they had found like a small boy with a toad in his pocket plainly i was going to have to go and read captain jonathan randalls laundry bill his receipt for boot repairs or some document of similar fascination frank was so absorbed in the tattered documents that he scarcely looked up when i entered the study he reluctantly surrendered them to the vicars podgy hands and came round to stand behind the reverend wakefield and peer over his shoulder as though he could not bear to let the papers out of his sight for a moment yes i said politely fingering the dirty bits of paper ummm yes very interesting in fact the spidery handwriting was so faded and so ornate that it hardly seemed worth the trouble of deciphering it one sheet better preserved than the rest had some sort of crest at the top the duke of sandringham is it i asked peering at the crest with its faded leopard couchant and the printing below more legible than the handwriting yes indeed the vicar said beaming even more an extinct title now you know i didnt but nodded intelligently being no stranger to historians in the manic grip of discovery it was seldom necessary to do more than nod periodically saying oh really or how perfectly fascinating at appropriate intervals after a certain amount of deferring back and forth between frank and the vicar the latter won the honor of telling me about their discovery evidently all this rubbish made it appear that franks ancestor the notorious black jack randall had not been merely a gallant soldier for the crown but a trusted and secret agent of the duke of sandringham almost an agent provocateur wouldnt you say dr randall the vicar graciously handed the ball back to frank who seized it and ran yes indeed the language is very guarded of course he turned the pages gently with a scrubbed forefinger oh really i said but it seems from this that jonathan randall was entrusted with the job of stirring up jacobite sentiments if any existed among the prominent scottish families in his area the point being to smoke out any baronets and clan chieftains who might be harboring secret sympathies in that direction but thats odd wasnt sandringham a suspected jacobite himself frank turned to the vicar a frown of inquiry on his face the vicars smooth bald head creased in an identical frown why yes i believe youre right but wait lets check in cameron he made a dive for the bookshelf crammed with calfbound volumes hes sure to mention sandringham how perfectly fascinating i murmured allowing my attention to wander to the huge corkboard that covered one wall of the study from floor to ceiling it was covered with an amazing assortment of things mostly papers of one sort or another gas bills correspondence notices from the diocesan council loose pages of novels notes in the vicars own hand but also small items like keys bottle caps and what appeared to be small car parts attached with tacks and string i browsed idly through the miscellanea keeping half an ear tuned to the argument going on behind me the duke of sandringham probably was a jacobite they decided my attention was caught by a genealogical chart tacked up with special care in a spot by itself using four tacks one to a corner the top of the chart included names dated in the early seventeenth century but it was the name at the bottom of the chart that had caught my eye roger w mackenzie wakefield it read excuse me i said interrupting a final sputter of dispute as to whether the leopard in the dukes crest had a lily in its paw or was it meant to be a crocus is this your sons chart eh oh why yes yes it is distracted the vicar hurried over beaming once more he detached the chart tenderly from the wall and laid it on the table in front of me i didnt want him to forget his own family you see he explained its quite an old lineage back to the sixteen hundreds his stubby forefinger traced the line of descent almost reverently i gave him my own name because it seemed more suitable as he lives here but i didnt want him to forget where he came from he made an apologetic grimace im afraid my own family is nothing to boast of genealogically vicars and curates with the occasional bookseller thrown in for variety and only traceable back to or so rather poor recordkeeping you know he said wagging his head remorsefully over the lethargy of his ancestors it was growing late by the time we finally left the vicarage with the vicar promising to take the letters to town for copying first thing in the morning frank babbled happily of spies and jacobites most of the way back to mrs bairds finally though he noticed my quietness what is it love he asked taking my arm solicitously not feeling well this was asked with a mingled tone of concern and hope no im quite well i was only thinking i hesitated because we had discussed this matter before i was thinking about roger roger i gave a sigh of impatience really frank you can be so oblivious roger the reverend wakefields son oh yes of course he said vaguely charming child what about him well only that there are a lot of children like that orphaned you know he gave me a sharp look and shook his head no claire really id like to but ive told you how i feel about adoption its just i couldnt feel properly toward a child thats not well not of my blood no doubt thats ridiculous and selfish of me but there it is maybe ill change my mind in time but now we walked a few steps in a barbed silence suddenly he stopped and turned to me gripping my hands claire he said huskily i want our child youre the most important thing in the world to me i want you to be happy above all else but i want well i want to keep you to myself im afraid a child from outside one we had no real relationship with would seem an intruder and id resent it but to be able to give you a child see it grow in you see it born then id feel as though it were more an extension of you perhaps and me a real part of the family his eyes were wide pleading yes all right i understand i was willing to abandon the topic for now i turned to go on walking but he reached out and took me in his arms claire i love you the tenderness in his voice was overwhelming and i leaned my head against his jacket feeling his warmth and the strength of his arms around me i love you too we stood locked together for a moment swaying slightly in the wind that swept down the road suddenly frank drew back a bit smiling down at me besides he said softly smoothing the windblown hair back from my face we havent given up yet have we i smiled back no he took my hand tucking it snugly beneath his elbow and we turned toward our lodgings game for another try yes why not we strolled hand in hand back toward the gereside road it was the sight of the baragh mhor the pictish stone that stands at the corner of the road there that made me remember things ancient i forgot i exclaimed i have something exciting to show you frank looked down at me and pulled me closer he squeezed my hand so have i he said grinning you can show me yours tomorrow when tomorrow came though we had other things to do i had forgotten that we had planned a day trip to the great glen of loch ness it was a long drive through the glen and we left early in the morning before sunup after the hurry to the waiting car through the freezing dawn it was cozy to relax under the rug and feel the warmth stealing back into my hands and feet along with it came a most delicious drowsiness and i fell blissfully asleep against franks shoulder my last conscious sight the drivers head in redrimmed silhouette against the dawning sky it was after nine when we arrived and the guide frank had called for was awaiting us on the edge of the loch with a small sailing skiff an it suits ye sir i thought wed take a wee sail down the lochside to urquhart castle perhaps well sup a bit there before goin on the guide a dourlooking little man in weatherbeaten cotton shirt and twill trousers stowed the picnic hamper tidily beneath the seat and offered me a callused hand down into the well of the boat it was a beautiful day with the burgeoning greenery of the steep banks blurring in the ruffled surface of the loch our guide despite his dour appearance was knowledgeable and talkative pointing out the islands castles and ruins that rimmed the long narrow loch yonder thats urquhart castle he pointed to a smoothfaced wall of stone barely visible through the trees or whats left of it twas cursed by the witches of the glen and saw one unhappiness after another he told us the story of mary grant daughter of the laird of urquhart castle and her lover donald donn poet son of macdonald of bohuntin forbidden to meet because of her fathers objection to the latters habits of lifting any cattle he came across an old and honorable highland profession the guide assured us they met anyway the father got wind of it donald was lured to a false rendezvous and thus taken condemned to die he begged to be beheaded like a gentleman rather than hanged as a felon this request was granted and the young man led to the block repeating the devil will take the laird of grant out of his shoes and donald donn shall not be hanged he wasnt and legend reports that as his severed head rolled from the block it spoke saying mary lift ye my head i shuddered and frank put an arm around me theres a bit of one of his poems left he said quietly donald donns it goes tomorrow i shall be on a hill without a head have you no compassion for my sorrowful maiden my mary the fair and tendereyed i took his hand and squeezed it lightly as story after story of treachery murder and violence were recounted it seemed as though the loch had earned its sinister reputation what about the monster i asked peering over the side into the murky depths it seemed entirely appropriate to such a setting our guide shrugged and spat into the water weel the lochs queer and no mistake theres stories to be sure of something old and evil that once lived in the depths sacrifices were made to it kine and sometimes even wee bairns flung into the water in withy baskets he spat again and some say the lochs bottomless got a hole in the center deeper than anything else in scotland on the other hand the guides crinkled eyes crinkled a bit more twas a family here from lancashire a few years ago cam rushin to the police station in invermoriston screamin as theyd seen the monster come out o the water and hide in the bracken said twas a terrible creature covered wi red hair and fearsome horns and chewin something wi the blood all dripping from its mouth he held up a hand stemming my horrified exclamation the constable they sent to see cam back and said weel bar the drippin blood twas a verra accurate description he paused for effect of a nice highland cow chewin her cud in the bracken we sailed down half the length of the loch before disembarking for a late lunch we met the car there and motored back through the glen observing nothing more sinister than a red fox in the road who looked up startled a small animal of some sort hanging limp in its jaws as we zoomed around a curve he leaped for the side of the road and swarmed up the bank swift as a shadow it was very late indeed when we finally staggered up the path to mrs bairds but we clung together on the doorstep as frank groped for the key still laughing over the events of the day it wasnt until we were undressing for bed that i remembered to mention the miniature henge on craigh na dun to frank his fatigue vanished at once really and you know where it is how marvelous claire he beamed and began rattling through his suitcase what are you looking for the alarm clock he replied hauling it out whatever for i asked in astonishment i want to be up in time to see them who the witches witches who told you there are witches the vicar frank answered clearly enjoying the joke his housekeepers one of them i thought of the dignified mrs graham and snorted derisively dont be ridiculous well not witches actually there have been witches all over scotland for hundreds of years they burnt them til well into the eighteenth century but this lot is really meant to be druids or something of the sort i dont suppose its actually a coven not devilworship i dont mean but the vicar said there was a local group that still observes rituals on the old sunfeast days he cant afford to take too much interest in such goingson you see because of his position but hes much too curious a man to ignore it altogether either he didnt know where the ceremonies took place but if theres a stone circle nearby that must be it he rubbed his hands together in anticipation what luck getting up once in the dark to go adventuring is a lark twice in two days smacks of masochism no nice warm car with rugs and thermoses this time either i stumbled sleepily up the hill behind frank tripping over roots and stubbing my toes on stones it was cold and misty and i dug my hands deeper into the pockets of my cardigan one final push up over the crest of the hill and the henge was before us the stones barely visible in the somber light of predawn frank stood stockstill admiring them while i subsided onto a convenient rock panting beautiful he murmured he crept silently to the outer edge of the ring his shadowy figure disappearing among the larger shadows of the stones beautiful they were and bloody eerie too i shivered and not entirely from the cold if whoever had made them had meant them to impress theyd known what they were doing frank was back in a moment no one here yet he whispered suddenly from behind me making me jump come on ive found a place we can watch from the light was coming up from the east now just a tinge of paler grey on the horizon but enough to keep me from stumbling as frank led me through a gap he had found in some alder bushes near the top of the path there was a tiny clearing inside the clump of bushes barely enough for the two of us to stand shoulder to shoulder the path was clearly visible though and so was the interior of the stone circle no more than twenty feet away not for the first time i wondered just what kind of work frank had done during the war he certainly seemed to know a lot about maneuvering soundlessly in the dark drowsy as i was i wanted nothing more than to curl up under a cozy bush and go back to sleep there wasnt room for that though so i continued to stand peering down the steep path in search of oncoming druids i was getting a crick in my back and my feet ached but it couldnt take long the streak of light in the east had turned a pale pink and i supposed it was less than half an hour til dawn the first one moved almost as silently as frank there was only the faintest of rattles as her feet dislodged a pebble near the crest of the hill and then the neat grey head rose silently into sight mrs graham so it was true then the vicars housekeeper was sensibly dressed in tweed skirt and woolly coat with a white bundle under one arm she disappeared behind one of the standing stones quiet as a ghost they came quite quickly after that in ones and twos and threes with subdued giggles and whispers on the path that were quickly shushed as they came into sight of the circle i recognized a few here came mrs buchanan the village postmistress blond hair freshly permed and the scent of evening in paris wafting strongly from its waves i suppressed a laugh so this was a modernday druid there were fifteen in all and all women ranging in age from mrs grahams sixtyodd years to a young woman in her early twenties whom i had seen pushing a pram round the shops two days before all of them were dressed for rough walking with bundles beneath their arms with a minimum of chat they disappeared behind stones or bushes emerging emptyhanded and barearmed completely clad in white i caught the scent of laundry soap as one brushed by our clump of bushes and recognized the garments as bedsheets wrapped about the body and knotted at the shoulder they assembled outside the ring of stones in a line from eldest to youngest and stood in silence waiting the light in the east grew stronger as the sun edged its way above the horizon the line of women began to move walking slowly between two of the stones the leader took them directly to the center of the circle and led them round and round still moving slowly stately as swans in a circular procession the leader suddenly stopped raised her arms and stepped into the center of the circle raising her face toward the pair of easternmost stones she called out in a high voice not loud but clear enough to be heard throughout the circle the still mist caught the words and made them echo as though they came from all around from the stones themselves whatever the call was it was echoed again by the dancers for dancers they now became not touching but with arms outstretched toward each other they bobbed and weaved still moving in a circle suddenly the circle split in half seven of the dancers moved clockwise still in a circular motion the others moved in the opposite direction the two semicircles passed each other at increasing speeds sometimes forming a complete circle sometimes a double line and in the center the leader stood stockstill giving again and again that mournful highpitched call in a language long since dead they should have been ridiculous and perhaps they were a collection of women in bedsheets many of them stout and far from agile parading in circles on top of a hill but the hair prickled on the back of my neck at the sound of their call they stopped as one and turned to face the rising sun standing in the form of two semicircles with a path lying clear between the halves of the circle thus formed as the sun rose above the horizon its light flooded between the eastern stones knifed between the halves of the circle and struck the great split stone on the opposite side of the henge the dancers stood for a moment frozen in the shadows to either side of the beam of light then mrs graham said something in the same strange language but this time in a speaking voice she pivoted and walked back straight irongrey waves glinting in the sun along the path of light without a word the dancers fell in step behind her they passed one by one through the cleft in the main stone and disappeared in silence we crouched in the alders until the women now laughing and chatting normally had retrieved their clothes and set off in a group down the hill headed for coffee at the vicarage goodness i stretched trying to get the kinks out of my legs and back that was quite a sight wasnt it wonderful enthused frank i wouldnt have missed it for the world he slipped out of the bush like a snake leaving me to disentangle myself while he cast about the interior of the circle nose to the ground like a bloodhound whatever are you looking for i asked i entered the circle with some hesitation but day was fully come and the stones while still impressive had lost a good deal of the brooding menace of dawn light marks he replied crawling about on hands and knees eyes intent on the short turf how did they know where to start and stop good question i dont see anything casting an eye over the ground though i did see an interesting plant growing near the base of one of the tall stones myosotis no probably not this had orange centers to the deep blue flowers intrigued i started toward it frank with keener hearing than i leaped to his feet and seized my arm hurrying me out of the circle a moment before one of the mornings dancers entered from the other side it was miss grant the tubby little woman who suitably enough in view of her figure ran the sweets and pastries shop in the towns high street she peered nearsightedly around then fumbled in her pocket for her spectacles jamming these on her nose she strolled about the circle at last pouncing on the lost hairclip for which she had returned having restored it to its place in her thick glossy locks she seemed in no hurry to return to business instead she seated herself on a boulder leaned back against one of the stone giants in comradely fashion and lighted a leisurely cigarette frank gave a muted sigh of exasperation beside me well he said resigned wed best go she could sit there all morning by the looks of her and i didnt see any obvious markings in any case perhaps we could come back later i suggested still curious about the blueflowered vine yes all right but he had plainly lost interest in the circle itself being now absorbed in the details of the ceremony he quizzed me relentlessly on the way down the path urging me to remember as closely as i could the exact wording of the calls and the timing of the dance norse he said at last with satisfaction the root words are ancient norse im almost sure of it but the dance he shook his head pondering no the dance is very much older not that there arent viking circle dances he said raising his brows censoriously as though i had suggested there werent but that shifting pattern with the doubleline business thats hmm its like well some of the patterns on the beaker folk glazeware show a pattern rather like that but then again hmm he dropped into one of his scholarly trances muttering to himself from time to time the trance was broken only when he stumbled unexpectedly over an obstacle near the bottom of the hill he flung his arms out with a startled cry as his feet went out from under him and he rolled untidily down the last few feet of the path fetching up in a clump of cow parsley i dashed down the hill after him but found him already sitting up among the quivering stems by the time i reached the bottom are you all right i asked though i could see that he was i think so he passed a hand dazedly over his brow smoothing back the dark hair what did i trip over this i held up a sardine tin discarded by some earlier visitor one of the menaces of civilization ah he took it from me peered inside then tossed it over one shoulder pity its empty im feeling rather hungry after that excursion shall we see what mrs baird can provide in the way of a late breakfast we might i said smoothing the last strands of hair for him and then again we might make it an early lunch instead my eyes met his ah he said again with a completely different tone he ran a hand slowly up my arm and up the side of my neck his thumb gently tickling the lobe of my ear so we might if you arent too hungry i said the other hand found its way behind my back palm spread it pressed me gently toward him fingers stroking lower and lower his mouth opened slightly and he breathed ever so lightly down the neck of my dress his warm breath tickling the tops of my breasts he laid me carefully back in the grass the feathery blossoms of the cow parsley seeming to float in the air around his head he bent forward and kissed me softly and kept on kissing me as he unbuttoned my dress one button at a time teasing pausing to reach a hand inside and play with the swelling tips of my breasts at last he had the dress laid open from neck to waist ah he said again in yet another tone like white velvet he spoke hoarsely and his hair had fallen forward again but he made no attempt to brush it back he sprang the clasp of my brassiere with one accomplished flick of the thumb and bent to pay a skilled homage to my breasts then he drew back and cupping my breasts with both hands drew his palms slowly down to meet between the rising mounds and without stopping drew them softly outward again tracing the line of my rib cage clear to the back up and again down and around until i moaned and turned toward him he sank his lips onto mine and pressed me toward him until our hips fitted tightly together he bent his head to mine nibbling softly around the rim of my ear the hand stroking my back slipped lower and lower stopping suddenly in surprise it felt again then frank raised his head and looked down at me grinning whats all this then he asked in imitation of a village bobby or rather whats not all this just being prepared i said primly nurses are taught to anticipate contingencies really claire he murmured sliding his hand under my skirt and up my thigh to the soft unprotected warmth between my legs you are the most terrifyingly practical person i have ever known frank came up behind me as i sat in the parlor chair that evening a large book spread out on my lap what are you doing he asked his hands rested gently on my shoulders looking for that plant i answered sticking a finger between the pages to mind my place the one i saw in the stone circle see i flipped the book open it could be in the campanulaceae or the gentianaceae the polemoniaceae the boraginaceae thats most likely i think forgetmenots but it could even be a variant of this one the anemone patens i pointed out a full color illustration of a pasqueflower i dont think it was a gentian of any kind the petals werent really rounded but well why not go back and get it he suggested mr crook would lend you his old banger perhaps or no ive a better idea borrow mrs bairds car its safer its a short walk from the road to the foot of the hill and then about a thousand yards straight up i said why are you so interested in that plant i swiveled around to look up at him the parlor lamp outlined his head with a thin gold line like a medieval engraving of a saint its not the plant i care about but if youre going up there anyway i wish youd have a quick look around the outside of the stone circle all right i said obligingly what for traces of fire he said in all the things ive been able to read about beltane fire is always mentioned in the rituals yet the women we saw this morning werent using any i wondered if perhaps theyd set the beltane fire the night before then come back in the morning for the dance though historically its the cow herds who were supposed to set the fire there wasnt any trace of fire inside the circle he added but we left before i thought of checking the outside all right i said again and yawned two early risings in two days were taking their toll i shut the book and stood up provided i dont have to get up before nine it was in fact nearly eleven before i reached the stone circle it was drizzling and i was soaked through not having thought to bring a mac i made a cursory examination of the outside of the circle but if there had ever been a fire there someone had taken pains to remove its traces the plant was easier to find it was where i remembered it near the foot of the tallest stone i took several clippings of the vine and stowed them temporarily in my handkerchief meaning to deal with them properly when i got back to mrs bairds tiny car where i had left the heavy plant presses the tallest stone of the circle was cleft with a vertical split dividing the two massive pieces oddly the pieces had been drawn apart by some means though you could see that the facing surfaces matched they were separated by a gap of two or three feet there was a deep humming noise coming from somewhere near at hand i thought there might be a beehive lodged in some crevice of the rock and placed a hand on the stone in order to lean into the cleft the stone screamed i backed away as fast as i could moving so quickly that i tripped on the short turf and sat down hard i stared at the stone sweating i had never heard such a sound from anything living there is no way to describe it except to say that it was the sort of scream you might expect from a stone it was horrible the other stones began to shout there was a noise of battle and the cries of dying men and shattered horses i shook my head violently to clear it but the noise went on i stumbled to my feet and staggered toward the edge of the circle the sounds were all around me making my teeth ache and my head spin my vision began to blur i do not know now whether i went toward the cleft in the main stone or whether it was accidental a blind drifting through the fog of noise once traveling at night i fell asleep in the passenger seat of a moving car lulled by the noise and motion into an illusion of serene weightlessness the driver of the car took a bridge too fast and lost control and i woke from my floating dream straight into the glare of headlights and the sickening sensation of falling at high speed that abrupt transition is as close as i can come to describing the feeling i experienced but it falls woefully short i could say that my field of vision contracted to a single dark spot then disappeared altogether leaving not darkness but a bright void i could say that i felt as though i were spinning or as though i were being pulled inside out all these things are true yet none of them conveys the sense i had of complete disruption of being slammed very hard against something that wasnt there the truth is that nothing moved nothing changed nothing whatever appeared to happen and yet i experienced a feeling of elemental terror so great that i lost all sense of who or what or where i was i was in the heart of chaos and no power of mind or body was of use against it i cannot really say i lost consciousness but i was certainly not aware of myself for some time i woke if thats the word when i stumbled on a rock near the bottom of the hill i half slid the remaining few feet and fetched up on the thick tufted grass at the foot i felt sick and dizzy i crawled toward a stand of oak saplings and leaned against one to steady myself there was a confused noise of shouting nearby which reminded me of the sounds i had heard and felt in the stone circle the ring of inhuman violence was lacking though this was the normal sound of human conflict and i turned toward it chapter the man in the wood the men were some distance away when i saw them two or three dressed in kilts running like the dickens across a small clearing there was a faroff banging noise that i rather dazedly identified as gunshots i was quite sure i was still hallucinating when the sound of shots was followed by the appearance of five or six men dressed in red coats and knee breeches waving muskets i blinked and stared i moved my hand before my face and held up two fingers i saw two fingers all present and correct no blurring of vision i sniffed the air cautiously the pungent odor of trees in spring and a faint whiff of clover from a clump near my feet no olfactory delusions i felt my head no soreness anywhere concussion unlikely then pulse a little fast but steady the sound of distant yelling changed abruptly there was a thunder of hooves and several horses came charging in my direction kilted scots atop them yodeling in gaelic i dodged out of the way with an agility that seemed to prove i had not been physically damaged whatever my mental state and then it came to me as one of the redcoats knocked flat by a fleeing scot rose and shook his fist theatrically after the horses of course a film i shook my head at my own slowness they were shooting a costume drama of some sort that was all one of those bonnieprinceintheheather sorts of things no doubt well regardless of artistic merit the film crew wouldnt thank me for introducing a note of historic inauthenticity into their shots i doubled back into the wood meaning to make a wide circle around the clearing and come out on the road where i had left the car the going was more difficult than i had expected though the wood was a young one and dense with underbrush that snagged my clothes i had to go carefully through the spindly saplings disentangling my skirts from the brambles as i went had he been a snake i would have stepped on him he stood so quietly among the saplings as almost to have been one of them and i did not see him until a hand shot out and gripped me by the arm its companion clapped over my mouth as i was dragged backward into the oak grove thrashing wildly in panic my captor whoever he was seemed not much taller than i but rather noticeably strong in the forearms i smelled a faint flowery scent as of lavender water and something more spicy mingled with the sharper reek of male perspiration as the leaves whipped back into place in the path of our passage though i noticed something familiar about the hand and forearm clasped about my waist i shook my head free of the restraint over my mouth frank i burst out what in heavens name are you playing at i was torn between relief at finding him here and irritation at the horseplay unsettled as i was by my experience among the stones i was in no mood for rough games the hands released me but even as i turned to him i sensed something wrong it was not only the unfamiliar cologne but something more subtle i stood stockstill feeling the hair prickle on my neck you arent frank i whispered i am not he agreed surveying me with considerable interest though ive a cousin of that name i doubt though that its he you have confused me with madam we do not resemble one another greatly whatever this mans cousin looked like the man himself might have been franks brother there was the same lithe spare build and finedrawn bones the same chiseled lines of the face the level brows and wide hazel eyes and the same dark hair curved smooth across the brow but this mans hair was long tied back from his face with a leather thong and the gypsy skin showed the deepbaked tan of months no years of exposure to the weather not the light golden color franks had attained during our scottish holiday just who are you i demanded feeling most uneasy while frank had numerous relatives and connections i thought i knew all the british branch of the family certainly there was no one who looked like this man among them and surely frank would have mentioned any near relative living in the highlands not only mentioned him but insisted upon visiting him as well armed with the usual collection of genealogical charts and notebooks eager for any tidbits of family history about the famous black jack randall the stranger raised his brows at my question who am i i might ask the same question madam and with considerably more justification his eyes raked me slowly from head to toe traveling with a sort of insolent appreciation over the thin peonysprigged cotton dress i wore and lingering with an odd look of amusement on my legs i did not at all understand the look but it made me extremely nervous and i backed up a step or two until i was brought up sharp by bumping into a tree the man finally removed his gaze and turned aside it was as though he had taken a constraining hand off me and i let out my breath in relief not realizing until then that i had been holding it he had turned to pick up his coat thrown across the lowest branch of an oak sapling he brushed some scattered leaves from it and began to put it on i must have gasped because he looked up again the coat was a deep scarlet longtailed and without lapels frogged down the front the buff linings of the turnedback cuffs extended a good six inches up the sleeve and a small coil of gold braid gleamed from one epaulet it was a dragoons coat an officers coat then it occurred to me of course he was an actor from the company i had seen on the other side of the wood though the short sword he proceeded to strap on seemed remarkably more realistic than any prop i had ever seen i pressed myself against the bark of the tree behind me and found it reassuringly solid i crossed my arms protectively in front of me who the bloody hell are you i demanded again the question this time came out in a croak that sounded frightened even to my ears as though not hearing me he ignored the question taking his time in the fastening of the frogs down the front of his coat only when he finished did he turn his attention to me once more he bowed sardonically hand over his heart i am madam jonathan randall esquire captain of his majestys eighth dragoons at your service madam i broke and ran my breath rasped in my chest as i tore through the screen of oak and alder ignoring brambles nettles stones fallen logs everything in my path i heard a shout behind me but was much too panicked to determine its direction i fled blindly branches scratching my face and arms ankles turning as i stepped in holes and stumbled on rocks i had no room in my mind for any form of rational thought i wanted only to get away from him a heavy weight struck me hard in the lower back and i pitched forward at full length landing with a thud that knocked the wind out of me rough hands flipped me onto my back and captain jonathan randall rose to his knees above me he was breathing heavily and had lost his sword in the chase he looked disheveled dirty and thoroughly annoyed what the devil do you mean by running away like that he demanded a thick lock of darkbrown hair had come loose and curved across his brow making him look even more disconcertingly like frank he leaned down and grasped me by the arms still gasping for breath i struggled to get free but succeeded only in dragging him down on top of me he lost his balance and collapsed at full length on me flattening me once more surprisingly enough this seemed to make his annoyance vanish oh like that is it he said with a chuckle well id be most willing to oblige you chuckie but it happens youve chosen a rather inopportune moment his weight pressed my hips to the ground and a small rock was digging painfully into the small of my back i squirmed to dislodge it he ground his hips hard against mine and his hands pinned my shoulders to the earth my mouth fell open in outrage what do you i began but he ducked his head and kissed me cutting short my expostulations his tongue thrust into my mouth and explored me with a bold familiarity roving and plunging retreating and lunging again then just as suddenly as he had begun he pulled back he patted my cheek quite nice chuck perhaps later when ive the leisure to attend to you properly i had by this time recovered my breath and i used it i screamed directly into his earhole and he jerked as though i had run a hot wire into it i took advantage of the movement to get my knee up and jabbed it into his exposed side sending him sprawling into the leaf mold i scrambled awkwardly to my feet he rolled expertly and came up alongside me i glanced wildly around looking for a way out but we were flush up against the foot of one of those towering granite cliffs that just so abruptly from the soil of the scottish highlands he had caught me at a point where the rock face broke inward forming a shallow stony box he blocked the entrance to the declivity arms spread and braced between the rock walls an expression of mingled anger and curiosity on his handsome dark face who were you with he demanded frank whoever he is ive no man by that name among my company or is it some man who lives nearby he smiled derisively you havent the smell of dung on your skin so you havent been with a cottar for that matter you look a bit more expensive than the local farmers could afford i clenched my fists and set my chin whatever this joker had in mind i was having none of it i havent the faintest idea what you are talking about and ill thank you to let me pass at once i said adopting my very best wardsisters tone this generally had a good effect on recalcitrant orderlies and young interns but appeared merely to amuse captain randall i was resolutely repressing the feelings of fear and disorientation that were flapping under my ribs like a panicked flock of hens he shook his head slowly examining me once more in detail not just at present chuckie im asking myself he said conversationally just why a whore abroad in her shift would be wearing her shoes and quite fine ones at that he added glancing at my plain brown loafers a what i exclaimed he ignored me completely his gaze had returned to my face and he suddenly stepped forward and gripped my chin in his hand i grabbed his wrist and yanked let go of me he had fingers like steel disregarding my efforts to free myself he turned my face from one side to the other so the fading afternoon light shone on it the skin of a lady ill swear he murmured to himself he leaned forward and sniffed and a french scent in your hair he let go then and i rubbed my jaw indignantly as though to erase the touch i still felt on my skin the rest might be managed with money from your patron he mused but youve the speech of a lady too thanks so much i snapped get out of my way my husband is expecting me if im not back in ten minutes hell come looking for me oh your husband the derisively admiring expression retreated somewhat but did not disappear completely and what is your husbands name pray where is he and why does he allow his wife to wander alone through deserted woods in a state of undress i had been throttling that part of my brain that was beating itself to pieces trying to make sense of the whole afternoon it now managed to break through long enough to tell me that however absurd i thought its conjectures giving this man franks name the same as his own was only likely to lead to further trouble disdaining therefore to answer him i made to push past him he blocked my passage with a muscular arm and reached for me with his other hand there was a sudden whoosh from above followed immediately by a blur before my eyes and a dull thud captain randall was on the ground at my feet under a heaving mass that looked like a bundle of old plaid rags a brown rocklike fist rose out of the mass and descended with considerable force meeting decisively with some bony protuberance by the sound of the resultant crack the captains struggling legs shiny in tall brown boots relaxed quite suddenly i found myself staring into a pair of sharp black eyes the sinewy hand that had temporarily distracted the captains unwelcome attentions was attached like a limpet to my forearm and who the hell are you i said in astonishment my rescuer if i cared to call him that was some inches shorter than i and sparely built but the bare arms protruding from the ragged shirt were knotted with muscle and his whole frame gave the impression of being made of some resilient material such as bedsprings no beauty either with a pockmarked skin low brow and narrow jaw this way he jerked on my arm and i stupefied by the rush of recent events obediently followed my new companion pushed his way rapidly through a scrim of alder made an abrupt turn around a large rock and suddenly we were on a path overgrown with gorse and heather and zigzagging so that it was never visible for more than six feet ahead it was still unmistakably a path leading steeply up toward the crest of a hill not until we were picking our way cautiously down the far side of the hill did i gather breath and wit enough to ask where we were going receiving no answer from my companion i repeated where on earth are we going in a louder tone to my considerable surprise he rounded on me face contorted and pushed me off the path as i opened my mouth to protest he clapped a hand over it and dragged me to the ground rolling on top of me not again i thought and was heaving desperately to and fro to free myself when i heard what he had heard and suddenly lay still voices called back and forth accompanied by trampling and splashing sounds they were unmistakably english voices i struggled violently to get my mouth free i sank my teeth into his hand and had time only to register the fact that he had been eating pickled herring with his fingers before something crashed against the back of my skull and everything went dark the stone cottage loomed up suddenly through a haze of night mist the shutters were bolted tight showing no more than a thread of light having no idea how long i had been unconscious i couldnt tell how far this place was from the hill of craigh na dun or the town of inverness we were on horseback myself mounted before my captor with hands tied to the pommel but there was no road so progress was still rather slow i thought i had not been out for long i showed no symptoms of concussion or other ill effects from the blow save a sore patch on the base of my skull my captor a man of few words had responded to my questions demands and acerbic remarks alike with the allpurpose scottish noise which can best be rendered phonetically as mmmmphm had i been in any doubt as to his nationality that sound alone would have been sufficient to remove it my eyes had gradually adapted to the dwindling light outside as the horse stumbled through the stones and gorse so it was a shock to step from neardark into what seemed a blaze of light inside as the dazzle receded i could see that in fact the single room was lit only by a fire several candlesticks and a dangerously oldfashionedlooking oil lamp what is it ye have there murtagh the weaselfaced man grabbed me by the arm and urged me blinking into the firelight a sassenach wench dougal by her speech there were several men in the room all apparently staring at me some in curiosity some with unmistakable leers my dress had been torn in various spots during the afternoons activities and i hastily took stock of the damage looking down i could see the curve of one breast clearly through a rip and i was sure the assembled men could too i decided that making an attempt to pull the torn edges together would only draw further attention to the prospect instead i chose a face at random and stared boldly at him in hopes of distracting either the man or myself eh a bonny one sassenach or no said the man a fat greasylooking sort seated by the fire he was holding a chunk of bread and didnt bother to set it down as he rose and came over to me he pushed my chin up with the back of his hand shoving the hair out of my face a few breadcrumbs fell down the neck of my dress the other men clustered close around a mass of plaid and whiskers smelling strongly of sweat and alcohol it was only then that i saw they were all kilted odd even for this part of the highlands had i stumbled into the meeting of a clan society or perhaps a regimental reunion cmere lass a large darkbearded man remained seated at the table by the window as he beckoned me by his air of command he seemed to be the leader of this pack the men parted reluctantly as murtagh pulled me forward apparently respecting his rights as captor the dark man looked me over carefully no expression on his face he was goodlooking i thought and not unfriendly there were lines of strain between his brows though and it wasnt a face one would willingly cross whats your name lass his voice was light for a man of his size not the deep bass i would have expected from the barrel chest claire claire beauchamp i said deciding on the spur of the moment to use my maiden name if it were ransom they had in mind i didnt want to help them by giving a name that could lead to frank and i wasnt sure i wanted these roughlooking men to know who i was before i found out who they were and just what do you think youre the dark man ignored me establishing a pattern that i was to grow tired of very quickly beauchamp the heavy brows lifted and the general company stirred in surprise a french name it is surely he had in fact pronounced the name in correct french though i had given it the common english pronunciation of beecham yes thats right i answered in some surprise where did ye find this lass dougal demanded swinging round on murtagh who was refreshing himself from a leather flask the swarthy little man shrugged at the foot o craigh na dun she was havin words with a certain captain of dragoons wi whom i chanced to be acquent he added with a significant lift of his eyebrows there seemed to be some question as to whether the lady was or was not a whore dougal looked me over carefully once more taking in every detail of cotton print dress and walking shoes i see and what was the ladys position in this discussion he inquired with a sarcastic emphasis on the word lady that i didnt particularly care for i noticed that while his scots was less pronounced than that of the man called murtagh his accent was still broad enough that the word was almost though not quite leddy murtagh seemed grimly amused at least one corner of the thin mouth turned up she said she wasna the captain himself appeared to be of two minds on the matter but inclined to put the question to the test we could do the same come to that the fat blackbearded man stepped toward me grinning hands tugging at his belt i backed up hastily as far as i could which was not nearly far enough given the dimensions of the cottage that will do rupert dougal was still scowling at me but his voice held the ring of authority and rupert stopped his advances making a comical face of disappointment i dont hold wi rape and weve not the time for it anyway i was pleased to hear this statement of policy dubious as its moral underpinning might be but remained a bit nervous in the face of the openly lascivious looks on some of the other faces i felt absurdly as though i had appeared in public in my undergarments and while i had no idea who or what these highland bandits were up to they seemed bloody dangerous i bit my tongue repressing a number of more or less injudicious remarks that were bubbling toward the surface what dye say murtagh dougal demanded of my captor she doesna appear to care for rupert at least thats no proof objected a short balding man he didna offer her any siller ye canna expect any woman to take on something like rupert without substantial payment in advance he added to the considerable hilarity of his companions dougal stilled the racket with an abrupt gesture though and jerked his head toward the door the balding man still grinning obediently slid out into the darkness murtagh who had not joined in the laughter was frowning as he looked me over he shook his head making the lank fringe across his forehead sway nay he said definitely ive no idea what she might be or who but ill stake my best shirt shes no a whore i hoped in that case that his best was not the one he was wearing which scarcely looked worth the wagering weel yed know murtagh yeve seen enough o them gibed rupert but was gruffly hushed by dougal well puzzle it out later said dougal brusquely weve a good distance to go tonight and we mun do something for jamie first he canna ride like that i shrank back into the shadows near the fireplace hoping to avoid notice the man called murtagh had untied my hands before leading me in here perhaps i could slip away while they were busy elsewhere the mens attention had shifted to a young man crouched on a stool in the corner he had barely looked up through my appearance and interrogation but kept his head bent hand clutching the opposite shoulder rocking slightly back and forth in pain dougal gently pushed the clutching hand away one of the men pulled back the young mans plaid revealing a dirtsmeared linen shirt blotched with blood a small man with a thick mustache came up behind the lad with a singlebladed knife and holding the shirt at the collar slit it across the breast and down the sleeve so that it fell away from the shoulder i gasped as did several of the men the shoulder had been wounded there was a deep ragged furrow across the top and blood was running freely down the young mans breast but more shocking was the shoulder joint itself a dreadful hump rose on that side and the arm hung at an impossible angle dougal grunted mmph out o joint poor bugger the young man looked up for the first time though drawn with pain and stubbled with red beard it was a strong goodhumored face fell wi my hand out when the musket ball knocked me off my saddle i landed with all my weight on the hand and crunch there it went crunch is right the mustached man a scot and educated to judge by his accent was probing the shoulder making the lad grimace in pain the wounds no trouble the ball went right through and its clean the bloods runnin free enough the man picked up a wad of grimy cloth from the table and used it to blot the blood i dont know quite what to do about the disjointure though wed need a chirurgeon to put it back in place properly you canna ride with it that way can you jamie lad musket ball i thought blankly chirurgeon the young man shook his head whitefaced hurts bad enough sitting still i couldna manage a horse he squeezed his eyes shut and set his teeth hard in his lower lip murtagh spoke impatiently well we canna leave him behind noo can we the lobsterbacks are no great shakes trackin in the dark but theyll find this place sooner or later shutters or no and jamie can hardly pass for an innocent cottar wi yon great hole in im dinna worrit yourself dougal said shortly i dont mean to be leaving him behind the mustached man sighed no help for it then well have to try and force the joint back murtagh you and rupert hold him ill give it a try i watched in sympathy as he picked up the young mans arm by wrist and elbow and began forcing it upward the angle was quite wrong it must be causing agonizing pain sweat poured down the young mans face but he made no sound beyond a soft groan suddenly he slumped forward kept from falling on the floor only by the grip of the men holding him one unstoppered a leather flask and pressed it to his lips the reek of the raw spirit reached me where i stood the young man coughed and gagged but swallowed nonetheless dribbling the amber liquid onto the remains of his shirt all right for another go lad the bald man asked or maybe rupert should have a try he suggested turning to the squat blackbearded ruffian rupert so invited flexed his hands as though about to toss a caber and picked up the young mans wrist plainly intending to put the joint back by main force an operation it was clear which was likely to snap the arm like a broomstick dont you dare to do that all thought of escape submerged in professional outrage i started forward oblivious to the startled looks of the men around me what do you mean snapped the bald man clearly irritated by my intrusion i mean that youll break his arm if you do it like that i snapped back stand out of the way please i elbowed rupert back and took hold of the patients wrist myself the patient looked as surprised as the rest but didnt resist his skin was very warm but not feverish i judged you have to get the bone of the upper arm at the proper angle before it will slip back into its joint i said grunting as i pulled the wrist up and the elbow in the young man was sizable his arm was heavy as lead this is the worst part i warned the patient i cupped the elbow ready to whip it upward and in his mouth twitched not quite a smile it canna hurt much worse than it does get on wi it sweat was popping out on my own face by now resetting a shoulder joint is hard work at the best of times done on a large man who had gone hours since the dislocation his muscles now swollen and pulling on the joint the job was taking all the strength i had the fire was dangerously close i hoped we wouldnt both topple in if the joint went back with a jerk suddenly the shoulder gave a soft crunching pop and the joint was back in place the patient looked amazed he put an unbelieving hand up to explore it doesna hurt anymore a broad grin of delighted relief spread across his face and the men broke out in exclamations and applause it will i was sweating from the exertion but smugly pleased with the results it will be tender for several days you mustnt extend the joint at all for two or three days when you do use it again go very slowly at first stop at once if it begins to hurt and use warm compresses on it daily i became aware in the midst of this advice that while the patient was listening respectfully the other men were eyeing me with looks ranging from wonder to outright suspicion im a nurse you see i explained feeling somehow defensive dougals eyes and ruperts as well dropped to my bosom and fastened there with a sort of horrified fascination they exchanged glances then dougal looked back at my face be that as it may he said raising his brows at me for a wetnurse youd seem to have some skill at healing can ye stanch the lads wound well enough for him to sit a horse i can dress the wound yes i said with considerable asperity provided youve anything to dress it with but just what do you mean wetnurse and why do you suppose id want to help you anyway i was ignored as dougal turned and spoke in a tongue i dimly recognized as gaelic to a woman who cowered in the corner surrounded by the mass of men i had not noticed her before she was dressed oddly i thought in a long ragged skirt and a longsleeved blouse halfcovered by a sort of bodice or jerkin everything was rather on the grubby side including her face glancing around though i could see that the cottage lacked not only electrification but also indoor plumbing perhaps there was some excuse for the dirt the woman bobbed a quick curtsy and scuttling past rupert and murtagh she began digging in a painted wooden chest by the hearth emerging finally with a pile of ratty cloths no that wont do i said fingering them gingerly the wound needs to be disinfected first then bandaged with a clean cloth if there are no sterile bandages eyebrows rose all around disinfected said the small man carefully yes indeed i said firmly thinking him a bit simpleminded in spite of his educated accent all dirt must be removed from the wound and it must be treated with a compound to discourage germs and promote healing such as such as iodine i said seeing no comprehension on the faces before me i tried again merthiolate dilute carbolic i suggested or perhaps even just alcohol looks of relief at last i had found a word they appeared to recognize murtagh thrust the leather flask into my hands i sighed with impatience i knew the highlands were primitive but this was nearly unbelievable look i said as patiently as i could why dont you just take him down into the town it cant be far and im sure theres a doctor there who could see to him the woman gawped at me what town the big man called dougal was ignoring this discussion peering cautiously into the darkness around the curtains edge he let it fall back into place and stepped quietly to the door the men fell quiet as he vanished into the night in a moment he was back bringing the bald man and the cold sharp scent of dark pines with him he shook his head in answer to the mens questioning looks nay nothing close well go at once while its safe catching sight of me he stopped for a moment thinking suddenly he nodded at me decision made shell come with us he said he rummaged in the pile of cloths on the table and came up with a tattered rag it looked like a neckcloth that had seen better days the mustached man seemed disinclined to have me along wherever they were going why do ye no just leave her here dougal cast him an impatient glance but left it to murtagh to explain wherever the redcoats are now theyll be here by dawn which is no so far off considering if this womans an english spy we canna risk leaving her here to tell them which way weve gone and if she should not be on good terms wi them he looked dubiously at me we certainly canna leave a lone woman here in her shift he brightened a bit fingering the fabric of my skirt she might be worth a bit in the way of ransom at that little as she has on its fine stuff besides dougal added interrupting she may be useful on the way she seems to know a bit about doctoring but weve no time for that now im afraid yell have to go without bein disinfected jamie he said clapping the younger man on the back can ye ride onehanded aye good lad here he said tossing the greasy rag at me bind up his wound quickly well be leaving directly do you two get the horses he said turning to weaselface and the fat one called rupert i turned the rag around distastefully i cant use this i complained its filthy without seeing him move i found the big man gripping my shoulder his dark eyes an inch from mine do it he said freeing me with a push he strode to the door and disappeared after his two henchmen feeling more than a little shaken i turned to the task of bandaging the bullet wound as best i could the thought of using the grimy neckrag was something my medical training wouldnt let me contemplate i tried to bury my confusion and terror in the task of trying to find something more suitable and after a quick and futile search through the pile of rags finally settled on strips of rayon torn from the hem of my slip while hardly sterile it was by far the cleanest material at hand the linen of my patients shirt was old and worn but still surprisingly tough with a bit of a struggle i ripped the rest of the sleeve open and used it to improvise a sling i stepped back to survey the results of my impromptu field dressing and backed straight into the big man who had come in quietly to watch he looked approvingly at my handiwork good job lass come on were ready dougal handed a coin to the woman and hustled me out of the cottage followed more slowly by jamie still a bit whitefaced unfolded from the low stool my patient proved to be quite tall he stood several inches over dougal himself a tall man the blackbearded rupert and murtagh were holding six horses outside muttering soft gaelic endearments to them in the dark it was a moonless night but the starlight caught the metal bits of the harness in flashes of quicksilver i looked up and almost gasped in wonder the night sky was thick with a glory of stars such as i had never seen glancing round at the surrounding forest i understood with no nearby city to veil the sky with light the stars here held undisputed dominion over the night and then i stopped dead feeling much colder than the night chill justified no city lights what town the woman inside had asked accustomed as i was to blackouts and air raids from the war years the lack of light had not at first disturbed me but this was peacetime and the lights of inverness should have been visible for miles the men were shapeless masses in the dark i thought of trying to slip away into the trees but dougal apparently divining my thought grabbed my elbow and pulled me toward the horses jamie get yourself up he called the lass will ride wi you he squeezed my elbow you can hold the reins if jamie canna manage onehanded but do ye take care to keep close wi the rest of us should ye try anythin else i shall cut your throat dye understand me i nodded throat too dry to answer his voice was not particularly threatening but i believed every word i was the less tempted to try anythin in that i had no idea what to try i didnt know where i was who my companions were why we were leaving with such urgency or where we were going but i lacked any reasonable alternatives to going with them i was worried about frank who must long since have started looking for me but this didnt seem the time to mention him dougal must have sensed my nod for he let go of my arm and stooped suddenly beside me i stood stupidly staring down at him until he hissed your foot lass give me your foot your left foot he added disgustedly i hastily took my misplaced right foot out of his hand and stepped up with my left with a slight grunt he boosted me into the saddle in front of jamie who gathered me in closely with his good arm in spite of the general awkwardness of my situation i was grateful for the young scots warmth he smelt strongly of woodsmoke blood and unwashed male but the night chill bit through my thin dress and i was happy enough to lean back against him with no more than a faint chinking of bridles we moved off into the starlit night there was no conversation among the men only a general wary watchfulness the horses broke into a trot as soon as we reached the road and i was jostled too uncomfortably to want to talk myself even assuming that anyone was willing to listen my companion seemed to be having little trouble in spite of being unable to use his right hand i could feel his thighs behind mine shifting and pressing occasionally to guide the horse i clutched the edge of the short saddle in order to stay seated i had been on horses before but was by no means the horseman this jamie was after a time we reached a crossroads where we stopped a moment while the bald man and the leader conferred in low tones jamie dropped the reins over the horses neck and let it wander to the verge to crop grass while he began twisting and turning behind me careful i said dont twist like that or your dressing will come off what are you trying to do get my plaid loose to cover you he replied youre shivering but i canna do it onehanded can ye reach the clasp of my brooch for me with a good deal of tugging and awkward shifting we got the plaid loosened with a surprisingly dexterous swirl he twirled the cloth out and let it settle shawllike around his shoulders he then put the ends over my shoulders and tucked them neatly under the saddle edge so that we were both warmly wrapped there he said we dinna want ye to freeze before we get there thank you i said grateful for the shelter but where are we going i couldnt see his face behind and above me but he paused a moment before answering at last he laughed shortly tell ye the truth lassie i dont know reckon well both find out when we get there eh something seemed faintly familiar about the section of countryside through which we were passing surely i knew that large rock formation ahead the one shaped like a roosters tail cocknammon rock i exclaimed aye reckon said my escort unexcited by this revelation didnt the english use it for ambushes i asked trying to remember the dreary details of local history frank had spent hours regaling me with over the last week if there is an english patrol in the neighborhood i hesitated if there was an english patrol in the neighborhood perhaps i was wrong to draw attention to it and yet in case of an ambush i would be quite indistinguishable from my companion shrouded as we were in one plaid and i thought again of captain jonathan randall and shuddered involuntarily everything i had seen since i had stepped through the cleft stone pointed toward the completely irrational conclusion that the man i had met in the wood was in fact franks sixtimesgreatgrandfather i fought stubbornly against this conclusion but was unable to formulate another that met the facts i had at first imagined that i was merely dreaming more vividly than usual but randalls kiss rudely familiar and immediately physical had dispelled that impression neither did i imagine that i had dreamed being knocked on the head by murtagh the soreness on my scalp was being matched by a chafing of my inner thighs against the saddle which seemed most undreamlike and the blood yes i was familiar enough with blood to have dreamed of it before but never had i dreamed the scent of blood that warm coppery tang that i could still smell on the man behind me tck he clucked to our horse and urged it up alongside the leaders engaging the burly shadow in quiet gaelic conversation the horses slowed to a walk at a signal from the leader jamie murtagh and the small bald man dropped back while the other two spurred up and galloped toward the rock a quartermile ahead to the right a halfmoon had come up and the light was bright enough to pick out the leaves of the mallow plants growing on the roadside but the shadows in the clefts of the rock could hide anything just as the galloping shapes passed the rock a flash of musket fire sparked from a hollow there was a bloodcurdling shriek from directly behind me and the horse leaped forward as though jabbed with a sharp stick we were suddenly racing toward the rock across the heather murtagh and the other man alongside hairraising screams and bellows splitting the night air i hung onto the pommel for dear life suddenly reining up next to a large gorse bush jamie grabbed me round the waist and unceremoniously dumped me into it the horse whirled sharply and sprinted off again circling the rock to come along the south side i could see the rider crouching low in the saddle as the horse vanished into the rocks shadow when it emerged still galloping the saddle was empty the rock surfaces were cratered with shadow i could hear shouts and occasional musket shots but couldnt tell if the movements i saw were those of men or only the shades of the stunted oaks that sprouted from cracks in the rock i extricated myself from the bush with some difficulty picking bits of prickly gorse from my skirt and hair i licked a scratch on my hand wondering what on earth i was to do now i could wait for the battle at the rock to be decided if the scots won or at least survived i supposed they would come back looking for me if they did not i could approach the english who might well assume that if i were traveling with the scots i was in league with them in league to do what i had no idea but it was quite plain from the mens behavior at the cottage that they were up to something which they expected the english strongly to disapprove of perhaps it would be better to avoid both sides in this conflict after all now that i knew where i was i stood some chance of getting back to a town or village that i knew even if i had to walk all the way i set off with decision toward the road tripping over innumerable lumps of granite the bastard offspring of cocknammon rock the moonlight made walking deceptive though i could see every detail of the ground i had no depth perception flat plants and jagged stones looked the same height causing me to lift my feet absurdly high over nonexistent obstacles and stub my toes on protruding rocks i walked as fast as i could listening for sounds of pursuit behind me the noises of battle had faded by the time i reached the road i realized that i was too visible on the road itself but i needed to follow it if i were to find my way to a town i had no sense of direction in the dark and had never learned from frank his trick of navigation by the stars thinking of frank made me want to cry so i tried to distract myself by trying to make sense of the afternoons events it seemed inconceivable but all appearances pointed to my being someplace where the customs and politics of the late eighteenth century still held sway i would have thought the whole thing a fancydress show of some type had it not been for the injuries of the young man they called jamie that wound had indeed been made by something very like a musket ball judging from the evidence it left behind the behavior of the men in the cottage was not consistent with any sort of playacting either they were serious men and the dirks and swords were real could it be some secluded enclave perhaps where the villagers reenacted part of their history periodically i had heard of such things in germany though never in scotland youve never heard of the actors shooting each other with muskets either have you jeered the uncomfortably rational part of my mind i looked back at the rock to check my position then ahead to the skyline and my blood ran cold there was nothing there but the feathered needles of pine trees impenetrably black against the spread of stars where were the lights of inverness if that was cocknammon rock behind me as i knew it was then inverness must be less than three miles to the southwest at this distance i should be able to see the glow of the town against the sky if it was there i shook myself irritably hugging my elbows against the chill even admitting for a moment the completely implausible idea that i was in another time than my own inverness had stood in its present location for some six hundred years it was there but apparently it had no lights under the circumstances this strongly suggested that there were no electric lights to be had yet another piece of evidence if i needed it but evidence of what exactly a shape stepped out of the dark so close in front of me that i nearly bumped into it stifling a scream i turned to run but a large hand gripped my arm preventing escape dinna worry lass tis me thats what i was afraid of i said crossly though in fact i was relieved that it was jamie i was not so afraid of him as of the other men though he looked just as dangerous still he was young even younger than i i judged and it was difficult for me to be afraid of someone i had so recently treated as a patient i hope you havent been misusing that shoulder i said in the rebuking voice of a hospital matron if i could establish a sufficient tone of authority perhaps i could persuade him into letting me go yon wee stramash didna do it any good he admitted massaging the shoulder with his free hand just then he moved into a patch of moonlight and i saw the huge spread of blood on his shirt front arterial bleeding i thought at once but then why is he still standing youre hurt i exclaimed have you broken open your shoulder wound or is it fresh sit down and let me see i pushed him toward a pile of boulders rapidly reviewing procedures for emergency field treatment no supplies to hand save what i was wearing i was reaching for the remains of my slip intending to use it to stanch the flow when he laughed nay pay it no mind lass this lot isna my blood not much of it anyway he added plucking the soaked fabric gingerly away from his body i swallowed feeling a bit queasy oh i said weakly dougal and the others will be waiting by the road lets go he took me by the arm less as a gallant gesture than a means of forcing me to accompany him i decided to take a chance and dug in my heels no im not going with you he stopped surprised at my resistance yes you are he didnt seem upset by my refusal in fact he seemed slightly amused that i had any objection to being kidnapped again and what if i wont are you going to cut my throat i demanded forcing the issue he considered the alternatives and answered calmly why no you dont look heavy if ye wont walk i shall pick you up and sling ye over my shoulder do ye want me to do that he took a step toward me and i hastily retreated i hadnt the slightest doubt he would do it injury or no no you cant do that youll damage your shoulder again his features were indistinct but the moonlight caught the gleam of teeth as he grinned well then since ye dont want me to hurt myself i suppose that means as youre comin with me i struggled for an answer but failed to find one in time he took my arm again firmly and we set off toward the road jamie kept a tight hold on my arm hauling me upright when i stumbled over rocks and plants he himself walked as though the stubbled heath were a paved road in broad daylight he has cat blood i reflected sourly no doubt that was how he managed to sneak up on me in the darkness the other men were as advertised waiting with the horses at no great distance apparently there had been no losses or injuries for they were all present scrambling up in an undignified scuffle i plopped down in the saddle again my head gave jamies bad shoulder an unintentional thump and he drew in his breath with a hiss i tried to cover my resentment at being recaptured and my remorse at having hurt him with an air of bullying officiousness serves you right brawling round the countryside and chasing through bushes and rocks i told you not to move that joint now youve probably got torn muscles as well as bruises he seemed amused by my scolding well it wasna much of a choice if id not moved my shoulder i wouldna have ever moved anything else again i can handle a single redcoat wi one hand maybe even two of them he said a bit boastfully but not three besides he said drawing me against his bloodencrusted shirt ye can fix it for me again when we get where were going thats what you think i said coldly squirming away from the sticky fabric he clucked to the horse and we set off again the men were in ferocious good spirits after the fight and there was a good deal of laughter and joking my minor part in thwarting the ambush was much praised and toasts were drunk in my honor from the flasks that several of the men carried i was offered some of the contents but declined at first on grounds that i found it hard enough to stay in the saddle sober from the mens discussion i gathered it had been a small patrol of some ten english soldiers armed with muskets and sabers someone passed a flask to jamie and i could smell the hot burntsmelling liquor as he drank i wasnt at all thirsty but the faint scent of honey reminded me that i was starving and had been for some time my stomach gave an embarrassingly loud growl protesting my neglect hey then jamielad hungry are ye or have ye a set of bagpipes with ye shouted rupert mistaking the source of the noise hungry enough to eat a set of pipes i reckon called jamie gallantly assuming the blame a moment later a hand with a flask came around in front of me again better have a wee nip he whispered to me it willna fill your belly but it will make ye forget youre hungry and a number of other things as well i hoped i tilted the flask and swallowed my escort had been correct the whisky built a small warm fire that burned comfortably in my stomach obscuring the hunger pangs we managed without incident for several miles taking turns with both reins and whisky flask near a ruined cottage though the breathing of my escort gradually changed to a ragged gasping our precarious balance heretofore contained in a staid wobble suddenly became much more erratic i was confused if i wasnt drunk it seemed rather unlikely that he was stop help i yelled hes going over i remembered my last unrehearsed descent and had no inclination to repeat it dark shapes swirled and crowded around us with a confused muttering of voices jamie slid off headfirst like a sack of stones luckily landing in someones arms the rest of the men were off their horses and had him laid in a field by the time i had scrambled down hes breathin said one well how very helpful i snapped groping frantically for a pulse in the blackness i found one at last rapid but fairly strong putting a hand on his chest and an ear to his mouth i could feel a regular rise and fall with less of that gasping note i straightened up i think hes just fainted i said put a saddlebag under his feet and if theres water bring me some i was surprised to find that my orders were instantly obeyed apparently the young man was important to them he groaned and opened his eyes black holes in the starlight in the faint light his face looked like a skull white skin stretched tight over the angled bones around the orbits im all right he said trying to sit up just a bit dizzy is all i put a hand on his chest and pushed him flat lie still i ordered i carried out a rapid inspection by touch then rose on my knees and turned to a looming shape that i deduced from its size to be the leader dougal the gunshot wound has been bleeding again and the idiots been knifed as well i think its not serious but hes lost quite a lot of blood his shirt is soaked through but i dont know how much of it is his he needs rest and quiet we should camp here at least until morning the shape made a negative motion nay were farther than the garrison will venture but theres still the watch to be mindful of weve a good fifteen miles yet to go the featureless head tilted back gauging the movement of the stars five hours at the least and more likely seven we can stay long enough for ye to stop the bleeding and dress the wound again no much more than that i set to work muttering to myself while dougal with a soft word dispatched one of the other shadows to stand guard with the horses by the road the other men relaxed for the moment drinking from flasks and chatting in low voices the ferretfaced murtagh helped me tearing strips of linen fetching more water and lifting the patient up to have the dressing tied on jamie being strictly forbidden to move himself despite his grumbling that he was perfectly all right you are not all right and its no wonder i snapped venting my fear and irritation what sort of idiot gets himself knifed and doesnt even stop to take care of it couldnt you tell how badly you were bleeding youre lucky youre not dead tearing around the countryside all night brawling and fighting and throwing yourself off horses hold still you bloody fool the rayon and linen strips i was working with were irritatingly elusive in the dark they slipped away eluding my grasp like fish darting away into the depths with a mocking flash of white bellies despite the chill sweat sprang out on my neck i finally finished tying one end and reached for another which persisted in slithering away behind the patients back come back here you oh you goddamned bloody bastard jamie had moved and the original end had come untied there was a moment of shocked silence christ said the fat man named rupert ive neer heard a woman use such language in me life then yeve neer met my auntie grisel said another voice to laughter your husband should tan ye woman said an austere voice from the blackness under a tree st paul says let a woman be silent and you can mind your own bloody business i snarled sweat dripping behind my ears and so can st paul i wiped my forehead with my sleeve turn him to the left and if you addressing my patient move so much as one single muscle while im tying this bandage ill throttle you och aye he answered meekly i pulled too hard on the last bandage and the entire dressing scooted off goddamn it all to hell i bellowed striking my hand on the ground in frustration there was a moment of shocked silence then as i fumbled in the dark for the loose ends of the bandages further comment on my unwomanly language perhaps we should send her to ste anne dougal offered one of the blankfaced figures squatting by the road ive not heard jamie swear once since we left the coast and he used to have a mouth on him would put a sailor to shame four months in a monastery must have had some effect you do not even take the name of the lord in vain anymore do ye lad you wouldna do so either if youd been made to do penance for it by lying for three hours at midnight on the stone floor of a chapel in february wearing nothin but your shirt answered my patient the men all laughed as he continued the penance was only for two hours but it took another to get myself up off the floor afterward i thought my er i thought id frozen to the flags but it turned out just to be stiffness apparently he was feeling better i smiled despite myself but spoke firmly nonetheless you be quiet i said or ill hurt you he gingerly touched the dressing and i slapped his hand away oh threats is it he asked impudently and after i shared my drink with ye too the flask completed the circle of men kneeling down next to me dougal tilted it carefully for the patient to drink the pungent burnt smell of very raw whisky floated up and i put a restraining hand on the flask no more spirits i said he needs tea or at worst water not alcohol dougal pulled the flask from my hand completely disregarding me and poured a sizable slug of the hotsmelling liquid down the throat of my patient making him cough waiting only long enough for the man on the ground to catch his breath he reapplied the flask stop that i reached for the whisky again do you want him so drunk he cant stand up i was rudely elbowed aside feisty wee bitch is she no said my patient sounding amused tend to your business woman dougal ordered weve a good way to go yet tonight and hell need whatever strength the drink can give him the instant the bandages were tied the patient tried to sit up i pushed him flat and put a knee on his chest to keep him there you are not to move i said fiercely i grabbed the hem of dougals kilt and jerked it roughly urging him back down on his knees next to me look at that i ordered in my best wardsister voice i plopped the sopping mass of the discarded shirt into his hand he dropped it with an exclamation of disgust i took his hand and put it on the patients shoulder and look there hes had a blade of some kind right through the trapezius muscle a bayonet put in the patient helpfully a bayonet i exclaimed and why didnt you tell me he shrugged and stopped short with a mild grunt of pain i felt it go in but i couldna tell how bad it was it didna hurt that much is it hurting now it is he said shortly good i said completely provoked you deserve it maybe that will teach you to go haring round the countryside kidnapping young women and kkilling people and i felt myself ridiculously close to tears and stopped fighting for control dougal was growing impatient with this conversation well can ye keep one foot on each side of the horse man he cant go anywhere i protested indignantly he ought to be in hospital certainly he cant my protests as usual went completely ignored can ye ride dougal repeated aye if yell take the lassie off my chest and fetch me a clean shirt chapter i come to the castle the rest of the journey passed uneventfully if you consider it uneventful to ride fifteen miles on horseback through rough country at night frequently without benefit of roads in company with kilted men armed to the teeth and sharing a horse with a wounded man at least we were not set upon by highwaymen we encountered no wild beasts and it didnt rain by the standards i was becoming used to it was quite dull dawn was coming up in streaks and slashes over the foggy moor our destination loomed ahead a huge bulk of dark stone outlined by the grey light the surroundings were no longer quiet and deserted there was a trickle of rudely dressed people heading toward the castle they moved to the side of the narrow road to let the horses trot past gawking at what they plainly thought my outlandish garb not surprisingly it was misting heavily but there was enough light to show a stone bridge arching over a small stream that ran past the front of the castle down to a dully gleaming loch a quarter mile away the castle itself was blunt and solid no fanciful turrets or toothed battlements this was more like an enormous fortified house with thick stone walls and high slitted windows a number of chimney pots smoked over the slick tiles of the roof adding to the general impression of greyness the gated entrance of the castle was wide enough to accommodate two wagons side by side i say this without fear of contradiction because it was doing exactly that as we crossed the bridge one oxdrawn wagon was loaded with barrels the other with hay our little cavalcade huddled on the bridge waiting impatiently for the wagons to complete their laborious entry i risked a question as the horses picked their way over the slippery stones of the wet courtyard i hadnt spoken to my escort since hastily redressing his shoulder by the roadside he had been silent too aside from an occasional grunt of discomfort when a misstep by the horse jolted him where are we i croaked my voice hoarse from cold and disuse the keep of leoch he answered shortly castle leoch well at least now i knew where i was when i had known it castle leoch was a picturesque ruin some thirty miles north of bargrennan it was considerably more picturesque now what with the pigs rooting under the walls of the keep and the pervasive smell of raw sewage i was beginning to accept the impossible idea that i was most likely somewhere in the eighteenth century i was sure that such filth and chaos existed nowhere in the scotland of bomb craters or no and we were definitely in scotland the accents of the people in the courtyard left no doubt of that ay dougal shouted a tattered hostler running up to grab the halter of the lead horse youre early man we hadna thought to see ye before the gathering the leader of our little group swung down from the saddle leaving the reins to the grubby youth aye well weve had some luck both good and bad im off to see my brother will ye summon mrs fitz to feed the lads theyll need their breakfasts and their beds he beckoned murtagh and rupert down to accompany him and together they disappeared under a pointed archway the rest of us dismounted and stood steaming in the wet courtyard for another ten minutes before mrs fitz whoever she might be consented to show herself a cluster of curious children gathered around us speculating on my possible origins and function the bolder ones had just begun to get up enough courage to pluck at my skirt when a large stout lady in dark brown linen and homespun bustled out and shooed them away willy my dear she cried how good to see ye and neddie she gave the small balding man a hearty buss of welcome that nearly knocked him over yell be needin breakfast i reckon plenty in the kitchen do ye go and feed yerselves turning to me and jamie she started back as though bitten by a snake she looked openmouthed at me then turned to jamie for an explanation of this apparition claire he said with a brief tilt of his head toward me and mistress fitzgibbons he added with a tilt the other way murtagh found her yesterday and dougal said we must bring her along wi us he added making it clear it was no good blaming him mistress fitzgibbons closed her mouth and looked me up and down with an air of shrewd evaluation apparently she decided that i looked harmless enough despite my odd and scandalous appearance for she smiled kindly despite several missing teeth and took me by the arm well then claire welcome to ye come wi me and we shall find ye somethin a bit more mmm she looked over my short skirt and inadequate shoes shaking her head she was leading me firmly away when i remembered my patient oh wait please i forgot jamie mistress fitzgibbons was surprised why jamie can fend for himself he knows where to get food and someone will find him a bed but hes hurt he was shot yesterday and stabbed last night i bandaged the wound for riding but i didnt have time to clean or dress it properly i must care for it now before it gets infected infected yes that is i mean inflamed you know with pus and swelling and fever oh aye i know what ye mean but do ye mean to say as ye know what to do for that are ye a charmer then a beaton something like that i had no notion what a beaton might be nor any wish to go into my medical qualifications standing out in the chilly drizzle that had set in mistress fitzgibbons seemed of a like mind for she called back jamie who was making off in the opposite direction and taking him also by an arm towed us both into the castle after a long trip through cold narrow corridors dimly lit by slitted windows we came to a fairly large room furnished with a bed a couple of stools and most importantly a fire i ignored my patient temporarily in favor of thawing my hands mistress fitzgibbons presumably immune to cold sat jamie on a stool by the fire and gently got the remains of his tattered shirt off replacing it with a warm quilt from the bed she clucked at the shoulder which was bruised and swollen and poked at my clumsy dressing i turned from the fire i think it will need to be soaked off and then the wound cleansed with a solution for for preventing fevers mistress fitzgibbons would have made an admirable nurse what will ye be needin she asked simply i thought hard what in the name of god had people used for preventing infection before the advent of antibiotics and of those limited compounds which might be available to me in a primitive scottish castle just after dawn garlic i said in triumph garlic and if you have it witch hazel also ill need several clean rags and a kettle of water for boiling aye well i think we can manage that perhaps a bit of comfrey as well what about a bit o boneset tea or chamomile tlad looks as though its been a long night the young man was in fact swaying with weariness too tired to protest our discussing him as though he were an inanimate object mrs fitzgibbons was soon back with an apron full of garlic bulbs gauze bags of dried herbs and torn strips of old linen a small black iron kettle hung from one meaty arm and she held a large demijohn of water as though it were so much goosedown now then m dear what would ye have me do she said cheerfully i set her to boiling water and peeling the cloves of garlic while i inspected the contents of the herb packets there was the witch hazel i had asked for boneset and comfrey for tea and something i tentatively identified as cherry bark painkiller i muttered happily recollecting mr crook explaining the uses of the barks and herbs we found good wed need that i threw several cloves of peeled garlic into the boiling water with some of the witch hazel then added the cloth strips to the mixture the boneset comfrey and cherry bark were steeping in a small pan of hot water set by the fire the preparations had steadied me a bit if i didnt know for certain where i was or why i was there at least i knew what to do for the next quarter of an hour thank you ah mrs fitzgibbons i said respectfully i can manage now if you have things to do the giant dame laughed breasts heaving ah lass there aye be things for me to do ill send a bit o broth up for ye do ye call oot if ye need anything else she waddled to the door with surprising speed and disappeared on her rounds i pulled the bandages off as carefully as i could still the rayon pad stuck to the flesh coming away with a soft crackling of dried blood droplets of fresh blood oozed around the edges of the wound and i apologized for hurting him though he hadnt moved or made a sound he smiled slightly with a hint perhaps of flirtation no worry lass ive been hurt much worse and by people much less pretty he bent forward for me to wash the wound with the boiled garlic decoction and the quilt slipped from his shoulder i saw at once that whether meant as a compliment or not his remark was a statement of plain fact he had been hurt much worse his upper back was covered with a crisscross of faded white lines he had been savagely flogged and more than once there were small lines of silvery scar tissue in some spots where the welts had crossed and irregular patches where several blows had struck the same spot flaying off skin and gouging the muscle beneath i had of course seen a great variety of wounds and injuries doing combat nursing but there was something about these scars that seemed shockingly brutal i must have drawn in my breath at the sight for he turned his head and caught me staring he shrugged his good shoulder lobsterbacks flogged me twice in the space of a week theyd ha done it twice the same day i expect were they not afraid of killing me no joy in flogging a dead man i tried to keep my voice steady while i sponged i shouldnt think anyone would do such a thing for joy no you should ha seen him who the redcoat captain that skinned my back for me if he was not precisely joyous he was at least verra pleased with himself more nor i was he added wryly randall was the name randall i couldnt keep the shock from my voice cold blue eyes fixed on mine youre familiar with the man the voice was suddenly suspicious no no i used to know a family of that name a long time uh a long time ago in my nervousness i dropped the sponge cloth drat now that will have to be boiled again i scooped it off the floor and bustled to the fireplace trying to hide my confusion in busyness could this captain randall possibly be franks ancestor the soldier with the sterling record gallant on the field of battle recipient of commendations from dukes and if so could someone related to my sweet gentle frank possibly be capable of inflicting the horrifying marks on this lads back i busied myself at the fire dropping in a few more handfuls of witch hazel and garlic setting more cloths to soak when i thought i could control my voice and face i came back to jamie sponge in hand why were you flogged i asked abruptly it was hardly tactful but i badly wanted to know and was too tired to phrase it more gently he sighed moving his shoulder uneasily under my ministrations he was tired too and i was undoubtedly hurting him gentle as i tried to be the first time was escape and the second was theft or at least thats what the chargesheet read what were you escaping from the english he said with an ironic lift of his brow if ye mean where fort william i gathered it was the english i said matching the dryness of his tone what were you doing in fort william in the first place he rubbed his brow with his free hand oh that i think that was obstruction obstruction escape and theft you sound a right dangerous character i said lightly hoping to distract him from what i was doing it worked at least slightly one corner of the wide mouth turned up and one dark blue eye glinted back over his shoulder at me oh i am that he said a wonder you think yourself safe in the same room wi me and you an english lassie well you look harmless enough at the moment this was entirely untrue shirtless scarred and bloodsmeared with stubbled cheeks and reddened eyelids from the long night ride he looked thoroughly disreputable and tired or not he looked entirely capable of further mayhem should the need arise he laughed a surprisingly deep infectious sound harmless as a setting dove he agreed im too hungry to be a threat to anything but breakfast let a stray bannock come within reach though and ill no answer for the consequences ooh sorry i muttered the stab wounds deep and its dirty its all right but he had gone pale beneath the coppery stubble of his beard i tried to lead him back into conversation what exactly is obstruction i asked casually i must say it doesnt sound a major crime he took a deep breath fixing his eyes resolutely on the carved bedpost as i swabbed deeper ah well i suppose its whatever the english say it is in my case it meant defending my family and my property and getting myself half killed in the process he pressed his lips together as if to say no more but after a moment went on as though seeking to focus his attention on anything other than his shoulder it was near to four years ago there was a levy put on the manors near fort william food for the garrison horses for transport and suchlike i wouldna say many liked it but most would yield what they had to small parties of soldiers would go round with an officer and a wagon or two collecting the bits of food and things and one day in october yon captain randall came along to l he caught himself quickly with a glance at me to our place i nodded encouragingly eyes on my work wed thought theyd not come so far the place is a good distance from the fort and not easy to get to but they did he closed his eyes briefly my father was away gone to a funeral at the next farm and i was up in the fields wi most of the men for it was close to harvest and a lot to be done so my sister was alone in the house except for two or three of the women servants and they all rushed upstairs to hide their heads under the bedclothes when they saw the red coats thought the soldiers were sent by the devil and ill no just say they were wrong i laid down my cloth the nasty part was done now all we needed was a poultice of some kind lacking iodine or penicillin it was the best i could do for infection and a good tight dressing eyes still closed the young man did not appear to notice i came down toward the house from behind meaning to fetch a piece of harness from the barn and heard the shouting and my sister screaming inside the house oh i tried to make my voice as quiet and unintrusive as i could i wanted very much to know about this captain randall so far this story had done little to dispel my original impression of him i went in through the kitchen and found two of em riflin the pantry stuffin their sacks wi flour and bacon i punched one of them in the head and threw the other out the window sack and all then i burst into the parlor where i found two of the redcoats with my sister jenny her dress was torn a bit and one of them had a scratched face he opened his eyes and smiled a bit grimly i didna stop to ask questions we were going round and about and i wasna doing too poorly for all there were two of them when randall came in randall had stopped the fight by the simple expedient of holding a pistol to jennys head forced to surrender jamie had quickly been seized and bound by the two soldiers randall had smiled charmingly at his captive and said well well two spitfire scratchcats here have we a taste of hard laborll cure your temper i trow and if it doesnt well theres another cat youll meet name of ninetails but theres other cures for other cats arent there my sweet pussy jamie stopped for a moment jaw working he was holdin jennys arm behind her back but he let go then to bring his hand round and put it down her dress round her breast like remembering the scene he smiled unexpectedly so he resumed jenny stamped down on his foot and gave him her elbow deep in the belly and as he was bent over choking she whirled round and gave him a good root in the stones wi her knee he snorted briefly with amusement weel at that he dropped the pistol and she went for it but one of the dragoons holding me got to it first i had finished the bandaging and stood quiet behind him a hand resting on his good shoulder it seemed important he should tell me everything but i was afraid he would stop if he were reminded of my presence when hed got back enough breath to talk with randall had his men haul us both outside they stripped off my shirt bound me to the wagon tongue and randall beat me across the back with the flat of his saber he was in a black fury but a wee bit the worse for wear ye might say it stung me a bit but he couldna keep it up for long the brief spurt of amusement had vanished now and the shoulder under my hand was hard with tension when he stopped he turned to jenny one of the dragoons had hold of her and asked her did she want to see more or would she rather go into the house with him and offer him better entertainment the shoulder twitched uneasily i couldna move much but i shouted to her that i wasna hurt and i wasnt too much and that she was not to go with him not if they cut my throat before her eyes they were holding her behind me so i couldna see but from the sound of it she spat in his face she must have done because next thing i knew hed grabbed a handful of my hair pulled my head back and set his knife against my throat ive a mind to take you at your suggestion randall had said through his teeth and dug the point just beneath the skin far enough to draw blood i could see the dagger close to my face jamie said and the pattern of spots my blood was making in the dust under the wagon his tone was almost dreamy and i realized that from fatigue and pain he had lapsed into something like a hypnotic state he might not even remember that i was there i made to call out to my sister to tell her that id much prefer to die than have her dishonor herself wi such scum randall took the dagger from my throat though and thrust the blade betwixt my teeth so i couldna call out he rubbed at his mouth as though still tasting bitter steel he stopped talking staring straight ahead but what happened then i shouldnt have spoken but i had to know he shook himself like a man rousing from sleep and rubbed a large hand tiredly across the back of his neck she went with him he said abruptly she thought he would kill me and perhaps she was right after that i dinna ken what happened one of the dragoons hit me in the head wi the stock of his musket when i woke i was trussed up in the wagon wi the chickens jolting down the road toward fort william i see i said quietly im sorry it must have been terrible for you he smiled suddenly the haze of fatigue gone oh aye chickens are verra poor company especially on a long journey realizing that the dressing was completed he hunched the shoulder experimentally wincing as he did so dont do that i said in alarm you really mustnt move it in fact i glanced at the table to be sure there were some strips of dry fabric left im going to strap that arm to your side hold still he didnt speak further but relaxed a bit under my hands when he realized that it wasnt going to hurt i felt an odd sense of intimacy with this young scottish stranger due in part i thought to the dreadful story he had just told me and in part to our long ride through the dark pressed together in drowsy silence i had not slept with many men other than my husband but i had noticed before that to sleep actually sleep with someone did give this sense of intimacy as though your dreams had flowed out of you to mingle with his and fold you both in a blanket of unconscious knowing a throwback of some kind i thought in older more primitive times like these asked another part of my mind it was an act of trust to sleep in the presence of another person if the trust was mutual simple sleep could bring you closer together than the joining of bodies the strapping finished i helped him on with the rough linen shirt easing it over the bad shoulder he stood up to tuck it onehanded into his kilt and smiled down at me i thank ye claire youve a good touch his hand reached out as though to touch my face but he seemed to think better of it the hand wavered and dropped to his side apparently he had felt that odd surge of intimacy too i looked hastily away flipping a hand in a thinknothingofit gesture my gaze traveled around the room taking in the smokeblacked fireplace the narrow unglazed windows and the solid oak furnishings no electrical fittings no carpeting no shiny brass knobs on the bedstead it looked in fact like an eighteenthcentury castle but what about frank the man i had met in the wood looked disturbingly like him but jamies description of captain randall was completely foreign to everything i knew about my gentle peaceloving husband but then if it were true and i was beginning to admit even to myself that it might be then he could in fact be almost anything a man i knew only from a genealogical chart was not necessarily bound to resemble his descendants in conduct but it was frank himself i was concerned with at the moment if i was in fact in the eighteenth century where was he what would he do when i failed to return to mrs bairds would i ever see him again thinking about frank was the last straw since the moment i stepped into the rock and ordinary life ceased to exist i had been assaulted threatened kidnapped and jostled i had not eaten or slept properly for more than twentyfour hours i tried to control myself but my lip wobbled and my eyes filled in spite of myself i turned to the fire to hide my face but too late jamie took my hand asking in a gentle voice what was wrong the firelight glinted on my gold wedding band and i began to sniffle in earnest oh ill ill be all right its all right really its just my my husband i dont ah lass are ye widowed then his voice was so full of sympathetic concern that i lost control entirely no yes i mean i dont yes i suppose i am overcome with emotion and tiredness i collapsed against him sobbing hysterically the lad had nice feelings instead of calling for help or retreating in confusion he sat down gathered me firmly onto his lap with his good arm and sat rocking me gently muttering soft gaelic in my ear and smoothing my hair with one hand i wept bitterly surrendering momentarily to my fear and heartbroken confusion but slowly i began to quiet a bit as jamie stroked my neck and back offering me the comfort of his broad warm chest my sobs lessened and i began to calm myself leaning tiredly into the curve of his shoulder no wonder he was so good with horses i thought blearily feeling his fingers rubbing gently behind my ears listening to the soothing incomprehensible speech if i were a horse id let him ride me anywhere this absurd thought coincided unfortunately with my dawning realization that the young man was not completely exhausted after all in fact it was becoming embarrassingly obvious to both of us i coughed and cleared my throat wiping my eyes with my sleeve as i slid off his lap im so sorry that is i mean thank you for but i i was babbling backing away from him with my face flaming he was a bit flushed too but not disconcerted he reached for my hand and pulled me back careful not to touch me otherwise he put a hand under my chin and forced my head up to face him ye need not be scairt of me he said softly nor of anyone here so long as im with ye he let go and turned to the fire you need somethin hot lass he said matteroffactly and a bit to eat as well something in your belly will help more than anything i laughed shakily at his attempts to pour broth onehanded and went to help he was right food did help we sipped broth and ate bread in a companionable silence sharing the growing comfort of warmth and fullness finally he stood up picking up the fallen quilt from the floor he dropped it back on the bed and motioned me toward it do ye sleep a bit claire youre worn out and likely someone will want to talk wi ye before too long this was a sinister reminder of my precarious position but i was too exhausted to care much i uttered no more than a pro forma protest at taking the bed i had never seen anything so enticing jamie assured me that he could find a bed elsewhere i fell headfirst into the pile of quilts and was asleep before he reached the door chapter the mackenzie i woke in a state of complete confusion i vaguely remembered that something was very wrong but couldnt remember what in fact i had been sleeping so soundly that i couldnt remember for a moment who i was much less where i was warm and the surrounding room was piercingly cold i tried to burrow back into my cocoon of quilts but the voice that had wakened me was still nagging come then lass come now ye must get up the voice was deep and genially hectoring like the barking of a sheepdog i pried one reluctant eye open far enough to see the mountain of brown homespun mistress fitzgibbons the sight of her shocked me back to full consciousness and memory returned it was still true then wrapping a blanket about me against the chill i staggered out of bed and headed for the fire as fast as possible mistress fitzgibbons had a cup of hot broth waiting i sipped it feeling like the survivor of some major bombing raid as she laid out a pile of garments on the bed there was a long yellowish linen chemise with a thin edging of lace a petticoat of fine cotton two overskirts in shades of brown and a pale lemonyellow bodice brownstriped stockings of wool and a pair of yellow slippers completed the ensemble brooking no protests the dame bustled me out of my inadequate garments and oversaw my dressing from the skin out she stood back surveying her handiwork with satisfaction the yellow suits ye lass i thought it would goes well wi that brown hair and it brings out the gold in your eyes stay though yell need a wee bit o ribbon turning out a pocket like a gunnysack she produced a handful of ribbons and bits of jewelry too stunned to resist i allowed her to dress my hair tying back the sidelocks with primrose ribbon clucking over the unfeminine unbecomingness of my shoulderlength bob goodness me dear whatever were ye thinkin to cut your hair so short were ye in disguise like ive heard o some lasses doin so to hide their sex when travelin same as to be safe from they dratted redcoats tis a fine day says i when leddies canna travel the roads in safety she ran on patting me here and there tucking in a curl or arranging a fold finally i was arrayed to her satisfaction weel now thats verra gude now yeve just time for a wee bite then i must take you to himself himself i said i didnt care for the sound of this whoever himself was he was likely to ask difficult questions why the mackenzie to be sure whoever else who else indeed castle leoch i dimly recalled was in the middle of the clan mackenzie lands plainly the clan chieftain was still the mackenzie i began to understand why our little band of horsemen had ridden through the night to reach the castle this would be a place of impregnable safety to men pursued by the crowns men no english officer with a grain of sense would lead his men so deeply into the clan lands to do so was to risk death by ambush at the first clump of trees and only a goodsized army would come as far as the castle gates i was trying to remember whether in fact the english army ever had come so far when i suddenly realized that the eventual fate of the castle was much less relevant than my immediate future i had no appetite for the bannocks and parritch that mrs fitzgibbons had brought for my breakfast but crumbled a bit and pretended to eat in order to gain some time for thought by the time mrs fitz came back to conduct me to the mackenzie i had cobbled together a rough plan the laird received me in a room at the top of a flight of stone steps it was a tower room round and rich with paintings and tapestries hung against the sloping walls while the rest of the castle seemed comfortable enough if somewhat bare this room was luxuriously crowded crammed with furniture bristling with ornaments and warmly lit by fire and candle against the drizzle of the day outside while the outer walls of the castle had only the high slit windows suited to resisting attack this inner wall had been more recently furnished with long casement windows that let in what daylight there was as i entered my attention was drawn at once by an enormous metal cage cleverly engineered to fit the curve of the wall from floor to ceiling filled with dozens of tiny birds finches buntings tits and several kinds of warblers drawing near my eye was filled with plump smooth bodies and beadbright eyes set like jewels in a background of velvet green darting among the leaves of oak elm and chestnut carefully tended trees rooted in mulched pots set on the floor of the cage the cheerful racket of conversing birds was punctuated by the whir of wings and rustle of leaves as the inhabitants flitted and hopped about their business busy wee things are they no a deep pleasant voice spoke from behind me and i turned with a smile that froze on my face colum mackenzie shared the broad planes and high forehead of his brother dougal though the vital force that gave dougal an air of intimidation was here mellowed into something more welcoming though no less vibrant darker with dovegrey rather than hazel eyes colum gave that same impression of intensity of standing just slightly closer to you than was quite comfortable at the moment though my discomfort arose from the fact that the beautifully modeled head and long torso ended in shockingly bowed and stumpy legs the man who should have topped six feet came barely to my shoulder he kept his eyes on the birds tactfully allowing me a muchneeded moment to gain control of my features of course he must be used to the reactions of people meeting him for the first time it occurred to me glancing around the room to wonder how often he did meet new people this was clearly a sanctuary the selfconstructed world of a man to whom the outer world was unwelcome or unavailable i welcome ye mistress he said with a slight bow my name is colum ban campbell mackenzie laird of this castle i understand from my brother that he er encountered you some distance from here he kidnapped me if you want to know i said i would have liked to keep the conversation cordial but i wanted even more to get away from this castle and back to the hill with the standing stone circle whatever had happened to me the answer lay there if anywhere the lairds thick brows rose slightly and a smile curved the finecut lips well perhaps he agreed dougal is sometimes a wee bit impetuous well i waved a hand indicating gracious dismissal of the matter im prepared to admit that a misunderstanding might have arisen but i would greatly appreciate being returned to the place he took me from mm brows still raised colum gestured toward a chair i sat reluctantly and he nodded toward one of the attendants who vanished through the door ive sent for some refreshment mistress beauchamp was it i understand that my brother and his men found ye in er some apparent distress he seemed to be hiding a smile and i wondered just how my supposed state of undress had been described to him i took a deep breath now it was time for the explanation i had devised thinking this out i had recalled franks telling me during his officers training about a course he had taken in withstanding interrogation the basic principle insofar as i remembered it was to stick to the truth as much as humanly possible altering only those details that must be kept secret less chance the instructor explained of slipping up in the minor aspects of ones cover story well wed have to see how effective that was well yes i had been attacked you see he nodded face alight with interest aye attacked by whom tell the truth by english soldiers in particular by a man named randall the patrician face changed suddenly at the name though colum continued to look interested there was an increased intensity in the line of the mouth and a deepening of the creases that bracketed it clearly that name was familiar the mackenzie chief sat back a bit and steepled his fingers regarding me carefully over them ah he said tell me more so god help me i told him more i gave him in great detail the story of the confrontation between the scots and randalls men since he would be able to check that with dougal i told him the basic facts of my conversation with randall since i didnt know how much the man murtagh had overheard he nodded absorbedly paying close attention aye he said but how did you come to be there in that spot its far off the road to inverness you meant to take ship from there i suppose i nodded and took a deep breath now we entered perforce the realm of invention i wished i had paid closer attention to franks remarks on the subject of highwaymen but i would have to do my best i was a widowed lady of oxfordshire i replied true so far as it went traveling with a manservant en route to distant relatives in france that seemed safely remote we had been set upon by highwaymen and my servant had either been killed or run off i had myself dashed into the wood on my horse but been caught some distance from the road while i had succeeded in escaping from the bandits i had perforce to abandon my horse and all property thereon and while wandering in the woods i had run afoul of captain randall and his men i sat back a little pleased with the story simple neat true in all checkable details colums face expressed no more than a polite attention he was opening his mouth to ask me a question when there was a faint rustle at the doorway a man one of those i had noticed in the courtyard when we arrived stood there holding a small leather box in one hand the chief of clan mackenzie excused himself gracefully and left me studying the birds with the assurance that he would shortly return to continue our most interesting conversation no sooner had the door swung shut behind him than i was at the bookshelf running my hand along the leather bindings there were perhaps two dozen books on this shelf more on the opposite wall hurriedly i flipped the opening pages of each volume several had no publication dates those that did were all dated from to colum mackenzie obviously liked luxury but the rest of his room gave no particular indication that he was an antiquarian the bindings were new with no sign of cracking or foxed pages within quite beyond ordinary scruples by this time i shamelessly rifled the olivewood desk keeping an ear out for returning footsteps i found what i supposed i had been looking for in the central drawer a halffinished letter written in a flowing hand rendered no more legible by the eccentric spelling and total lack of punctuation the paper was fresh and clean and the ink crisply black legible or not the date at the top of the page sprang out at me as though written in letters of fire april when he returned a few moments later colum found his guest seated by the casement windows hands clasped decorously in her lap seated because my legs would no longer hold me up hands clasped to hide the trembling that had made it difficult for me to stuff the letter back into its resting place he had brought with him the tray of refreshments mugs of ale and fresh oatcakes spread with honey i nibbled sparingly at these my stomach was churning too vigorously to allow for any appetite after a brief apology for his absence he commiserated with me on my sad misfortune then he leaned back eyed me speculatively and asked but how is it mistress beauchamp that my brothers men found ye wandering about in your shift highwaymen would be reluctant to molest your person as theyd likely mean to hold ye for ransom and even with such things as ive heard of captain randall id be surprised to hear that an officer in the english army was in the habit of raping stray travelers oh i snapped well whatever youve heard about him i assure you hes entirely capable of it i had overlooked the detail of my clothing when planning my story and wondered at what point in our encounter the man murtagh had spotted the captain and myself ah well said colum possible i daresay the mans a bad reputation to be sure possible i said why dont you believe what ive told you for the mackenzie chieftains face was showing a faint but definite skepticism i did not say i didnt believe ye mistress he answered evenly but ive not held the leadership of a large clan for twentyodd years without learning not to swallow whole every tale im told well if you dont believe i am who i say who in bloody hell do you think i am i demanded he blinked taken aback by my language then the sharpcut features firmed again that he said remains to be seen in the meantime mistress youre a welcome guest at leoch he raised a hand in gracious dismissal and the everpresent attendant near the door came forward obviously to escort me back to my quarters colum didnt say the next words but he might as well have they hung in the air behind me as clearly as though spoken as i walked away until i find out who you really are part two castle leoch chapter colums hall the small boy mrs fitzgibbons had referred to as young alec came to fetch me to dinner this was held in a long narrow room outfitted with tables down the length of each wall supplied by a constant stream of servants issuing from archways at either end of the room laden with trays trenchers and jugs the rays of early summers late sunlight came through the high narrow windows sconces along the walls below held torches to be lighted as the daylight failed banners and tartans hung on the walls between the windows plaids and heraldry of all descriptions splotching the stones with color by contrast most of the people gathered below for dinner were dressed in serviceable shades of grey and brown or in the soft brown and green plaid of hunting kilts muted tones suited for hiding in the heather i could feel curious glances boring into my back as young alec led me toward the top of the room but most of the diners kept their eyes politely upon their plates there seemed little ceremony here people ate as they pleased helping themselves from the serving platters or taking their wooden plates to the far end of the room where two young boys turned a sheeps carcass on a spit in the enormous fireplace there were some forty people sat to eat and perhaps another ten to serve the air was loud with conversation most of it in gaelic colum was already seated at a table at the head of the room stunted legs tucked out of sight beneath the scarred oak he nodded graciously at my appearance and waved me to a seat on his left next to a plump and pretty redhaired woman he introduced as his wife letitia and this is my son hamish he said dropping a hand on the shoulder of a handsome redhaired lad of seven or eight who took his eyes off the waiting platter just long enough to acknowledge my presence with a quick nod i looked at the boy with interest he looked like all the other mackenzie males i had seen with the same broad flat cheekbones and deepset eyes in fact allowing for the difference in coloring he might be a smaller version of his uncle dougal who sat next to him the two teenage girls next to dougal who giggled and poked each other when introduced to me were his daughters margaret and eleanor dougal gave me a brief but friendly smile before snatching the platter out from under the reaching spoon of one of his daughters and shoving it toward me ha ye no manners lass he scolded guests first i rather hesitantly picked up the large horn spoon offered me i had not been sure what sort of food was likely to be offered and was somewhat relieved to find that this platter held a row of homely and completely familiar smoked herrings id never tried to eat a herring with a spoon but i saw nothing resembling a fork and dimly recalled that runcible spoons would not be in general use for quite a few years yet judging from the behavior of eaters at other tables when a spoon proved impracticable the everhandy dirk was employed for the slicing of meat and removal of bones lacking a dirk i resolved to chew cautiously and leaned forward to scoop up a herring only to find the deep blue eyes of young hamish fixed accusingly on me yeve not said grace yet he said severely small face screwed into a frown obviously he considered me a conscienceless heathen if not downright depraved er perhaps you would be so kind as to say it for me i ventured the cornflower eyes popped open in surprise but after a moments consideration he nodded and folded his hands in a businesslike fashion he glared round the table to insure that everyone was in a properly reverential attitude before bowing his own head satisfied he intoned some hae meat that canna eat and some could eat that want it we hae meat and we can eat and so may god be thankit amen looking up from my respectfully folded hands i caught colums eye and gave him a smile that acknowledged the sangfroid of his offspring he suppressed his own smile and nodded gravely at his son nicely said lad will ye hand round the bread conversation at table was limited to occasional requests for further food as everyone settled down to serious eating i found my own appetite rather lacking partly owing to the shock of my circumstances and partly to the fact that i really didnt care for herring when all was said and done the mutton was quite good though and the bread was delicious fresh and crusty with large dollops of fresh unsalted butter i hope mr mactavish is feeling better i offered during a momentary pause for breath i didnt see him when i came in mactavish letitias delicate brows tilted over round blue eyes i felt rather than saw dougal look up beside me young jamie he said briefly before returning his attention to the mutton bone in his hands jamie why whatever is the matter wi the lad her fullcheeked countenance creased with concern naught but a scratch my dear colum soothed he glanced across at his brother where is he though dougal i imagined perhaps that the dark eyes held a hint of suspicion his brother shrugged eyes still on his plate i sent him down to the stables to help auld alec wi the horses seemed the best place for him all things considered he raised his eyes to meet his brothers gaze or did ye have some other idea colum seemed dubious the stables aye well ye trust him so far dougal wiped a hand carelessly across his mouth and reached for a loaf of bread its yours to say colum if ye dinna agree wi my orders colums lips tightened briefly but he only said nay i reckon hell do well enough there before returning to his meal i had some doubts myself as to a stable being the proper place for a patient with a gunshot wound but was reluctant to offer an opinion in this company i resolved to seek out the young man in question in the morning just to assure myself that he was as suitably cared for as could be managed i refused the pudding and excused myself pleading tiredness which was in no way prevarication i was so exhausted that i scarcely paid attention when colum said goodnight to ye then mistress beauchamp ill send someone to bring ye to hall in the morning one of the servants seeing me groping my way along the corridor kindly lighted me to my chamber she touched her candle to the one on my table and a mellow light flickered over the massive stones of the wall giving me a moments feeling of entombment once she had left though i pulled the embroidered hanging away from the window and the feeling blew away with the inrush of cool air i tried to think about everything that had happened but my mind refused to consider anything but sleep i slid under the quilts blew out the candle and fell asleep watching the slow rise of the moon it was the massive mrs fitzgibbons who arrived again to wake me in the morning bearing what appeared to be the full array of toiletries available to a wellborn scottish lady lead combs to darken the eyebrows and lashes pots of powdered orrisroot and rice powder even a stick of what i assumed was kohl though i had never seen any and a delicate lidded porcelain cup of french rouge incised with a row of gilded swans mrs fitzgibbons also had a striped green overskirt and bodice of silk with yellow lisle stockings as a change from the homespun i had been provided with the day before whatever hall involved it seemed to be an occasion of some consequence i was tempted to insist on attending in my own clothes just to be contrary but the memory of fat ruperts response to my shift was sufficient to deter me besides i rather liked colum despite the fact that he apparently intended to keep me here for the foreseeable future well wed just see about that i thought as i did my best with the rouge dougal had said the young man i had doctored was in the stables hadnt he and stables presumably had horses upon which one could ride away i resolved to go looking for jamie mactavish as soon as hall was over with hall turned out to be just that the dining hall where i had eaten the night before now it was transformed though tables benches and stools pushed back against the walls the head table removed and replaced by a substantial carved chair of dark wood covered with what i assumed must be the mackenzie tartan a plaid of dark green and black with a faint red and white overcheck sprigs of holly decorated the walls and there were fresh rushes strewn on the stone flags a young piper was blowing up a set of small pipes behind the empty chair with numerous sighs and wheezes near him were what i assumed must be the intimate members of colums staff a thinfaced man in trews and smocked shirt who lounged against the wall a balding little man in a coat of fine brocade clearly a scribe of some sort as he was seated at a small table equipped with inkhorn quills and paper two brawny kilted men with the attitude of guards and to one side one of the largest men i have ever seen i stared at this giant with some awe coarse black hair grew far down on his forehead nearly meeting the beetling eyebrows similar mats covered the immense forearms exposed by the rolledup sleeves of his shirt unlike most of the men i had seen the giant did not seem to be armed save for a tiny knife he carried in his stockingtop i could barely make out the stubby hilt in the thickets of black curls that covered his legs above the gaily checked hose a broad leather belt circled what must be a fortyinch waist but carried neither dirk nor sword in spite of his size the man had an amiable expression and seemed to be joking with the thinfaced man who looked like a marionette in comparison with his huge conversant the piper suddenly began to play with a preliminary belch followed at once by an earsplitting screech that eventually settled down into something resembling a tune there were some thirty or forty people present all seeming somewhat betterdressed and groomed than the diners of the night before all heads turned to the lower end of the hall where after a pause for the music to build up steam colum entered followed at a few paces by his brother dougal both mackenzies were clearly dressed for ceremony in dark green kilts and wellcut coats colums of pale green and dougals of russet both with the plaid slung across their chests and secured at one shoulder by a large jeweled brooch colums black hair was loose today carefully oiled and curled upon his shoulders dougals was still clubbed back in a queue that nearly matched the russet satin of his coat colum walked slowly up the length of the hall nodding and smiling to faces on either side looking across the hall i could see another archway near where his chair was placed clearly he could have entered the hall by that doorway instead of the one at the far end of the room so it was deliberate this flaunting of his twisted legs and ungainly waddle on the long progress to his seat deliberate too the contrast with his tall straightbodied younger brother who looked neither to left nor right but walked straight behind colum to the wooden chair and took up his station standing close behind colum sat and waited for a moment then raised one hand the pipes wailing died away in a pitiful whine and hall began it quickly became apparent that this was the regular occasion on which the laird of castle leoch dispensed justice to his tacksmen and tenants hearing cases and settling disputes there was an agenda the balding scribe read out the names and the various parties came forward in their turn while some cases were presented in english most of the proceedings were held in gaelic i had already noticed that the language involved considerable eyerolling and footstamping for emphasis making it difficult to judge the seriousness of a case by the demeanor of the participants just as i had decided that one man a rather motheaten specimen with an enormous sporran made of an entire badger was accusing his neighbor of nothing less than murder arson and wifestealing colum raised his eyebrows and said something quick in gaelic that had both complainant and defendant clutching their sides with laughter wiping his eyes the complainant nodded at last and offered a hand to his opponent as the scribe scribbled busily quill scratching like a mouses feet i was fifth on the agenda a placement i thought carefully calculated to indicate to the assembled crowd the importance of my presence in the castle for my benefit english was spoken during my presentation mistress beauchamp will ye stand forth called the scribe urged forward by an unnecessary shove from mrs fitzgibbonss meaty hand i stumbled out into the clear space before colum and rather awkwardly curtsied as i had seen other females do the shoes i had been given did not distinguish between right foot and left being in either case only an oblong of formed leather which made graceful maneuvering difficult there was a stir of interest through the crowd as colum paid me the honor of getting up from his chair he offered me his hand which i took in order not to fall flat on my face rising from the curtsy mentally cursing the slippers i found myself staring at dougals chest as my captor it was apparently up to him to make formal application for my reception or captivity depending how you wanted to look at it i waited with some interest to see just how the brothers had decided to explain me sir began dougal bowing formally to colum we pray your indulgence and mercy with regard to a lady in need of succor and safe refuge mistress claire beauchamp an english lady of oxford finding herself set upon by highwaymen and her servant most traitorously killed fled into the forests of your lands where she was discovered and rescued by myself and my men we beg that castle leoch might offer this lady refuge until he paused and a cynical smile twisted his mouth her english connections may be apprised of her whereabouts and due provision made for her safe transport i didnt miss the emphasis laid on english and neither did anyone else in the hall i was sure so i was to be tolerated but held under suspicion had he said french i would have been considered a friendly or at worst neutral intrusion it might be more difficult than i had expected to get away from the castle colum bowed graciously to me and offered me the unlimited hospitality of his humble hearth or words to that effect i curtsied again with somewhat more success and retired to the ranks followed by curious but more or less friendly stares until this point the cases seemed to have been of interest chiefly to the parties involved the spectators had chatted quietly among themselves waiting their turns my own appearance had been met with an interested murmur of speculation and i thought approval but now there was an excited stir through the hall a burly man stepped forward into the clear space dragging a young girl by the hand she looked about sixteen with a pretty pouting face and long yellow hair tied back with blue ribbon she stumbled into the space and stood alone while the man behind her expostulated in gaelic waving his arms and occasionally pointing at her in illustration or accusation small murmurs ran through the crowd as he talked mrs fitzgibbons her bulk resting on a sturdy stool was craning forward with interest i leaned forward and whispered in her ear whats she done the huge dame replied without moving her lips or taking her eyes from the action her father accuses her of loose behavior consortin improperly wi young men against his orders muttered mistress fitzgibbons leaning her bulk backward on the stool her father wishes the mackenzie to have her punished for disobedience punished how i hissed as quietly as i could shhh in the center attention now focused on colum who was considering the girl and her father looking from one to the other he began to speak frowning he rapped his knuckles sharply on the arm of his chair and a shiver ran through the crowd hes decided whispered mrs fitzgibbons unnecessarily what he had decided was also clear the giant stirred for the first time unbuckling his leather belt in a leisurely manner the two guards took the terrified girl by the arms and turned her so that her back was to colum and her father she began to cry but made no appeal the crowd was watching with the sort of intent excitement that attends public executions and road accidents suddenly a gaelic voice from the back of the crowd rose audible over the shuffle and murmur heads turned to locate the speaker mrs fitzgibbons craned even rising on tiptoe to see i had no idea what had been said but i thought i recognized that voice deep but soft with a spiky way of clipping the final consonants the crowd parted and jamie mactavish came out into the clear space he inclined his head respectfully to the mackenzie then spoke some more whatever he said seemed to cause some controversy colum dougal the little scribe and the girls father all seemed to be getting into the act what is it i muttered to mrs fitz my patient was looking much better than when last seen though still a bit whitefaced i thought hed found a clean shirt somewhere the empty right sleeve had been folded and tucked into the waist of his kilt mrs fitz was watching the proceedings with great interest the lads offering to take the girls punishment for her she said absently peeking around a spectator in front of us what but hes injured surely they wont let him do something like that i spoke as quietly as i could under the hum of the crowd mrs fitz shook her head i dunno lass theyre arguin it now see tis allowable for a man o her own clan to offer for her but the lad is no a mackenzie hes not i was surprised having naively assumed that all the men in the group that had captured me came from castle leoch o course not said mrs fitz impatiently do ye no see his tartan of course i did once she had pointed it out while jamie also wore a hunting tartan in shades of green and brown the colors were different than that of the other men present it was a deeper brown almost a bark color with a faint blue stripe apparently dougals contribution was the deciding argument the knot of advisers dispersed and the crowd hushed falling back to wait the two guards released the girl who ran back into the crowd and jamie stepped forward to take her place between them i watched in horror as they moved to take his arms but he spoke in gaelic to the man with the strap and the two guards fell back amazingly a wide impudent grin lighted his face briefly stranger still there was a quick answering smile on the face of the giant what did he say i demanded of my interpreter he chooses fists rather than the strap a man may choose so though a woman may not fists i had no time to question further the executioner drew back a fist like a ham and drove it into jamies abdomen doubling him up and driving his breath out with a gasp the man waited for him to straighten up before moving in and administering a series of sharp jabs to the ribs and arms jamie made no effort to defend himself merely shifting his balance to remain upright in the face of the assault the next blow was to the face i winced and shut my eyes involuntarily as jamies head rocked back the executioner took his time between blows careful not to knock his victim down or strike too many times in one spot it was a scientific beating skillfully engineered to inflict bruising pain but not to disable or maim one of jamies eyes was swelling shut and he was breathing heavily but otherwise he didnt appear too badly off i was in an agony of apprehension lest one of the blows redamage the wounded shoulder my strapping job was still in place but it wouldnt hold for long against this sort of treatment how long was this going to go on the room was silent except for the smacking thud of flesh on flesh and an occasional soft grunt wee angusll stop when bloods drawn whispered mrs fitz apparently divining my unasked question usually when the nose is broken thats barbarous i hissed fiercely several people around us looked at me censoriously the executioner apparently now decided that the punishment had gone on for the prescribed length of time he drew back and let fly a massive blow jamie staggered and fell to his knees the two guards hurried forward to pull him to his feet and as he raised his head i could see blood welling from his battered mouth the crowd burst into a hum of relief and the executioner stepped back satisfied with the performance of his duty one guard held jamies arm supporting him as he shook his head to clear it the girl had disappeared jamie raised his head and looked directly at the towering executioner amazingly he smiled again as best he could the bleeding lips moved thank you he said with some difficulty and bowed formally to the bigger man before turning to go the attention of the crowd shifted back to the mackenzie and the next case before him i saw jamie leave the hall by the door in the opposite wall having more interest in him now than in the proceedings i took my leave of mrs fitzgibbons with a quick word and pushed my way across the hall to follow him i found him in a small side courtyard leaning against a wellhead and dabbing at his mouth with his shirttail here use this i said offering him a kerchief from my pocket unh he accepted it with a noise that i took for thanks a pale watery sun had come out by now and i looked the young man over carefully by its light a split lip and badly swollen eye seemed to be the chief injuries though there were marks along the jaw and neck that would be black bruises soon is your mouth cut inside too unhhuh he bent down and i pulled down his lower jaw gently turning down the lip to examine the inside there was a deep gash in the glistening cheek lining and a couple of small punctures in the pinkness of the inner lip blood mixed with saliva welled up and overflowed water he said with some difficulty blotting the bloody trickle that ran down his chin right luckily there was a bucket and horn cup on the rim of the well he rinsed his mouth and spat several times then splashed water over the rest of his face what did you do that for i asked curiously what he said straightening up and wiping his face on his sleeve he felt the split lip gingerly wincing slightly offer to take that girls punishment for her do you know her i felt a certain diffidence about asking but i really wanted to know what lay behind that quixotic gesture i ken who she is havena spoken to her though then why did you do it he shrugged a movement that also made him wince it would have shamed the lass to be beaten in hall easier for me easier i echoed incredulously looking at his smashed face he was probing his bruised ribs experimentally with his free hand but looked up and gave me a onesided grin aye shes verra young she would ha been shamed before everyone as knows her and it would take a long time to get over it im sore but no really damaged ill get over it in a day or two but why you i asked he looked as though he thought this an odd question why not me he said why not i wanted to say because you didnt know her she was nothing to you because you were already hurt because it takes something rather special in the way of guts to stand up in front of a crowd and let someone hit you in the face no matter what your motive well a musket ball through the trapezius might be considered a good reason i said dryly he looked amused fingering the area in question trapezius is it i didna know that och here ye are lad i see yeve found your healer already perhaps i wont be needed mrs fitzgibbons waddled through the narrow entrance to the courtyard squeezing a bit she held a tray with a few jars a large bowl and a clean linen towel i havent done anything but fetch some water i said i think hes not badly hurt but im not sure what we can do besides wash his face for him och now theres always somethin always somethin that can be done she said comfortably that eye now lad lets have a look at that jamie sat obligingly on the edge of the well turning his face toward her pudgy fingers pressed gently on the purple swelling leaving white depressions that faded quickly still bleedin under the skin leeches will help then she lifted the cover from the bowl revealing several small dark sluglike objects an inch or two long covered with a disagreeablelooking liquid scooping out two of them she pressed one to the flesh just under the brow bone and the other just below the eye see she explained to me once a bruise is set like leeches do ye no good but where ye ha a swellin like this as is still comin up that means the blood is flowin under the skin and leeches can pull it out i watched fascinated and disgusted doesnt that hurt i asked jamie he shook his head making the leeches bounce obscenely no feels a bit cold is all mrs fitz was busy with her jars and bottles too many folk misuses leeches she instructed me theyre verra helpful sometimes but ye must understand how when ye use em on an old bruise they just take healthy blood and it does the bruise no good also ye must be careful not to use too many at a time theyll weaken someone as is verra ill or has lost blood already i listened respectfully absorbing all this information though i sincerely hoped i would never be asked to make use of it now lad rinse your mouth wi this twill cleanse the cuts and ease the pain willowbark tea she explained in an aside to me wi a bit of ground orrisroot i nodded i recalled vaguely from a longago botany lecture hearing that willow bark in fact contained salicylic acid the active ingredient in aspirin wont the willow bark increase the chance of bleeding i asked mrs fitz nodded approvingly aye it do sometimes thats why ye follow it wi a good handful of st johns wort soaked in vinegar that stops bleedin if its gathered under a full moon and ground up well jamie obediently swilled his mouth with the astringent solution eyes watering at the sting of the aromatic vinegar the leeches were fully engorged by now swollen to four times their original size the dark wrinkled skins were now stretched and shiny they looked like rounded polished stones one leech dropped suddenly off bouncing to the ground at my feet mrs fitz scooped it up deftly bending easily despite her bulk and dropped it back in the bowl grasping the other leech delicately just behind the jaws she pulled gently making the head stretch ye dont want to pull too hard lass she said sometimes they burst i shuddered involuntarily at the idea but if theyre nearly full sometimes theyll come off easy if they dont just leave em be and theyll fall off by themselves the leech did in fact let go easily leaving a trickle of blood where it had been attached i blotted the tiny wound with the corner of a towel dipped in the vinegar solution to my surprise the leeches had worked the swelling was substantially reduced and the eye was at least partially open though the lid was still puffy mrs fitz examined it critically and decided against the use of another leech yell be a sight tomorrow lad and no mistake she said shaking her head but at least yell be able to see oot o that eye what ye want now is a wee bit o raw meat on it and a drop o broth wi ale in it for strengthenin purposes come along to the kitchen in a bit and ill find some for ye she scooped up her tray pausing for a moment what ye did was kindly meant lad laoghaire is my granddaughter ye ken ill thank ye for her though she had better thank ye herself if shes any manners at all she patted jamies cheek and padded heavily off i examined him carefully the archaic medical treatment had been surprisingly effective the eye was still somewhat swollen but only slightly discolored and the cut through the lip was now a clean bloodless line only slightly darker than the surrounding tissue how do you feel i asked fine i must have looked askance at this because he smiled still careful of his mouth its only bruises ye know ill have to thank ye again it seems this makes three times in three days youve doctored me yell be thinking im fair clumsy i touched a purple mark on his jaw not clumsy a little reckless perhaps a flutter of movement at the courtyard entrance caught my eye a flash of yellow and blue the girl named laoghaire hung back shyly seeing me i think someone wants to speak with you alone i said ill leave you the bandages on your shoulder can come off tomorrow though ill find you then aye thank ye again he squeezed my hand lightly in farewell i went out looking curiously at the girl as i passed she was even prettier close up with soft blue eyes and rosepetal skin she glowed as she looked at jamie i left the courtyard wondering whether in fact his gallant gesture had been quite so altruistic as i supposed next morning roused at daylight by the twittering of birds outside and people inside i dressed and found my way through the drafty corridors to the hall restored to its normal identity as a refectory enormous cauldrons of porridge were being dispensed together with bannocks baked on the hearth and spread with molasses the smell of steaming food was almost strong enough to lean against i felt still offbalance and confused but a hot breakfast heartened me enough to explore a bit finding mrs fitzgibbons up to her dimpled elbows in floured dough i announced that i wanted to find jamie in order to remove his bandages and inspect the healing of the gunshot wound she summoned one of her tiny minions with the wave of a massive whitesmeared hand young alec do ye run and find jamie the new horsebreaker tell im to come back wi ye to ha his shoulder seen to we shall be in the herb garden a sharp fingersnap sent the lad scampering out to locate my patient turning the kneading over to a maid mrs fitz rinsed her hands and turned to me it will take a while yet before theyre back would ye care for a look at the herb gardens it would seem yeve some knowledge of plants and if youve a mind to ye might lend a hand there in your spare moments the herb garden valuable repository of healing and flavors that it was was cradled in an inner courtyard large enough to allow for sun but sheltered from spring winds with its own wellhead rosemary bushes bordered the garden to the west chamomile to the south and a row of amaranth marked the north border with the castle wall itself forming the eastern edge an additional shelter from the prevailing winds i correctly identified the green spikes of late crocus and softleaved french sorrel springing out of the rich dark earth mrs fitz pointed out foxglove purslane and betony along with a few i did not recognize late spring was planting time the basket on mrs fitzs arm carried a profusion of garlic cloves the source of the summers crop the plump dame handed me the basket along with a digging stick for planting apparently i had lazed about the castle long enough until colum found some use for me mrs fitz could always find work for an idle hand here mdear do ye set em here along the south side between the thyme and foxglove she showed me how to divide the heads into individual buds without disturbing the tough casing then how to plant them it was simple enough just poke each clove into the ground blunt end down buried about an inch and a half below the surface she got up dusting her voluminous skirts keep back a few heads she advised me divide em and plant the buds single one here and one there all round the garden garlic keeps the wee bugs awa from the other plants onions and yarrow will do the same and pinch the dead marigold heads but keep them theyre useful numerous marigolds were scattered throughout the garden bursting into golden flower just then the small lad she had sent in search of jamie came up out of breath from the run he reported that the patient refused to leave his work he says panted the boy as e doesna hurt bad enough to need doctorin but thank ye for yer consairn mrs fitz shrugged at this not altogether reassuring message weel if he wont come he wont ye might go out to the paddock near noontide though lass if yeve a mind to he may not stop to be doctored but hell stop for food if i ken young men young alec here will come back for ye at noontide and guide ye to the paddock leaving me to plant the rest of the garlic mrs fitz sailed away like a galleon young alec bobbing in her wake i worked contentedly through the morning planting garlic pinching back dead flower heads digging out weeds and carrying on the gardeners neverending battle against snails slugs and similar pests here though the battle was waged barehanded with no assistance from chemical antipest compounds i was so absorbed in my work that i didnt notice the reappearance of young alec until he coughed politely to attract my attention not one to waste words he waited barely long enough for me to rise and dust my skirt before vanishing through the courtyard gate the paddock to which he led me was some way from the stables in a grassy meadow three young horses frolicked gaily in the meadow nearby another a cleanlooking young bay mare was tethered to the paddock fence with a light blanket thrown across her back jamie was sidling cautiously up along one side of the mare who was watching his approach with considerable suspicion he placed his one free arm lightly on her back talking softly ready to pull back if the mare objected she rolled her eyes and snorted but didnt move moving slowly he leaned across the blanket still muttering to the mare and very gradually rested his weight on her back she reared slightly and shuffled but he persisted raising his voice just a trifle just then the mare turned her head and saw me and the boy approaching scenting some threat she reared whinnying and swung to face us crushing jamie against the paddock fence snorting and bucking she leapt and kicked against the restraining tether jamie rolled under the fence out of the way of the flailing hooves he rose painfully to his feet swearing in gaelic and turned to see what had caused this setback to his work when he saw who it was his thunderous expression changed at once to one of courteous welcome though i gathered our appearance was still not as opportune as might have been wished the basket of lunch thoughtfully provided by mrs fitz who did in fact know young men did a good deal to restore his temper ahh settle then ye blasted beastie he remarked to the mare still snorting and dancing on her tether dismissing young alec with a friendly cuff he retrieved the mares fallen blanket and shaking off the dust of the paddock he gallantly spread it for me to sit on i tactfully avoided any reference to the recent contretemps with the mare instead pouring ale and offering chunks of bread and cheese he ate with a singleminded concentration that reminded me of his absence from the dining hall the two nights before slept through it he said when i asked him where he had been i went to sleep directly i left ye at the castle and didna wake til dawn yesterday i worked a bit yesterday after hall then sat down on a bale of hay to rest a bit before dinner he laughed woke up this morning still sitting there wi a horse nibbling at my ear i thought the rest had done him good the bruises from yesterdays beating were dark but the skin around them had a good healthy color and certainly he had a good appetite i watched him polish off the last of the meal tidily dabbing stray crumbs from his shirt with a moistened fingertip and popping them into his mouth youve a healthy appetite i said laughing i think youd eat grass if there was nothing else i have he said in all seriousness it doesna taste bad but its no verra filling i was startled then thought he must be teasing me when i asked winter year before last i was livin rough ye know in the woods with the with a group of lads raidin over the border wed had poor luck for a week and more and no food amongst us left to speak of wed get a bit of parritch now and then from a crofters cottage but those folk are so poor themselves theres seldom anything to spare theyll always find something to give a stranger mind but twenty strangers is a bit much even for a highlanders hospitality he grinned suddenly have ye heard well no ye wouldna i was goin to say had ye heard the grace they say in the crofts no how does it go he shook his hair out of his eyes and recited hurley hurley round the table eat as muckle as yere able eat muckle pooch nane hurley hurley amen pooch nane i said diverted he patted the sporran on his belt put it in your belly not your bag he explained he reached out for one of the longbladed grasses and pulled it smoothly from its sheath he rolled it slowly between his palms making the floppy grainheads fly out from the stem it was a late winter then and mild which was lucky or wed not have lasted we could usually snare a few rabbits ate them raw sometimes if we couldna risk a fire and once in a while some venison but thered been no game for days this time im talkin of square white teeth crunched down on the grass stem i plucked a stem myself and nibbled the end it was sweet and faintly acid but there was only an inch or so of stem tender enough to eat hardly much nourishment there tossing the halfeaten stalk away jamie plucked another and went on with his story there was a light snow a few days before just a crust under the trees and mud everywhere else i was looking for fungas ye know the big orange things that grow on the trees low down sometimes and put my foot through a rind of snow into a patch of grass growing in an open spot between the trees reckon a little sun got in there sometimes usually the deer find those patches they paw away the snow and eat the grass down to the roots they hadnt found this one yet and i thought if they managed the winter that way why not me i was hungry enough id ha boiled my boots and eaten them did i not need them to walk in so i ate the grass down to the roots like the deer do how long had you been without food i asked fascinated and appalled three days wi nothing a week with naught more than drammach a handful of oats and a little milk aye he said reminiscently viewing the grass stalk in his hand winter grass is tough and its sour not like this but i didna pay it much mind he grinned at me suddenly i didna pay much mind to the thought that a deers got four stomachs either while i had but one gave me terrible cramps and i had wind for days one of the older men told me later that if youre going to eat grass ye boil it first but i didna know that at the time wouldnt ha mattered i was too hungry to wait he scrambled to his feet leaning down to give me a hand up best get back to work thank ye for the food lass he handed me the basket and headed for the horsesheds sun glinting on his hair as though on a trove of gold and copper coins i made my way slowly back to the castle thinking about men who lived in cold mud and ate grass it didnt occur to me until i had reached the courtyard that i had forgotten all about his shoulder chapter davie beatons closet to my surprise one of colums kilted menatarms was waiting for me near the gate when i returned to the castle himself would be obliged i was told if i would wait upon him in his chambers the long casements were open in the lairds private sanctum and the wind swept through the branches of the captive trees with a rush and a murmur that gave the illusion of being outdoors the laird himself was writing at his desk when i entered but stopped at once and rose to greet me after a few words of inquiry as to my health and wellbeing he led me over to the cages against the wall where we admired the tiny inhabitants as they chirped and hopped through the foliage excited by the wind dougal and mrs fitz both say as youve quite some skill as a healer colum remarked conversationally extending a finger through the mesh of the cage well accustomed to this apparently a small grey bunting swooped down and made a neat landing tiny claws gripping the finger and wings slightly spread to keep its balance he stroked its head gently with the callused forefinger of the other hand i saw the thickened skin around the nail and wondered at it it hardly seemed likely that he did much manual labor i shrugged it doesnt take that much skill to dress a superficial wound he smiled maybe not but it takes a bit of skill to do it in the pitchblack dark by the side of a road eh and mrs fitz says youve mended one of her wee lads fingers as was broken and bound up a kitchenmaids scalded arm this morning as well thats nothing very difficult either i replied wondering what he was getting at he gestured to one of the attendants who quickly fetched a small bowl from one of the drawers of the secretary removing the lid colum began scattering seed from it through the mesh of the cage the tiny birds popped down from the branches like so many cricket balls bouncing on a pitch and the bunting flew down to join its fellows on the ground no connections to clan beaton have ye he asked i remembered mrs fitzgibbons asking at our first meeting are ye a charmer then a beaton none what have the clan beaton to do with medical treatment colum eyed me in surprise youve not heard of them the healers of clan beaton are famous through the highlands traveling healers many of them we had one here for a time in fact had one what happened to him i asked he died colum responded matteroffactly caught a fever and it carried him off within a week weve not had a healer since save mrs fitz she seems very competent i said thinking of her efficient treatment of the young man jamies injuries thinking of that made me think of what had caused them and i felt a wave of resentment toward colum resentment and caution as well this man i reminded myself was law jury and judge to the people in his domain and clearly accustomed to having things his own way he nodded still intent on the birds he scattered the rest of the seed favoring a latecoming greyblue warbler with the last handful oh aye shes quite a hand with such matters but shes more than enough to take care of already running the whole castle and everyone in it including me he said with a sudden charming grin i was wondering he said taking swift advantage of my answering smile seeing as how youve not a great deal to occupy your time at present you might think of having a look at the things davie beaton left behind him you might know the uses of a few of his medicines and such well i suppose so why not in fact i was becoming slightly bored with the round between garden stillroom and kitchen i was curious to see what the late mr beaton had considered useful in the way of paraphernalia angus or i could show the lady down sir the attendant suggested respectfully dont trouble yourself john colum said gesturing the man politely away ill show mistress beauchamp myself his progress down the stair was slow and obviously painful just as obviously he didnt wish for help and i offered none the surgery of the late beaton proved to be in a remote corner of the castle tucked out of sight behind the kitchens it was in close proximity to nothing save the graveyard in which its late proprietor now rested in the outer wall of the castle the narrow dark room boasted only one of the tiny slit windows set high in the wall so that a flat plane of sunlight knifed through the air separating the darkness of the high vaulted ceiling from the deeper gloom of the floor below peering past colum into the dim recesses of the room i made out a tall cabinet equipped with dozens of tiny drawers each with a label in curlicue script jars boxes and vials of all shapes and sizes were neatly stacked on the shelves above a counter where the late beaton evidently had been in the habit of mixing medicines judging from the residue of stains and a crusted mortar that rested there colum went ahead of me into the room shimmering motes disturbed by his entry swirled upward into the bar of sunlight like dust raised from the breaking of a tomb he stood for a moment letting his eyes grow used to the dimness then walked forward slowly looking from side to side i thought perhaps it was the first time he had ever been in this room watching his halting progress as he traversed the narrow room i said you know massage can help a bit with the pain i mean i caught a flash from the grey eyes and wished for a moment that i hadnt spoken but the spark disappeared almost at once replaced by his usual expression of courteous attention it needs to be done forcefully i said at the base of the spine especially i know he said angus mhor does it for me at night he paused fingering one of the vials it would seem you do know a bit about healing then a bit i was cautious hoping he didnt mean to test me by asking what the assorted medicaments were used for the label on the vial he was holding said purles ovis anyones guess what that was luckily he put the vial back and drew a finger gingerly through the dust on a large chest near the wall been some time since anyones been here he said ill have mrs fitz send some of her wee lassies along to clean up a bit shall i i opened a cupboard door and coughed at the resulting cloud of dust perhaps youd better i agreed there was a book on the lower shelf of the cupboard a fat volume bound in blue leather lifting it i discovered a smaller book beneath this one bound cheaply in black cloth much worn along the edges this second book proved to be beatons daily log book in which he had tidily recorded the names of his patients details of their ailments and the course of treatment prescribed a methodical man i thought with approval one entry read nd february ad sarah graham mackenzie injury to thumb by reason of catching the appendage on edge of spinning reel application of boiled pennyroyal followed by poultice of one part each yarrow st johnswort ground slaters and mouseear mixed in a base of fine clay slaters mouseear some of the herbs on the shelves no doubt did sarah mackenzies thumb heal well i asked colum shutting the book sarah ah he said thoughtfully no i believe not really i wonder what happened i said perhaps i could take a look at it later he shook his head and i thought i caught a glimpse of grim amusement showing in the lines of his full curved lips why not i asked has she left the castle then ye might say so he answered the amusement was now apparent shes dead i stared at him as he picked his way across the dusty stone floor toward the doorway its to be hoped youll do somewhat better as a healer than the late davie beaton mrs beauchamp he said he turned and paused at the door regarding me sardonically the sunbeam held him as though in a spotlight ye could hardly do worse he said and vanished into the dark i wandered up and down the narrow little room looking at everything likely most of it was rubbish but there might be a few useful things to be salvaged i pulled out one of the tiny drawers in the apothecarys chest letting loose a gust of camphor well that was useful right enough i pushed the drawer in again and rubbed my dusty fingers on my skirt perhaps i should wait until mrs fitzs merry maids had had a chance to clean the place before i continued my investigations i peered out into the corridor deserted no noises either but i was not naive enough to assume that no one was nearby whether by order or by tact they were fairly subtle about it but i knew that i was being watched when i went to the garden someone went with me when i climbed the stair to my room i would see someone casually glance up from the foot to see which way i turned and as we had ridden in i hadnt failed to note the armed guards sheltering under the overhang from the rain no i definitely wasnt going to be allowed simply to walk out of here let alone be provided with transport and means to leave i sighed at least i was alone for the moment and solitude was something i very much wanted at least for a little i had tried repeatedly to think about everything that had happened to me since i stepped through the standing stone but things moved so rapidly around this place that i had hardly had a moment to myself when i wasnt asleep apparently i had one now though i pulled the dusty chest away from the wall and sat down leaning back against the stones they were very solid i reached back and rested my palms against them thinking about the stone circle trying to recall every tiny detail of what had happened the screaming stones were the last thing i could truly say i remembered and even that i had doubts about the screaming had kept up all the time it was possible i thought that the noise came not from the stones themselves but from whatever i had stepped into were the stones a door of some kind and into what did they open there simply were no words for whatever it was a crack through time i supposed because clearly i had been then and i was now and the stones were the only connection and the sounds they had been overwhelming but looking back from a short distance i thought they were very similar to the sounds of battle the field hospital at which i was stationed had been shelled three times even knowing that the flimsy walls of our temporary structures would not protect us still doctors nurses and orderlies had all dashed inside at the first alarm huddling together for courage courage is in very short supply when there are mortar shells screaming overhead and bombs going off next door and the kind of terror i had felt then was the closest thing to what i had felt in the stone i now realized that i did recall some things about the actual trip through the stone very minor things i remembered a sensation of physical struggle as though i were caught in a current of some kind yes i had deliberately fought against it whatever it was there were images in the current too i thought not pictures exactly more like incomplete thoughts some were terrifying and i had fought away from them as i well as i passed had i fought toward others i had some consciousness of fighting toward a surface of some kind had i actually chosen to come to this particular time because it offered some sort of haven from that whirling maelstrom i shook my head i could find no answers by thinking about it nothing was clear except the fact that i would have go back to the standing stones mistress a soft scottish voice from the doorway made me look up two girls perhaps sixteen or seventeen hung back shyly in the corridor they were roughly dressed with clogs on their feet and homespun scarves covering their hair the one who had spoken carried a brush and several folded cloths while her companion held a steaming pail mrs fitzs lasses here to clean the surgery well no be disturbin ye mistress one asked anxiously no no i assured them i was about to leave anyway youve missed the noon meal the other informed me but mrs fitz said to tell ye as theres food for ye in the kitchens whenever ye like to go there i glanced out the window at the end of the corridor the sun was in fact a little past the zenith and i became conscious of increasing hunger pangs i smiled at the girls i might just do that thank you i brought lunch to the fields again fearing that jamie might get nothing to eat until dinner otherwise seated on the grass watching him eat i asked him why he had been living in the rough raiding cattle and thieving over the border i had seen enough by now both of the folk that came and went from the nearby village and of the castle dwellers to be able to tell that jamie was both higher born and much better educated than most it seemed likely that he came from a fairly wealthy family judging from the brief description he had given me of their farm estate why was he so far from home im an outlaw he said as though surprised that i didnt know the english have a price of ten pounds sterling on my head not quite so much as a highwayman he said deprecatingly but a bit more than a pickpocket just for obstruction i said unbelievingly ten pounds sterling here was half the yearly income of a small farm i couldnt imagine a single escaped prisoner was worth that much to the english government och no murder i choked on a mouthful of breadandpickle jamie pounded me helpfully on the back until i could speak again eyes watering i asked whwho did you kkill he shrugged well its a bit odd i didna actually kill the man whose murder im outlawed for mind ye ive done for a few other redcoats along the way so i suppose its not unjust he paused and shifted his shoulders as though rubbing against some invisible wall i had noticed him do it before on my first morning in the castle when i had doctored him and seen the marks on his back it was at fort william i could hardly move for a day or two after id been flogged the second time and then i had fever from the wounds once i could stand again though some friends made shift to get me out of the camp by means id best not go into anyhow there was some ruckus as we left and an english sergeantmajor was shot by coincidence it was the man that gave me the first flogging id not ha shot him though i had nothing personal against him and i was too weak to do more than hang onto the horse in any case the wide mouth tightened and thinned though had it been captain randall i expect id ha made the effort he eased his shoulders again stretching the rough linen shirt taut across his back and shrugged there it is though thats one reason i do not go far from the castle alone this far into the highlands theres little chance of running into an english patrol but they do come over the border quite often and then theres the watch though theyll not come near the castle either colums not much need of their services having his own men to hand he smiled running a hand through his bright cropped hair til it stood on end like porcupine quills im no precisely inconspicuous ye ken i doubt theres informers in the castle itself but there might be a few here and there about the countryside as would be glad enough to earn a few pence by letting the english know where i was did they know i was a wanted man he smiled at me yell have gathered the names not mactavish does the laird know that im an outlaw oh aye colum knows most people through this part of the highlands likely know that what happened at fort william caused quite a bit of stir at the time and news travels fast here what they wont know is that jamie mactavish is the man thats wanted provided nobody that knows me by my own name sees me his hair was still sticking up absurdly i had a sudden impulse to smooth it for him but resisted why do you wear your hair cropped i asked suddenly then blushed im sorry its none of my business i only wondered since most of the other men ive seen here wear it long he flattened the spiky licks looking a bit selfconscious i used to wear mine long as well its short now because the monks had to shave the back of my head and its had but a few months to grow again he bent forward at the waist inviting me to inspect the back of his head see there across the back i could certainly feel it and see it as well when i spread the thick hair aside a sixinch weal of freshly healed scar tissue still pink and slightly raised i pressed gently along its length cleanly healed and a nice neat job by whoever had stitched it a wound like that must have gaped and bled considerably do you have headaches i asked professionally he sat up smoothing the hair down over the wound he nodded sometimes though none so bad as it was i was blind for a month or so after it happened and my head ached like fury all the time the headache started to go away when my sight came back he blinked several times as though testing his vision fades a bit sometimes he explained if im verra tired things get blurry round the edges its a wonder it didnt kill you i said you must have a good thick skull on you that i have solid bone according to my sister we both laughed how did it happen i asked he frowned and a look of uncertainty came over his face weel theres just the question he answered slowly i dinna remember anything about it i was down near carryarick pass with a few lads from loch laggan last i knew i was pushing my way uphill through a wee thicket i remember pricking my hand on a hollybush and thinking the blood drops looked just like the berries and the next thing i remember is waking in france in the abbey of sainte anne de beaupré with my head throbbing like a drum and someone i couldnt see giving me something cool to drink he rubbed the back of his head as though it ached yet sometimes i think i remember little bits of things a lamp over my head swinging back and forth a sort of sweet oily taste on my lips people saying things to me but i do not know if any of its real i know the monks gave me opium and i dreamed nearly all the time he pressed his fingers flat over closed eyelids there was one dream i had over and over tree roots growing inside my head big gnarled things growing and swelling pushing out through my eyes thrusting down my throat to choke me it went on and on with the roots twisting and curling and getting bigger all the time finally theyd get big enough to burst my skull and id wake hearing the sound of the bones popping apart he grimaced sort of a juicy cracking noise like gunshots under water ugh a shadow fell suddenly over us and a stout boot shot out and nudged jamie in the ribs idle young bastard the newcomer said without heat stuffin yerself while the horses run wild and whens that filly goin to be broke hey lad none the sooner for my starving myself alec jamie replied meanwhile have a bit theres plenty he reached a chunk of cheese up to a hand knotted with arthritis the fingers permanently curled in a halfgrip slowly closed on the cheese as their owner sank down on the grass with unexpectedly courtly manners jamie introduced the visitor alec mcmahon mackenzie master of horse of castle leoch a squat figure in leather breeks and rough shirt the master of horse had an air of authority sufficient i thought to quell the most recalcitrant stallion an eye like mars to threaten or command the quotation sprang at once to mind a single eye it was the other being covered with a black cloth patch as if to make up for the loss his eyebrows sprouted profusely from a central point sporting long grey hairs like insects antennae that waved threateningly from the basic brown tufts after an initial nod of acknowledgment old alec for so jamie referred to him no doubt to distinguish him from the young alec who had been my guide ignored me dividing his attention instead between the food and the three young horses switching their tails in the meadow below i rather lost interest during a long discussion involving the parentage of several no doubt distinguished horses not among those present details of breeding records of the entire stable for several years and a number of incomprehensible points of equine conformation dealing with hocks withers shoulders and other items of anatomy since the only points i noticed on a horse were nose tail and ears the subtleties were lost on me i leaned back on my elbows and basked in the warming spring sun there was a curious peace in this day a sense of things working quietly in their proper courses nothing minding the upsets and turmoils of human concerns perhaps it was the peace that one always finds outdoors far enough away from buildings and clatter maybe it was the result of gardening that quiet sense of pleasure in touching growing things the satisfaction of helping them thrive perhaps just the relief of finally having found work to do rather than rattling around the castle feeling out of place conspicuous as an inkblot on parchment in spite of the fact that i took no part in the horsey conversation i didnt feel out of place here at all old alec acted as though i were merely a part of the landscape and while jamie cast an occasional glance my way he too gradually ignored me as their conversation segued into the sliding rhythms of gaelic sure sign of a scots emotional involvement in his subject matter since i gathered no sense from the talk it was as soothing as listening to bees humming in the heather blossoms oddly contented and drowsy i pushed away all thoughts of colums suspicions my own predicament and other disturbing ideas sufficient unto the day i thought sleepily picking up the biblical quotation from some recess of memory it may have been the chill from a passing cloud or the changed tone of the mens conversation that woke me sometime later the talk had switched back to english and the tone was serious no longer the meandering chat of the horseobsessed its no but a week til the gathering laddie alec was saying have ye made up your mind what youll do then there was a long sigh from jamie no alec that i havena sometimes i think one way sometimes the other granted that its good here working wi the beasts and with you there was a smile somewhere in the young mans voice which disappeared as he went on and colums promised me to well youll not know about that but kiss the iron and change my name to mackenzie and forswear all im born to nay i canna make up my mind to it stubborn as your da ye are remarked alec though the words held a tone of grudging approval youve the look of him about ye sometimes for all youre tall and fair as your mothers folk knew him did ye jamie sounded interested oh a bit and heard more ive been here at leoch since before your parents wed ye ken and to hear dougal and colum speak of black brian yed think he was the deil himself if not worse and your ma the virgin mary swept awa to the bad place by him jamie laughed and im like him am i ye are and all that laddie aye i see why itd stick in your craw to be colums man weel enough but theres considerations the other way no if it comes to fighting for the stuarts say and dougal has his way come out on the right side in that fight laddie and youll ha your land back and more besides whatever colum does jamie replied with what i had come to think of as a scottish noise that indeterminate sound made low in the throat that can be interpreted to mean almost anything this particular noise seemed to indicate some doubt as to the likelihood of such a desirable outcome aye he said and if dougal doesna get his way then what or if the fight goes against the house of stuart alec made a guttural sound of his own then you stay here laddie be master of horse in my place ill not last so much longer and theres no better hand ive seen wi a horse jamies modest grunt indicated appreciation of the compliment the older man went on disregarding such interruptions the mackenzies are kin to ye too its not a matter of forswearing your blood and theres other considerations too his voice took on a teasing note like mistress laoghaire perhaps he got another noise in response this one indicating embarrassment and dismissal hey now lad a young feller doesna let himself be beaten for the sake of a lass he cares nothin for and ye know her father will no let her wed outside the clan she was verra young alec and i felt sorry for her said jamie defensively theres nothin more to it than that this time it was alec who made the scottish noise a guttural snort full of derisory disbelief tell that one to the barn door laddie its no more brains than to believe ye weel even if its no laoghaire and ye could do a deal worse mark me yed be a better prospect for marriage did ye ha a bit of money and a future as ye would if yere next master ye could take yer choice of the lasses if one doesna choose you first alec snorted with the halfchoked mirth of a man who seldom laughs flies round a honeypot would be nothin to it lad penniless and nameless as ye are now the lasses still sigh after ye ive seen em more snorting even this sassenach wench can no keep away from ye and her a new widow wishing to prevent what promised to be a series of increasingly distasteful personal remarks i decided it was time to be officially awake stretching and yawning i sat up ostentatiously rubbing my eyes to avoid looking at either of the speakers mmmm i seem to have fallen asleep i said blinking prettily at them jamie rather red around the ears was taking an exaggerated interest in packing up the remains of the picnic old alec stared down at me apparently taking notice of me for the first time interested in horses are ye lass he demanded i could hardly say no under the circumstances agreeing that horses were most interesting i was treated to a detailed exegesis on the filly in the paddock now standing drowsily at rest tail twitching for the occasional fly yere welcome to come and watch any time lass alec concluded so long as ye dinna get so close ye distract the horses they need to work ye ken this was plainly intended as a dismissal but i stood my ground remembering my original purpose in coming here yes ill be careful next time i promised but before i go back to the castle i wanted to check jamies shoulder and take the dressings off alec nodded slowly but to my surprise it was jamie who refused my attentions turning away to go back to the paddock ah itll wait awhile lass he said looking away theres much to be done yet today perhaps later after supper hey this seemed very odd he hadnt been in any hurry to return to work earlier but i could hardly force him to submit to my ministrations if he didnt want to shrugging i agreed to meet him after supper and turned uphill to go back to the castle as i made my way back up the hill i considered the shape of the scar on jamies head it wasnt a straight line as might be made by an english broadsword the wound was curved as though made by a blade with a definite bend a blade like a lochaber ax but so far as i knew the murderous axes had been no were i corrected myself carried only by clansmen it was only as i walked away that it occurred to me for a young man on the run with unknown enemies jamie had been remarkably confiding to a stranger leaving the picnic basket in the kitchens i returned to the late beatons surgery now dustless and pristine after a visitation by mrs fitzs energetic assistants even the dozens of glass vials in the cupboard gleamed in the dim light from the window the cupboard seemed a good place to start with an inventory of the herbs and medicaments already on hand i had spent a few moments the night before before sleep overcame me thumbing through the blue leatherbound book i had taken from the surgery this proved to be the physicians guide and handbook a listing of recipes for the treatment of assorted symptoms and diseases the ingredients for which were apparently displayed before me the book was divided into several sections centauries vomitories and electuaries troches and lodochs assorted plasters and their virtus decoctions and theriacs and a quite extensive section ominously headed with the single word purges reading through a few of the recipes the reason for the late davie beatons lack of success with his patients became apparent for headache read one entry take ye one ball of horse dunge this to be carefully dried pounded to powder and the whole drunk stirred into hot ale for convulsions in children five leeches to be applied behind the ear and a few pages later decoctions made of the roots of celandine turmeric and juice of slaters cannot but be of great service in a case of jaundice i closed the book marveling at the large number of the late doctors patients who according to his meticulous log had not only survived the treatment meted out to them but actually recovered from their original ailments there was a large brown glass jar in the front containing several suspiciouslooking balls and in view of beatons recipes i had a good idea what it might be turning it around i triumphantly read the handlettered label dunge of horses reflecting that such a substance likely didnt improve much with keeping i gingerly set the jar aside without opening it subsequent investigation proved purles ovis to be a latinate version of a similar substance this time from sheep mouseear also proved to be animal in nature rather than herbal i pushed aside the vial of tiny pinkish dried ears with a small shudder i had been wondering about the slaters spelt variously as slatters sclaters and slatears which seemed to be an important ingredient in a number of medicines so i was pleased to see a clear corkstoppered vial with this name on the label the vial was about halffull of what appeared to be small grey pills these were no more than a quarterinch in diameter and so perfectly round that i marveled at beatons dispensing skill i brought the vial up close to my face wondering at its lightness then i saw the fine striations across each pill and the microscopic legs folded into the central crease i hastily set the vial down wiping my hand on my apron and made another entry in the mental list i had been compiling for slaters read woodlice there were a number of more or less harmless substances in beatons jars as well as several containing dried herbs or extractions that might actually be helpful i found some of the orrisroot powder and aromatic vinegar that mrs fitz had used to treat jamie mactavishs injuries also angelica wormwood rosemary and something labeled stinking arag i opened this one cautiously but it proved to be nothing more than the tender tips of fir branches and a pleasant balsamic fragrance floated out of the unsealed bottle i left the bottle open and set it on the table to perfume the air in the dark little room as i went on with my inventory i discarded jars of dried snails oil of earthworms which appeared to be exactly that vinum millepedatum millipedes these crushed to pieces and soaked in wine powder of eygyptiane mummie an indeterminatelooking dust whose origin i thought more likely a silty streambank than a pharaohs tomb pigeons blood ant eggs a number of dried toads painstakingly packed in moss and human skull powdered whose i wondered it took most of the afternoon to finish my inspections of the cupboard and multidrawered cabinet when i had finished there was a great heap of discarded bottles boxes and flasks set outside the door of the surgery for disposal and a much smaller collection of possibly useful items stowed back into the cupboard i had considered a large packet of cobwebs for some time hesitating between the piles both beatons guide and my own dim memories of folk medicine held that spiders web was efficacious in dressing wounds while my own inclination was to consider such usage unhygienic in the extreme my experience with linen bandages by the roadside had shown me the desirability of having something with adhesive as well as absorbent properties for dressings at last i set the cobwebs back in the cupboard resolving to see whether there might be a way of sterilizing them not boiling i thought maybe steam would cleanse them without destroying the stickiness i rubbed my hands against my apron considering i had inventoried almost everything now except the wooden chest against the wall i flung back the lid and recoiled at once from the stench that gusted out the chest was the repository of the surgical side of beatons practice within were a number of sinisterlooking saws knives chisels and other tools looking more suited to building construction than to use on delicate human tissues the stench apparently derived from the fact that davie beaton had seen no particular benefit to cleaning his instruments between uses i grimaced in distaste at the sight of the dark stains on some of the blades and slammed shut the lid i dragged the chest toward the door intending to tell mrs fitz that the instruments once safely boiled should be distributed to the castle carpenter if there were such a personage a stir behind alerted me in time to avoid crashing into the person who had just come in i turned to see two young men one supporting the other who was hopping on one foot the lame foot was bound up in an untidy bundle of rags stained with fresh blood i glanced around then gestured at the chest for lack of anything else sit down i said apparently the new physician of castle leoch was now in practice chapter an evenings entertainment i lay on my bed feeling altogether exhausted oddly enough i had quite enjoyed the rummage through the memorabilia of the late beaton and treating those few patients with however meager a resource had made me feel truly solid and useful once more feeling flesh and bone beneath my fingers taking pulses inspecting tongues and eyeballs all the familiar routine had done much to settle the feeling of hollow panic that had been with me since my fall through the rock however strange my circumstances and however out of place i might be it was somehow very comforting to realize that these were truly other people warmfleshed and hairy with hearts that could be felt beating and lungs that breathed audibly badsmelling louseridden and filthy some of them but that was nothing new to me certainly no worse than conditions in a field hospital and the injuries were so far reassuringly minor it was immensely satisfying to be able once again to relieve a pain reset a joint repair damage to take responsibility for the welfare of others made me feel less victimized by the whims of whatever impossible fate had brought me here and i was grateful to colum for suggesting it colum mackenzie now there was a strange man a cultured man courteous to a fault and thoughtful as well with a reserve that all but hid the steely core within the steel was much more evident in his brother dougal a warrior born that one and yet to see them together it was clear which was the stronger colum was a chieftain twisted legs and all toulouselautrec syndrome i had never seen a case before but i had heard it described named for its most famous sufferer who did not yet exist i reminded myself it was a degenerative disease of bone and connective tissue victims often appeared normal if sickly until their early teens when the long bones of the legs under the stress of bearing a body upright began to crumble and collapse upon themselves the pasty skin with its premature wrinkling was another outward effect of the poor circulation that characterized the disease likewise the dryness and pronounced callusing of fingers and toes that i had already noticed as the legs twisted and bowed the spine was put under stress and often twisted as well causing immense discomfort to the victim i mentally read back the textbook description to myself idly smoothing out the tangles of my hair with my fingers low whitecell count increased susceptibility to infection liable to early arthritis because of the poor circulation and the degeneration of connective tissue victims were invariably sterile and often impotent as well i stopped suddenly thinking of hamish my son colum had said proudly introducing the boy mmm i thought to myself perhaps not impotent then or perhaps so but rather fortunate for letitia that so many of the mackenzie males resembled each other to such a marked degree i was disturbed in these interesting ruminations by a sudden knock on the door one of the ubiquitous small boys stood without bearing an invitation from colum himself there was to be singing in the hall he said and the mackenzie would be honored by my presence if i cared to come down i was curious to see colum again in light of my recent speculations so with a quick glance in the looking glass and a futile smoothing of my hair i shut the door behind me and followed my escort through the cold and winding corridors the hall looked different at night quite festive with pine torches crackling all along the walls popping with an occasional blue flare of turpentine the huge fireplace with its multiple spits and cauldrons had diminished its activity since the frenzy of supper now only the one large fire burned on the hearth sustained by two huge slowburning logs and the spits were folded back into the cavernous chimney the tables and benches were still there but pushed back slightly to allow for a clear space near the hearth apparently that was to be the center of entertainment for colums large carved chair was placed to one side colum himself was seated in it a warm rug laid across his legs and a small table with decanter and goblets within easy reach seeing me hesitating in the archway he beckoned me to his side with a friendly gesture waving me onto a nearby bench im pleased youve come down mistress claire he said pleasantly informal gwyllyn will be glad of a new ear for his songs though were always willing to listen the mackenzie chieftain looked rather tired i thought the wide shoulders slumped a bit and the premature lines on his face were deeply cut i murmured something inconsequential and looked around the hall people were beginning to drift in and sometimes out standing in small groups to chat gradually taking seats on the benches ranged against the walls i beg your pardon i turned having missed colums words in the growing noise to find him offering me the decanter a lovely bellshaped thing of pale green crystal the liquid within seen through the glass seemed green as the seadepths but once poured out it proved to be a beautiful palerose color with the most delicious bouquet the taste was fully up to the promise and i closed my eyes in bliss letting the wine fumes tickle the back of my palate before reluctantly allowing each sip of nectar to trickle down my throat good isnt it the deep voice held a note of amusement and i opened my eyes to find colum smiling at me in approval i opened my mouth to reply and found that the smooth delicacy of the taste was deceptive the wine was strong enough to cause a mild paralysis of the vocal cords won wonderful i managed to get out colum nodded aye that it is rhenish ye know youre not familiar with it i shook my head as he tipped the decanter over my goblet filling the bowl with a pool of glowing rose he held his own goblet by the stem turning it before his face so that the firelight lit the contents with dashes of vermilion you know good wine though colum said tilting the glass to enjoy the rich fruity scent himself but thats natural i suppose with your family french or half french i should say he corrected himself with a quick smile what part of france do your folk come from i hesitated a moment then thought stick to the truth so far as you can and answered its an old connection and not a close one but such relatives as i may have there come from the north near compiègne i was mildly startled to realize that at this point my relatives were in fact near compiègne stick to the truth indeed ah never been there yourself though i tilted the glass shaking my head as i did so i closed my eyes and breathed deeply inhaling the wines perfume no i said eyes still closed i havent met any of my relatives there either i opened my eyes to find him watching me closely i told you that he nodded not at all perturbed so ye did his eyes were a beautiful soft grey thickly lashed with black a very attractive man colum mackenzie at least down to the waist my gaze flickered past him to the group nearest the fire where i could see his wife letitia part of a group of several ladies all engaged in animated conversation with dougal mackenzie also a most attractive man and a whole one i pulled my attention back to colum and found him gazing abstractedly at one of the wall hangings and as i also told you before i said abruptly bringing him out of his momentary inattention id like to be on my way to france as soon as possible so ye did he said again pleasantly and picked up the decanter with a questioning lift of the brow i held my goblet steady gesturing at the halfway point to indicate that i wanted only a little but he filled the delicate hollow nearly to the rim once more well as i told you mistress beauchamp he said eyes fixed on the rising wine i think ye must be content to bide here a bit until suitable arrangements can be made for your transport no need for haste after all its only the spring of the year and months before the autumn storms make the channel crossing chancy he raised eyes and decanter together and fixed me with a shrewd look but if yed care to give me the names of your kin in france i might manage to send word ahead so theyll be fettled against your coming eh bluff called i had little choice but to mutter something of the yeswellperhapslater variety and excuse myself hastily on the pretext of visiting the necessary facilities before the singing should start game and set to colum but not yet match my pretext had not been entirely fictitious and it took me some time wandering about the darkened halls of the castle to find the place i was seeking groping my way back wineglass still in hand i found the lighted archway to the hall but realized on entering that i had reached the lower entrance and was now at the opposite end of the hall from colum under the circumstances this suited me quite well and i strolled unobtrusively into the long room taking pains to merge with small groups of people as i worked my way along the wall toward one of the benches casting a look at the upper end of the hall i saw a slender man who must be gwyllyn the bard judging from the small harp he carried at colums gesture a servant hastened up to bring the bard a stool on which he seated himself and proceeded to tune the harp plucking lightly at the strings ear close to the instrument colum poured another glass of wine from his own decanter and with another wave dispatched it via the servant in the bards direction oh he called for his pipe and he called for his bowl and he called for his fiddlers threeee i sang irreverently under my breath eliciting an odd look from the girl laoghaire she was seated under a tapestry showing a hunter with six elongated and crosseyed dogs in erratic pursuit of a single hare bit of overkill dont you think i said breezily waving a hand at it and plumping myself down beside her on the bench oh er aye she answered cautiously edging away slightly i tried to engage her in friendly conversation but she answered mostly in monosyllables blushing and starting when i spoke to her and i soon gave it up my attention drawn by the scene at the end of the room harp tuned to his satisfaction gwyllyn had brought out from his coat three wooden flutes of varying sizes which he laid on a small table ready to hand suddenly i noticed that laoghaire was not sharing my interest in the bard and his instruments she had stiffened slightly and was peering over my shoulder toward the lower archway simultaneously leaning back into the shadows under the tapestry to avoid detection following the direction of her gaze i spotted the tall redhaired figure of jamie mactavish just entering the hall ah the gallant hero fancy him do you i asked the girl at my side she shook her head frantically but the brilliant blush staining her cheeks was answer enough well well see what we can do shall we i said feeling expansive and magnanimous i stood up and waved cheerily to attract his attention catching my signal the young man made his way through the crowd smiling i didnt know what might have passed between them in the courtyard but i thought his manner in greeting the girl was warm if still formal his bow to me was slightly more relaxed after the forced intimacy of our relations to date he could hardly treat me as a stranger a few tentative notes from the upper end of the hall signaled an imminent beginning to the entertainment and we hastily took our places jamie seating himself between laoghaire and myself gwyllyn was an insignificantlooking man lightboned and mousyhaired but you didnt see him once he began to sing he only served as a focus a place for the eyes to rest while the ears enjoyed themselves he began with a simple song something in gaelic with a strong rhyming chime to the lines accompanied by the merest touch of his harp strings so that each plucked string seemed by its vibration to carry the echo of the words from one line to the next the voice was also deceptively simple you thought at first there was nothing much to it pleasant but without much strength and then you found that the sound went straight through you and each syllable was crystal clear whether you understood it or not echoing poignantly inside your head the song was received with a warm surge of applause and the singer launched at once into another this time in welsh i thought it sounded like a very tuneful sort of gargling to me but those around me seemed to follow well enough doubtless they had heard it before during a brief pause for retuning i asked jamie in a low voice has gwyllyn been at the castle long then remembering i said oh but you wouldnt know would you id forgotten you were so new here yourself ive been here before he answered turning his attention to me spent a year at leoch when i was sixteen or so and gwyllyn was here then colums fond of his music ye see he pays gwyllyn well to stay has to the welshman would be welcome at any lairds hearth where he chose to roost i remember when you were here before it was laoghaire still blushing pinkly but determined to join the conversation jamie turned his head to include her smiling slightly do ye then you canna have been more than seven or eight yourself id not think i was much to see then so as to be remembered turning politely to me he said do ye have the welsh then well i do remember though laoghaire said pursuing it you were er ah i mean do ye not remember me from then her hands fiddled nervously with the folds of her skirt she bit her nails i saw jamies attention seemed distracted by a group of people across the room arguing in gaelic about something ah he said vaguely no i dinna think so still he said with a smile pulling his attention suddenly back to her i wouldna be likely to a young burke of sixteens too taken up wi his own grand self to pay much heed to what he thinks are naught but a rabble of snotnosed bairns i gathered he had meant this remark to be deprecatory to himself rather than his listener but the effect was not what he might have hoped i thought perhaps a brief pause to let laoghaire recover her selfpossession was in order and broke in hastily with no i dont know any welsh at all do you have any idea what it is he was saying oh aye and jamie launched into what appeared to be a verbatim recitation of the song translated into english it was an old ballad apparently about a young man who loved a young woman what else but feeling unworthy of her because he was poor went off to make his fortune at sea the young man was shipwrecked met sea serpents who menaced him and mermaids who entranced him had adventures found treasure and came home at last only to find his young woman wed to his best friend who if somewhat poorer also apparently had better sense and which would you do i asked teasing a bit would you be the young man who wouldnt marry without money or would you take the girl and let the money go hang this question seemed to interest laoghaire as well who cocked her head to hear the answer meanwhile pretending great attention to an air on the flute that gwyllyn had begun me jamie seemed entertained by the question well as ive no money to start with and precious little chance of ever getting any i suppose id count myself lucky to find a lass would wed me without he shook his head grinning ive no stomach for sea serpents he opened his mouth to say something further but was silenced by laoghaire who laid a hand timidly on his arm then blushing snatched it back as though he were redhot sshh she said i mean hes going to tell stories do ye not want to hear oh aye jamie sat forward a bit in anticipation then realizing that he blocked my view insisted that i sit on the other side of him displacing laoghaire down the bench i could see the girl was not best pleased at this arrangement and i tried to protest that i was all right as i was but he was firm about it no youll see and hear better there and then if he speaks in the gaelic i can whisper in your ear what he says each part of the bards performance had been greeted with warm applause though people chatted quietly while he played making a deep hum below the high sweet strains of the harp but now a sort of expectant hush descended on the hall gwyllyns speaking voice was as clear as his singing each word pitched to reach the end of the high drafty hall without strain it was a time two hundred years ago he spoke in english and i felt a sudden sense of déja vu it was exactly the way our guide on loch ness had spoken telling legends of the great glen it was not a story of ghosts or heroes though but a tale of the wee folk he told there was a clan of the wee folk as lived near dundreggan he began and the hill there is named for the dragon that dwelt there that fionn slew and buried where he fell so the dun is named as it is and after the passing of fionn and the feinn the wee folk that came to dwell in the dun came to want mothers of men to be wet nurses to their own fairy bairns for a man has something that a fairy has not and the wee folk thought that it might pass through the mothers milk to their own small ones now ewan macdonald of dundreggan was out in the dark tending his beasts on the night when his wife bore her firstborn son a gust of the night wind passed by him and in the breath of the wind he heard his wifes sighing she sighed as she sighed before the child was born and hearing her there ewan macdonald turned and flung his knife into the wind in the name of the trinity and his wife dropped safe to the ground beside him the story was received with a sort of collective ah at the conclusion and was quickly followed by tales of the cleverness and ingenuity of the wee folk and others about their interactions with the world of men some were in gaelic and some in english used apparently according to which language best fitted the rhythm of the words for all of them had a beauty to the speaking beyond the content of the tale itself true to his promise jamie translated the gaelic for me in an undertone so quickly and easily that i thought he must have heard these stories many times before there was one i noticed particularly about the man out late at night upon a fairy hill who heard the sound of a woman singing sad and plaintive from the very rocks of the hill he listened more closely and heard the words i am the wife of the laird of balnain the folk have stolen me over again so the listener hurried to the house of balnain and found there the owner gone and his wife and baby son missing the man hastily sought out a priest and brought him back to the fairy knoll the priest blessed the rocks of the dun and sprinkled them with holy water suddenly the night grew darker and there was a loud noise as of thunder then the moon came out from behind a cloud and shone upon the woman the wife of balnain who lay exhausted on the grass with her child in her arms the woman was tired as though she had traveled far but could not tell where she had been nor how she had come there others in the hall had stories to tell and gwyllyn rested on his stool to sip wine as one gave place to another by the fireside telling stories that held the hall rapt some of these i hardly heard i was rapt myself but by my own thoughts which were tumbling about forming patterns under the influence of wine music and fairy legends it was a time two hundred years ago its always two hundred years in highland stories said the reverend wakefields voice in memory the same thing as once upon a time you know and women trapped in the rocks of fairy duns traveling far and arriving exhausted who knew not where they had been nor how they had come there i could feel the hair rising on my forearms as though with cold and rubbed them uneasily two hundred years from to yes near enough and women who traveled through the rocks was it always women i wondered suddenly something else occurred to me the women came back holy water spell or knife they came back so perhaps just perhaps it was possible i must get back to the standing stones on craigh na dun i felt a rising excitement that made me feel a trifle sick and i reached for the wine goblet to calm myself be careful my groping fingers fumbled the edge of the nearly full crystal goblet which i had carelessly set on the bench beside me jamies long arm shot across my lap narrowly saving the goblet from disaster he lifted the glass holding the stem delicately between two large fingers and passed it gently back and forth under his nose he handed it back to me eyebrows lifted rhenish i explained helpfully aye i know he said still looking quizzical colums is it why yes would you like to try some its very good i held out the glass a trifle unsteadily after a moments hesitation he accepted the glass and tried a small sip aye its good he said handing the goblet back its also double strength colum takes it at night because his legs pain him how much of it have you had he asked eyeing me narrowly two no three glasses i said with some dignity are you implying that im intoxicated no he said brows still raised im impressed that youre not most folk that drink wi colum are under the table after the second glass he reached out and took the goblet from me again still he added firmly i think youd best drink no more of it or ye wont get back up the stairs he tilted the glass and deliberately drained it himself then handed the empty goblet to laoghaire without looking at her take that back will ye lass he said casually its grown late i believe ill see mistress beauchamp to her chamber and putting a hand under my elbow he steered me toward the archway leaving the girl staring after us with an expression that made me relieved that looks in fact cannot kill jamie followed me up to my chamber and somewhat to my surprise came in after me the surprise vanished when he shut the door and immediately shed his shirt i had forgotten the dressing which i had been meaning to remove for the last two days ill be glad to get this off he said rubbing at the rayon and linen harness arrangement under his arm its been chafing me for days im surprised you didnt take it off yourself then i said reaching up to untie the knots i was afraid to after the scolding ye gave me when you put the first one on he said grinning impudently down at me thought id get my bum smacked if i touched it youll get it smacked now if you dont sit down and keep still i answered mockstern i put both hands on his good shoulder and a little unsteadily pulled him down onto the bedroom stool i slipped the harness off and carefully probed the shoulder joint it was still slightly swollen with some bruising but thankfully i could find no evidence of torn muscles if you were so anxious to get rid of it why didnt you let me take it off for you yesterday afternoon his behavior at the paddock had puzzled me then and did so still more now that i could see the patches of reddened skin where the rough edges of the linen bandages had rubbed him nearly raw i lifted the dressing cautiously but all was well beneath he glanced sidelong at me then looked down a bit sheepishly well its ah its only that i didna want to take my shirt off before alec modest are you i asked dryly making him raise his arm to test the extension of the joint he winced slightly at the movement but smiled at the remark if i were i should hardly be sittin halfnaked in your chamber should i no its the marks on my back seeing my raised eyebrows he went on to explain alec knows who i am i mean hes heard i was flogged but hes not seen it and to know something like that is no the same as seein it wi your own eyes he felt the sore shoulder tentatively eyes turned away he frowned at the floor its maybe youll not know what i mean but when you know a mans suffered some harm its only one of the things you know about him and it doesna make much difference to how ye see him alec knows ive been flogged like he knows ive red hair and it doesna matter to how he treats me he looked up then searching for some sign of understanding from me but when you see it yourself its like he hesitated looking for words its a bit personal maybe is what i mean i think if he were to see the scars he couldna see me anymore without thinking of my back and id be able to see him thinking of it and that would make me remember it and he broke off shrugging well thats a poor job of explaining no i daresay im too tenderminded about it in any case after all i canna see it for myself perhaps its not as bad as i think i had seen wounded men making their way on crutches down the street and the people passing them with averted eyes and i thought it was not at all a bad job of explanation you dont mind my seeing your back no i dont he sounded mildly surprised and paused a moment to think about it i suppose its that ye seem to have a knack for letting me know youre sorry for it without makin me feel pitiful about it he sat patiently not moving as i circled behind him and inspected his back i didnt know how bad he thought it was but it was bad enough even by candlelight and having seen it once before i was appalled before i had seen only the one shoulder the scars covered his entire back from shoulders to waist while many had faded to little more than thin white lines the worst formed thick silver wedges cutting across the smooth muscles i thought with some regret that it must have been quite a beautiful back at one time his skin was fair and fresh and the lines of bone and muscle were still solid and graceful the shoulders flat and squareset and the backbone a smooth straight groove cut deep between the rounded columns of muscle that rose on either side of it jamie was right too looking at this wanton damage i could not avoid a mental picture of the process that had caused it i tried not to imagine the muscular arms raised spreadeagled and tied ropes cutting into wrists the coppery head pressed hard against the post in agony but the marks brought such images all too readily to mind had he screamed when it was done i pushed the thought hastily away i had heard the stories that trickled out of postwar germany of course of atrocities much worse than this but he was right hearing is not at all the same as seeing involuntarily i reached out as though i might heal him with a touch and erase the marks with my fingers he sighed deeply but didnt move as i traced the deep scars one by one as though to show him the extent of the damage he couldnt see i rested my hands at last lightly on his shoulders in silence groping for words he placed his own hand over mine and squeezed lightly in acknowledgment of the things i couldnt find to say theres worse has happened to others lass he said quietly then he let go and the spell was broken it feels as though its healing well he said trying to look sideways at the wound in his shoulder it doesna pain me much thats good i said clearing my throat of some obstruction that seemed to have lodged there it is healing well its scabbed over nicely and theres no drainage at all just keep it clean and dont use the arm more than you must for another two or three days i patted the undamaged shoulder signifying dismissal he put his shirt back on without assistance tucking the long tails down into the kilt there was an awkward moment as he paused by the door seeking something to say in farewell finally he invited me to come to the stable next day and see a newborn foal i promised that i would and we said good night both speaking together we laughed and nodded absurdly to each other as i shut the door i went at once to bed and fell asleep in a winey haze to dream unsettling dreams that i would not recall come morning next day after a long morning of treating new patients rummaging the stillroom for useful herbs to replenish the medical supplies cupboard and with some ceremony recording the details in davie beatons black ledger i left my narrow closet in search of air and exercise there was no one about for the moment and i took the opportunity to explore the upper floors of the castle poking into empty chambers and winding staircases mapping the castle in my mind it was a most irregular floor plan to say the least bits and pieces had been added here and there over the years until it was difficult to say whether there ever had been a plan originally in this hall for example there was an alcove built into the wall by the stairs apparently serving no purpose but to fill in a blank space too small for a complete room the alcove was partly shielded from view by a hanging curtain of striped linen i would have passed by without stopping had a sudden flash of white from within not attracted my attention i stopped just short of the opening and peered inside to see what it was it was the sleeve of jamies shirt passing around a girls back drawing her close for a kiss she sat on his lap and her yellow hair caught the sunlight coming through a slit reflecting light like the surface of a trout stream on a bright morning i paused uncertain what to do i had no desire to spy on them but was afraid the sound of my footsteps on the corridor stones would draw their attention while i hesitated jamie broke from the embrace and looked up his eyes met mine and his face twitched from alarm to recognition with a raised eyebrow and a faintly ironic shrug he settled the girl more firmly on his knee and bent to his work i shrugged back and tiptoed away not my business i had little doubt however that both colum and the girls father would consider this consorting highly improper the next beating might well be on his own account if they werent more careful in choosing a meeting place finding him at supper that night with alec i sat down opposite them at the long table jamie greeted me pleasantly enough but with a watchful expression in his eyes old alec gave me his usual mmphm women as he had explained to me at the paddock have no natural appreciation for horses and are therefore difficult to talk to hows the horsebreaking coming along i asked to interrupt the industrious chewing on the other side of the table well enough answered jamie cautiously i peered at him across a platter of boiled turnips your mouth looks a bit swollen jamie get thumped by a horse did you i asked wickedly aye he answered narrowing his eyes swung its head when i wasna looking he spoke placidly but i felt a large foot come down on top of mine under the table it rested lightly at the moment but the threat was explicit too bad those fillies can be dangerous i said innocently the foot pressed down hard as alec said filly yere no workin fillies now are ye lad i used my other foot as a lever that failing i used it to kick his ankle sharply jamie jerked suddenly whats wrong wi ye alec demanded bit my tongue muttered jamie glaring at me over the hand he had clapped to his mouth clumsy young dolt no more than id expect though from an idjit as canna even keep clear of a horse when alec went on for several minutes accusing his assistant at length of clumsiness idleness stupidity and general ineptitude jamie possibly the least clumsy person i had ever seen in my life kept his head down and ate stolidly through the diatribe though his cheeks flushed hotly i kept my eyes demurely on my plate for the rest of the meal refusing a second helping of stew jamie left the table abruptly putting an end to alecs tirade the old horsemaster and i munched silently for a few minutes wiping his plate with the last bite of bread the old man pushed it into his mouth and leaned back surveying me sardonically with his one blue eye ye shouldna devil the lad ye ken he said conversationally if her father or colum comes to know about it young jamie could get summat more than a blackened eye like a wife i said looking him squarely in the eye he nodded slowly could be and thats not the wife he should have no i was a bit surprised at this after overhearing alecs remarks in the paddock nay he needs a woman not a girl and laoghaire will be a girl when shes fifty the grim old mouth twisted in something like a smile ye may think ive lived in a stable all my life but i had a wife as was a woman and i ken the difference verra weel the blue eye flashed as he made to get up so do you lass i reached out a hand impulsively to stop him how did you know i began old alec snorted derisively i may ha but one eye lass it doesna mean im blind he creaked off snorting as he went i found the stairs and went up to my room contemplating what if anything the old horsemaster had meant by his final remark chapter the gathering my life seemed to be assuming some shape if not yet a formal routine rising at dawn with the rest of the castle inhabitants i breakfasted in the great hall then if mrs fitz had no patients for me to see i went to work in the huge castle gardens several other women worked there regularly with an attending phalanx of lads in varying sizes who came and went hauling rubbish tools and loads of manure i generally worked through the day there sometimes going to the kitchens to help prepare a newly picked crop for eating or preserving unless some medical emergency called me back to the skulkery as i called the late beatons closet of horrors once in a while i would take up alecs invitation and visit the stables or paddock enjoying the sight of the horses shedding their shaggy winter coats in clumps growing strong and glossy with spring grass some evenings i would go to bed immediately after supper exhausted by the days work other times when i could keep my eyes open i would join the gathering in the great hall to listen to the evenings entertainment of stories song or the music of harp or pipes i could listen to gwyllyn the welsh bard for hours enthralled in spite of my total ignorance of what he was saying most times as the castle inhabitants grew accustomed to my presence and i to them some of the women began to make shy overtures of friendship and to include me in their conversations they were plainly very curious about me but i replied to all their tentative questions with variations of the story i had told colum and after a bit they accepted that as all they were likely to know having found out that i knew something of medicine and healing though they grew still more interested in me and began to ask questions about the ailments of their children husbands and beasts in most cases making little distinction between the latter two in level of importance besides the normal questions and gossip there was considerable talk of the coming gathering that i had heard old alec mention at the paddock i concluded that this was an occasion of some importance and grew more convinced by the extent of the preparations for it a constant stream of foodstuffs poured into the great kitchens and more than twenty skinned carcasses hung in the slaughter shed behind a screen of fragrant smoke that kept the flies away hogsheads of ale were delivered by wagon and carted down to the castle cellars bags of fine flour were brought up from the village mill for baking and baskets of cherries and apricots were fetched daily from the orchards outside the castle wall i was invited to go on one of these fruitpicking expeditions with several of the young women of the castle and accepted with alacrity eager to get out from under the forbidding shadow of the stone walls it was beautiful in the orchard and i greatly enjoyed wandering through the cool mist of the scottish morning fingering through the damp leaves of the fruit trees for the bright cherries and smooth plump apricots squeezing gently to judge the ripeness we plucked only the best dropping them into our baskets in juicy heaps eating as much as we could hold and carrying back the remainder to be made into tarts and pies the enormous pantry shelves were nearly filled now with pastries cordials hams and assorted delicacies how many people customarily come to a gathering i asked magdalen one of the girls with whom i had become friendly she wrinkled a snub freckled nose in thought i dinna ken for sure the last great gathering at leoch was over twenty year past and then there were oh maybe ten score of men come then when old jacob died ye ken and colum was made laird might be more this year been a good year for the crops and folk will ha a bit more money put by so a good many will bring their wives and bairns along visitors were already beginning to arrive at the castle though i had heard that the official parts of the gathering the oathtaking the tynchal and the games would not take place for several days the more illustrious of colums tacksmen and tenants were housed in the castle proper while the poorer menatarms and cottars set up camp on a fallow field below the stream that fed the castles loch roving tinkers gypsies and sellers of small goods had set up a sort of impromptu fair near the bridge the inhabitants of both castle and nearby village had begun to visit the spot in the evenings when the days work was done to buy tools and bits of finery watch the jugglers and catch up on the latest gossip i kept a close eye on the comings and goings and made a point of paying frequent visits to stable and paddock there were horses in plenty now those of the visitors being accommodated in the castle stables among the confusion and disturbance of the gathering i thought i should have no difficulty in finding my chance to escape it was on one of the fruitpicking expeditions to the orchard that i first met geillis duncan finding a small patch of ascaria beneath the roots of an alder i was hunting for more the scarlet caps grew in tiny clumps only four or five mushrooms in a group but there were several clumps scattered through the long grass in this part of the orchard the voices of the women picking fruit grew fainter as i worked my way toward the edge of the orchard stooping or dropping on hands and knees to gather the fragile stalks those kind are poison said a voice from behind me i straightened up from the patch of ascaria i had been bending over thumping my head smartly on a branch of the pine they were growing under as my vision cleared i could see that the peals of laughter were coming from a tall young woman perhaps a few years older than myself fair of hair and skin with the loveliest green eyes i had ever seen i am sorry to be laughing at you she said dimpling as she stepped down into the hollow where i stood i could not help it i imagine i looked funny i said rather ungraciously rubbing the sore spot on top of my head and thank you for the warning but i know those mushrooms are poisonous och you know and who is it youre planning to do away with then your husband perhaps tell me if it works and ill try it on mine her smile was infectious and i found myself smiling back i explained that though the raw mushroom caps were indeed poisonous you could prepare a powdered preparation from the dried fungi that was very efficacious in stopping bleeding when applied topically or so mrs fitz said i was more inclined to trust her than davie beatons physicians guide fancy that she said still smiling and did you know that these she stooped and came up with a handful of tiny blue flowers with heartshaped leaves will start bleeding no i said startled why would anyone want to start bleeding she looked at me with an expression of exasperated patience to get rid of a child ye dont want i mean it brings on your flux but only if ye use it early too late and it can kill you as well as the child you seem to know a lot about it i remarked still stung by having appeared stupid a bit the girls in the village come to me now and again for such things and sometimes the married women too they say im a witch she said widening her brilliant eyes in feigned astonishment she grinned but my husbands the procurator fiscal for the district so they dont say it too loud now the young lad ye brought with ye she went on nodding in approval theres one thats had a few lovephiltres bought on his behalf is he yours mine who you mean er jamie i was startled the young woman looked amused she sat down on a log twirling a lock of fair hair idly around her index finger och aye theres quite a few would settle for a fellow wi eyes and hair like that no matter the price on his head or whether hes any money their fathers may think differently o course now me she went on looking off into the distance im a practical sort i married a man with a fair house a bit o money put away and a good position as for hair he hasnt any and as for eyes i never noticed but he doesna trouble me much she held out the basket she carried for my inspection four bulbous roots lay in the bottom mallow root she explained my husband suffers from a chill on the stomach now and again farts like an ox i thought it best to stop this line of conversation before things got out of hand i havent introduced myself i said extending a hand to help her up from the log my name is claire claire beauchamp the hand that took mine was slender with long tapering white fingers though i noticed the tips were stained probably with the juices of the plants and berries resting alongside the mallow roots in her basket i know who ye are she said the village has been humming with talk of ye since ye came to the castle my name is geillis geillis duncan she peered into my basket if its balganbuachrach youre looking for i can show you where they grow best i accepted her offer and we wandered for some time through the small glens near the orchard poking under rotted logs and crawling around the rim of the sparkling tarns where the tiny toadstools grew in profusion geillis was very knowledgeable about the local plants and their medicinal uses though she suggested a few usages i thought questionable to say the least i thought it very unlikely for instance that bloodwort would be effective in making warts grow on a rivals nose and i strongly doubted whether wood betony was useful in transforming toads into pigeons she made these explanations with a mischievous glance that suggested she was testing my own knowledge or perhaps the local suspicion of witchcraft despite the occasional teasing i found her a pleasant companion with a ready wit and a cheerful if cynical outlook on life she appeared to know everything there was to know about everyone in village countryside and castle and our explorations were punctuated by rests during which she entertained me with complaints about her husbands stomach trouble and amusing if somewhat malicious gossip they say young hamish is not his fathers son she said at one point referring to colums only child the redhaired lad of eight or so whom i had seen at dinner in the hall i was not particularly startled by this bit of gossip having formed my own conclusions on the matter i was only surprised that there was but one child of questionable parentage surmising that letitia had been either lucky or smart enough to seek out someone like geilie in time unwisely i said as much to geilie she flung back her long fair hair and laughed no not me the fair letitia does not need any help in such matters believe me if people are seeking a witch in this neighborhood theyd do better to look in the castle than the village anxious to change the subject to something safer i seized on the first thing that came to mind if young hamish isnt colums son whose is he supposed to be i asked scrambling over a heap of boulders why the lads of course she turned to face me small mouth mocking and green eyes bright with mischief young jamie returning to the orchard alone i met magdalen hair coming loose under her kerchief and wideeyed with worry oh there ye are she said heaving a sigh of relief we were going back to the castle when i missed ye it was kind of you to come back for me i said picking up the basket of cherries id left in the grass i know the way though she shook her head you should take care my dearie walking alone in the woods wi all the tinkers and folk coming for the gathering colums given orders she stopped abruptly hand over her mouth that im to be watched i suggested gently she nodded reluctantly clearly afraid i would be offended i shrugged and tried to smile reassuringly at her well thats natural i suppose i said after all hes no ones word but my own for who i am or how i came here curiosity overcame my better judgment who does he think i am i asked but the girl could only shake her head youre english was all she said i didnt return to the orchard next day not because i was ordered to remain in the castle but because there was a sudden outbreak of food poisoning among the castle inhabitants that demanded my attention as physician having done what i could for the sufferers i set out to track the trouble to its source this proved to be a tainted beef carcass from the slaughter shed i was in the shed next day giving the chief smoker a piece of my mind regarding proper methods of meat preserving when the door swung open behind me sending a thick wave of choking smoke over me i turned eyes watering to see dougal mackenzie looming through the clouds of oakwood smoke supervising the butchering as well as the physicking are ye now mistress he asked mockingly soon yell have the whole castle under your thumb and mrs fitz will be seeking employment elsewhere i have no desire to have anything to do with your filthy castle i snapped wiping my streaming eyes and coming away with charcoal streaks on my handkerchief all i want is to get out of here as fast as possible he inclined his head courteously still grinning well i might be in a position to gratify that wish mistress he said at least temporarily i dropped the handkerchief and stared at him what do you mean he coughed and waved a hand at the smoke now drifting in his direction he drew me outside the shed and turned in the direction of the stables you were saying yesterday to colum that ye needed betony and some odd bits of herbs yes to make up some medicines for the people with food poisoning what of it i demanded still suspicious he shrugged goodnaturedly only that im going down to the smiths in the village taking three horses to be shod the fiscals wife is something of an herbwoman and has stocks to hand doubtless she has the simples that youre needing and if it please ye lady youre welcome to ride one of the horses down wi me to the village the fiscals wife mrs duncan i immediately felt happier the prospect of escaping the castle altogether even if only for a short time was irresistible i mopped my face hurriedly and tucked the soiled kerchief in my belt lets go i said i enjoyed the short ride downhill to the village of cranesmuir even though the day was dark and overcast dougal himself was in high spirits and chatted and joked pleasantly as we went along we stopped first at the smiths where he left the three extra horses taking me up behind him on his saddle for the trip up the high street to the duncans house this was an imposing halftimbered manor of four stories the lower two equipped with elegant leadedglass windows diamondshaped panes in watery tones of purple and green geilie greeted us with delight pleased to have company on such a dreary day how splendid she exclaimed ive been wanting an excuse to go through the stillroom and sort out some things anne a short middleaged serving woman with a face like a winter apple popped out of a door i hadnt noticed concealed as it was in the bend of the chimney take mistress claire up to the stillroom geilie ordered and then go and fetch us a bucket of spring water from the spring mind not the well in the square she turned to dougal ive the tonic put by that i promised your brother if youll come out to the kitchen with me for a moment i followed the serving womans pumpkinshaped rear up a set of narrow wooden stairs emerging unexpectedly into a long airy loft unlike the rest of the house this room was furnished with casement windows shut now against the damp but still providing a great deal more light than had been available in the fashionably gloomy parlor downstairs it was clear that geilie knew her business as an herbalist the room was equipped with long drying frames netted with gauze hooks above the small fireplace for heatdrying and open shelves along the walls drilled with holes to allow for air circulation the air was thick with the delicious spicy scent of drying basil rosemary and lavender a surprisingly modern long counter ran along one side of the room displaying a remarkable assortment of mortars pestles mixing bowls and spoons all immaculately clean it was some time before geilie appeared flushed from climbing the stairs but smiling in anticipation of a long afternoon of herbpounding and gossip it began to rain lightly drops spattering the long casements but a small fire was burning on the stillroom hearth and it was very cozy i enjoyed geilies company immensely she had a wrytongued cynical viewpoint that was a refreshing contrast to the sweet shy clanswomen at the castle and clearly she had been well educated for a woman in a small village she also knew every scandal that had occurred either in village or castle in the last ten years and she told me endless amusing stories oddly enough she asked me few questions about myself i thought perhaps that was not her way she would find out what she wanted to know about me from other people for some time i had been conscious of noises coming from the street outside but had attributed them to the traffic of villagers coming from sunday mass the kirk was located at the end of the street by the well and the high street ran from kirk to square spreading from there into a fan of tiny lanes and walks in fact i had amused myself on the ride to the smithy by imagining an aerial view of the village as a representation of a skeletal forearm and hand the high street was the radius along which lay the shops and businesses and the residences of the more welltodo st margarets lane was the ulna a narrower street running parallel with the high tenanted by smithy tannery and the less genteel artisans and businesses the village square which like all village squares i had ever seen was not square at all but roughly oblong formed the carpals and metacarpals of the hand while the several lanes of cottages made up the phalangeal joints of the fingers the duncans house stood on the square as behooved the residence of the procurator fiscal this was a matter of convenience as well as status the square could be used for those judicial matters which by reason of public interest or legal necessity overflowed the narrow confines of arthur duncans study and it was as dougal explained convenient to the pillory a homely wooden contraption that stood on a small stone plinth in the center of the square adjacent to the wooden stake used with thrifty economy of purpose as whipping post maypole flagstaff and horse tether depending upon requirements the noise outside was now much louder and altogether more disorderly than seemed appropriate to people coming soberly home from church to their dinners geilie put aside the jars with an exclamation of impatience and threw open the window to see what caused the uproar joining her at the window i could see a crowd of folk dressed in churchgoing garb of gown kirtle coat and bonnet led by the stocky figure of father bain the priest who served both village and castle he had in his custody a youth perhaps twelve years old whose ragged trews and smelly shirt proclaimed him a tanners lad the priest had the boy gripped by the nape of the neck a hold made somewhat difficult to maintain by the fact that the lad was slightly taller than his minatory captor the crowd followed the pair at a small distance rumbling with disapproving comment like a passing thunder cloud in the wake of a lightning bolt as we watched from the upper window father bain and the boy disappeared beneath us into the house the crowd remained outside muttering and jostling a few of the bolder souls chinned themselves on the window ledges attempting to peer within geilie shut the window with a slam making a break in the anticipatory rumble below stealing most like she said laconically returning to the herb table usually is wi the tanners lads what will happen to him i asked curiously she shrugged crumbling dried rosemary between her fingers into the mortar depends on whether arthurs dyspeptic this morning i should reckon if hes made a good breakfast the lad might get off with a whipping but happen hes costive or flatulent she made a moue of distaste the boyll lose an ear or a hand most like i was horrified but hesitant to interfere directly in the matter i was an outlander and an englishwoman to boot and while i thought i would be treated with some respect as an inhabitant of the castle i had seen many of the villagers surreptitiously make the sign against evil as i passed my intercession might easily make things worse for the boy cant you do anything i asked geilie speak to your husband i mean ask him to be er lenient geilie looked up from her work surprised clearly the thought of interfering in her husbands affairs had never crossed her mind why should you care what happens to him she asked but curiously not with any hostile meaning of course i care i said hes only a lad whatever he did he doesnt deserve to be mutilated for life she raised pale brows plainly this argument was unconvincing still she shrugged and handed me the mortar and pestle anything to oblige a friend she said rolling her eyes she scanned her shelves and selected a bottle of greenish stuff labeled in fine cursive script extract of peppermint ill go and dose arthur and whilst im about it ill see if aught can be done for the lad it may be too late mind she warned and if that poxy priests got a hand in hell want the stiffest sentence he can get still ill try you keep after the pounding rosemary takes forever i took up the pestle as she left and pounded and ground automatically paying little heed to the results the shut window blocked the sound both of the rain and the crowd below the two blended in a soft pattering susurrus of menace like any schoolchild i had read dickens and earlier authors as well with their descriptions of the pitiless justice of these times meted out to all illdoers regardless of age or circumstance but to read from a cozy distance of one or two hundred years accounts of child hangings and judicial mutilation was a far different thing than to sit quietly pounding herbs a few feet above such an occurrence could i bring myself to interfere directly if the sentence went against the boy i moved to the window carrying the mortar with me and peered out the crowd had increased as merchants and housewives attracted by the gathering wandered down the high street to investigate newcomers leaned close as the standees excitedly relayed the details then merged into the body of the crowd more faces turned expectantly to the door of the house looking down on the assembly standing patiently in the drizzle awaiting a verdict i suddenly had a vivid understanding of something like so many i had heard appalled the reports that trickled out of postwar germany the stories of deportations and mass murder of concentration camps and burnings and like so many others had done and would do for years to come i had asked myself how could the people have let it happen they must have known must have seen the trucks the coming and going the fences and smoke how could they stand by and do nothing well now i knew the stakes were not even life or death in this case and colums patronage would likely prevent any physical attack on me but my hands grew clammy around the porcelain bowl as i thought of myself stepping out alone and powerless to confront that mob of solid and virtuous citizens avid for the excitement of punishment and blood to alleviate the tedium of existence people are gregarious by necessity since the days of the first cave dwellers humans hairless weak and helpless save for cunning have survived by joining together in groups knowing as so many other edible creatures have found that there is protection in numbers and that knowledge bred in the bone is what lies behind mob rule because to step outside the group let alone to stand against it was for uncounted thousands of years death to the creature who dared it to stand against a crowd would take something more than ordinary courage something that went beyond human instinct and i feared i did not have it and fearing was ashamed it seemed forever before the door opened and geilie stepped in looking cool and unperturbed as usual a small stick of charcoal in her hand well need to filter it after its boiled she remarked as though going on with our previous conversation i think well run it through charcoal in muslin thats best geilie i said impatiently dont try me what about the tanners boy oh that she lifted a shoulder dismissively but a mischievous smile lurked about the corners of her lips she dropped the facade then and laughed you should have seen me she said giggling i was awfully good an i say it myself all wifely solicitude and womanly kindness with a small dab o maternal pity mixed in oh arthur she dramatized had our own union been blessed not much chance if ive aught to say about it she said dropping the soulful mask for a moment with a tilt of her head toward the herb shelves why how would ye feel my darling should your own son be taken so nae doubt it was but hunger made the lad take to thievery oh arthur can ye no find it in your heart to be merciful and you the soul of justice she dropped onto a stool laughing and pounding her fist lightly against her leg what a pity theres no place for acting here the sound of the crowd outside had changed and i moved to the window to see what was happening ignoring geilies selfcongratulations the throng parted and the tanners lad came out walking slowly between priest and judge arthur duncan was swollen with benevolence bowing and nodding to the more eminent members of the assembly father bain on the other hand resembled a sullen potato more than anything else brown face lumpy with resentment the little procession proceeded to the center of the square where the village locksman one john macrae stepped out of the crowd to meet them this personage was dressed as befitted his office in the sober elegance of dark breeches and coat and grey velvet hat removed for the nonce and tenderly sheltered from the rain beneath the tail of his coat he was not as i had at first assumed the village jailer though in a pinch he did perform such office his duties were primarily those of constable customs inspector and when needed executioner his title came from the wooden lock or scoop that hung from his belt with which he was entitled to take a percentage of each bag of grain sold in the thursday market the remuneration of his office i had found all this out from the locksman himself he had been to the castle only a few days before to see whether i could treat a persistent felon on his thumb i had lanced it with a sterile needle and dressed it with poplarbud salve finding macrae a shy and softspoken man with a pleasant smile there was no trace of a smile now though macraes face was suitably stern reasonable i thought no one wants to see a grinning executioner the miscreant was brought to stand on the plinth in the center of the square the lad looked pale and frightened but did not move as arthur duncan procurator fiscal for the parish of cranesmuir drew his plumpness up into an approximation of dignity and prepared to pronounce sentence the ninny had already confessed by the time i came in said a voice by my ear geilie peered interestedly over my shoulder i couldna get him freed entirely i got him off as light as could be though only an hour in the pillory and one ear nailed one ear nailed nailed to what why the pillory o course she shot me a curious look but turned back to the window to watch the execution of this light sentence obtained by her merciful intercession the crush of bodies around the pillory was so great that little of the miscreant could be seen but the crowd drew back a bit to allow the locksman free movement for the earnailing the lad whitefaced and small in the jaws of the pillory had both eyes tight shut and kept them that way shuddering with fear he uttered a high thin scream when the nail was driven in audible through the closed windows and i shuddered a bit myself we returned to our work as did most of the spectators in the square but i could not help rising to glance out from time to time a few idlers passing by paused to jeer at the victim and throw balls of mud and now and then a more sober citizen was to be seen seizing a moment from the round of daily duties to attend to the moral improvement of the delinquent by means of a few wellchosen words of reproval and advice it was still an hour to the late spring sunset and we were drinking tea below in the parlor when a pounding at the door announced the arrival of a visitor the day was so dark from the rain that one could hardly tell the level of the sun the duncans house however boasted a clock a magnificent contrivance of walnut panels brass pendulums and a face decorated with quiring cherubim and this instrument pointed to halfpast six the scullery maid opened the door to the parlor and unceremoniously announced in here jamie mactavish ducked automatically as he came through the door bright hair darkened by the rain to the color of ancient bronze he wore an elderly and disreputable coat against the wet and carried a riding cloak of heavy green velvet folded under one arm he nodded in acknowledgment as i rose and introduced him to geilie mistress duncan mrs beauchamp he waved a hand toward the window i see yeve had a wee bit doing this afternoon is he still there i asked peering out the boy was only a dark shape seen through the distortion of the wavering drawingroom panes he must be soaked through he is jamie spread the cloak and held it for me so youd be as well colum thought id business in the village so he sent along the cloak with me for ye youre to ride back wi me that was kind of him i spoke absently for my mind was still on the tanners lad how long must he stay there i asked geilie the lad in the pillory i added impatiently seeing her blank look oh him she said frowning slightly at the introduction of such an unimportant topic an hour i told you the locksman should ha freed him from the pillory by now he has jamie assured her i saw him as i was crossing the green its only the lads not got up courage to tear the griss from his lug yet my mouth dropped open you mean the nail wont be taken out of his ear hes to tear himself loose oh aye jamie was cheerfully offhand hes still a bit nervous but i imagine hell set his mind to it soon its wet out and growing dark as well we must leave ourselves or well get naught but scraps to our dinner he bowed to geilie and turned to go wait a bit she said to me since youve a big strong lad like yon to see ye home ive a chest of dried marsh cabbage and other simples as ive promised to mrs fitzgibbons up at the castle perhaps mr mactavish would be so kind jamie assenting she had a manservant fetch down the chest from her workroom handing over the enormous wroughtiron key for the purpose while the servant was gone she busied herself for a moment at a small writing desk in the corner by the time the chest a sizable wooden box with brass bands was brought in she had finished her note she hastily sanded it folded and sealed it with a blob of wax from the candle and pressed it into my hand there she said thats the bill for it will ye give it to dougal for me its him that handles the payments and such dinna give it to anyone else or ill not be paid for weeks yes of course she embraced me warmly and with admonitions about avoiding the chill saw us to the door i stood sheltering beneath the eave of the house as jamie tied the box to his horses saddle the rain was coming down harder now and the eaves ran with a ragged sheet of water i eyed the broad back and muscular forearms as he lifted the heavy box with little apparent effort then i glanced at the plinth where the tanners boy in spite of encouragement from the regathered crowd was still firmly pinioned granted this was not a lovely young girl with moonbeam hair but jamies earlier actions in colums hall of justice made me think that he might not be unsympathetic to the youngsters plight er mr mactavish i began hesitantly there was no response the comely face did not change expression the wide mouth stayed relaxed the blue eyes focused on the strap he was fastening ah jamie i tried again a little louder and he looked up at once so it really wasnt mactavish i wondered what it was aye he said youre er quite sizable arent you i said a halfsmile curved his lips and he nodded clearly wondering what i was up to big enough for most things he answered i was encouraged and moved casually closer so as not to be overheard by any stragglers from the square and tolerably strong in the fingers i asked he flexed one hand and the smile widened aye thats so happen youve a few chestnuts you want cracked he looked down at me with a shrewd and merry glint i glanced briefly past him to the knot of onlookers in the square more like one to be pulled from the fire i think i looked up to meet that questioning blue gaze could you do it he stood looking down at me for a moment still smiling then shrugged aye if the shanks long enough to grip can ye draw the crowd away though interference wouldna be looked on kindly and me a stranger i had not anticipated the possibility that my request might put him in any danger and i hesitated but he seemed game to try danger notwithstanding well if we both went over for a closer look and then i were to faint at the sight do you think you being so unused to blood and all one brow lifted sardonically and he grinned aye thatll do if ye can make shift to fall off the plinth still better i had in fact felt a bit squeamish about looking but it was not so daunting a sight as i had feared the ear was pinned firmly through the upper flange close to the edge and a full two inches of the nails square headless shank was free above the pinioned appendage there was almost no blood and it was clear from the boys face that while he was both frightened and uncomfortable he was in no great pain i began to think that geilie perhaps had been right in considering this a fairly lenient sentence given the overall state of current scottish jurisprudence though this didnt alter by one whit my opinion as to the barbarity of it jamie edged casually through the fringe of lookerson he shook his head reprovingly at the boy na then lad he said clicking his tongue got yourself in a rare swivet have ye no he rested one large firm hand on the wooden edge of the pillory under pretext of looking more closely at the ear och laddie he said disparaging yons no job to be making heavy weather of a wee snatch o the head and its over here shall i help ye he reached out as though to grasp the lad by the hair and wrench his head free the boy yelped in fear recognizing my cue i stepped back taking care to tread heavily on the toes of the woman behind me who yipped in anguish as my boot heel crushed her metatarsals i beg your pardon i gasped im so dizzy please i turned away from the pillory and took two or three steps staggering artfully and clutching at the sleeves of those nearby the edge of the plinth was only six inches away i took a firm hold on a slightly built girl i had marked out for the purpose and pitched headfirst over the edge taking her with me we rolled on the wet grass in a tangle of skirts and squeals letting go of her blouse at last i relaxed into a dramatically spreadeagled heap rain pattering down on my upturned face i was in truth a trifle winded by the impact the girl had fallen on top of me and i fought for breath listening to the babble of concerned voices gathered around me speculations suggestions and shocked interjections rained on me thicker than the drops of water from the sky but it was a pair of familiar arms that raised me to a sitting position and a pair of gravely concerned blue eyes that i saw when i opened my own a faint flicker of the eyelids told me that the mission had been accomplished and in fact i could see the tanners lad napkin clutched to his ear making off at speed in the direction of his loft unnoticed by the crowd that had turned to attend to this new sensation the villagers so lately calling for the lads blood were kindness itself to me i was tenderly gathered up and carried back to the duncans house where i was plied with brandy tea warm blankets and sympathy i was only allowed to depart at last by jamies stating bluntly that we must go then lifting me bodily off the couch and heading for the door disregarding the expostulations of my hosts mounted once more in front of him my own horse led by the rein i tried to thank him for his help no trouble lass he said dismissing my thanks but it was a risk to you i said persisting i didnt realize youd be in danger when i asked you ah he said noncommittally and a moment later with a hint of amusement ye wouldna expect me to be less bold than a wee sassenach lassie now would ye he urged the horses into a trot as the shadows of dusk gathered by the roadside we did not speak much on the rest of the journey home and when we reached the castle he left me at the gate with no more than a softly mocking good een mistress sassenach but i felt as though a friendship had been begun that ran a bit deeper than shared gossip under the apple trees chapter the oathtaking there was a terrific stir over the next two days with comings and goings and preparations of every sort my medical practice dropped off sharply the foodpoisoning victims were well again and everyone else seemed to be much too busy to fall sick aside from a slight rash of splintersinfingers among the boys hauling in wood for the fires and a similar outbreak of scalds and burns among the busy kitchen maids there were no accidents either i was excited myself tonight was the night mrs fitz had told me that all the fighting men of the mackenzie clan would be in the hall tonight to make their oaths of allegiance to colum with a ceremony of this importance going on inside no one would be watching the stables during my hours helping in the kitchens and orchards i had managed to stow away sufficient food to see me provided for several days i thought i had no water flask but had contrived a substitute using one of the heavier glass jugs from the surgery i had stout boots and a warm cloak courtesy of colum i would have a decent horse on my afternoon visit to the stables i had marked out the one i meant to take i had no money but my patients had given me a handful of small trinkets ribbons and bits of carving or jewelry if necessary i might be able to use these to trade for anything else i needed i felt badly about abusing colums hospitality and the friendship of the castle inhabitants by leaving without a word or a note of farewell but after all what could i possibly say i had pondered the problem for some time but finally decided just to leave for one thing i had no writing paper and was not willing to take the risk of visiting colums quarters in search of any an hour past first dark i approached the stable cautiously ears alert for any signs of human presence but it seemed that everyone was up in the hall readying themselves for the ceremony the door stuck but gave with a slight push its leather hinges letting it swing silently inward the air inside was warm and alive with the faint stirrings of resting horses it was also black as the inside of an undertakers hat as uncle lamb used to say such few windows as there were for ventilation were narrow slits too small to admit the faint starlight outside hands outstretched i walked slowly into the main part of the stable feet shuffling in the straw i groped carefully in front of me looking for the edge of a stall to guide me my hands found only empty air but my shins met a solid obstruction resting on the floor and i pitched headlong with a startled cry that rang in the rafters of the old stone building the obstruction rolled over with a startled oath and grasped me hard by the arms i found myself held against the length of a sizable male body with someones breath tickling my ear who are you i gasped jerking backward and what are you doing here hearing my voice the unseen assailant relaxed his grip i might ask the same of you sassenach said the deep soft voice of jamie mactavish and i relaxed a little in relief there was a stirring in the straw and he sat up though i suppose i could guess he added dryly how far dye think youd get lassie on a dark night and a strange horse wi half the mackenzie clan after ye by morning i was ruffled in more ways than one they wouldnt be after me theyre all up at the hall and if one in five of them is sober enough to stand by morning let alone ride a horse ill be most surprised he laughed and standing up reached down a hand to help me to my feet he brushed the straw from the back of my skirt with somewhat more force than i thought strictly necessary well thats verra sound reasoning on your part sassenach he said sounding mildly surprised that i was capable of reason or would be he added did colum not have guards posted all round the castle and scattered through the woods hed hardly leave the castle unprotected and the fighting men of the whole clan inside it granted that stone doesna burn so well as wood i gathered he was referring to the infamous glencoe massacre when one john campbell on government orders had put thirtyeight members of the macdonald clan to the sword and burned the house above them i calculated rapidly that would have been only fiftysome years before recent enough to justify any defensive precautions on colums part in any case ye could scarcely have chosen a worse night to try to escape mactavish went on he seemed entirely unconcerned with the fact that i had meant to escape only with the reasons why it wouldnt work which struck me as a little odd besides the guards and the fact that every good horseman for miles around is here the way to the castle will be filled wi folk coming from the countryside for the tynchal and the games tynchal a hunt usually stags maybe a boar this time one of the stable lads told old alec theres a large one in the east wood he put a large hand in the center of my back and turned me toward the faint oblong of the open door come along he said ill take ye back up to the castle i pulled away from him dont bother i said ungraciously i can find my own way he took my elbow with considerable firmness i daresay ye can but youll not want to meet any of colums guards alone and why not i snapped im not doing anything wrong theres no law against walking outside the castle is there no i doubt theyd mean to do ye harm he said peering thoughtfully into the shadows but its far from unusual for a man to take a flask along to keep him company when he stands guard and the drink may be a boon companion but its no a verra good adviser as to suitable behavior when a small sweet lass comes on ye alone in the dark i came on you in the dark alone i reminded him with some boldness and im neither particularly small nor very sweet at least at present aye well i was asleep not drunk he responded briefly and questions of your temper aside youre a good bit smaller than most of colums guards i put that aside as an unproductive line of argument and tried another tack and why were you asleep in the stable i asked havent you a bed somewhere we were in the outer reaches of the kitchen gardens by now and i could see his face in the faint light he was intent checking the stone arches carefully as we went but he glanced sharply aside at this aye he said he continued to stride forward still gripping me by the elbow but went on after a moment i thought id be better out of the way because you dont mean to swear allegiance to colum mackenzie i guessed and you dont want to stand any racket about it he glanced at me amused at my words something like that he admitted one of the side gates had been left welcomingly ajar and a lantern perched atop the stone ledge next to it shed a yellow glow on the path we had almost reached this beacon when a hand suddenly descended on my mouth from behind and i was jerked abruptly off my feet i struggled and bit but my captor was heavily gloved and as jamie had said a good deal larger than i jamie himself seemed to be having minor difficulties judging from the sound of it the grunting and muffled cursing ceased abruptly with a thud and a rich gaelic expletive the struggle in the dark stopped and there was an unfamiliar laugh gods eyes if its no the young lad colums nephew come late to the oathtaking are ye not lad and whos that wi ye its a lassie replied the man holding me and a sweet juicy one too by the heft of her the hand left my mouth and administered a hearty squeeze elsewhere i squeaked in indignation reached over my shoulder got hold of his nose and yanked the man set me down with a quick oath of his own less formal than those about to be taken within the hall i stepped back from the blast of whisky fumes feeling a sudden surge of appreciation for jamies presence perhaps his accompanying me had been prudent after all he appeared to be thinking otherwise as he made a vain attempt to remove the clinging grip of the two menatarms who had attached themselves to him there was nothing hostile about their actions but there was a considerable amount of firmness they began to move purposefully toward the open gate their captive in tow nay let me go and change first man he protested im no decent to be going into the oathtaking like this his attempt at graceful escape was foiled by the sudden appearance of rupert fatly resplendent in ruffled shirt and goldlaced coat who popped out of the narrow gate like a cork from a bottle dinna worrit yourself about that laddie he said surveying jamie with a gleaming eye well outfit ye proper inside he jerked his head toward the gate and jamie disappeared within under compulsion a meaty hand gripped my own elbow and i followed willynilly rupert appeared to be in very high spirits as did the other men i saw inside the castle there were perhaps sixty or seventy men all dressed in their best festooned with dirks swords pistols and sporrans milling about in the courtyard nearest the entrance to the great hall rupert gestured to a door set in the wall and the men hustled jamie into a small lighted room it was one apparently used for storage odds and ends of all kinds littered the tables and shelves with which it was furnished rupert surveyed jamie critically with an eye to the oatstraws in his hair and the stains on his shirt i saw his glance flicker to the oatstraws in my own hair and a cynical grin split his face no wonder yere late laddie he said digging jamie in the ribs dinna blame ye a bit willie he called to one of the men outside we need some clothes here something suitable for the lairds nephew see to it man and hurry jamie looked around thinlipped at the men surrounding him six clansmen all in tearing high spirits at the prospect of the oathtaking and brimming over with a fierce mackenzie pride the spirits had plainly been assisted by an ample intake from the tub of ale i had seen in the yard jamies eye lighted on me his expression still grim this was my doing his face seemed to say he could of course announce that he did not mean to swear his oath to colum and head back to his warm bed in the stables if he wanted a serious beating or his throat cut that is he raised an eyebrow at me shrugged and submitted with a fair show of grace to willie who rushed up with a pile of snowy linen in his arms and a hairbrush in one hand the pile was topped by a flat blue bonnet of velvet adorned with a metal badge that held a sprig of holly i picked up the bonnet to examine it as jamie fought his way into the clean shirt and brushed his hair with suppressed savagery the badge was round and the engraving surprisingly fine it showed five volcanos in the center spouting most realistic flames and on the border was a motto luceo non uro i shine not burn i translated aloud aye lassie the mackenzie motto said willie nodding approvingly at me he snatched the bonnet from my hands and pushed it into jamies before dashing off in search of further clothing er im sorry i said in a low voice taking advantage of willies absence to move closer i didnt mean jamie who had been viewing the badge on the bonnet with disfavor glanced down at me and the grim line of his mouth relaxed ah dinna worrit yourself on my account sassenach it would ha come to it sooner or later he twisted the badge loose from the bonnet and smiled sourly at it weighing it speculatively in his hand dye ken my own motto lass he asked my clans i mean no i answered startled what is it he flipped the badge once in the air caught it and dropped it neatly into his sporran he looked rather bleakly toward the open archway where the mackenzie clansmen were massing in untidy lines je suis prest he replied in surprisingly good french he glanced back to see rupert and another large mackenzie i didnt know faces flushed with high spirits and spirits of another kind advancing with solid purpose rupert held a huge length of mackenzie tartan cloth without preliminaries the other man reached for the buckle of jamies kilt best leave sassenach jamie advised briefly its no place for women so i see i responded dryly and was rewarded with a wry smile as his hips were swathed in the new kilt and the old one yanked deftly away beneath it modesty preserved rupert and friend took him firmly by the arms and hustled him toward the archway i turned without delay and made my way back toward the stair to the minstrels gallery carefully avoiding the eye of any clansman i passed once around the corner i paused shrinking back against the wall to avoid notice i waited for a moment until the corridor was temporarily deserted then nipped inside the gallery door and pulled it quickly to behind me before anyone else could come around the corner and see where i had gone the stairs were dimly lit by the glow from above and i had no trouble keeping my footing on the worn flags i climbed toward the noise and light thinking of that last brief exchange je suis prest i am ready i hoped he was the gallery was lit by pine torches brilliant flares that rose straight up in their sockets outlined in black by the soot their predecessors had left on the walls several faces turned blinking to look at me as i came out of the hangings at the back of the gallery from the looks of it all the women of the castle were up here i recognized the girl laoghaire magdalen and some of the other women i had met in the kitchens and of course the stout form of mrs fitzgibbons in a position of honor near the balustrade seeing me she beckoned in a friendly manner and the women squeezed against each other to let me pass when i reached the front i could see the whole hall spread out beneath the walls were decked with myrtle branches yew and holly and the fragrance of the evergreens rose up into the gallery mingled with the smoke of fires and the harsh reek of men there were dozens of them coming going standing talking in small groups scattered throughout the hall and all clad in some version of the clan tartan be it only a plaid or a tartan bonnet worn above ordinary working shirt and tattered breeches the actual patterns varied wildly but the colors were mostly the same dark greens and white most of them were completely dressed as jamie now was kilt plaid bonnet and in most cases badges i caught a glimpse of him standing near the wall still looking grim rupert had disappeared into the throng but two more burly mackenzies flanked jamie obviously guards the confusion in the hall was gradually becoming organized as the castle residents pushed and led the newcomers into place at the lower end tonight was plainly special the young lad who played the pipes at hall had been augmented by two other pipers one a man whose bearing and ivorymounted pipes proclaimed him a master piper this man nodded to the other two and soon the hall was filled with the fierce drone of pipe music much smaller than the great northern pipes used in battle these versions made a most effective racket the chanters laid a trill above the drones that made the blood itch the women stirred around me and i thought of a line from maggie lauder oh they call me rab the ranter and the lassies all go daft when i blow up my chanter if not daft the women around me were fully appreciative and there were many murmurs of admiration as they hung over the rail pointing out one man or another striding about the hall decked in his finery one girl spotted jamie and with a muffled exclamation beckoned her friends to see there was considerable whispering and murmuring over his appearance some of it was admiration for his fine looks but more was speculation about his presence at the oathtaking i noticed that laoghaire in particular glowed like a candle as she watched him and i remembered what alec had said in the paddock ye know her father will no let her wed outside the clan and colums nephew was he the lad might be quite a catch at that bar the minor matter of outlawry of course the pipe music rose to a fervent pitch and then abruptly ceased in the dead silence of the hall colum mackenzie stepped out from the upper archway and strode purposefully to a small platform that had been erected at the head of the room if he made no effort to hide his disability he did not flaunt it now either he was splendid in an azureblue coat heavily laced with gold buttoned with silver and with rose silk cuffs that turned back almost to the elbow a tartan kilt in fine wool hung past his knees covering most of his legs and the checked stockings on them his bonnet was blue but the silver badge held plumes not holly the entire hall held its breath as he took center stage whatever else he was colum mackenzie was a showman he turned to face the assembled clansmen raised his arms and greeted them with a ringing shout tulach ard tulach ard the clansmen gave back in a roar the woman next to me shivered there was a short speech next given in gaelic this was greeted with periodic roars of approval and then the oathtaking proper commenced dougal mackenzie was the first man to advance to colums platform the small rostrum gave colum enough height that the brothers met face to face dougal was richly dressed but in plain chestnut velvet with no gold lace so as not to distract attention from colums magnificence dougal drew his dirk with a flourish and sank to one knee holding the dirk upright by the blade his voice was less powerful than colums but loud enough so that every word rang through the hall i swear by the cross of our lord jesus christ and by the holy iron that i hold to give ye my fealty and pledge ye my loyalty to the name of the clan mackenzie if ever my hand shall be raised against ye in rebellion i ask that this holy iron shall pierce my heart he lowered the dirk kissed it at the juncture of haft and tang and thrust it home in its sheath still kneeling he offered both hands clasped to colum who took them between his own and lifted them to his lips in acceptance of the oath so offered then he raised dougal to his feet turning colum picked up a silver quaich from its place on the tartancovered table behind him he lifted the heavy eared cup with both hands drank from it and offered it to dougal dougal took a healthy swallow and handed back the cup then with a final bow to the laird of the clan mackenzie he stepped to one side to make room for the next man in line this same process was repeated over and over from vow to ceremonial drink viewing the number of men in the line i was impressed anew at colums capacity i was trying to work out how many pints of spirit he would have consumed by the end of the evening given one swallow per oathtaker when i saw jamie approach the head of the line dougal his own oath completed had taken up a station to colums rear he saw jamie before colum who was occupied with another man and i saw his sudden start of surprise he stepped close to his brother and muttered something colum kept his eyes fixed on the man before him but i saw him stiffen slightly he was surprised too and i thought not altogether pleased the level of feeling in the hall high to start with had risen through the ceremony if jamie were to refuse his oath at this point i thought he could easily be torn to shreds by the overwrought clansmen around him i wiped my palms surreptitiously against my skirt feeling guilty at having brought him into such a precarious situation he seemed composed hot as the hall was he wasnt sweating he waited patiently in line showing no signs of realizing that he was surrounded by a hundred men armed to the teeth who would be quick to resent any insult offered to the mackenzie and the clan je suis prest indeed or perhaps he had decided after all to take alecs advice my nails were digging into my palms by the time it came his turn he went gracefully to one knee and bowed deeply before colum but instead of drawing his knife for the oath he rose to his feet and looked colum in the face fully erect he stood head and shoulders over most of the men in the hall and he topped colum on his rostrum by several inches i glanced at the girl laoghaire she had gone pale when he rose to his feet and i saw that she also had her fists clenched tight every eye in the hall was on him but he spoke as though to colum alone his voice was as deep as colums and every word was clearly audible colum mackenzie i come to you as kinsman and as ally i give ye no vow for my oath is pledged to the name that i bear there was a low ominous growl from the crowd but he ignored it and went on but i give ye freely the things that i have my help and my goodwill wherever ye should find need of them i give ye my obedience as kinsman and as laird and i hold myself bound by your word so long as my feet rest on the lands of clan mackenzie he stopped speaking and stood tall and erect hands relaxed at his sides ball now in colums court i thought one word from him one sign and theyd be scrubbing the young mans blood off the flags come morning colum stood unmoving for a moment then smiled and held out his hands after an instants hesitation jamie placed his own hands lightly on colums palms we are honored by your offer of friendship and goodwill said colum clearly we accept your obedience and hold you in good faith as an ally of the clan mackenzie there was a lessening of the tension over the hall and almost an audible sigh of relief in the gallery as colum drank from the quaich and offered it to jamie the young man accepted it with a smile instead of the customary ceremonial sip however he carefully raised the nearly full vessel tilted it and drank and kept on drinking there was a gasp of mingled respect and amusement from the spectators as the powerful throat muscles kept moving surely hed have to breathe soon i thought but no he drained the heavy cup to the last drop lowered it with an explosive gasp for air and handed it back to colum the honor is mine he said a little hoarsely to be allied with a clan whose taste in whisky is so fine there was an uproar at this and he made his way toward the archway much impeded by congratulatory handshakes and thumps on the back as he passed apparently colum mackenzie was not the only member of the family with a knack for good theater the heat in the gallery was stifling and the rising smoke was making my head ache before the oathtaking finally came to an end with what i assumed were a few stirring words by colum unaffected by six shared quaichs of spirit the strong voice still reverberated off the stones of the hall at least his legs wouldnt pain him tonight i thought in spite of all the standing there was a massive shout from the floor below an outbreak of skirling pipes and the solemn scene dissolved into a heaving surge of riotous yelling an even louder shout greeted the tubs of ale and whisky that now appeared on trestles accompanied by platters of steaming oatcakes haggis and meat mrs fitz who must have organized this part of the proceedings leaned precariously across the balustrade keeping a sharp eye on the behavior of the stewards mostly lads too young to swear a formal oath and wheres the pheasants got to then she muttered under her breath surveying the incoming platters or the stuffed eels either drat that mungo grant ill skin him if hes burnt the eels making up her mind she turned and began to squeeze toward the back of the gallery plainly unwilling to leave administration of something so critical as the feasting in the untried hands of mungo grant seizing the opportunity i pushed along behind her taking advantage of the sizable wake she left through the crowd others clearly thankful for a reason to leave joined me in the exodus mrs fitz turning at the bottom saw the flock of women above and scowled ferociously you wee lassies clear off to your rooms right sharp she commanded if youll not stay up there safe out o sight yed best scamper awa to your own places but no lingering in the corridors nor peeping round the corners theres not a man in the place whos not half in his cups already and theyll be far gone in an hour tis no place for lasses tonight pushing the door ajar she peered cautiously into the corridor the coast apparently clear she shooed the women out the door one at a time sending them hurriedly on their way to their sleeping quarters on the upper floors do you need any help i asked as i came even with her in the kitchens i mean she shook her head but smiled at the offer nay theres no need lass get along wi ye now youre no safer than the rest and a kindly shove in the small of the back sent me hurtling out into the dim passage i was inclined to take her advice after the encounter with the guard outside the men in the hall were rioting dancing and drinking with no thought of restraint or control no place for a woman i agreed finding my way back to my room was another matter altogether i was in an unfamiliar part of the castle and while i knew the next floor had a breezeway that connected it to the corridor leading to my room i couldnt find anything resembling stairs i came around a corner and smack into a group of clansmen these were men i didnt know come from the outlying clan lands and unused to the genteel manners of a castle or so i deduced from the fact that one man apparently in search of the latrines gave it up and chose to relieve himself in a corner of the hallway as i came upon them i whirled at once intending to go back the way i had come stairs or no stairs several hands reached to stop me though and i found myself pressed against the wall of the corridor surrounded by bearded highlanders with whisky on their breath and rape on their minds seeing no point in preliminaries the man in front of me grabbed me by the waist and plunged his other hand into my bodice he leaned close rubbing his bearded cheek against my ear and how about a sweet kiss now for the brave lads of the clan mackenzie tulach ard erin go bragh i said rudely and pushed with all my strength unsteady with drink he staggered backward into one of his companions i dodged to the side and fled kicking off my clumsy shoes as i ran another shape loomed in front of me and i hesitated there seemed to be only one in front of me though and at least ten behind me catching up fast despite their cargo of drink i raced forward intending to dodge around him he stepped sharply in front of me though and i came to a halt so fast that i had to put my hands on his chest to avoid crashing into him it was dougal mackenzie what in hell he began then saw the men after me he pulled me behind him and barked something at my pursuers in gaelic they protested in the same language but after a short exchange like the snarling of wolves they gave it up and went off in search of better entertainment thank you i said a little dazed thank you ill ill go i shouldnt be down here dougal glanced down at me and took my arm pulling me around to face him he was disheveled and clearly had been joining in the roistering in the hall true enough lass he said ye shouldna be here since ye are weel youll have to pay the penalty for that he murmured eyes gleaming in the halfdark and without warning he pulled me hard against him and kissed me kissed me hard enough to bruise my lips and force them apart his tongue flicked against mine the taste of whisky sharp in my mouth his hands gripped me firmly by the bottom and pressed me against him making me feel the rigid hardness under his kilt through my layers of skirts and petticoats he released me as suddenly as he had seized me he nodded and gestured down the hall breathing a little unsteadily a lock of russet hair hung loose over his forehead and he brushed it back with one hand get ye gone lassie he said before ye pay a greater price i went barefoot given the carryingson of the night before i had expected most inhabitants of the castle to lie late the next morning possibly staggering down for a restorative mug of ale when the sun was high assuming that it chose to come out at all of course but the highland scots of clan mackenzie were a tougher bunch than i had reckoned with for the castle was a buzzing hive long before dawn with rowdy voices calling up and down the corridors and a great clanking of armory and thudding of boots as men prepared for the tynchal it was cold and foggy but rupert whom i met in the courtyard on my way to the hall assured me that this was the best sort of weather in which to hunt boar the beasts ha such a thick coat the colds no hindrance to them he explained sharpening a spearpoint with enthusiasm against a footdriven grindstone and they feel safe wi the mist so heavy all round them canna see the men coming toward them ye ken i forbore to point out that this meant the hunting men would not be able to see the boar they were approaching either until they were upon it as the sun began to streak the mist with blood and gold the hunting party assembled in the forecourt spangled with damp and brighteyed with anticipation i was glad to see that the women were not expected to participate but contented themselves with offering bannocks and drafts of ale to the departing heroes seeing the large number of men who set out for the east wood armed to the teeth with boar spears axes bows quivers and daggers i felt a bit sorry for the boar this attitude was revised to one of awed respect an hour later when i was hastily summoned to the forests edge to dress the wounds of a man who had as i surmised stumbled over the beast unawares in the fog bloody christ i said examining a gaping jagged wound that ran from knee to ankle an animal did this whats it got stainless steel teeth eh the victim was white with shock and too shaken to answer me but one of the fellows who had assisted him from the wood gave me a curious look never mind i said and yanked tight the compression bandage i had wound about the injured calf take him up to the castle and well have mrs fitz give him hot broth and blankets thatll have to be stitched and ive no tools for it here the rhythmic shouts of the same beaters still echoed in the mists of the hillside suddenly there was a piercing scream that rose high above fog and tree and a startled pheasant broke from its hiding place nearby with a frightening rattle of wings dear god in heaven what now seizing an armful of bandages i abandoned my patient to his caretakers and headed into the forest at a dead run the fog was thicker under the branches and i could see no more than a few feet ahead but the sound of excited shouting and thrashing underbrush guided me in the right direction it brushed past me from behind intent on the shouting i didnt hear it and i didnt see it until it had passed a dark mass moving at incredible speed the absurdly tiny cloven hooves almost silent on the sodden leaves i was so stunned by the suddenness of the apparition that it didnt occur to me at first to be frightened i simply stared into the mist where the bristling black thing had vanished then raising my hand to brush back the ringlets that were curling damply around my face i saw the blotched red streak across it looking down i found a matching streak on my skirt the beast was wounded had the scream come from the boar perhaps i thought not i knew the sound of mortal wounding and the pig was moving well under its own power when it had passed me i took a deep breath and went on into the wall of mist in search of a wounded man i found him at the bottom of a small slope surrounded by kilted men they had spread their plaids over him to keep him warm but the cloth covering his legs was ominously dark with wetness a wide scrape of black mud showed where he had tumbled down the length of the slope and a scrabble of muddied leaves and churned earth where he had met the boar i sank to my knees beside the man pulled back the cloth and set to work i had scarcely begun when the shouts of the men around us made me turn to see the nightmare shape appear once more soundless out of the trees this time i had time to see the dagger hilt protruding from the beasts side perhaps the work of the man on the ground before me and the wicked yellow ivory stained red as the mad little eyes the men around me as stunned as i was began to stir and reach for weapons faster than the rest a tall man seized a boarspear from the hands of a companion who stood frozen and stepped out into the clearing it was dougal mackenzie he walked almost casually carrying the spear low braced in both hands as though about to lift a spadeful of dirt he was intent on the beast speaking to it in an undertone murmuring in gaelic as though to coax the beast from the shelter of the tree it stood beside the first charge was sudden as an explosion the beast shot past so closely that the brown hunting tartan flapped in the breeze of its passing it spun at once and came back a blur of muscular rage dougal leapt aside like a bullfighter jabbing at it with his spear back forth and again it was less a rampage than a dance both adversaries rooted in strength but so nimble they seemed to float above the ground the whole thing lasted only a minute or so though it seemed much longer it ended when dougal whirling aside from the slashing tusks raised the point of the short stout spear and drove it straight down between the beasts sloping shoulders there was the thunk of the spear and a shrill squealing noise that made the hairs stand up along my forearms the small piggy eyes cast to and fro veering wildly in search of nemesis and the dainty hooves sank deep in mud as the boar staggered and lurched the squealing went on rising to an inhuman pitch as the heavy body toppled to one side driving the protruding dagger hiltdeep in the hairy flesh the delicate hooves spurned the ground churning up thick clods of damp earth the squeal stopped abruptly there was silence for a moment and then a thoroughly piggish grunt and the bulk was still dougal had not waited to make sure of the kill but had circled the twitching animal and made his way back to the injured man he sank to his knees and put an arm behind the victims shoulders taking the place of the man who had been supporting him a fine spray of blood had spattered the high cheekbones and drying droplets matted his hair on one side now then geordie he said rough voice suddenly gentle now then ive got him man its all right dougal ist you man the wounded man turned his head in dougals direction struggling to open his eyes i was surprised listening as i rapidly checked the mans pulse and vital signs dougal the fierce dougal the ruthless was speaking to the man in a low voice repeating words of comfort hugging the man hard against him stroking the tumbled hair i sat back on my heels and reached again toward the pile of cloths on the ground beside me there was a deep wound running at least eight inches from the groin down the length of the thigh from which the blood was gushing in a steady flow it wasnt spurting though the femoral artery wasnt cut which meant there was a good chance of stopping it what couldnt be stopped was the ooze from the mans belly where the ripping tushes had laid open skin muscles mesentery and gut alike there were no large vessels severed there but the intestine was punctured i could see it plainly through the jagged rent in the mans skin this sort of abdominal wound was frequently fatal even with a modern operating room sutures and antibiotics readily to hand the contents of the ruptured gut spilling out into the body cavity simply contaminated the whole area and made infection a deadly certainty and here with nothing but cloves of garlic and yarrow flowers to treat it with my gaze met dougals as he also looked down at the hideous wound his lips moved mouthing soundlessly over the mans head the words can he live i shook my head mutely he paused for a moment holding geordie then reached forward and deliberately untied the emergency tourniquet i had placed around the mans thigh he looked at me challenging me to protest but i made no move save a small nod i could staunch the bleeding and allow the man to be transported by litter back to the castle back to the castle there to linger in increasing agony as the belly wound festered until the corruption spread far enough finally to kill him wallowing perhaps for days in longdrawnout pain a better death perhaps was what dougal was giving him to die cleanly under the sky his hearts blood staining the same leaves dyed by the blood of the beast that killed him i crawled over the damp leaves to geordies head and took half his weight on my own arm it will be better soon i said and my voice was steady as it always was as it had been trained to be the pain will be better soon aye its better now i canna feel my leg anymore nor my hands dougal are ye there are ye there man the numb hands were blindly flailing before the mans face dougal grasped them firmly between his own and leaned close murmuring in the mans ear geordies back arched suddenly and his heels dug deeply into the muddy ground his body in violent protest at what his mind had begun already to accept he gasped deeply from time to time as a man who is bleeding to death gulps for air hungry for the oxygen that his body is starving for the forest was very quiet no birds sang in the mist and the men who waited patiently hunkered in the shadow of the trees were silent as the trees themselves dougal and i leaned close together over the struggling body murmuring and comforting sharing the messy heartrending and necessary task of helping a man to die the trip up the hill to the castle was silent i walked beside the dead man borne on a makeshift litter of pine boughs behind us borne in precisely similar fashion came the body of his foe dougal walked ahead alone as we entered the gate to the main courtyard i caught sight of the tubby little figure of father bain the village priest hurrying belatedly to the aid of his fallen parishioner dougal paused reaching out to stay me as i turned toward the stair leading to the surgery the bearers with geordies plaidshrouded body on its litter passed on heading toward the chapel leaving us together in the deserted corridor dougal held me by the wrist looking me over intently youve seen men die before he said flatly by violence not a question almost an accusation many of them i said just as flatly and pulling myself free i left him standing there and went to tend my living patient the death of geordie hideous as it was put only a momentary damper on the celebrations a lavish funeral mass was said over him that afternoon in the castle chapel and the games began the next morning i saw little of them being occupied in patching up the participants all i could say for sure of authentic highland games is that they were played for keeps i bound up some fumblefoot who had managed to slash himself trying to dance between swords i set the broken leg of a hapless victim whod got in the way of a carelessly thrown hammer and i doled out castor oil and nasturtium syrup to countless children who had overindulged in sweeties by late afternoon i was near exhaustion i climbed up on the surgery table in order to poke my head out of the tiny window for some air the shouts and laughter and music from the field where the games were held had ceased good no more new patients then at least not until tomorrow what had rupert said they were going to do next archery hmm i checked the supply of bandages and wearily closed the surgery door behind me leaving the castle i trailed downhill toward the stables i could do with some good nonhuman nonspeaking nonbleeding company i also had in mind that i might find jamie whatever his last name was and try again to apologize for involving him in the oathtaking true he had brought it off well but clearly he would not have been there at all left to his own devices as to the gossip rupert might now be spreading about our supposed amorous dalliance i preferred not to think as to my own predicament i preferred not to think about that either but i would have to sooner or later having so spectacularly failed to escape at the beginning of the gathering i wondered whether the chances might be better at the end true most of the horses would be leaving along with the visitors but there would be a number of castle horses still available and with luck the disappearance of one would be put down to random thievery there were plenty of villainouslooking scoundrels hanging about the fairground and the games and in the confusion of leaving it might be some time before anyone discovered that i was gone i scuffed along the paddock fence pondering escape routes the difficulty was that i had only the vaguest idea where i was with reference to where i wanted to go and since i was now known to virtually every mackenzie between leoch and the border thanks to my doctoring at the games i would not be able to ask directions i wondered suddenly whether jamie had told colum or dougal of my abortive attempt to escape on the night of the oathtaking neither of them had mentioned it to me so perhaps not there were no horses out in the paddock i pushed open the stable door and my heart skipped a beat to see both jamie and dougal seated side by side on a bale of hay they looked almost as startled at my appearance as i was at theirs but gallantly rose and invited me to sit down thats all right i said backing toward the door i didnt mean to intrude on your conversation nay lass said dougal what ive just been saying to young jamie here concerns you too i cast a quick look at jamie who responded with a trace of a headshake so he hadnt told dougal about my attempted escape i sat down a bit wary of dougal i remembered that little scene in the corridor on the night of the oathtaking though he had not referred to it since by word or gesture im leaving in two days time he said abruptly and im taking the two of you with me taking us where i asked startled my heart began to beat faster through the mackenzie lands colum doesna travel so visiting the tenants and tacksmen that canna come to the gathering thats left to me and to take care of the bits of business here and there he waved a hand dismissing these as trivial but why me why us i mean i demanded he considered for a moment before answering why jamies a handy lad wi the horses and as to you lass colum thought it wise i should take ye along as far as fort william the commander there might be able to assist ye in finding your family in france or to assist you i thought in determining who i really am and how much else are you not telling me dougal stared down at me obviously wondering how i would take this news all right i said tranquilly that sounds a good idea outwardly tranquil inwardly i was rejoicing what luck now i wouldnt have to try to escape from the castle dougal would take me most of the way himself and from fort william i thought i could find my own way without much difficulty to craigh na dun to the circle of standing stones and with luck back home part three on the road chapter conversations with a lawyer we rode out of the gates of castle leoch two days later just before dawn in twos and threes and fours to the sound of shouted farewells and the calls of wild geese on the loch the horses stepped their way carefully over the stone bridge i glanced behind from time to time until the bulk of the castle disappeared at last behind a curtain of shimmering mist the thought that i would never again see that grim pile of stone or its inhabitants gave me an odd feeling of regret the noise of the horses hooves seemed muffled in the fog voices carried strangely through the damp air so that calls from one end of the long string were sometimes heard easily at the other while the sounds of nearby conversations were lost in broken murmurs it was like riding through a vapor peopled by ghosts disembodied voices floated in the air speaking far away then remarkably near at hand my place fell in the middle of the party flanked on the one side by a manatarms whose name i did not know and on the other by ned gowan the little scribe i had seen at work in colums hall he was something more than a scribe i found as we fell into conversation on the road ned gowan was a solicitor born bred and educated in edinburgh he looked the part thoroughly a small elderly man of neat precise habits he wore a coat of fine broadcloth fine woolen hose a linen shirt whose stock bore the merest suggestion of lace and breeches of a fabric that was a nicely judged compromise between the rigors of travel and the status of his calling a small pair of goldrimmed halfspectacles a neat hairribbon and a bicorne of blue felt completed the picture he was so perfectly the quintessential man of law that i couldnt look at him without smiling he rode alongside me on a quiet mare whose saddle was burdened with two enormous bags of worn leather he explained that one held the tools of his trade inkhorn quills and papers and whats the other for i asked eyeing it while the first bag was plump with its contents the second seemed nearly empty oh thats for his lairdships rents the lawyer replied patting the limp bag he must be expecting rather a lot then i suggested mr gowan shrugged goodnaturedly not so much as all that mdear but the most of it will be in doits and pence and other small coins and such unfortunately take up more room than the larger denominations of currency he smiled a quick curve of thin dry lips at that a weighty mass of copper and silver is still easier of transport than the bulk of his lairdships income he turned to direct a piercing look over his shoulder at the two large muledrawn wagons that accompanied the party bags of grain and bunches of turnips have at least the benefit of lack of motion fowl if suitably trussed and caged i have nae argument with nor with goats though they prove some inconvenience in terms of their omnivorous habits one ate a handkerchief of mine last year though i admit the fault was mine in allowin the fabric to protrude injudiciously from my coatpocket the thin lips set in a determined line i have given explicit directions this year though we shall not accept live pigs the necessity of protecting mr gowans saddlebags and the two wagons explained the presence of the twenty or so men who made up the rest of the rentcollecting party i supposed all were armed and mounted and there were a number of pack animals bearing what i assumed were supplies for the sustenance of the party mrs fitz among her farewells and exhortations had told me that accommodations would be primitive or nonexistent with many nights spent encamped along the road i was quite curious to know what had led a man of mr gowans obvious qualifications to take up a post in the remote scottish highlands far from the amenities of civilized life to which he must be accustomed well as to that he said in answer to my questions as a young man i had a small practice in edinburgh with lace curtains in the window and a shiny brass plate by the door with my name inscribed upon it but i grew rather tired of making wills and drawing up conveyances and seeing the same faces in the street day after day so i left he said simply he had purchased a horse and some supplies and set off with no idea where he was going or what to do once he got there ye see i must confess he said dabbing his nose primly with a monogrammed handkerchief to something of a taste for adventure however neither my stature nor my family background had fitted me for the life of highwayman or seafarer which were the most adventurous occupations i could envision at the time as an alternative i determined that my best path lay upward into the highlands i thought that in time i might perhaps induce some clan chieftain to well to allow me to serve him in some way and in the course of his travels he had in fact encountered such a chieftain jacob mackenzie he said with a fond reminiscent smile and a wicked red auld rascal he was mr gowan nodded toward the front of the line where jamie mactavishs bright hair blazed in the mist his grandsons verra like him ye ken we met first at the point of a pistol jacob and i as he was robbing me i yielded my horse and my bags with good grace having little other choice but i believe he was a bit taken aback when i insisted upon accompanying him on foot if necessary jacob mackenzie that would be colum and dougals father i asked the elderly lawyer nodded aye of course he was not laird then that happened a few years later with a very small bit of assistance from me he added modestly things were less civilized then he said nostalgically oh were they i said politely and colum er inherited you so to speak something of the kind mr gowan said there was a wee bit o confusion when jacob died dye see colum was heir to leoch to be sure but he the lawyer paused looking ahead and behind to see that no one was close enough to listen the manatarms had ridden forward though to catch up with some of his mates and a good four lengths separated us from the wagondriver behind colum was a whole man to the age of eighteen or so he resumed his story and gave promise to be a fine leader he took letitia to wife as part of an alliance with the camerons i drew up the marriage contract he added as a footnote but soon after the marriage he had a bad fall during a raid broke the long bone of his thigh and it mended poorly i nodded it would have of course and then mr gowan went on with a sigh he rose from his bed too soon and took a tumble down the stairs that broke the other leg he lay in his bed close on a year but it soon became clear that the damage was permanent and that was when jacob died unfortunately the little man paused to marshal his thoughts he glanced ahead again as though looking for someone failing to find them he settled back into the saddle that was about the time there was all the fuss about his sisters marriage too he said and dougal well im afraid dougal did not acquit himself so verra weel over that affair otherwise dye see dougal might have been made chief at the time but twas felt hed not the judgment for it yet he shook his head oh there was a great stramash about it all there were cousins and uncles and tacksmen and a great gathering to decide the matter but they did choose colum after all i said i marveled once again at the force of personality of colum mackenzie and casting an eye at the withered little man who rode at my side i rather thought colum had also had some luck in choosing his allies they did but only because the brothers stood firm together there was nae doubt ye see of colums courage nor yet of his mind but only of his body twas clear hed never be able to lead his men into battle again but there was dougal sound and whole if a bit reckless and hotheaded and he stood behind his brothers chair and vowed to follow colums word and be his legs and his swordarm in the field so a suggestion was made that colum be allowed to become laird as he should in the ordinary way and dougal be made war chieftain to lead the clan in time of battle it was a situation not without precedent he added primly the modesty with which he had said a suggestion was made made it clear just whose suggestion it had been and whose man are you i asked colums or dougals my interests must lie with the mackenzie clan as a whole mr gowan said circumspectly but as a matter of form i have sworn my oath to colum a matter of form my foot i thought i had seen that oathtaking though i did not recall the small form of the lawyer specifically among so many men no man could have been present at that ceremony and remained unmoved not even a born solicitor and the little man on the bay mare dry as his bones might be and steeped to the marrow in the law had by his own testimony the soul of a romantic he must find you a great help i said diplomatically oh i do a bit from time to time he said in a small way as i do for others should ye find yourself in need of advice mdear he said beaming genially do feel free to call upon me my discretion may be relied upon i do assure you he bowed quaintly from his saddle to the same extent as your loyalty to colum mackenzie i said arching my brows the small brown eyes met mine full on and i saw both the cleverness and the humor that lurked in their faded depths ah weel he said without apology worth a try i suppose so i said more amused than angered but i assure you mr gowan that i have no need of your discretion at least at present its catching i thought hearing myself i sound just like him i am an english lady i added firmly and nothing more colum is wasting his time and yours in trying to extract secrets from me that dont exist or that do exist but are untellable i thought mr gowans discretion might be limitless but not his belief he didnt send you along just to coerce me into damaging revelations did he i demanded suddenly struck by the thought oh no mr gowan gave a short laugh at the idea no indeed mdear i fulfill an essential function in managing the records and receipts for dougal and performing such small legal requirements that the clansmen in the more distant areas may have and i am afraid that even at my advanced age i have not entirely outgrown the urge to seek adventure things are much more settled now than they used to be he heaved a sigh that might have been one of regret but there is always the possibility of robbery along the road or attack near the borders he patted the second bag on his saddle this bag is not entirely empty ye ken he turned back the flap long enough for me to see the gleaming grips of a pair of scrollhandled pistols snugly set in twin loops that kept them within easy reach he surveyed me with a glance that took in every detail of my costume and appearance ye should really be armed yourself mdear he said in a tone of mild reproof though i suppose dougal thought it would not be suitable still ill speak to him about it he promised we passed the rest of the day in pleasant conversation wandering among his reminiscences of the dear departed days when men were men and the pernicious weed of civilization was less rampant upon the bonny wild face of the highlands at nightfall we made camp in a clearing beside the road i had a blanket rolled and tied behind my saddle and with this i prepared to spend my first night of freedom from the castle as i left the fire and made my way to a spot behind the trees though i was conscious of the glances that followed me even in the open air it seemed freedom had definite limits we reached the first stoppingplace near noon of the second day it was no more than a cluster of three or four huts set off the road at the foot of a small glen a stool was brought out from one of the cottages for dougals use and a plank thoughtfully brought along in one of the wagons laid across two others to serve as a writing surface for mr gowan he withdrew an enormous square of starched linen from the tailpocket of his coat and laid it neatly over a stump temporarily withdrawn from its usual function as chopping block he seated himself upon this and began to lay out inkhorn ledgers and receiptbook as composed in his manner as though he were still behind his lace curtains in edinburgh one by one the men from the nearby crofts appeared to conduct their annual business with the lairds representative this was a leisurely affair and conducted with a good deal less formality than the goingson in the hall of castle leoch each man came fresh from field or shed and drawing up a vacant stool sat alongside dougal in apparent equality explaining complaining or merely chatting some were accompanied by a sturdy son or two bearing bags of grain or wool at the conclusion of each conversation the indefatigable ned gowan would write out a receipt for the payment of the years rent record the transaction neatly in his ledger and flick a finger to one of the drovers who would obligingly heave the payment onto a wagon less frequently a small heap of coins would disappear into the depths of his leather bag with a faint chinking sound meanwhile the menatarms lounged beneath the trees or disappeared up the wooded bank to hunt i supposed variations of this scene were repeated over the next few days now and then i would be invited into a cottage for cider or milk and all of the women would crowd into the small single room to talk with me sometimes a cluster of rude huts would be large enough to support a tavern or even an inn which became dougals headquarters for the day once in a while the rents would include a horse a sheep or other livestock these were generally traded to someone in the neighborhood for something more portable or if jamie declared a horse fit for inclusion in the castle stables it would be added to our string i wondered about jamies presence in the party while the young man clearly knew horses well so did most of the men in the party including dougal himself considering also that horses were both a rare sort of payment and usually nothing special in the way of breeding i wondered why it had been thought necessary to bring an expert along it was a week after we had set out in a village with an unpronounceable name that i found out the real reason why dougal had wanted jamie the village though small was large enough to boast a tavern with two or three tables and several rickety stools here dougal held his hearings and collected his rents and after a rather indigestible luncheon of salt beef and turnips he held court buying ale for the tenants and cottars who had lingered after their transactions and a few villagers who drifted in when their daily work was completed to gawk at the strangers and hear such news as we carried i sat quietly on a settle in the corner sipping sour ale and enjoying the respite from horseback i was paying little attention to dougals talk which shifted back and forth between gaelic and english ranging from bits of gossip and farming talk to what sounded like vulgar jokes and meandering stories i was wondering idly how long at this rate it might take to reach fort william and once there exactly how i might best part company with the scots of castle leoch without becoming equally entangled with the english army garrison lost in my own thoughts i had not noticed that dougal had been speaking for some time alone as though making a speech of some kind his hearers were following him intently with occasional brief interjections and exclamations coming gradually back to an awareness of my surroundings i realized that he was skillfully rousing his audience to a high pitch of excitement about something i glanced around fat rupert and the little lawyer ned gowan sat against the wall behind dougal tankards of ale forgotten on the bench beside them as they listened intently jamie frowning into his own tankard leaned forward with his elbows on the table whatever dougal was saying he didnt seem to care for it with no warning dougal stood seized jamies collar and pulled old and shabbily made to begin with the shirt tore cleanly down the seams taken completely by surprise jamie froze his eyes narrowed and i saw his jaw set tightly but he didnt move as dougal spread aside the ripped flaps of cloth to display his back to the onlookers there was a general gasp at sight of the scarred back then a buzz of excited indignation i opened my mouth then caught the word sassenach spoken with no kindly intonation and shut it again jamie with a face like stone stood and stepped back from the small crowd clustering around him he carefully peeled off the remnants of his shirt wadding the cloth into a ball an elderly little woman who reached the level of his elbow was shaking her head and patting his back gingerly making what i assumed were comforting remarks in gaelic if so they were clearly not having the hopedfor effect he replied tersely to a few questions from the men present the two or three young girls who had come in to fetch their families dinner ale were clustered together against the far wall whispering intently to each other with frequent bigeyed glances across the room with a look at dougal that should by rights have turned the older man to stone jamie tossed the ruins of his shirt into a corner of the hearth and left the room in three long strides shaking off the sympathetic murmurs of the crowd deprived of spectacle their attentions turned back to dougal i didnt understand most of the comment though the bits i caught seemed to be highly antienglish in nature i was torn between wanting to follow jamie outside and staying inconspicuously where i was i doubted that he wanted any company though so i shrank back into my corner and kept my head down studying my blurry pale reflection in the surface of my tankard the clink of metal made me look up one of the men a sturdylooking crofter in leather trews had tossed a few coins on the table in front of dougal and seemed to be making a short speech of his own he stood back thumbs braced in his belt as though daring the rest to something after an uncertain pause one or two bold souls followed suit and then a few more digging copper doits and pence out of purse and sporran dougal thanked them heartily waving a hand at the landlord for another round of ale i noticed that the lawyer ned gowan was tidily stowing the new contributions in a separate pouch from that used for the mackenzie rents bound for colums coffers and i realized what the purpose of dougals little performance must be rebellions like most other business propositions require capital the raising and provisioning of an army takes gold as does the maintenance of its leaders and from the little i remembered of bonnie prince charlie the young pretender to the throne part of his support had come from france but part of the finances behind his unsuccessful rising had come from the shallow threadbare pockets of the people he proposed to rule so colum or dougal or both were jacobites supporters of the young pretender against the lawful occupant of the throne of england george ii finally the last of the cottars and tenants drifted away to their dinners and dougal stood up and stretched looking moderately satisfied like a cat that has dined at least on milk if not cream he weighed the smaller pouch and tossed it back to ned gowan for safekeeping aye well enough he remarked canna expect a great deal from such a small place but manage enough of the same and it will be a respectable sum respectable is not quite the word id use i said rising stiffly from my lurking place dougal turned as though noticing me for the first time no he said mouth curling in amusement why not have ye an objection to loyal subjects contributing their mite in support of their sovereign none i said meeting his stare no matter which sovereign it is its your collection methods i dont care for dougal studied me carefully as though my features might tell him something no matter which sovereign it is he repeated softly i thought ye had no gaelic i havent i said shortly but ive the sense i was born with and two ears in good working order and whatever king georges health may be in gaelic i doubt very much that it sounds like bragh stuart he tossed back his head and laughed that it doesna he agreed id tell ye the proper gaelic for your liege lord and ruler but it isna a word suitable for the lips of a lady sassenach or no stooping he plucked the balledup shirt out of the ashes of the hearth and shook the worst of the soot off it since ye dinna care for my methods perhaps yed wish to remedy them he suggested thrusting the ruined shirt into my hands get a needle from the lady of the house and mend it mend it yourself i shoved it back into his arms and turned to leave suit yourself dougal said pleasantly from behind me jamie can mend his own shirt then if youre not disposed to help i stopped then turned reluctantly hand out all right i began but was interrupted by a large hand that snaked over my shoulder and snatched the shirt from dougals grasp dividing an opaque glance evenly between us jamie tucked the shirt under his arm and left the room as silently as he had entered it we found accommodation for the night at a crofters cottage or i should say i did the men slept outside disposed in various haystacks wagonbeds and patches of bracken in deference to my sex or my status as semicaptive i was provided with a pallet on the floor inside near the hearth while my pallet seemed vastly preferable to the single bedstead in which the entire family of six was sleeping i rather envied the men their openair sleeping arrangements the fire was not put out only damped for the night and the air in the cottage was stifling with warmth and the scents and sounds of the tossing turning groaning snoring sweating farting inhabitants after some time i gave up any thought of sleeping in that smothered atmosphere i rose and stole quietly outside taking a blanket with me the air outside was so fresh by contrast with the congestion in the cottage that i leaned against the stone wall gulping in enormous lungfuls of the delicious cool stuff there was a guard sitting in quiet watchfulness under a tree by the path but he merely glanced at me apparently deciding that i was not going far in my shift he went back to whittling at a small object in his hands the moon was bright and the blade of the tiny sgian dhu flickered in the leafy shadows i walked around the cottage and a little way up the hill behind it careful to watch for slumbering forms in the grass i found a pleasant private spot between two large boulders and made a comfortable nest for myself from heaped grass and the blanket stretched at length on the ground i watched the full moon on its slow voyage across the sky just so had i watched the moon rise from the window of castle leoch on my first night as colums unwilling guest a month then since my calamitous passage through the circle of standing stones at least i now thought i knew why the stones had been placed there likely of no particular importance in themselves they were markers just as a signpost warns of rockfalls near a cliffedge the standing stones were meant to mark a spot of danger a spot where what where the crust of time was thin where a gate of some sort stood ajar not that the makers of the circles would have known what it was they were marking to them the spot would have been one of terrible mystery and powerful magic a spot where people disappeared without warning or appeared perhaps out of thin air that was a thought what would have happened i wondered had anyone been present on the hill of craigh na dun when i made my abrupt appearance i supposed it might depend on the time one entered here had a cottar encountered me under such circumstances i would doubtless have been thought a witch or a fairy more likely a fairy popping into existence on that particular hill with its reputation and that might well be where its reputation came from i thought if people through the years had suddenly disappeared or just as suddenly appeared from nowhere at a certain spot it might with good reason acquire a name for enchantment i poked a foot out from under the blanket and waggled my long toes in the moonlight most unfairylike i decided critically at five foot six i was quite a tall woman for these times as tall as many men since i could hardly pass as one of the wee folk then i would likely have been thought a witch or an evil spirit of some kind from the little i knew of current methods for dealing with such manifestations i could only be grateful that no one in fact had seen me appear i wondered idly what would happen if it worked the other way what if someone disappeared from this time and popped up in my own that after all was precisely what i was intending to do if there were any possible way of managing it how would a modernday scot like mrs buchanan the postmistress react if someone like murtagh for instance were suddenly to spring from the earth beneath her feet the most likely reaction i thought would be to run to summon the police or perhaps to do nothing at all beyond telling ones friends and neighbors about the most extraordinary thing that happened the other day as for the visitor well he might manage to fit into the new time without arousing excessive attention if he was cautious and lucky after all i was managing to pass with some success as a normal resident of this time and place though my appearance and language had certainly aroused plenty of suspicion what if a displaced person were too different though or went about loudly proclaiming what had happened to him if the exit were in primitive times likely a conspicuous stranger would simply have been killed on the spot without further inquiry and in more enlightened times they would most likely be considered mad and tidied away into an institution somewhere if they didnt quiet down this sort of thing could have been going on as long the earth itself i reflected even when it happened in front of witnesses there would be no clues at all nothing to tell what had happened because the only person who knew would be gone and as for the disappeared theyd likely keep their mouths shut at the other end deep in my thoughts i hadnt noticed the faint murmur of voices or the stirrings of footsteps through the grass and i was quite startled to hear a voice speak only a few yards away devil take ye dougal mackenzie it said kinsman or no i dinna owe ye that the voice was pitched low but tight with anger do ye no said another voice faintly amused i seem to recall a certain oath giving your obedience so long as my feet rest on the lands of clan mackenzie i believe was the way of it there was a soft thud as of a foot stamping packed earth and mackenzie land it is laddie i gave my word to colum not to you so it was young jamie mactavish and precisely three guesses as to what he was upset about one and the same man and ye ken it well there was the sound of a light slap as of a hand against a cheek your obedience is to the chieftain of the clan and outside of leoch i am colums head and arms and hands as well as his legs and never saw i a better case of the right hand not knowin what the left is up to came the quick rejoinder despite the bitterness of the tone there was a lurking wit that enjoyed this clash of wills what dye think the right is going to say about the left collecting gold for the stuarts there was a brief pause before dougal replied mackenzies and macbeolains and macvinichs theyre free men all none can force them to give against their will and none can stop them either and who knows it may happen that colum will give more for prince charles edward than all o them put together in the end it may the deeper voice agreed it may rain straight up tomorrow instead of down as well that doesna mean ill stand waiting at the stairhead wi my wee bucket turned upside down no youve more to gain from a stuart throne than i have laddie and naught from the english save a noose if ye dinna care for your own silly neck my neck is my own concern jamie interrupted savagely and so is my back not while ye travel with me sweet lad said his uncles mocking voice if ye wish to hear what horrocks may tell ye youll do as youre told yourself and wise to do it at that a fine hand ye may be wi a needle but youve no but the one clean shirt there was a shifting as of someone rising from his seat on a rock and the soft passage of footsteps through the grass only one set of footsteps though i thought i sat up as quietly as i could and peered cautiously around the edge of one of the boulders that hid me jamie was still there sitting hunched on a rock a few feet away elbows braced on his knees chin sunk on his locked hands his back was mostly to me i started to ease backward not wishing to intrude on his solitude when he suddenly spoke i know youre there he said come out if ye like from his tone it was a matter of complete indifference to him i rose and started to come out when i realized i had been lying in my shift reflecting that he had enough to worry about without needing to blush for me as well i tactfully wrapped myself in the blanket before emerging i sat down near him and leaned back against a rock watching him a little diffidently beyond a brief nod of acknowledgment he ignored me completely occupied with inward thoughts of no very pleasant form to judge from the dark frown on his face one foot tapped restlessly against the rock he sat on and he twisted his fingers together clenching then spreading them with a force that made several knuckles pop with soft crackling sounds it was the popping knuckles that reminded me of captain manson the supply officer for the field hospital where i had worked captain manson suffered shortages missed deliveries and the endless idiocies of the army bureaucracy as his own personal slings and arrows normally a mild and pleasantspoken man when the frustrations became too great he would retire briefly into his private office and punch the wall behind the door with all the force he could muster visitors in the outer reception area would watch in fascination as the flimsy wallboard quivered under the force of the blows a few moments later captain manson would reemerge bruised of knuckle but once more calm of spirit to deal with the current crisis by the time he was transferred to another unit the wall behind his door was pocked with dozens of fistsized holes watching the young man on the rock trying to disjoint his own fingers i was forcibly reminded of the captain facing some insoluble problem of supply you need to hit something i said eh he looked up in surprise apparently having forgotten i was there hit something i advised youll feel better for it his mouth quirked as though about to say something but instead he rose from his rock headed decisively for a sturdylooking cherry tree and dealt it a solid blow apparently finding this some palliative to his feelings he smashed the quivering trunk several times more causing a delirious shower of palepink petals to rain down upon his head sucking a grazed knuckle he came back a moment later thank ye he said with a wry smile perhaps ill sleep tonight after all did you hurt your hand i rose to examine it but he shook his head rubbing the knuckles gently with the palm of the other hand nay its nothing we stood a moment in awkward silence i didnt want to refer to the scene i had overheard or to the earlier events of the evening i broke the silence finally by saying i didnt know you were a lefty a lefty oh cackhanded ye mean aye always have been the schoolmaster used to tie that one to my belt behind my back to make me write wi the other can you write with the other i mean he nodded reapplying the injured hand to his mouth aye makes my head ache to do it though do you fight lefthanded too i asked wanting to distract him with a sword i mean he was wearing no arms at the moment except his dirk and sgian dhu but during the day he customarily wore both sword and pistols as did most of the men in the party no i use a sword well enough in either hand a lefthanded swordsmans at a disadvantage ye ken wi a smallsword for ye fight wi your left side turned to the enemy and your hearts on that side dye see too filled with nervous energy to keep still he had begun to stride about the grassy clearing making illustrative gestures with an imaginary sword it makes little difference wi a broadsword he said he extended both arms straight out hands together and swept them in a flat graceful arc through the air ye use both hands usually he explained or if youre close enough to use only one it doesna matter much which for you come down from above and cleave the man through the shoulder not the head he added instructively for the blade may slip off easy catch him clean in the notch though he chopped the edge of his hand at the juncture of neck and shoulder and hes dead and if its not a clean cut still the man will no fight again that day or ever likely he added his left hand dropped to his belt and he drew the dirk in a motion like water pouring from a glass now to fight wi sword and dirk together he said if ye have no targe to shelter your dirk hand then you favor the right side wi the smallsword in that hand and come up from underneath wi the dirk if ye fight in close but if the dirk hand is well shielded ye can come from either side and twist your body about he ducked and weaved illustrating to keep the enemys blade away and use the dirk only if ye lose the sword or the use of the sword arm he dropped low and brought the blade up in a swift murderous jab that stopped an inch short of my breast i stepped back involuntarily and at once he stood upright sheathing the dirk with an apologetic smile im sorry im showin off i didna mean to startle ye youre awfully good i said with sincerity who taught you to fight i asked id think youd need another lefthanded fighter to show you aye it was a lefthanded fighter the best ive ever seen he smiled briefly without humor dougal mackenzie most of the cherry blossoms had fallen from his head by now only a few pink petals clung to his shoulders and i reached out to brush them away the seam of his shirt had been mended neatly i saw if without artistry even a rip through the fabric had been catchstitched together hell do it again i said abruptly unable to stop myself he paused before answering but there was no pretense of not understanding what i meant oh aye he said at last nodding it gets him what he wants ye see and youll let him do it let him use you that way he looked past me down the hill toward the tavern where a single light still showed through chinks in the timbers his face was smooth and blank as a wall for now we continued on our rounds moving no more than a few miles a day often stopping for dougal to conduct business at a crossroads or a cottage where several tenants would gather with their bags of grain and bits of carefully hoarded money all was recorded in ledgers by the quickmoving pen of ned gowan and such receipts as were needed dispensed from his scrapbag of parchment and papers and when we reached a hamlet or village large enough to boast an inn or tavern dougal would once more do his turn standing drinks telling stories making speeches and finally if he judged the prospects good enough he would force jamie to his feet to show his scars and a few more coins would be added to the second bag the purse bound for france and the court of the pretender i tried to judge such scenes as they developed and step outside before the climax public crucifixion never having been much to my taste while the initial reaction to the sight of jamies back was horrified pity followed by bursts of invective against the english army and king george often there was a slight flavor of contempt that even i could pick up on one occasion i heard one man remark softly to a friend in english an awfu sight man is it no christ id die in my blood before i let a wheyfaced sassenach to use me so angry and miserable to start with jamie grew more wretched each day he would shrug back into his shirt as soon as possible avoiding questions and commiseration and seek an excuse to leave the gathering avoiding everyone until we took horse the following morning the breaking point came a few days later in a small village called tunnaig this time dougal was still exhorting the crowd a hand on jamies bare shoulder when one of the onlookers a young lout with long dirty brown hair made some personal remark to jamie i couldnt tell what was said but the effect was instantaneous jamie wrenched out of dougals grasp and hit the lad in the stomach knocking him flat i was slowly learning to put a few words of gaelic together though i could in no way be said to understand the language yet however i had noticed that i often could tell what was being said from the attitude of the speaker whether i understood the words or not get up and say that again looks the same said in any schoolyard pub or alley in the world so does right you are mate and get him lads jamie disappeared under an avalanche of grimy work clothes as the rentstable went over with a crash beneath the weight of brownhair and two of his friends innocent bystanders pressed back against the walls of the tavern and prepared to enjoy the spectacle i sidled closer to ned and murtagh eyeing the heaving mass of limbs uneasily a lonely flash of red hair showed occasionally in the twisting sea of arms and legs shouldnt you help him i murmured to murtagh out of the corner of my mouth he looked surprised at the idea no why hell call for help if he needs it said ned gowan tranquilly watching from my other side whatever you say i subsided doubtfully i wasnt at all sure jamie would be able to call for help if he needed it at the moment he was being throttled by a stout lad in green my personal opinion was that dougal would soon be short one prime exhibit but he didnt seem concerned in fact none of the watchers seemed at all bothered by the mayhem taking place on the floor at our feet a few bets were being taken but the overall air was one of quiet enjoyment of the entertainment i was glad to notice that rupert drifted casually across the path of a couple of men who seemed to be contemplating joining the action as they took a step toward the fray he bumbled absentmindedly into their way hand lightly resting on his dirk they fell back deciding to leave well enough alone the general feeling appeared to be that three to one was reasonable odds given that the one was quite large an accomplished fighter and obviously in the grip of a berserk fury that might be true the contest seemed to be evening out with the abrupt retirement of the stout party in green dripping blood as the result of a wellplaced elbow to the nose it went on for several minutes more but the conclusion became more and more obvious as a second fighter fell by the wayside and rolled under a table moaning and clutching his groin jamie and his original antagonist were still hammering each other earnestly in the middle of the floor but the jamiebackers amongst the spectators were already collecting their winnings a forearm across the windpipe accompanied by a vicious kidney punch decided brownhair that discretion was the better part of valor i added a mental translation of thats enough i give up to my growing gaelicenglish word list jamie rose slowly off the body of his last opponent to the cheers of the crowd nodding breathlessly in acknowledgment he staggered to one of the few benches still standing and flopped down streaming sweat and blood to accept a tankard of ale from the publican gulping it down he set the empty tankard on the bench and leaned forward gasping for breath elbows on his knees and the scars on his back defiantly displayed for once he was in no hurry to resume his shirt in spite of the chill in the pub he remained halfnaked only putting on his shirt to go outside when it was time to seek our lodging for the night he left to a chorus of respectful good nights looking more relaxed than he had in days in spite of the pain from scrapes cuts and assorted contusions one scraped shin one cut eyebrow one split lip one bloody nose six smashed knuckles one sprained thumb and two loosened teeth plus more contusions than i care to count i completed my inventory with a sigh how do you feel we were alone in the small shed behind the inn where i had taken him to administer first aid fine he said grinning he started to stand up but froze halfway grimacing aye well perhaps the ribs hurt a bit of course they hurt youre black and blue again why do you do such things what in gods name do you think youre made of iron i demanded irritably he grinned ruefully and touched his swollen nose no i wish i were i sighed again and prodded him gently around the middle i dont think theyre cracked its only bruises ill strap them though in case stand up straight roll up your shirt and hold your arms out from your sides i began to tear strips from an old shawl id got from the innkeepers wife muttering under my breath about sticking plaster and other amenities of civilized life i improvised a strap dressing pulling it tight and fastening it with the ringbrooch off his plaid i cant breathe he complained if you breathe it will hurt dont move where did you learn to fight like that dougal again no he winced away from the vinegar i was applying to the cut eyebrow my father taught me really what was your father the local boxing champion whats boxing no he was a farmer bred horses too jamie sucked in his breath as i continued the vinegar application on his barked shin when i was nine or ten he said he thought i was going to be big as my mothers folk so id have to learn to fight he was breathing more easily now and held out a hand to let me rub marigold ointment into the knuckles he said if youre sizable half the men ye meet will fear ye and the other half will want to try ye knock one down he said and the rest will let ye be but learn to do it fast and clean or youll be fightin all your life so hed take me to the barn and knock me into the straw until i learned to hit back ow that stings fingernail gouges are nasty wounds i said swabbing busily at his neck especially if the gouger doesnt wash regularly and i doubt that greasyhaired lad bathes once a year fast and clean isnt quite how id describe what you did tonight but it was impressive your father would be proud of you i spoke with some sarcasm and was surprised to see a shadow pass across his face my fathers dead he said flatly im sorry i finished the swabbing then said softly but i meant it he would be proud of you he didnt answer but gave me a halfsmile in reply he suddenly seemed very young and i wondered just how old he was i was about to ask when a raspy cough from behind announced a visitor to the shed it was the stringy little man named murtagh he eyed jamies strappedup ribs with some amusement and lobbed a small wash leather bag through the air jamie put up a large hand and caught it easily with a small clinking sound and whats this he asked murtagh raised one sketchy brow your share o the wagers what else jamie shook his head and made to toss the bag back i didna wager anything murtagh raised a hand to stop him you did the work youre a verra popular fellow at the moment at least wi those that backed ye but not with dougal i dont suppose i interjected murtagh was one of those men who always looked a bit startled to find that women had voices but he nodded politely enough aye thats true still i dinna see as that should trouble ye he said to jamie no a glance passed between the two men with a message i didnt understand jamie blew his breath out softly through his teeth nodding slowly to himself when he asked a week ten days perhaps near a place called lag cruime youll know it jamie nodded again looking more content than i had seen him in some time i know it i looked from one face to the other both closed and secretive so murtagh had found out something something to do with the mysterious horrocks perhaps i shrugged whatever the cause it appeared that jamies days as an exhibition were over i suppose dougal can always tapdance instead i said eh the secretive looks changed to looks of startlement never mind sleep well i picked up my box of medical supplies and went to find my own rest chapter the garrison commander we were drawing nearer to fort william and i began to ponder seriously what my plan of action should be once we had arrived there it depended i thought upon what the garrison commander was likely to do if he believed that i was a gentlewoman in distress he might provide me with temporary escort toward the coast and my putative embarkation for france but he might be suspicious of me turning up in the company of the mackenzies still i was patently not a scot myself surely he would not be inclined to think me a spy of some sort that was evidently what colum and dougal thought that i was an english spy which made me wonder what i was meant to be spying on well unpatriotic activities i supposed of which collecting money for the support of prince charles edward stuart pretender to the throne was definitely one but in that case why had dougal allowed me to see him do it he could easily enough have sent me outside before that part of the proceedings of course the proceedings had all been held in gaelic i argued with myself perhaps that was the point though i remembered the odd gleam in his eyes and his question i thought ye had no gaelic perhaps it was a test to see whether i really was ignorant of the language for an english spy scarcely would have been sent into the highlands unable to speak with more than half the people there but no the conversation i had overheard between jamie and dougal would seem to indicate that dougal was indeed a jacobite though colum apparently was not yet my head was beginning to buzz with all these suppositions and i was glad to see that we were approaching a fairly large village likely that meant a good inn as well and a decent supper the inn was in fact commodious by the standards i had grown accustomed to if the bed was apparently designed for midgets and fleabitten ones at that at least it was in a chamber to itself in several of the smaller inns i had slept on a settle in the common room surrounded by snoring male forms and the humped shadows of plaidwrapped shapes customarily i fell asleep immediately whatever the sleeping conditions worn out by a day in the saddle and an evening of dougals politicizing the first evening in an inn though i had remained awake for a good halfhour fascinated by the remarkable variety of noises the male respiratory apparatus could produce an entire dormitory full of student nurses couldnt come close it occurred to me listening to the chorus that men in a hospital ward seldom really snore breathe heavily yes they gasp groan occasionally and sometimes sob or cry out in sleep but there was no comparison to this healthy racket perhaps it was that sick or injured men could not sleep deeply enough to relax into that sort of din if my observations were sound then my companions were plainly in the most robust health they certainly looked it limbs casually asprawl faces slack and glowing in the firelight the complete abandon of their sleep on hard boards was the satisfying of an appetite as hearty as the one they had brought to dinner obscurely comforted by the cacophony i had pulled my traveling cloak around my shoulders and went to sleep myself by comparison i found myself now rather lonely here in the solitary splendor of my tiny smelly attic despite having removed the bedclothes and beaten the mattress to discourage unwelcome cohabitants i had some difficulty in sleeping so silent and dark did the chamber seem after i had blown out the candle there were a few faint echoes from the common room two floors below and a brief flurry of noise and movement but this served only to emphasize my own isolation it was the first time i had been left so completely alone since my arrival at the castle and i was not at all sure i liked it i was hovering uneasily on the verge of sleep when my ears picked up an ominous creaking of floorboards in the hall outside the step was slow and halting as though the intruder hesitated in his path picking the soundestappearing of the boards for each next step i sat bolt upright groping for the candle and flint box by the bed my hand blindly searching struck the flint box and knocked it to the floor with a soft thump i froze and the steps outside did likewise there was a soft scratching at the door as of someone groping for the latch i knew the door was unbolted though it was fitted with brackets for a bolt i had searched unavailingly for the bolt itself before retiring i grabbed the candlestick yanked the stub of the candle out and slid out of bed as quietly as i could clutching the heavy pottery the door squeaked slightly on its hinges as it gave the rooms only window was tightly shuttered against both elements and light nonetheless i could just make out the dim outline of the door as it opened the outline grew then to my surprise it shrank and disappeared as the door shut again everything was quiet once more i stayed pressed against the wall for what seemed like ages holding my breath and trying to hear through the noise of my pounding heart at last i inched toward the door edging carefully around the room next to the wall thinking the floorboards must surely be more solid here i eased my foot down at each step gradually trusting my weight to it then pausing and groping with bare toes for the seam between two boards before setting the other foot as solidly as i could judge once the door was reached i paused ear pressed to the thin panels hands braced on the frame on guard against a sudden bursting inward i thought perhaps i heard slight sounds but wasnt sure was it only the sounds of the activity down below or was it the stifled breathing of someone on the other side of the panel the constant flow of adrenaline was making me slightly sick tiring at last of this nonsense i took a firm grip of my candlestick yanked open the door and rushed into the hallway i say rushed in actuality i took two steps trod heavily on something soft and fell headlong into the passageway skinning my knuckles and banging my head quite painfully on something solid i sat up clutching my brow with both hands completely uncaring that i might be assassinated at any moment the person i had stepped on was swearing in a rather breathless manner through the haze of pain i was dimly aware that he i assumed from the size and the smell of sweat that my visitor was male had risen and was groping for the fastening of the shutters in the wall above us a sudden inrush of fresh air made me wince and shut my eyes when i opened them there was enough light from the night sky for me to see the intruder what are you doing here i asked accusingly at the same time jamie asked in a similarly accusatory tone how much do ye weigh sassenach still a bit addled i actually replied nine stone before thinking to ask why ye nearly crushed my liver he answered gingerly prodding the affected area not to mention scaring living hell out of me he reached a hand down and hauled me to my feet are ye all right no i bumped my head rubbing the spot i looked dazedly around the bare hallway what did i bang it on i demanded ungrammatically my head he said rather grumpily i thought serves you right i said nastily what were you doing sneaking about outside my door he gave me a testy look i wasna sneaking about for gods sake i was sleeping or trying to he rubbed what appeared to be a knot forming on his temple sleeping here i looked up and down the cold bare filthy hallway with exaggerated amazement you do pick the oddest places first stables now this it may interest ye to know that theres a small party of english dragoons stopped in to the taproom below he informed me coldly theyre a bit gone in drink and disporting themselves a bit reckless with two women from the town since theres but the two lasses and five men some of the soldiers seemed a bit inclined to venture upward in search of ah partners i didna think youd care overmuch for such attentions he flipped his plaid back over his shoulder and turned in the direction of the stairway if i was mistaken in that impression then i apologize id no intention of disturbin your rest good een to ye wait a minute he stopped but did not turn back forcing me to walk around him he looked down at me polite but distant thank you i said it was very kind of you im sorry i stepped on you he smiled then his face changing from a forbidding mask to its usual expression of good humor no harm done sassenach he said as soon as the headache goes away and the cracked rib heals ill be good as new he turned back and pushed open the door of my room which had swung shut in the wake of my hasty exit owing to the fact that the builder had apparently constructed the inn without benefit of a plumb line there wasnt a right angle in the place go back to bed then he suggested ill be here i looked at the floor besides its essential hardness and coldness the oaken boards were blotched with expectorations spills and forms of filth i didnt wish even to contemplate the builders mark in the door lintel had said and that was plainly the last time the boards had been cleaned you cant sleep out here i said come in at least the floor in the room isnt quite this bad jamie froze hand on the doorframe sleep in your room with ye he sounded truly shocked i couldna do that your reputation would be ruined he really meant it i started to laugh but converted it into a tactful coughing fit given the exigencies of road travel the crowded state of the inns and the crudity or complete lack of sanitary facilities i was on terms of such physical intimacy with these men jamie included that i found the idea of such prudery hilarious youve slept in the same room with me before i pointed out when i had recovered a bit you and twenty other men he sputtered a bit that isna at all the same thing i mean it was a quite public room and he paused as an awful thought struck him you didna think i meant that you were suggesting anything improper he asked anxiously i assure ye i no no not at all i made haste to reassure him that i had taken no offense seeing that he could not be persuaded i insisted that at the least he must take the blankets from my bed to lie upon he agreed to this reluctantly and only upon my repeated assurances that i would not use them myself in any case but intended to sleep as usual in the cover of my thick traveling cloak i tried to thank him again as i paused by the makeshift pallet before returning to my fetid sanctuary but he waved away my appreciation with a gracious hand it isna entirely disintested kindness on my part ye ken he observed id as soon avoid notice myself i had forgotten that he had his own reasons for keeping away from english soldiery it did not escape me however that this could have been much better accomplished not to say more comfortably by his sleeping in the warm and airy stables rather than on the floor before my door but if anyone does come up here i protested theyll find you then he reached a long arm out to grasp the swinging shutter and pulled it to the hall was plunged in blackness and jamie appeared as no more than a shapeless bulk they canna see my face he pointed out and in the condition theyre in my name would be of no interest to them either even were i to give them the right one which i dinna mean to do thats true i said doubtfully wont they wonder though what youre doing up here in the dark i could see nothing of his face but the tone of his voice told me he was smiling not at all sassenach theyll just think im waiting my turn i laughed and went in then i curled myself on the bed and went to sleep marveling at the mind that could make such ribald jokes even as it recoiled at the thought of sleeping in the same room with me when i awoke jamie was gone going down to breakfast i met dougal at the foot of the stairs waiting for me eat up quickly lass he said you and i are riding to brockton he declined to tell me anything further but he seemed a bit uneasy i thought i ate quickly and we soon found ourselves trotting through the misty early morning birds were busy in the shrubbery and the air gave promise of a warm summer day to come who are we going to see i asked you may as well tell me since if i dont know ill be surprised and if i do im intelligent enough to act surprised anyway dougal cocked an eye at me considering but decided that my argument was sound the garrison commander from fort william he said i felt a minor shock i wasnt quite ready for this i had thought we had three days yet until we reached the fort but were nowhere near fort william i exclaimed mmphm apparently this garrison commander was an energetic sort not content to stay at home minding his garrison he was out inspecting the countryside with a party of dragoons the soldiers who had come to our inn the night before were part of this group and had told dougal that the commander was presently in residence at the inn at brockton this presented a problem and i was silent for the rest of the ride contemplating it i had counted on being able to extract myself from dougals company at fort william which i thought to be within a days travel of the hill of craigh na dun even unprepared for camping and lacking food or other resources i thought i could cover that much ground alone and find my way to the stone circle as to what would happen then well there was no way to tell except by going there but this development threw an unexpected spanner into my plans if i parted company with dougal here as i well might i would be four days ride from the hill not one and i did not have sufficient faith in my sense of direction let alone my endurance to risk it alone on foot among the wild crags and moors the last weeks of rugged travel had given me a wary respect for the jagged rocks and crashing burns of the highlands let alone the occasional wild beast i had no particular desire to meet a boar for example facetoface in some deserted glen we reached brockton at midmorning the mist had burned away and the day was sunny enough to give me a sense of optimism perhaps it would be a simple matter after all to persuade the garrison commander to provide me with a small escort who could see me to the hill i could see why the commander had chosen brockton as his temporary headquarters the village was large enough to boast two taverns one of them an imposing threestory edifice with attached stable here we stopped turning our horses over to the attention of a hostler who moved so slowly as to seem ossified he had barely succeeded in reaching the stable door by the time we were inside and dougal was ordering refreshment from the innkeeper i was left below contemplating a plate of rather stalelooking oatcakes while dougal mounted the stair to the commanders sanctum it felt a bit strange to see him go there were three or four english soldiers in the taproom who eyed me speculatively chatting to each other in low voices after a month among the scots of clan mackenzie the presence of english dragoons made me unaccountably nervous i told myself i was being silly after all they were my own countrymen out of time or not still i found myself missing the congenial company of mr gowan and the pleasant familiarity of jamie whateverhisnamewas i was feeling rather sorry that i had had no chance to bid farewell to anyone before leaving that morning when i heard dougals voice calling from the stair behind me he was standing at the top beckoning me upward he looked somewhat more grim than usual i thought as he stood aside without speaking and gestured me into the room the garrison commander stood by the open window his slim straight figure silhouetted by the light he gave a short laugh when he saw me yes i thought so it had to be you from mackenzies description the door closed behind me and i was alone with captain jonathan randall of his majestys eighth dragoons he was dressed this time in a clean redandfawn uniform with a lacetrimmed stock and a neatly curled and powdered wig but the face was the same franks face my breath caught in my throat this time though i noticed the small lines of ruthlessness around his mouth and the touch of arrogance in the set of his shoulders still he smiled affably enough and invited me to sit down the room was plainly furnished with no more than a desk and chair a long deal table and a few stools captain randall motioned to a young corporal who stood to attention near the door and a mug of ale was clumsily poured and set before me the captain waved the corporal back and poured his own ale then sank gracefully onto a stool across the table from me all right he said pleasantly why dont you tell me who you are and how you come to find yourself here having little choice at this point i told him the same story i had given colum omitting only the less tactful references to his own behavior which he knew about in any case i had no idea how much dougal had told him and didnt wish to risk being tripped up the captain appeared polite but skeptical throughout my recital he took less trouble to hide it than colum had i reflected he rocked back on his stool considering oxfordshire you say there are no beauchamps in oxfordshire that i know of how would you know i snapped youre from sussex yourself his eyes popped open in surprise i could have bitten my tongue and may i ask just how you know that he asked er your voice yes its your accent i said hastily clearly sussex the graceful dark brows nearly touched the curls of his wig neither my tutors nor my parents would be much obliged to hear that my speech so clearly reflects my birthplace madam he said dryly they having gone to considerable trouble and expense to remedy it but being the expert at local speech patterns that you are he turned to the man standing against the wall no doubt you can also identify my corporals place of origin corporal hawkins would you oblige me by reciting something anything at all will do he added seeing the confusion on the mans face some popular verse perhaps the corporal a young man with a stupid beefy face and broad shoulders glanced wildly about the room seeking inspiration then drew himself up to attention and intoned buxom meg she washed my clothes and took them all away i waited thus in sore distress and then i made her pay er that will do corporal thank you randall made a dismissive motion and the corporal subsided against the wall sweating freely well randall turned to me questioning er cheshire i guessed close lancashire he eyed me narrowly putting his hands together behind his back he strolled over to the window and peered out checking to see whether dougal had brought any men with him i wondered suddenly he whirled back to me with an abrupt parlezvous français très bien i promptly replied what of it head to one side he looked me over carefully damme if i think youre french he said as though to himself could be i suppose but ive yet to meet a frenchie could tell a cockney from a cornishman his neatly manicured fingers tapped the wood of the tabletop what was your maiden name mrs beauchamp look captain i said smiling as charmingly as i could entertaining as it is to play twenty questions with you i should really like to conclude these preliminaries and arrange for the continuation of my journey ive already been delayed for some time and you do not help your case by adopting this frivolous attitude madam he interrupted narrowing his eyes i had seen frank do that when displeased about something and i felt a little weak in the knees i put my hands on my thighs to brace myself i have no case to help i said as boldly as i could im making no claims on you the garrison or for that matter on the mackenzies all i want is to be allowed to resume my journey in peace and i see no reason why you ought to have any objection to that he glared at me lips pressed tight together in irritation oh you dont well consider my position for a moment madam and perhaps my objections will become clearer a month ago i was with my men in hot pursuit of a band of unidentified scottish bandits who had absconded with a small herd of cattle from an estate near the border when oh so thats what they were doing i exclaimed i wondered i added lamely captain randall breathed heavily then decided against whatever he had been going to say in favor of continuing his story in the midst of this lawful pursuit he went on in measured tones i encounter a halfdressed englishwoman in a place where no englishwoman should be even with a proper escort who resists my inquiries assaults my person you assaulted mine first i said hotly whose accomplice renders me unconscious by a cowardly attack and who then flees the area plainly with some assistance my men and i searched that area most thoroughly and i assure you madam there was no trace of your murdered servant your plundered baggage your discarded gown nor the merest sign that there is the slightest truth to your story oh i said a little weakly yes furthermore there have been no reports of bandits in that area within the last four months and now madam you turn up in company with the war chieftain of clan mackenzie who tells me that his brother colum is convinced you are a spy presumably working for me well im not am i i said reasonably you know that at least yes i know that he said with exaggerated patience what i dont know is who the devil you are but i mean to find out madam have no doubts as to that i am the commander of this garrison as such i am empowered to take certain steps in order to secure the safety of this area against traitors spies and any other persons whose behavior i consider suspicious and those steps madam i am fully prepared to take and just what might those steps be i inquired i honestly wanted to know though i suppose the tone of my question must have sounded rather baiting he stood up looked down at me consideringly for a moment then walked around the table extended his hand and drew me to my feet corporal hawkins he said still staring at me i shall require your assistance for a moment the youth by the wall looked profoundly uneasy but sidled over to us stand behind the lady please corporal randall said sounding bored and take her firmly by both elbows he drew back his arm and hit me in the pit of the stomach i made no noise because i had no breath i sat on the floor doubled over struggling to draw air into my lungs i was shocked far beyond the actual pain of the blow which was beginning to make itself felt along with a wave of giddy sickness in a fairly eventful life no one had ever purposely struck me before the captain squatted down in front of me his wig was slightly awry but aside from that and a certain brightness to his eyes he showed no change from his normal controlled elegance i trust you are not with child madam he said in a conversational tone because if you are you wont be for long i was beginning to make a rather odd wheezing noise as the first wisps of oxygen found their way painfully into my throat i rolled onto my hands and knees and groped feebly for the edge of the table the corporal after a nervous glance at the captain reached down to help me up waves of blackness seemed to ripple over the room i sank onto the stool and closed my eyes look at me the voice was as light and calm as though he were about to offer me tea i opened my eyes and looked up at him through a slight fog his hands were braced on his exquisitely tailored hips have you anything to say to me now madam he demanded your wig is crooked i said and closed my eyes again chapter a marriage is announced i sat at a table in the taproom below gazing into a cup of milk and fighting off waves of nausea dougal had taken one look at my face as i came downstairs supported by the beefy young corporal and strode purposefully past me up the stairs to randalls room the floors and doors of the inn were stout and well constructed but i could still hear the sound of raised voices upstairs i raised the cup of milk but my hands were still shaking too badly to drink it i was gradually recovering from the physical effects of the blow but not from the shock of it i knew the man was not my husband but the resemblance was so strong and my habits so ingrained that i had been halfinclined to trust him and had spoken to him as i would have to frank expecting civility if not active sympathy to have those feelings abruptly turned inside out by his vicious attack was what was making me ill now ill and frightened as well i had seen his eyes as he crouched next to me on the floor something had moved in their depths just for a moment it was gone in a flash but i did not want ever to see it again the sound of a door opening above brought me out of my reverie the thud of heavy footsteps was succeeded by the rapid appearance of dougal followed closely by captain randall so closely indeed that the captain appeared to be in pursuit of the scot and was brought up short when dougal catching sight of me halted suddenly at the foot of the stairs with a glare over his shoulder at captain randall dougal came swiftly over to where i was seated tossed a small coin on the table in payment and jerked me to my feet without a word he was hustling me out the door before i had time to do more than register the extraordinary look of speculative acquisitiveness on the face of the redcoat officer we were mounted and moving before i had even tucked the voluminous skirts around my legs and the material billowed around me like a settling parachute dougal was silent but the horses seemed to pick up his sense of urgency we were all but galloping by the time we hit the main road near a crossroads marked with a pictish cross dougal abruptly reined to a halt dismounting he seized the bridles of both horses and tied them loosely to a sapling he helped me down then abruptly disappeared into the bushes beckoning me to follow i followed the swing of his kilt up the hillside ducking as the branches he pushed out of the way snapped back across the path over my head the hillside was overgrown with oak and scrubby pine i could hear titmice in the copse to the left and a flock of jays calling out to each other as they fed further on the grass was the fresh green of early summer clumps of sturdy growth shooting out of the rocks and furring the ground under the oaks nothing grew under the pines of course the needles lay inches thick affording protection for the small crawling things that hid there from sunlight and predators the sharp scents made my throat ache i had been up such hillsides before and smelled these same spring scents but then the pine and grass scent had been diluted with the smell of petrol fumes from the road below and the voices of day trippers replaced those of the jays last time i walked such a path the ground was littered with sandwich wrappers and cigarette butts instead of mallow blossoms and violets sandwich wrappers seemed a reasonable enough price to pay i supposed for such blessings of civilization as antibiotics and telephones but just for the moment i was willing to settle for the violets i badly needed a little peace and i felt it here dougal turned suddenly aside just below the crest of the hill and disappeared into a thick growth of broom shoving my way in after him with some difficulty i found him seated on the flat stone edging of a small pool a weathered block of stone stood askew behind him with a dim and vaguely human figure etched in the stained surface it must be a saints pool i realized these small shrines to one saint or another dotted the highlands and were often to be found in such secluded spots though even up here tattered remnants of fabric flapped from the branches of a rowan tree that overhung the water pledges from visitors who petitioned the saint for health or a safe journey perhaps dougal greeted my appearance with a nod he crossed himself bent his head and scooped up a double handful of water the water had an odd dark color and a worse smell likely a sulfur spring i thought the day was hot and i was thirsty though so i followed dougals example the water was faintly bitter but cold and not unpalatable i drank some then splashed my face the road had been dusty i looked up face dripping to find him watching me with a very odd expression something between curiosity and calculation i thought bit of a climb for a drink isnt it i asked lightly there were water bottles on the horses and i doubted that dougal meant to petition the patron of the spring for our safe journey back to the inn he struck me as a believer in more worldly methods how well dye know the captain he asked abruptly less well than you i snapped back ive met him once before today and that by accident we didnt get on surprisingly the stern face lightened a bit well he admitted i canna say as i care for the man much myself he drummed his fingers on the well coping considering something hes wellthought of by some though he said eyeing me a brave soldier and a bonny fighter by what i hear i raised my eyebrows not being an english general i am not impressed he laughed showing startlingly white teeth the sound disturbed three rooks in the tree overhead who flapped off full of hoarse complaint are ye a spy for the english or the french he asked with another bewildering change of subject at least he was being direct for a change certainly not i said crossly im plain claire beauchamp and nothing more i soaked my handkerchief in the water and used it to wipe my neck small refreshing trickles ran down my back under the grey serge of my traveling gown i pressed the wet cloth to my bosom and squeezed producing a similar effect dougal was silent for several minutes watching me intently as i conducted my haphazard ablutions youve seen jamies back he said suddenly i could hardly help doing so i said a little coldly i had given up wondering what he was up to with these disconnected questions presumably he would tell me when he was ready you mean did i know randall did it then or did you know that yourself aye i kent it well enough he answered calmly appraising me but i wasna aware that you did i shrugged implying that what i knew and what i didnt were hardly his concern i was there ye ken he said casually where at fort william i had a bit of business there with the garrison the clerk there knew jamie was some kin to me and sent me word when they arrested him so i went along to see could aught be done for him apparently you werent very successful i said with an edge dougal shrugged unfortunately not had it been the regular sergeantmajor in charge i might ha saved jamie at least the second goround but as it was randall was new in command he didna know me and was indisposed to listen much to what i said i thought at the time it was only he meant to make an example of jamie to show everyone at the start that thered be no softness from him he tapped the short sword he wore at his belt its a sound enough principle when youre in command of men earn their respect before ye do aught else and if you canna do that earn their fear i remembered the expression on the face of randalls corporal and thought i knew which route the captain had taken dougals deepset eyes were on my face interested you knew it was randall did jamie tell ye about it a bit i said cautiously he must think well of ye he said musingly he doesna generally speak of it to anyone i cant imagine why not i said provoked i still held my breath each time we came to a new tavern or inn until it was clear that the company had settled for an evening of drinking and gossip by the fire dougal smiled sardonically clearly knowing what was in my mind well it wasna necessary to tell me was it since i kent it already he swished a hand idly through the strange dark water stirring up brimstone fumes id not know how it goes in oxfordshire he said with a sarcastic emphasis that made me squirm slightly but hereabouts ladies are generally not exposed to such sights as floggings have ye ever seen one no nor do i much want to i responded sharply i can imagine what it would take to make marks like the ones on jamies back though dougal shook his head flipping water out of the pool at a curious jay that ventured close now there youre wrong lass and youll pardon my saying so imagination is all verra well but it isna equal to the sight of a man having his back laid open a verra nasty thing its meant to break a man and most often it succeeds not with jamie i spoke rather more sharply than i had intended jamie was my patient and to some extent my friend as well i had no wish to discuss his personal history with dougal though i would if pressed admit to a certain morbid curiosity i had never met anyone more open and at the same time more mysterious than the tall young mactavish dougal laughed shortly and wiped his wet hand through his hair pasting back the strands that had escaped during our flight for so i thought of it from the tavern weel jamies as stubborn as the rest of his family like rocks the lot of them and hes the worst but there was a definite tone of respect in his voice grudging though it was jamie told ye he was flogged for escape yes aye he went over the wall of the camp just after dark same day as the dragoons brought him in that was a fairly frequent occurrence there the prisoners accommodations not bein as secure as might be wished so the english ran patrols near the walls every night the garrison clerk told me jamie put up a good fight from the look of him when he came back but it was six against one and the six all wi muskets so it didna last long jamie spent the night in chains and went to the whipping post first thing in the morning he paused checking me for signs of faintness or nausea i supposed floggings were done right after assembly so as to start everyone off in the proper frame of mind for the day there were three to be flogged that day and jamie was the last of them you actually saw it oh aye and ill tell ye lass watchin men bein flogged is not pleasant ive had the good fortune never to experience it but i expect bein flogged is not verra pleasant either watching it happen to someone else while waitin for it yourself is probably least pleasant of all i dont doubt it i murmured dougal nodded jamie looked grim enough but he didna turn a hair even listening to the screams and the other noises did ye know ye can hear the flesh being torn ugh so i thought myself lass he said grimacing in memory of it to say nothing of the blood and bruises ech he spat carefully avoiding the pool and its coping turned my stomach to see and im no a squeamish man by any means dougal went on with his ghastly story come jamies turn he walks up to the post some men have to be dragged but not him and holds out his hands so the corporal can unlock the manacles hes wearing the corporal goes to pull his arm like to haul him into place but jamie shakes him off and steps back a pace i was half expectin him to make a dash for it but instead he just pulls off his shirt its torn here and there and filthy as a clout but he folds it up careful like it was his sunday best and lays it on the ground then he walks over to the post steady as a soldier and puts his hands up to be bound dougal shook his head marveling the sunlight filtering through the rowan leaves dappled him with lacy shadows so he looked like a man seen through a doily i smiled at the thought and he nodded approvingly at me thinking my response due to his story aye lass courage like that is uncommon rare it wasna ignorance mind hed just seen two men flogged and he knew the same was coming to him its just he had made up his mind there was no help for it boldness in battle is nothing out of the way for a scotsman ye ken but to face down fear in cold blood is rare in any man he was but nineteen at the time dougal added as an afterthought must have been rather gruesome to watch i said ironically i wonder you werent sick dougal saw the irony and let it lie i nearly was lass he said lifting his dark brows the first lash drew blood and the lads back was half red and half blue within a minute he didna scream though or beg for mercy or twist round to try and save himself he just set his forehead hard against the post and stood there he flinched when the lash hit of course but nothin more i doubt i could do that he admitted nor are there many that could he fainted half through it and they roused him wi water from a jug and finished it very nasty indeed i observed why are you telling me about it i havena finished telling ye about it dougal pulled the dirk from his belt and began to clean his fingernails with the point he was a fastidious man in spite of the difficulties of keeping clean on the road jamie was slumped in the ropes with the blood running down and staining his kilt i dinna think hed fainted he was just too wambly to stand for the moment but just then captain randall came down into the yard i dont know why hed not been there to begin with had business that delayed him perhaps anyway jamie saw him coming and had the presence o mind left to close his eyes and let his head flop like as if he were unconscious dougal knitted his brows concentrating fiercely on a recalcitrant hangnail the captain was fair put out that theyd flogged jamie already seems that was a pleasure hed meant to have for himself still not much to be done about it at the moment but then he thought to make inquiries about how jamie came to escape in the first place he held up the dirk examining it for nicks then began to sharpen the edge against the stone he sat on had several soldiers shaking in their boots before he was done the mans a way wi words ill say that for him that he has i said dryly the dirk scraped rhythmically against the stone every so often a faint spark leapt from the metal as it struck a rough patch in the rock weel in the course of this inquiry it came out that jamied had the heel of a loaf and a bit of cheese with him when they caught him taken it along when he went over the wall whereupon the captain thinks for a moment then smiles a smile i should hate to see on my grandmothers face he declares that theft bein a serious offense the penalty should be commensurate and sentences jamie on the spot to another hundred lashes i flinched in spite of myself that would kill him dougal nodded aye thats what the garrison doctor said he said as hed permit no such thing in good conscience the prisoner must be allowed a week to heal before receiving the second flogging well how humanitarian of him i said good conscience my aunt fanny and what did captain randall think of this he was none too pleased at first but he reconciled himself once he did the sergeantmajor who knew a real faint when he saw one had jamie untied the lad staggered a bit but he kept to his feet and a few of the men there cheered which didna go ower a treat wi the captain he wasna best pleased when the sergeant picked up jamies shirt and handed it back to the lad either though it was quite a popular move with the men dougal twisted the blade back and forth examining it critically then he laid it across his knee and gave me a direct look ye know lass its fairly easy to be brave sittin in a warm tavern ower a glass of ale tis not so easy squatting in a cold field wi musket balls going past your head and heather ticklin your arse and its still less easy when youre standing face to face wi your enemy wi your own blood running down your legs i wouldnt suppose so i said i did feel a little faint in spite of everything i plunged both hands into the water letting the dark liquid chill my wrists i did go back to see randall later in the week dougal said defensively as though he felt some need to justify the action we talked a good bit and i even offered him compensation oh i am impressed i murmured but desisted in the face of his glare no i mean it it was kind of you i gather randall declined your offer though aye he did and i still dinna ken why for ive not found english officers on the whole to be owerscrupulous when it comes to their purses and clothes such as the captains come a bit dear perhaps he hasother sources of income i suggested he does for a fact dougal confirmed but with a sharp glance at me still he hesitated then proceeded more slowly i went back then to be there for jamie when he came up again though there wasna much i could do for him at that point poor lad the second time jamie had been the only prisoner up for flogging the guards had removed his shirt before bringing him out just after sunup on a cold october morning i could see the lad was dead scairt said dougal though he was walking by himself and wouldna let the guard touch him i could see him shaking as much wi the cold as wi nerves and the gooseflesh thick on his arms and chest but the sweat was standing on his face as well a few minutes later randall came out the whip tucked under his arm and the lead plummets at the tips of the lashes clicking softly together as he walked he had surveyed jamie coolly then motioned to the sergeantmajor to turn the prisoner around to show his back dougal grimaced a pitiful sight it was too still raw no more than halfhealed wi the weals turned black and the rest yellow wi bruises the thought of a whip comin down on that soreness was enough to make me blench along wi most of those watching randall then turned to the sergeantmajor and said a pretty job sergeant wilkes i must see if i can do as well with considerable punctilio he then called for the garrison doctor and had him certify officially that jamie was fit enough to be flogged youve seen a cat play wi a wee mousie dougal asked twas like that randall strolled round the lad making one kind of remark and another none of them what yed call pleasant and jamie stood there like an oak tree sayin nothing and keeping his eyes fixed on the post not lookin at randall at all i could see the lad was hugging his elbows to try to stop the shivering and ye could tell randall saw it too his mouth tightened up and he says i thought this was the young man who only a week past was shouting that he wasnt afraid to die surely a man whos not afraid to die isnt afraid of a few lashes and he gives jamie a poke in the belly wi the handle of the whip jamie met randalls eye straight on then and said no but im afraid ill freeze stiff before yere done talking dougal sighed well it was a braw speech but damn reckless for a that now scourging a man is never a pretty business but theres ways to make it worse than it might be strikin sideways to cut deep or steppin in wi a hard blow ower the kidneys for instance he shook his head verra ugly he frowned choosing his words slowly randalls face was intent i suppose yed say and sort o lighted up like when a man is lookin at a lass hes soft on if ye know what i mean twas as though he were doin somethin much worse to jamie than just skinning him alive the blood was running down the lads legs by the fifteenth stroke and the tears running down his face wi the sweat i swayed a little and put out a hand to the stone of the coping well he said abruptly catching sight of my expression ill say no more except that he lived through it when the corporal untied his hands he nearly fell but the corporal and sergeantmajor each caught him by an arm and kind o steadied him til he could keep his feet he was shakin worse than ever from shock and cold but his head was up and his eyes blazin i could see it from twenty feet away he keeps his eyes fixed on randall while they help him off the platform leavin bloody footprints its like watchin randall is the only thing keeping him on his feet randalls face was almost as white as jamies and his eyes were locked wi the lads as though either of them would fall if he took his eyes away dougals own eyes were fixed still seeing the eerie scene everything was quiet in the small glade except for the faint rush of wind through the leaves of the rowan tree i closed my eyes and listened to it for some time why i asked finally eyes still closed why did you tell me dougal was watching me intently when i opened my eyes i dipped a hand in the spring again and applied the cool water to my temples i thought it might serve as what ye may call a character illustration he said of randall i uttered a short mirthless laugh i dont need any further evidence as to his character thank you of randall he agreed and jamie too i looked at him suddenly ill at ease ye see i have orders he emphasized the word sarcastically from the good captain orders to do what i asked the agitated feeling increasing to produce the person of an english subject one claire beauchamp by name at fort william on monday the th of june for questioning i must have looked truly alarming for he jumped to his feet and came over to me put your head between your knees lass he instructed pushing on the back of my neck til the faintness passes off i know what to do i said irritably doing it nonetheless i closed my eyes feeling the ebbing blood begin to throb in my temples again the clammy sensation around my face and ears began to disappear though my hands were still icy i concentrated on breathing properly counting in onetwothreefour outonetwo in onetwothreefour at length i sat up feeling more or less in possession of all my faculties dougal had resumed his seat on the stone coping and was waiting patiently watching to be sure that i didnt fall backward into the spring theres a way out of it he said abruptly the only one i can see lead me to it i said with an unconvincing attempt at a smile verra well then he sat forward leaning toward me to explain randalls the right to take ye for questioning because youre a subject of the english crown well then we must change that i stared at him uncomprehending what do you mean youre a subject of the crown as well arent you how would you change such a thing scots law and english law are verra similar he said frowning but no the same and an english officer canna compel the person of a scot unless hes firm evidence of a crime committed or grounds for serious suspicions even with suspicion he could no remove a scottish subject from clan lands without the permission of the laird concerned youve been talking to ned gowan i said beginning to feel a little dizzy again he nodded aye i have i thought it might come to this ye ken and what he told me is what i thought myself the only way i can legally refuse to give ye to randall is to change ye from an englishwoman into a scot into a scot i said the dazed feeling quickly being replaced by a horrible suspicion this was confirmed by his next words aye he said nodding at my expression ye must marry a scot young jamie i couldnt do that weel he frowned considering i suppose ye could take rupert instead hes a widower and hes the lease of a small farm still hes a good bit older and i dont want to marry rupert either thats the the most absurd words failed me springing to my feet in agitation i paced around the small clearing fallen rowan berries crunching under my feet jamies a goodly lad dougal argued still sitting on the coping hes not much in the way of property just now true but hes a kindhearted lad hed not be cruel to ye and hes a bonny fighter with verra good reason to hate randall nay marry him and hell fight to his last breath to protect ye but but i cant marry anyone i burst out dougals eyes were suddenly sharp why not lass do ye have a husband living still no its just its ridiculous such things dont happen dougal had relaxed when i said no now he glanced up at the sun and rose to go best get moving lass there are things well have to attend to therell have to be a special dispensation he murmured as though to himself but ned can manage that he took my arm still muttering to himself i wrenched it away i will not marry anyone i said firmly he seemed undisturbed by this merely raising his brows you want me to take you to randall no something occurred to me so at least you believe me when i say im not an english spy i do now he spoke with some emphasis why now and not before he nodded at the spring and at the worn figure etched in the rock it must be hundreds of years old much older even than the giant rowan tree that shaded the spring and cast its white flowers into the black water st ninians spring ye drank the water before i asked ye i was thoroughly bewildered by this time what does that have to do with it he looked surprised then his mouth twisted in a smile ye didna know they call it the liars spring as well the water smells o the fumes of hell anyone who drinks the water and then tells untruth will ha the gizzard burnt out of him i see i spoke between my teeth well my gizzard is quite intact so you can believe me when i say im not a spy english or french and you can believe something else dougal mackenzie im not marrying anyone he wasnt listening in fact he had already pushed his way through the bushes that screened the spring only a quivering oak branch marked his passage seething i followed him i remonstrated at some length further on the ride back to the inn dougal advised me finally to save my breath to cool my parritch with and after that we rode in silence reaching the inn i flung my reins to the ground and stamped upstairs to the refuge of my room the whole idea was not only outrageous but unthinkable i paced around and around the narrow room feeling increasingly like a rat in a trap why in hell hadnt i had the nerve to steal away from the scots earlier whatever the risk i sat down on the bed and tried to think calmly considered strictly from dougals point of view no doubt the idea had merit if he refused pointblank to hand me over to randall with no excuse the captain might easily try to take me by force and whether he believed me or not dougal might understandably not want to engage in a skirmish with a lot of english dragoons for my sake and viewed in cold blood the idea had some merit from my side as well if i were married to a scot i would presumably no longer be watched and guarded it would be that much easier to get away when the time came and if it were jamie well he liked me clearly and he knew the highlands like the backs of his hands he would perhaps take me to craigh na dun or at least in the general direction yes possibly marriage was the best way to gain my goal that was the coldblooded way to look at it my blood however was anything but cold i was hot with fury and agitation and could not keep still pacing and fuming looking for a way out any way after an hour of this my face was flushed and my head throbbing i got up and threw open the shutters sticking my head out into the cooling breeze there was a peremptory rap on the door behind me dougal entered as i pulled my head in he bore a sheaf of stiff paper like a salver and was followed by rupert and the immaculate ned gowan bringing up the rear like royal equerries please do come in i said courteously ignoring me as usual dougal removed a chamber pot from its resting place on the table and fanned the sheets of paper out ceremoniously on the rough oak surface all done he said with the pride of one who has shepherded a difficult project to a successful conclusion neds drawn up the papers nothing like a lawyer so long as hes on your side eh ned the men all laughed evidently in good humor not really difficult ye ken ned said modestly its but a simple contract he riffled the pages with a proprietary forefinger then paused wrinkling his brow at a sudden thought youve no property in france have ye he asked peering worriedly at me over the halfspectacles he wore for close work i shook my head and he relaxed shuffling the papers back into a pile and tapping the edges neatly together thats that then youll only need to sign here at the foot and dougal and rupert to witness the lawyer set down the inkpot he had brought in and whipping a clean quill from his pocket presented it ceremoniously to me and just what is this i asked this was in the nature of a rhetorical question for the top page of the bundle said contract of marriage in a clear calligraphic hand the letters two inches high and starkly black across the page dougal suppressed a sigh of impatience at my recalcitrance ye ken quite weel what it is he said shortly and unless youve had another bright thought for keeping yourself out of randalls hands youll sign it and have done with it times short bright thoughts were in particularly short supply at the moment despite the hour i had spent hammering away at the problem it really began to seem that this incredible alternative was the best i could do struggle as i might but i dont want to marry i said stubbornly it occurred to me as well that mine was not the only point of view involved i remembered the girl with blond hair i had seen kissing jamie in the alcove at the castle and maybe jamie doesnt want to marry me i said what about that dougal dismissed this as unimportant jamies a soldier hell do as hes told so will you he said pointedly unless of course yed prefer an english prison i glared at him breathing heavily i had been in a stir ever since our abrupt removal from randalls office and my level of agitation had now increased substantially confronted with the choice in black and white as it were i want to talk to him i said abruptly dougals eyebrows shot up jamie why why because youre forcing me to marry him and so far as i can see you havent even told him plainly this was an irrelevancy as far as dougal was concerned but he eventually gave in and accompanied by his minions went to fetch jamie from the taproom below jamie appeared shortly looking understandably bewildered did you know that dougal wants us to marry i demanded bluntly his expression cleared oh aye i knew that but surely i said a young man like yourself i mean isnt there anyone else youre ah interested in he looked blank for a moment then understanding dawned oh am i promised nay im no much of a prospect for a girl he hurried on as though feeling this might sound insulting i mean ive no property to speak of and nothing more than a soldiers pay to live on he rubbed his chin eyeing me dubiously then theres the minor difficulty that ive a price on my head no father much wants his daughter married to a man as may be arrested and hanged any time did ye think of that i flapped my hand dismissing the matter of outlawry as a minor consideration compared to the whole monstrous idea i had one last try does it bother you that im not a virgin he hesitated a moment before answering well no he said slowly so long as it doesna bother you that i am he grinned at my dropjawed expression and backed toward the door reckon one of us should know what theyre doing he said the door closed softly behind him clearly the courtship was over the papers duly signed i made my way cautiously down the inns steep stairs and over to the bar table in the taproom whisky i said to the rumpled old creature behind it he glared rheumily but a nod from dougal made him oblige with a bottle and glass the latter was thick and greenish a bit smeared with a chip out of the rim but it had a hole in the top and that was all that mattered at the moment once the searing effect of swallowing the stuff had passed it did induce a certain spurious calmness i felt detached noticing details of my surroundings with a peculiar intensity the small stainedglass inset over the bar casting colored shadows over the ruffianly proprietor and his wares the curve of the handle on a copperbottomed dipper that hung on the wall next to me a greenbellied fly struggling on the edges of a sticky puddle on the table with a certain amount of fellowfeeling i nudged it out of danger with the edge of my glass i gradually became aware of raised voices behind the closed door on the far side of the room dougal had disappeared there after the conclusion of his business with me presumably to firm up arrangements with the other contracting party i was pleased to hear that judging from the sound of it my intended bridegroom was cutting up rough despite his apparent lack of objection earlier perhaps he hadnt wanted to offend me stick to it lad i murmured and took another gulp sometime later i was dimly conscious of a hand prying my fingers open in order to remove the greenish glass another hand was steadyingly under my elbow christ shes drunk as an auld besom in a bothy said a voice in my ear the voice rasped unpleasantly i thought as though its owner had been eating sandpaper i giggled softly at the thought quiet yerself woman said the unpleasant rasping voice it grew fainter as the owner turned to talk to someone else drunk as a laird and screechin like a parrot what do ye expect another voice interrupted the first but i couldnt tell what it said the words were blurred and indistinguishable it was a pleasanter sound though deep and somehow reassuring it came nearer and i could make out a few words i made an effort to focus but my attention had begun to wander again the fly had found its way back to the puddle and was floundering in the middle hopelessly mired the light from the stainedglass window fell on it glittering like sparks on the straining green belly my gaze fixed on the tiny green spot which seemed to pulsate as the fly twitched and struggled brother you havent a shance i said and the spark went out chapter a marriage takes place there was a low beamed ceiling over me when i woke and a thick quilt tucked tidily under my chin i seemed to be clad only in my shift i started to sit up to look for my clothes but thought better of it halfway up i eased myself very carefully back down closed my eyes and held onto my head to prevent it from rolling off the pillow and bouncing on the floor i woke again sometime later when the door of the room opened i cracked one eye cautiously a wavering outline resolved itself into the dour figure of murtagh staring disapprovingly down at me from the foot of the bed i closed the eye i heard a muffled scottish noise presumably indicating appalled disgust but when i looked again he was gone i was just sinking thankfully back into unconsciousness when the door opened again this time to reveal a middleaged woman i took to be the publicans wife carrying a ewer and basin she bustled cheerily into the room and banged the shutters open with a crash that reverberated through my head like a tank collision advancing on the bed like a panzer division she ripped the quilt from my feeble grasp and tossed it aside leaving me quaking and exposed come along then me love she said we mun get ye ready now she put a hefty forearm behind my shoulders and levered me into a sitting position i clutched my head with one hand my stomach with the other ready i said through a mouth filled with decayed moss the woman began briskly washing my face och aye she said ye dinna want to miss yer own wedding now do ye yes i said but was ignored as she unceremoniously stripped off my shift and stood me in the middle of the floor for further intimate attentions a bit later i sat on the bed fully dressed feeling dazed and belligerent but thanks to a glass of port supplied by the goodwife at least functional i sipped carefully at a second glass as the woman tugged a comb through the thickets of my hair i jumped and shuddered spilling the port as the door crashed open once more one damn thing after another i thought balefully this time it was a double visitation murtagh and ned gowan wearing similar looks of disapprobation i exchanged glares with ned while murtagh came into the room and walked slowly around the bed surveying me from every angle he returned to ned and muttered something in a tone too low for me to hear with a final glance of despair in my direction he pulled the door shut behind them at last my hair was dressed to the womans satisfaction swept back and pulled high in a knot at the crown curls picked loose to tumble to the back and ringlets in front of my ears it felt as though my scalp were going to pop off from the tension of the strainedback hair but the effect in the looking glass the woman provided was undeniably becoming i began to feel slightly more human and even brought myself to thank her for her efforts she left me the looking glass and departed remarking that it was so lucky to be married in summer wasnt it as id have plenty of flowers for my hair we who are about to die i said to my reflection sketching a salute in the glass i collapsed on the bed plastered a wet cloth over my face and went back to sleep i was having a rather nice dream something to do with grassy fields and wildflowers when i became aware that what i had thought a playful breeze tugging at my sleeves was a pair of nonetoogentle hands i sat up with a jerk blindly flailing when i got my eyes open i saw that my small chamber now resembled a tube station with faces walltowall ned gowan murtagh the innkeeper the innkeepers wife and a lanky young man who turned out to be the innkeepers son with his arms full of assorted flowers which accounted for the scents in my dream there was also a young woman armed with a round wicker basket who smiled amiably at me displaying the lack of several rather important teeth this person it developed was the village sempstress recruited to repair the deficiencies of my wardrobe by adjusting the fit of a dress obtained on short notice from some local connection of the innkeepers ned was carrying the dress in question hanging from one hand like a dead animal smoothed out on the bed it proved to be a lownecked gown of heavy creamcolored satin with a separate bodice that buttoned with dozens of tiny clothcovered buttons each embroidered with a gold fleurdelis the neckline and the belled sleeves were heavily ruched with lace as was the embroidered overskirt of chocolatebrown velvet the innkeeper was halfburied in the petticoats he carried his bristling whiskers barely visible over the foamy layers i looked at the portwine stain on my grey serge skirt and vanity won out if i were in fact to be married i didnt want to do it looking like the village drudge after a short spell of frenetic activity with me standing like a dressmakers dummy and everyone else racing about fetching carrying criticizing and tripping over each other the final product was ready complete to white asters and yellow roses pinned in my hair and a heart pounding madly away beneath the lacy bodice the fit was not quite perfect and the gown smelled rather strongly of its previous owner but the satin was weighty and swished rather fascinatingly about my feet over the layers of petticoats i felt quite regal and not a little lovely you cant make me do this you know i hissed threateningly at murtaghs back as i followed him downstairs but he and i both knew my words were empty bravado if i had ever had the strength of character to defy dougal and take my chances with the english it had drained away with the whisky dougal ned and the rest were in the main taproom at the foot of the stair drinking and exchanging pleasantries with a few villagers who seemed to have nothing better to do with their afternoon than hang about getting sloshed dougal caught sight of me slowly descending and abruptly stopped talking the others fell silent as well and i floated down in a most gratifying cloud of reverent admiration dougals deepset eyes covered me slowly from head to foot and returned to my face with a completely ungrudging nod of acknowledgment what with one thing and another it was some time since a man had looked at me that way and i nodded quite graciously back after the first silence the rest of those in the taproom became vocal in their admiration and even murtagh allowed himself a small smile nodding in satisfaction at the results of his efforts and who appointed you fashion editor i thought disagreeably still i had to admit that he was responsible for my not marrying in grey serge marrying oh god buoyed temporarily by port wine and cream lace i had momentarily managed to ignore the significance of the occasion i gripped the banister as fresh realization hit like a blow in the stomach looking over the throng though i noticed one glaring omission my groom was nowhere in sight heartened by the thought that he might have succeeded in escaping out of a window and be miles away by now i accepted a parting cup of wine from the innkeeper before following dougal outside ned and rupert went to fetch the horses murtagh had disappeared somewhere perhaps to search for traces of jamie dougal held me by one arm ostensibly to support me lest i stumble in my satin slippers in reality to prevent any lastminute breaks for freedom it was a warm scottish day meaning that the mist wasnt quite heavy enough to qualify as a drizzle but not far off either suddenly the inn door opened and the sun came out in the person of james if i was a radiant bride the groom was positively resplendent my mouth fell open and stayed that way a highlander in full regalia is an impressive sight any highlander no matter how old illfavored or crabbed in appearance a tall straightbodied and by no means illfavored young highlander at close range is breathtaking the thick redgold hair had been brushed to a smooth gleam that swept the collar of a fine lawn shirt with tucked front belled sleeves and lacetrimmed wrist frills that matched the cascade of the starched jabot at the throat decorated with a ruby stickpin his tartan was a brilliant crimson and black that blazed among the more sedate mackenzies in their green and white the flaming wool fastened by a circular silver brooch fell from his right shoulder in a graceful drape caught by a silverstudded sword belt before continuing its sweep past neat calves clothed in woolen hose and stopping just short of the silverbuckled black leather boots sword dirk and badgerskin sporran completed the ensemble well over six feet tall broad in proportion and striking of feature he was a far cry from the grubby horsehandler i was accustomed to and he knew it making a leg in courtly fashion he swept me a bow of impeccable grace murmuring your servant maam eyes glinting with mischief oh i said faintly i had seldom seen the taciturn dougal at a loss for words before thick brows knotted over a suffused face he seemed in his way as taken aback by this apparition as i was are ye mad man he said at last what if someones to see ye jamie cocked a sardonic eyebrow at the older man why uncle he said insults and on my wedding day too you wouldna have me shame my wife now would ye besides he added with a malicious gleam i hardly think it would be legal did i not marry in my own name and you do want it legal now dont you with an apparent effort dougal recovered his selfpossession if yere quite finished jamie well get on wi it he said but jamie was not quite finished it seemed ignoring dougals fuming he drew a short string of white beads from his sporran he stepped forward and fastened the necklace around my neck looking down i could see it was a string of small baroque pearls those irregularly shaped productions of freshwater mussels interspersed with tiny piercedwork gold roundels smaller pearls dangled from the gold beads theyre only scotch pearls he said apologetically but they look bonny on you his fingers lingered a moment on my neck those were your mothers pearls said dougal glowering at the necklace aye said jamie calmly and now theyre my wifes shall we go wherever we were going it was some distance from the village we made a rather morose wedding party the bridal pair encircled by the others like convicts being escorted toward some distant prison the only conversation was a muted apology from jamie for being late explaining that there had been some difficulty in finding a clean shirt and coat large enough to fit him i think this one belongs to the local squires son he said flipping the lacy jabot bit of a dandy it looks like we dismounted and left the horses at the foot of a small hill a footpath led upward through the heather yeve made the arrangements i heard dougal say in an undertone to rupert as they tethered the beasts och aye there was a flash of teeth in the black beard was a bit o trouble to persuade the padre but we showed him the special license he patted his sporran which clinked musically giving me some idea of the nature of the special license through the drizzle and mist i saw the chapel jutting out of the heather with a sense of complete disbelief i saw the roundshouldered roof and the odd little manypaned windows which i had last seen on the bright sunny morning of my marriage to frank randall no i exclaimed not here i cant hst now hst dinna worry lass dinna worry it will be all right dougal put a large paw on my shoulder making soothing scottish noises as if i were a skittish horse tis natural to be a bit nervous he said to all of us a firm hand in the small of my back urged me on up the path my shoes sank moistly in the damp layer of fallen leaves jamie and dougal walked close on either side of me preventing escape their looming plaid presences were unnerving and i felt a mounting sense of hysteria two hundred years ahead more or less i had been married in this chapel charmed then by its ancient picturesqueness the chapel now was creaking with newness its boards not yet settled into charm and i was about to marry a twentythreeyearold scottish catholic virgin with a price on his head whose i turned to jamie in sudden panic i cant marry you i dont even know your last name he looked down at me and cocked a ruddy eyebrow oh its fraser james alexander malcolm mackenzie fraser he pronounced it formally each name slow and distinct completely flustered i said claire elizabeth beauchamp and stuck out my hand idiotically apparently taking this as a plea for support he took the hand and tucked it firmly into the crook of his elbow thus inescapably pinioned i squelched up the path to my wedding rupert and murtagh were waiting for us in the chapel keeping guard over a captive cleric a spindly young priest with a red nose and a justifiably terrified expression rupert was idly slicing a willow twig with a large knife and while he had laid aside his hornhandled pistols on entering the church they remained in easy reach on the rim of the baptismal font the other men also disarmed as was suitable in the house of god leaving an impressively bristling pile of lethality in the back pew only jamie kept his dagger and sword presumably as a ceremonial part of his dress we knelt before the wooden altar murtagh and dougal took their places as witnesses and the ceremony began the form of the catholic marriage service has not changed appreciably in several hundred years and the words linking me with the redheaded young stranger at my side were much the same as those that had consecrated my wedding to frank i felt like a cold hollow shell the young priests stammering words echoed somewhere in the empty pit of my stomach i stood automatically when it came time for the vows watching in a sort of numbed fascination as my chilly fingers disappeared into my bridegrooms substantial grasp his fingers were as cold as my own and it occurred to me for the first time that despite his outwardly cool demeanor he might be as nervous as i was i had so far avoided looking at him but now glanced up to find him staring down at me his face was white and carefully expressionless he looked as he had when i dressed the wound in his shoulder i tried to smile at him but the corners of my mouth wobbled precariously the pressure of his fingers on mine increased i had the impression that we were holding each other up if either of us let go or looked away we would both fall down oddly the feeling was mildly reassuring whatever we were in for at least there were two of us i take thee claire to be my wife his voice didnt shake but his hand did i tightened my grip our stiff fingers clenched together like boards in a vise to love honor and protect for better and for worse the words came from far away the blood was draining from my head the boned bodice was infernally tight and though i felt cold sweat ran down my sides beneath the satin i hoped i wouldnt faint there was a small stainedglass window set high in the wall at the side of the sanctuary a crude rendering of john the baptist in his bearskin green and blue shadows flowed over my sleeve reminding me of the taverns public room and i wished fervently for a drink my turn i stuttered slightly to my fury i ttake thee james i stiffened my spine jamie had got through his half creditably enough i could try to do as well to have and to hold from this day forth my voice came stronger now til death us do part the words rang out in the quiet chapel with a startling finality everything was still as though in suspended animation then the minister asked for the ring there was a sudden stir of agitation and i caught a glimpse of murtaghs stricken face i barely registered the fact that someone had forgotten to provide for the ring when jamie released my hand long enough to twist a ring from his own finger i still wore franks ring on my left hand the fingers of my right looked frozen pallid and stiff in a pool of blue light as the large metal circlet passed over the fourth finger it hung loose on the digit and would have slid off had jamie not folded my fingers around it and enclosed my fist once more in his own more mumbling from the priest and jamie bent to kiss me it was clear that he intended only a brief and ceremonial touching of lips but his mouth was soft and warm and i moved instinctively toward him i was vaguely conscious of noises scottish whoops of enthusiasm and encouragement from the spectators but really noticed nothing beyond the enfolding warm solidness sanctuary we drew apart both a little steadier and smiled nervously i saw dougal draw jamies dirk from its sheath and wondered why still looking at me jamie held out his right hand palm up i gasped as the point of the dirk scored deeply across his wrist leaving a dark line of welling blood there was not time to jerk away before my own hand was seized and i felt the burning slice of the blade swiftly dougal pressed my wrist to jamies and bound the two together with a strip of white linen i must have swayed a bit because jamie gripped my elbow with his free left hand bear up lass he urged softly its not long now say the words after me it was a short bit of gaelic two or three sentences the words meant nothing to me but i obediently repeated them after jamie stumbling on the slippery vowels the linen was untied the wounds blotted clean and we were married there was a general air of relief and exhilaration on the way back down the footpath it might have been any merry wedding party albeit a small one and one composed entirely of men save the bride we were nearly at the bottom when lack of food the remnants of a hangover and the general stresses of the day caught up with me i came to lying on damp leaves my head in my new husbands lap he put down the wet cloth with which he had been wiping my face that bad was it he grinned down at me but his eyes held an uncertain expression that rather touched me in spite of everything i smiled shakily back its not you i assured him its just i dont think ive had anything at all to eat since breakfast yesterday and rather a lot to drink im afraid his mouth twitched so i heard well that i can remedy ive not a lot to offer a wife as i said but i do promise ill keep ye fed he smiled and shyly pushed a stray curl off my face with a forefinger i started to sit up and grimaced at a slight burning in one wrist i had forgotten that last bit of the ceremony the cut had come open no doubt as a result of the fall i had taken i took the cloth from jamie and wrapped it awkwardly around the wrist i thought it might have been that that made ye faint he said watching i should have thought to warn ye about it i didna realize you werent expecting it until i saw your face what was it exactly i asked trying to tuck in the ends of the cloth its a bit pagan but its customary hereabouts to have a blood vow along with the regular marriage service some priests wont have it but i dont suppose this one was likely to object to anything he looked almost as scared as i felt he said smiling a blood vow what do the words mean jamie took my right hand and gently tucked in the last end of the makeshift bandage it rhymes more or less when ye say it in english it says ye are blood of my blood and bone of my bone i give ye my body that we two might be one i give ye my spirit til our life shall be done he shrugged about the same as the regular vows just a bit more ah primitive i gazed down at my bound wrist yes you could say that i glanced about we were alone on the path under an aspen tree the round dead leaves lay on the ground gleaming in the wet like rusted coins it was very quiet save for the occasional splat of water droplets falling from the trees where are the others did they go back to the inn jamie grimaced no i made them go away so i could tend ye but theyll be waitin for us just over there he gestured with his chin in the countrymans manner theyre no going to trust us alone til everythings official isnt it i said blankly were married arent we he seemed embarrassed turning away and elaborately brushing dead leaves from his kilts mmmphm aye were married right enough but its no legally binding ye know until its been consummated a slow fierce blush burned its way up from the lacy jabot mmmphm i said lets go and find something to eat chapter revelations of the bridal chamber at the inn food was readily available in the form of a modest wedding feast including wine fresh bread and roast beef dougal took me by the arm as i started for the stairs to freshen myself before eating i want this marriage consummated wi no uncertainty whatsoever dougal instructed me firmly in an undertone theres to be no question of it bein a legal union and no way open for annulment or were all riskin our necks seems to me youre doing that anyway i remarked crossly mine especially dougal patted me firmly on the rump dinna ye worry about that ye just do your part he looked me over critically as though judging my capacity to perform my role adequately i kent jamies father if the lads much like him yell have no trouble at all ah jamie lad he hurried across the room to where jamie had come in from stabling the horses from the look on jamies face he was getting his orders as well how in the name of god did this happen i asked myself some time later six weeks ago i had been innocently collecting wildflowers on a scottish hill to take home to my husband i was now shut in the room of a rural inn awaiting a completely different husband whom i scarcely knew with firm orders to consummate a forced marriage at risk of my life and liberty i sat on the bed stiff and terrified in my borrowed finery there was a faint noise as the heavy door of the room swung open then shut jamie leaned against the door watching me the air of embarrassment between us deepened it was jamie who broke the silence finally you dinna need to be afraid of me he said softly i wasna going to jump on ye i laughed in spite of myself well i didnt think you would in fact i didnt think he would touch me until and unless i invited him to the fact remained that i was going to have to invite him to do considerably more than that and soon i eyed him dubiously i supposed it would be harder if i found him unattractive in fact the opposite was true still i had not slept with any man but frank in over eight years not only that this young man by his own acknowledgment was completely inexperienced i had never deflowered anyone before even dismissing my objections to the whole arrangement and considering matters from a completely practical standpoint how on earth were we to start at this rate we would still be standing here staring at each other three or four days hence i cleared my throat and patted the bed beside me ah would you like to sit down aye he came across the room moving like a big cat instead of sitting beside me though he pulled up a stool and sat down facing me somewhat tentatively he reached out and took my hands between his own they were large bluntfingered and very warm the backs lightly furred with reddish hairs i felt a slight shock at the touch and thought of an old testament passage for jacobs skin was smooth while his brother esau was a hairy man franks hands were long and slender nearly hairless and aristocraticlooking i had always loved watching them as he lectured tell me about your husband said jamie as though he had been reading my mind i almost jerked my hands away in shock what look ye lass we have three or four days together here while i dinna pretend to know all there is to know ive lived a good bit of my life on a farm and unless people are verra different from other animals it isna going to take that long to do what we have to we have a bit of time to talk and get over being scairt of each other this blunt appraisal of our situation relaxed me a little bit are you scared of me he didnt look it perhaps he was nervous though even though he was no timid sixteenyearold lad this was the first time he looked into my eyes and smiled aye more scairt than you i expect thats why im holdin your hands to keep my own from shaking i didnt believe this but squeezed his hands tightly in appreciation its a good idea it feels a little easier to talk while were touching why did you ask about my husband though i wondered a bit wildly if he wanted me to tell him about my sex life with frank so as to know what i expected of him well i knew ye must be thinking of him ye could hardly not under the circumstances i do not want ye ever to feel as though ye canna talk of him to me even though im your husband now that feels verra strange to say it isna right that ye should forget him or even try to if ye loved him he must ha been a good man yes he was my voice trembled and jamie stroked the backs of my hands with his thumbs then i shall do my best to honor his spirit by serving his wife he raised my hands and kissed each one formally i cleared my throat that was a very gallant speech jamie he grinned suddenly aye i made it up while dougal was making toasts downstairs i took a deep breath i have questions i said he looked down hiding a smile id suppose ye do he agreed i imagine youre entitled to a bit of curiosity under the circumstances what is it ye want to know he looked up suddenly blue eyes bright with mischief in the lamplight why im a virgin yet er i should say that that was more or less your own business i murmured it seemed to be getting rather warm suddenly and i pulled one hand free to grope for my handkerchief as i did so i felt something hard in the pocket of the gown oh i forgot i still have your ring i drew it out and gave it back to him it was a heavy gold circlet set with a cabochon ruby instead of replacing it on his finger he opened his sporran to put it inside it was my fathers wedding ring he explained i dinna wear it customarily but i well i wished to do ye honor today by looking as well as i might he flushed slightly at this admission and busied himself with refastening the sporran you did do me great honor i said smiling in spite of myself adding a ruby ring to the blazing splendor of his costume was coals to newcastle but i was touched by the anxious thought behind it ill get one that fits ye so soon as i may he promised its not important i said feeling slightly uncomfortable i meant after all to be gone soon er i have one main question i said calling the meeting to order if you dont mind telling me why did you agree to marry me ah he let go of my hands and sat back a bit he paused for a moment before answering smoothing the woolen cloth over his thighs i could see the long line of muscle taut under the drape of the heavy fabric well i would ha missed talking to ye for one thing he said smiling no i mean it i insisted why he sobered then before i tell ye claire theres the one thing id ask of you he said slowly whats that honesty i must have flinched uncomfortably for he leaned forward earnestly hands on his knees i know there are things yed not wish to tell me claire perhaps things that ye cant tell me you dont know just how right you are i thought ill not press you ever or insist on knowin things that are your own concern he said seriously he looked down at his hands now pressed together palm to palm there are things that i canna tell you at least not yet and ill ask nothing of ye that ye canna give me but what i would ask of ye when you do tell me something let it be the truth and ill promise ye the same we have nothing now between us save respect perhaps and i think that respect has maybe room for secrets but not for lies do ye agree he spread his hands out palms up inviting me i could see the dark line of the blood vow across his wrist i placed my own hands lightly on his palms yes i agree ill give you honesty his fingers closed lightly about mine and i shall give ye the same now he drew a deep breath you asked why i wed ye i am just the slightest bit curious i said he smiled the wide mouth taking up the humor that lurked in his eyes well i canna say i blame ye i had several reasons and in fact theres one maybe two that i canna tell ye yet though i will in time the main reason though is the same reason you wed me i imagine to keep ye safe from the hands of jack randall i shuddered a bit at the memory of the captain and jamies hands tightened on mine you are safe he said firmly you have my name and my family my clan and if necessary the protection of my body as well the man willna lay hands on ye again while i live thank you i said looking at that strong young determined face with its broad cheekbones and solid jaw i felt for the first time that this preposterous scheme of dougals might actually have been a reasonable suggestion the protection of my body the phrase struck with particular impact looking at him the resolute set of the wide shoulders and the memory of his graceful ferocity showing off at swordplay in the moonlight he meant it and young as he was he knew what he meant and bore the scars to prove it he was no older than many of the pilots and the infantrymen i had nursed and he knew as well as they the price of commitment it was no romantic pledge he had made me but the blunt promise to guard my safety at the cost of his own i hoped only that i could offer him something in return thats most gallant of you i said with absolute sincerity but was it worth well worth marriage it was he said nodding he smiled again a little grimly this time ive good reason to know the man ye ken i wouldna see a dog given into his keeping if i could prevent it let alone a helpless woman how flattering i remarked wryly and he laughed he stood up and went to the table near the window someone perhaps the landlady had supplied a bouquet of wildflowers set in water in a whisky tumbler behind this stood two wineglasses and a bottle jamie poured out two glasses and came back handing me one as he resumed his seat not quite so good as colums private stock he said with a smile but none so bad either he raised his glass briefly to mrs fraser he said softly and i felt a thump of panic again i quelled it firmly and raised my own glass to honesty i said and we both drank well thats one reason i said lowering my glass are there others you can tell me he studied his wineglass with some care perhaps its just that i want to bed you he looked up abruptly did ye think of that if he meant to disconcert me he was succeeding nicely but i resolved not to show it well do you i asked boldly if im bein honest yes i do the blue eyes were steady over the rim of the glass you wouldnt necessarily have had to marry me for that i objected he appeared honestly scandalized you do not think i would take ye without offering you marriage many men would i said amused at his innocence he sputtered a bit at a momentary loss then regaining his composure said with formal dignity perhaps i am pretentious in saying so but i would like to think that i am not many men and that i dinna necessarily place my behavior at the lowest common denominator rather touched by this speech i assured him that i had so far found his behavior both gallant and gentlemanly and apologized for any doubt i might inadvertently have cast on his motives on this precariously diplomatic note we paused while he refilled our empty glasses we sipped in silence for a time both feeling a bit shy after the frankness of that last exchange so apparently there was something i could offer him i couldnt in fairness say the thought had not entered my mind even before the absurd situation in which we found ourselves arose he was a very engaging young man and there had been that moment right after my arrival at the castle when he had held me on his lap and i tilted my wineglass back and drained the contents i patted the bed beside me again sit down here with me i said and i cast about for some neutral topic of conversation to ease us over the awkwardness of close proximity and tell me about your family where did you grow up the bed sank noticeably under his weight and i braced myself not to roll against him he sat closely enough that the sleeve of his shirt brushed my arm i let my hand lie open on my thigh relaxed he took it naturally as he sat and we leaned against the wall neither of us looking down but as conscious of the link as though we had been welded together well now where shall i start he put his rather large feet up on the stool and crossed them at the ankles with some amusement i recognized the highlander settling back for a leisurely dissection of that tangle of family and clan relationships which forms the background of almost any event of significance in the scottish highlands frank and i had spent one evening in the village pub enthralled by a conversation between two old codgers in which the responsibility for the recent destruction of an ancient barn was traced back through the intricacies of a local feud dating so far as i could tell from about with the sort of minor shock to which i was becoming accustomed i realized that that particular feud whose origins i had thought shrouded in the mists of time had not yet begun suppressing the mental turmoil this realization caused i forced my attention to what jamie was saying my father was a fraser of course a younger halfbrother to the present master of lovat my mother was a mackenzie though yell know that dougal and colum are my uncles i nodded the resemblance was clear enough despite the difference in coloring the broad cheekbones and long straight knife edged nose were plainly a mackenzie inheritance aye well my mother was their sister and there were two more sisters besides my auntie janet is dead like my mother but my auntie jocasta married a cousin of ruperts and lives up near the edge of loch eilean auntie janet had six children four boys and two girls auntie jocasta has three all girls dougals got the four girls colum has little hamish only and my parents had me and my sister whos named for my auntie janet but we called her jenny always ruperts a mackenzie too i asked already struggling to keep everyone straight aye hes jamie paused a moment considering hes dougal colum and jocastas first cousin which makes him my second cousin ruperts father and my grandfather jacob were brothers along with wait a minute dont lets go back any farther than we have to or i shall be getting hopelessly muddled we havent even got to the frasers yet and ive already lost track of your cousins he rubbed his chin calculating hmm well on the fraser side its a bit more complicated because my grandfather simon married three times so my father had two sets of halfbrothers and halfsisters lets leave it for now that ive six fraser uncles and three aunts still living and well leave out all the cousins from that lot yes lets i leaned forward and poured another glass of wine for each of us the clan territories of mackenzie and fraser it turned out adjoined each other for some distance along their inner borders running side by side from the seacoast past the lower end of loch ness this shared border as borders tend to be was an unmapped and most uncertain line shifting to and fro in accordance with time custom and alliance along this border at the southern end of the fraser clan lands lay the small estate of broch tuarach the property of brian fraser jamies father its a fairly rich bit of ground and theres decent fishing and a good patch of forest for hunting it maybe supports sixty crofts and the small village broch mordha its called then theres the manor house of course thats modern he said with some pride and the old broch that we use now for the beasts and the grain dougal and colum were not at all pleased to have their sister marrying a fraser and they insisted that she not be a tenant on fraser land but live on a freehold so lallybroch thats what the folk that live there call it was deeded to my father but there was a clause in the deed stating that the land was to pass to my mother ellens issue only if she died without children the land would go back to lord lovat after my fathers death whether father had children by another wife or no but he didnt remarry and i am my mothers son so lallybrochs mine for what thats worth i thought you were telling me yesterday that you didnt have any property i sipped the wine finding it rather good it seemed to be getting better the more i drank of it i thought perhaps i had better stop soon jamie wagged his head from side to side well it belongs to me right enough the thing is though it doesna do me much good at present as i cant go there he looked apologetic theres the minor matter of the price on my head ye see after his escape from fort william he had been taken to dougals house beannachd means blessed he explained to recover from his wounds and the consequent fever from there he had gone to france where he had spent two years fighting with the french army around the spanish border you spent two years in the french army and stayed a virgin i blurted out incredulously i had had a number of frenchmen in my care and i doubted very much that the gallic attitude toward women had changed appreciably in two hundred years one corner of jamies mouth twitched and he looked down at me sideways if ye had seen the harlots that service the french army sassenach yed wonder ive the nerve even to touch a woman let alone bed one i choked spluttering wine and coughing until he was obliged to pound me on the back i subsided breathless and redfaced and urged him to go on with his story he had returned to scotland a year or so ago and spent six months alone or with a gang of broken men men without clans living hand to mouth in the forest or raiding cattle from the borderlands and then someone hit me in the head wi an ax or something o the sort he said shrugging and ive to take dougals word for what happened during the next two months as i wasna taking much notice of things myself dougal had been on a nearby estate at the time of the attack summoned by jamies friends he had somehow managed to transport his nephew to france why france i asked surely it was taking a frightful risk to move you so far more of a risk to leave me where i was there were english patrols all over the district wed been fairly active thereabouts ye see me and the lads and i suppose dougal didna want them to find me lying senseless in some cottars hut or in his own house i said a little cynically i imagine hed ha taken me there but for two things jamie replied for one hed an english visitor at the time for the second he thought from the look of me i was going to die in any case so he sent me to the abbey the abbey of ste anne de beaupré on the french coast was the domain it seemed of the erstwhile alexander fraser now abbot of that sanctuary of learning and worship one of jamies six fraser uncles he and dougal do not get on particularly jamie explained but dougal could see there was little to be done for me here while if there was aught to help me it might be found there and it was assisted by the monks medical knowledge and his own strong constitution jamie had survived and gradually mended under the care of the holy brothers of st dominic once i was well again i came back he explained dougal and his men met me at the coast and we were headed for the mackenzie lands when we er met with you captain randall said you were stealing cattle i said he smiled undisturbed by the accusation well dougal isna the man to overlook an opportunity of turning a bit of a profit he observed we came on a nice bunch of beasts grazing in a field and no one about so he shrugged with a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitabilities of life apparently i had come upon the end of the confrontation between dougals men and randalls dragoons spotting the english bearing down on them dougal had sent half his men around a thicket driving the cattle before them while the rest of the scots had hidden among the saplings ready to ambush the english as they came by worked verra well too jamie said in approval we popped out at them and rode straight through them yelling they took after us of course and we led them a canty chase uphill and through burns and over rocks and such and all the while the rest of dougals men were making off over the border wi the kine we lost the lobsterbacks then and denned up at the cottage where i first saw ye waiting for darkness to slip out i see i said why did you come back to scotland in the first place though i should have thought youd be much safer in france he opened his mouth to reply then reconsidered sipping wine apparently i was getting near the edge of his own area of secrecy well thats a long story sassenach he said avoiding the issue ill tell it ye later but for now what about you will ye tell me about your own family if ye feel ye can of course he added hastily i thought for a moment but there really seemed little risk in telling him about my parents and uncle lamb there was after all some advantage to uncle lambs choice of profession a scholar of antiquities made as much or as little sense in the eighteenth century as in the twentieth so i told him omitting only such minor details as automobiles and airplanes and of course the war as i talked he listened intently asking questions now and then expressing sympathy at my parents death and interest in uncle lamb and his discoveries and then i met frank i finished up i paused not sure how much more i could say without getting into dangerous territory luckily jamie saved me and yed as soon not talk about him right now he said understandingly i nodded wordless my vision blurring a little jamie let go of the hand he had been holding and putting an arm around me pulled my head gently down on his shoulder its all right he said softly stroking my hair are ye tired lass shall i leave ye to your sleep i was tempted for a moment to say yes but i felt that that would be both unfair and cowardly i cleared my throat and sat up shaking my head no i said taking a deep breath he smelled faintly of soap and wine im all right tell me tell me what games you used to play when you were a boy the room was furnished with a thick twelvehour candle rings of dark wax marking the hours we talked through three of the rings only letting go of each others hands to pour wine or get up to visit the privy stool behind the curtain in the corner returning from one of these trips jamie yawned and stretched it is awfully late i said getting up too maybe we should go to bed all right he said rubbing the back of his neck to bed or to sleep he cocked a quizzical eyebrow and the corner of his mouth twitched in truth i had been feeling so comfortable with him that i had almost forgotten why we were there at his words i suddenly felt a hollow panic well i said faintly either way youre no intending to sleep in your gown are ye he asked in his usual practical manner well no i suppose not in fact during the rush of events i had not even thought about a sleeping garment which i did not possess in any case i had been sleeping in my chemise or nothing depending on the weather jamie had nothing but the clothes he wore he was plainly going to sleep in his shirt or naked a state of affairs which was likely to bring matters rapidly to a head well then come here and ill help ye wi the laces and such his hands did in fact tremble briefly as he began to undress me he lost some of his selfconsciousness though in the struggle with the dozens of tiny hooks that attached the bodice ha he said in triumph as the last one came loose and we laughed together now let me do you i said deciding that there was no point in further delay i reached up and unfastened his shirt sliding my hands inside and across his shoulders i brought my palms slowly down across his chest feeling the springy hair and the soft indentations around his nipples he stood still hardly breathing as i knelt down to unbuckle the studded belt around his hips if it must be sometime it may as well be now i thought and deliberately ran my hands up the length of his thighs hard and lean under his kilt though by this time i knew perfectly well what most scotsmen wore beneath their kilts nothing it was still something of a shock to find only jamie he lifted me to my feet then and bent his head to kiss me it went on a long while and his hands roamed downward finding the fastening of my petticoat it fell to the floor in a billow of starched flounces leaving me in my chemise where did you learn to kiss like that i said a little breathless he grinned and pulled me close again i said i was a virgin not a monk he said kissing me again if i find i need guidance ill ask he pressed me firmly to him and i could feel that he was more than ready to get on with the business at hand with some surprise i realized that i was ready too in fact whether it was the result of the late hour the wine his own attractiveness or simple deprivation i wanted him quite badly i pulled his shirt loose at the waist and ran my hands up over his chest circling his nipples with my thumbs they grew hard in a second and he crushed me suddenly against his chest oof i said struggling for breath he let go apologizing no dont worry kiss me again he did this time slipping the straps of the chemise down over my shoulders he drew back slightly cupping my breasts and rubbing my nipples as i had done his i fumbled with the buckle that held his kilt his fingers guided mine and the clasp sprang free suddenly he lifted me in his arms and sat down on the bed holding me on his lap he spoke a little hoarsely tell me if im too rough or tell me to stop altogether if ye wish anytime until we are joined i dinna think i can stop after that in answer i put my hands behind his neck and pulled him down on top of me i guided him to the slippery cleft between my legs holy god said james fraser who never took the name of his lord in vain dont stop now i said lying together afterward it seemed natural for him to cradle my head on his chest we fitted well together and most of our original constraint was gone lost in shared excitement and the novelty of exploring each other was it like you thought it would be i asked curiously he chuckled making a deep rumble under my ear almost i had thought nay never mind no tell me what did you think im no goin to tell ye yell laugh at me i promise not to laugh tell me he caressed my hair smoothing the curls back from my ear oh all right i didna realize that ye did it face to face i thought ye must do it the back way like like horses ye know it was a struggle to keep my promise but i didnt laugh i know that sounds silly he said defensively its just well ye know how you get ideas in your head when youre young and then somehow they just stick there youve never seen people make love i was surprised at this having seen the crofters cottages where the whole family shared a single room granted that jamies family were not crofters still it must be the rare scottish child who had never waked to find his elders coupling nearby of course i have but generally under the bedclothes ye know i couldna tell anything except the man was on top that much i knew mm i noticed did i squash you he asked a little anxiously not much really though is that what you thought i didnt laugh but couldnt help grinning broadly he turned slightly pink around the ears aye i saw a man take a woman plain once out in the open but that well it was a rape was what it was and he took her from the back it made some impression on me and as i say its just the idea stuck he continued to hold me using his horsegentling techniques again these gradually changed though to a more determined exploration i want to ask ye something he said running a hand down the length of my back whats that did ye like it he said a little shyly yes i did i said quite honestly oh i thought ye did though murtagh told me that women generally do not care for it so i should finish as soon as i could what would murtagh know about it i said indignantly the slower the better as far as most women are concerned jamie chuckled again well youd know better than murtagh i had considerable good advice offered me on the subject last night from murtagh and rupert and ned a good bit of it sounded verra unlikely to me though so i thought id best use my own judgment it hasnt led you wrong yet i said curling one of his chest hairs around my finger what other sage bits of advice did they give you his skin was a ruddy gold in the candlelight to my amusement it grew still redder in embarrassment i could no repeat most of it as i said i think its likely wrong anyway ive seen a good many kinds of animals mate with each other and most seem to manage it without any advice at all i would suppose people could do the same i was privately entertained by the notion of someone picking up pointers on sexual technique from barnyard and forest rather than locker rooms and dirty magazines what kinds of animals have you seen mating oh all kinds our farm was near the forest ye see and i spent a good deal of time there hunting or seeking cows as had got out and suchlike ive seen horses and cows of course pigs chickens doves dogs cats red deer squirrels rabbits wild boar oh and once even a pair of snakes snakes aye did ye know that snakes have two cocks male snakes i mean no i didnt are you sure about that aye and both of em forked like this he spread his second and third fingers apart in illustration that sounds terribly uncomfortable for the female snake i said giggling well she appeared to be enjoying herself said jamie near as i could tell snakes havena got much expression on their faces i buried my face in his chest snorting with mirth his pleasant musky smell mingled with the harsh scent of linen take off your shirt i said sitting up and pulling at the hem of the garment why he asked but sat up and obliged i knelt in front of him admiring his naked body because i want to look at you i said he was beautifully made with long graceful bones and flat muscles that flowed smoothly from the curves of chest and shoulder to the slight concavities of belly and thigh he raised his eyebrows well then fairs fair take off yours then he reached out and helped me squirm out of the wrinkled chemise pushing it down over my hips once it was off he held me by the waist studying me with intense interest i grew almost embarrassed as he looked me over havent you ever seen a naked woman before i asked aye but not one so close his face broke into a broad grin and not one thats mine he stroked my hips with both hands you have good wide hips yed be a good breeder i expect what i drew away indignantly but he pulled me back and collapsed on the bed with me on top of him he held me until i stopped struggling then raised me enough to meet his lips again i know once is enough to make it legal but he paused shyly you want to do it again would ye mind verra much i didnt laugh this time either but i felt my ribs creak under the strain no i said gravely i wouldnt mind are you hungry i asked softly sometime later famished he bent his head to bite my breast softly then looked up with a grin but i need food too he rolled to the edge of the bed theres cold beef and bread in the kitchen i expect and likely wine as well ill go and bring us some supper no dont you get up ill fetch it i jumped off the bed and headed for the door pulling a shawl over my shift against the chill of the corridor wait claire jamie called yed better let me but i had already opened the door my appearance at the door was greeted by a raucous cheer from some fifteen men lounging around the fireplace of the main room below drinking eating and tossing dice i stood nonplussed on the balcony for a moment fifteen leering faces flickering out of the firelit shadows at me hey lass shouted rupert one of the loungers yere still able t walk isnt jamie doin his duty by ye then this sally was greeted with gales of laughter and a number of even cruder remarks regarding jamies prowess if yeve worn jamie out aready ill be happy t take is place offered a short darkhaired youth nay nay es no good lass take me shouted another shell ha none o ye lads yelled murtagh uproariously drunk after jamie shell need somethin like this to satisfy er he waved a huge mutton bone overhead causing the room to rock with laughter i whirled back into the room slammed the door and stood with my back to it glaring at jamie who lay naked on the bed shaking with laughter i tried to warn ye he said gasping you should see your face just what i hissed are all those men doing out there jamie slid gracefully off our wedding couch and began rummaging on his knees through the pile of discarded clothing on the floor witnesses he said briefly dougal is no takin any chances of this marriage bein annulled he straightened with his kilt in his hands grinning at me as he wrapped it around his loins im afraid your reputations compromised beyond repair sassenach he started shirtless for the door dont go out there i said in sudden panic he turned to smile reassuringly hand on the latch dinna worry lass if theyre witnesses they may as well have somethin to see besides im no intendin to starve for the next three days for fear of a wee bit o chaff he stepped out of the room to a chorus of bawdy applause leaving the door slightly ajar i could hear his progress toward the kitchen marked by shouted congratulations and ribald questions and advice how was yer first time jamie did ye bleed shouted ruperts easily recognized gravelpit voice nay but ye will ye auld bugger if ye dinna clapper yer face came jamies spiked tones in broad scots reply howls of delight greeted this sally and the raillery continued following jamie down the hall to the kitchen and back up the stairs i pushed open the door a crack to admit jamie face red as the fire below and hands piled high with food and drink he sidled in followed by a final burst of hilarity from below i choked it off with a decisive slam of the door and shot the bolt to i brought enough well no need to go out again for a bit jamie said laying out dishes on the table carefully not looking at me will ye have a bite i reached past him for the bottle of wine not just yet what i need is a drink there was a powerful urgency in him that roused me to response despite his awkwardness not wanting to lecture nor yet to highlight my own experience i let him do what he would only offering an occasional suggestion such as that he might carry his weight on his elbows and not my chest as yet too hungry and too clumsy for tenderness still he made love with a sort of unflagging joy that made me think that male virginity might be a highly underrated commodity he exhibited a concern for my safety though that i found at once endearing and irritating sometime in our third encounter i arched tightly against him and cried out he drew back at once startled and apologetic im sorry he said i didna mean to hurt ye you didnt i stretched languorously feeling dreamily wonderful are you sure he said inspecting me for damage suddenly it dawned on me that a few of the finer points had likely been left out of his hasty education at the hands of murtagh and rupert does it happen every time he asked fascinated once i had enlightened him i felt rather like the wife of bath or a japanese geisha i had never envisioned myself as an instructress in the arts of love but i had to admit to myself that the role held certain attractions no not every time i said amused only if the man is a good lover oh his ears turned faintly pink i was slightly alarmed to see the look of frank interest being replaced with one of growing determination will you tell me what i should do next time he asked you dont need to do anything special i assured him just go slowly and pay attention why wait though youre still ready he was surprised you dont need to wait i canna do it again right away after well women are different aye i noticed he muttered he circled my wrist with thumb and index finger its just youre so small im afraid im going to hurt you you are not going to hurt me i said impatiently and if you did i wouldnt mind seeing puzzled incomprehension on his face i decided to show him what i meant what are you doing he asked shocked just what it looks like hold still after a few moments i began to use my teeth pressing progressively harder until he drew in his breath with a sharp hiss i stopped did i hurt you i asked yes a little he sounded halfstrangled do you want me to stop no i went on being deliberately rough until he suddenly convulsed with a groan that sounded as though i had torn his heart out by the roots he lay back quivering and breathing heavily he muttered something in gaelic eyes closed what did you say i said he answered opening his eyes i thought my heart was going to burst i grinned pleased with myself oh murtagh and company didnt tell you about that either aye they did that was one of the things i didnt believe i laughed in that case maybe youd better not tell me what else they told you do you see what i meant though about not minding if youre rough aye he drew a deep breath and blew it out slowly if i did that to you would it feel the same well you know i said slowly i dont really know i had been doing my best to keep my thoughts of frank at bay feeling that there should really be no more than two people in a marriage bed regardless of how they got there jamie was very different from frank both in body and mind but there are in fact only a limited number of ways in which two bodies can meet and we had not yet established that territory of intimacy in which the act of love takes on infinite variety the echoes of the flesh were unavoidable but there were a few territories still unexplored jamies brows were tilted in an expression of mocking threat oh so theres something you dont know well well find out then wont we as soon as ive the strength for it he closed his eyes again next week sometime i woke in the hours before dawn shivering and rigid with terror i could not recall the dream that woke me but the abrupt plunge into reality was equally frightening it had been possible to forget my situation for a time the night before lost in the pleasures of newfound intimacy now i was alone next to a sleeping stranger with whom my life was inextricably linked adrift in a place filled with unseen threat i must have made some sound of distress for there was a sudden upheaval of bedclothes as the stranger in my bed vaulted to the floor with the heartstopping suddenness of a pheasant rising underfoot he came to rest in a crouch near the door of the chamber barely visible in the predawn light pausing to listen carefully at the door he made a rapid inspection of the room gliding soundlessly from door to window to bed the angle of his arm told me that he held a weapon of some sort though i could not see what it was in the darkness sitting down next to me satisfied that all was secure he slid the knife or whatever it was back into its hiding place above the headboard are you all right he whispered his fingers brushed my wet cheek yes im sorry to wake you i had a nightmare what on earth i started to ask what it was that had made him spring so abruptly to the alert a large warm hand ran down my bare arm interrupting my question no wonder youre frozen the hand urged me under the pile of quilts and into the warm space recently vacated my fault he murmured ive taken all the quilts im afraid im no accustomed yet to share a bed he wrapped the quilts comfortably around us and lay back beside me a moment later he reached again to touch my face is it me he asked quietly can ye not bear me i gave a short hiccupping laugh not quite a sob no it isnt you i reached out in the dark groping for a hand to press reassuringly my fingers met a tangle of quilts and warm flesh but at last i found the hand i had been seeking we lay side by side looking up at the low beamed ceiling what if i said i couldnt bear you i asked suddenly what on earth could you do the bed creaked as he shrugged tell dougal you wanted an annulment on grounds of nonconsummation i suppose this time i laughed outright nonconsummation with all those witnesses the room was growing light enough to see the smile on the face turned toward me aye well witnesses or no its only you and me that can say for sure isnt it and id rather be embarrassed than wed to someone that hated me i turned toward him i dont hate you i dont hate you either and theres many good marriages have started wi less than that gently he turned me away from him and fitted himself to my back so we lay nested together his hand cupped my breast not in invitation or demand but because it seemed to belong there dont be afraid he whispered into my hair theres the two of us now i felt warm soothed and safe for the first time in many days it was only as i drifted into sleep under the first rays of daylight that i remembered the knife above my head and wondered again what threat would make a man sleep armed and watchful in his bridal chamber chapter one fine day the hardwon intimacy of the night seemed to have evaporated with the dew and there was considerable constraint between us in the morning after a mostly silent breakfast taken in our room we climbed the small hillock behind the inn exchanging rather strained politenesses from time to time at the crest i settled on a log to rest while jamie sat on the ground back against a pine sapling a few feet away some bird was active in the bush behind me a siskin i supposed or possibly a thrush i listened to its dilatory rustlings watched the small fluffy clouds float by and pondered the etiquette of the situation the silence was becoming really too heavy to bear when jamie suddenly said i hope then stopped and blushed though i rather felt it should be me blushing i was glad that at least one of us was able to do it what i said as encouragingly as possible he shook his head still pink it doesna matter go ahead i reached out a foot and nudged his leg with a tentative toe honesty remember it was unfair but i really couldnt stand any more nervous throatclearing and eyetwitching his clasped hands tightened around his knees and he rocked back a bit but fixed his gaze directly on me i was going to say he said softly that i hoped the man who had the honor to lie first wi you was as generous as you were with me he smiled a little shyly but on second thought that didna sound quite right what i meant well all i wanted was to say thank you generosity had nothing to do with it i snapped looking down and brushing energetically at a nonexistent spot on my dress a large boot pushed into my downcast field of vision and nudged my ankle honesty is it he echoed and i looked up to meet a derisively raised pair of eyebrows above a wide grin well i said defensively not after the first time anyway he laughed and i discovered to my horror that i was not beyond blushing after all a cool shadow fell over my heated face and a large pair of hands took firm hold of mine and pulled me to my feet jamie took my place on the log and patted his knee invitingly sit he said i reluctantly obliged keeping my face turned away he settled me comfortably against his chest and wrapped his arms about my waist i felt the steady thump of his heart against my back now then he said if we canna talk easy yet without touching well touch for a bit tell me when youre accustomed to me again he leaned back so that we were in the shade of an oak and held me close without speaking just breathing slowly so that i felt the rise and fall of his chest and the stir of his breath in my hair all right i said after a moment good he loosened his grip and turned me to face him at close range i could see the bristle of auburn stubble on cheek and chin i brushed my fingers across it it was like the plush on an oldfashioned sofa stiff and soft at the same time im sorry he said i couldna shave this morning dougal gave me a razor before the wedding yesterday but he took it back in case i cut my throat after the wedding night i expect he grinned down at me and i smiled back the reference to dougal reminded me of our conversation of the night before i wondered i said last night you said dougal and his men met you at the coast when you came back from france why did you come back with him instead of going to your own home or the fraser lands i mean the way dougals treated you i trailed off hesitant oh he said shifting his legs to bear my weight more evenly i could almost hear him thinking to himself he made up his mind quite quickly well its something ye should know i suppose he frowned to himself i told ye why im outlawed well for a time after after i left the fort i didna care much about anything my father died about that time and my sister he paused again and i sensed some kind of struggle going on inside him i twisted around to look at him the normally cheerful face was shadowed with some strong emotion dougal told me he said slowly dougal told me thatthat my sister was wi child by randall oh dear he glanced sideways at me then away his eyes were bright as sapphires and he blinked hastily once or twice i i couldna bring myself to go back he said lowvoiced to see her again after what happened and too he sighed then set his lips firmly dougal told me that she that after the child was born she well of course she couldna help it she was alone damn it i left her alone he said she had taken up wi another english soldier someone from the garrison he didna know which one he swallowed heavily then went on more firmly i sent back what money i could of course but i could not well i couldna bring myself to write to her what could i say he shrugged helplessly anyway after a time i grew tired of soldiering in france and i heard through my uncle alex that hed had word of an english deserter named horrocks the man had left the army and taken service wi francis maclean o dunweary he was in his cups one day and let out that hed been stationed wi the garrison at fort william when i escaped and hed seen the man who shot the sergeantmajor that day so he could prove that it wasnt you this sounded good news and i said so jamie nodded well yes though the word of a deserter would likely not count for much still its a start at least id know myself who it was and while i well i dinna see how i can go back to lallybroch still it would be as well if i could walk the soil of scotland without the risk of being hanged yes that seems a good idea i said dryly but where do the mackenzies come into it there followed a certain amount of complicated analysis of family relationships and clan alliances but when the smoke cleared away it appeared that francis maclean was some connection with the mackenzie side and had sent word of horrocks to colum who had sent dougal to make contact with jamie which is how he came to be nearby when i was wounded jamie finished up he paused squinting into the sun i wondered afterward ye know whether perhaps hed done it hit you with an ax your own uncle why on earth he frowned as though weighing how much to tell me then shrugged i dinna ken how much ye know about the clan mackenzie he said though i imagine ye canna have ridden wi old ned gowan for days without hearin something of it he canna keep off the subject for long he nodded at my answering smile well youve seen colum for yourself anyone can see that hell not make old bones and wee hamish is barely eight hell no be able to lead a clan for ten years yet so what happens if colum dies before hamish is ready he looked at me prompting well dougal would be laird i suppose i said slowly at least until hamish is old enough aye thats true jamie nodded but dougals not the man colum is and there are those in the clan that wouldna follow him so gladly if there were an alternative i see i said slowly and you are the alternative i looked him over carefully and had to admit that there was a certain amount of possibility there he was old jacobs grandson a mackenzie by blood if only on his mothers side a big comely wellmade lad plainly intelligent and with the family knack for managing people he had fought in france and proved his ability to lead men in battle an important consideration even the price on his head might not be an insurmountable obstacle if he were laird the english had enough trouble in the highlands between the constant small rebellions the border raids and the warring clans not to risk a major uprising by accusing the chieftain of a major clan of murder which would seem no murder at all to the clansmen to hang an unimportant fraser clansman was one thing to storm castle leoch and drag out the laird of the clan mackenzie to face english justice was something else again do you mean to be laird if colum dies it was one way out of his difficulties after all though i suspected it was a way hedged with its own considerable obstacles he smiled briefly at the thought no even if i felt myself entitled to it which i dont it would split the clan dougals men against those that might follow me i havena the taste for power at the cost of other mens blood but dougal and colum couldna be sure of that could they so they might think it safer just to kill me than to take the risk my brow was furrowed thinking it all out but surely you could tell dougal and colum that you dont intend oh i looked up at him with considerable respect but you did at the oathtaking i had thought already how well he had handled a dangerous situation there now i saw just how dangerous it had been the clansmen had certainly wanted him to take his oath just as certainly colum had not to swear such an oath was to declare himself a member of the clan mackenzie and as such a potential candidate for chieftain of the clan he risked open violence or death for refusal he risked the same more privately for compliance seeing the danger he had taken the prudent course of staying away from the ceremony and when i by my botched escape attempt had led him straight back to the edge of the abyss he had set a sure and certain foot on a very narrow tightrope and walked it to the other side je suis prest indeed he nodded seeing the thoughts cross my face aye if i had sworn my oath that night chances are i wouldna have seen the dawn i felt a little shaky at the thought as well as at the knowledge that i had unwittingly exposed him to such danger the knife over his bed suddenly seemed nothing more than a sensible precaution i wondered how many nights he had slept armed at leoch expecting death to come visiting i always sleep armed sassenach he said though i had not spoken except for the monastery last night is the first time in months ive not slept wi my dirk in my fist he grinned plainly remembering what had been in his fist instead how the bloody hell did you know what i was thinking i demanded ignoring the grin he shook his head goodnaturedly youd make a verra poor spy sassenach everything ye think shows on your face plain as day you looked at my dirk and then ye blushed he studied me appraisingly bright head on one side i asked ye for honesty last night but it wasna really necessary it isna in you to lie just as well since im apparently so bad at it i observed with some asperity am i to take it that at least you dont think im a spy then he didnt answer he was looking over my shoulder toward the inn body suddenly tense as a bowstring i was startled for a moment but then heard the sounds that had attracted his attention the thud of hooves and jangle of harness a large group of mounted men was coming down the road toward the inn moving cautiously jamie crouched behind the screen of bushes at a spot commanding a view of the road i tucked my skirts up and crawled after him as silently as i could the road hooked sharply past a rocky outcrop then curved more gently down to the hollow where the inn lay the morning breeze carried the sounds of the approaching group in our direction but it was a minute or two before the first horse poked its nose into sight it was a group of some twenty or thirty men mostly wearing leather trews and tartanclad but in a variety of colors and patterns all without exception were well armed each horse bore at least one musket strapped to the saddle and there was an abundance of pistols dirks and swords on view plus whatever further armament might be concealed in the capacious saddlebags of the four packhorses six of the men also led extra mounts unburdened and saddleless despite their warlike accoutrements the men seemed relaxed they were chatting and laughing in small groups as they rode though here and there a head raised watchful of the surroundings i fought back the urge to duck as one mans gaze passed over the spot where we lay hidden it seemed as though that searching look must surely discover some random movement or the gleam of the sun off jamies hair glancing up at this thought i discovered that it had occurred to him as well he had pulled a fold of his plaid up over his head and shoulders so that the dull hunting pattern made him effectively part of the shrubbery as the last of the men wound down into the innyard jamie dropped the plaid and motioned back toward the path up the hill do you know who they are i panted as i followed him up into the heather oh aye jamie took the steep path like a mountain goat with no loss of breath or composure glancing back he noticed my labored progress and stopped reaching down a hand to help me its the watch he said nodding back in the direction of the inn were safe enough but i thought wed as soon be a bit further away i had heard of the famous black watch that informal police force that kept order in the highlands and heard also that there were other watches each patrolling its own area collecting subscriptions from clients for the safeguarding of cattle and property clients in arrears might well wake one morning to find their livestock vanished in the night and none to tell where they had gone certainly not the men of the watch i was seized by a sudden irrational terror theyre not looking for you are they startled he looked back as though expecting to see men scrambling up the hill in pursuit but there was no one and he looked back at me with a relieved smile and put an arm about my waist to help me along nay i doubt it ten pound sterling is not enough to make me worth the hunting by a pack like that and if they kent i was at the inn they wouldna have come as they did traipsing up to the door all of a piece he shook his head decisively no were they hunting anyone theyd send men to guard the back and the windows before coming in the front door theyve but stopped there for refreshment likely we continued to climb past the spot where the rude path petered out in clumps of gorse and heather we were among foothills here and the granite rocks rose higher than jamies head reminding me uncomfortably of the standing stones of craigh na dun we emerged then onto the top of a small dun and the hills sloped away in a breathtaking fall of rocks and green on all sides most places in the highlands gave me a feeling of being surrounded by trees or rocks or mountains but here we were exposed to the fresh drafts of the wind and the rays of the sun which had come out as though in celebration of our unorthodox marriage i experienced a heady sense of freedom at being out from under dougals influence and the claustrophobic company of so many men i was tempted to urge jamie to run away and to take me with him but common sense prevailed we had neither of us any money nor any food beyond the bit of lunch that he carried in his sporran we would certainly be pursued if we did not return to the inn by sundown and while jamie could plainly climb rocks all day without breaking a sweat or getting out of breath i was in no such training noticing my red face he led me to a rock and sat beside me contentedly gazing out over the hills while he waited for me to regain my breath we were certainly safe here thinking of the watch i laid a hand impulsively on jamies arm im awfully glad youre not worth very much i said he regarded me for a moment rubbing his nose which was beginning to redden well i might take that several ways sassenach but under the circumstances he said thank you i should thank you i said for marrying me i must say that id rather be here than in fort william i thank ye for the compliment lady he said with a slight bow so would i and while were busy thanking each other he added i should thank you for marrying me as well er well i blushed once more not only for that sassenach he said his grin widening though certainly for that as well but i imagine youve also saved my life for me at least so far as the mackenzies are concerned whatever do you mean being half mackenzie is one thing he explained being half mackenzie wi an english wife is quite another there isna much chance of a sassenach wench ever becoming lady of leoch whatever the clansmen might think of me alone thats why dougal picked me to wed ye to ye ken he lifted one brow reddishgold in the morning sun i hope ye wouldna have preferred rupert after all no i wouldnt i said with emphasis he laughed and got up brushing pine needles from his kilts well my mother told me id be some lassies choice one fine day he reached down a hand and helped me up i told her he continued that i thought it was the mans part to choose and what did she say to that i asked she rolled her eyes and said youll find out my fine wee cockerel youll find out he laughed and so i have he looked upward to where the sun was now seeping through the pine needles in lemon threads and it is a fine day at that come along sassenach ill take ye fishin we went further up into the hills this time jamie turned to the north and over a jumble of stone and through a crevice into the head of a tiny glen rockwalled and leafy filled with the gurgling of water from the burn that spilled from a dozen wee falls among the rocks and plunged roistering down the length of the canyon into a series of rills and pools below we dangled our feet in the water moving from shade to sun and back to shade as we grew too warm talking of this and that and not much of anything both aware of each others smallest movement both content to wait until chance should bring us to that moment when a glance should linger and a touch should signal more above one dark speckled pool jamie showed me how to tickle trout crouched to avoid the lowgrowing branches overhead he duckwalked along an overhanging ledge arms outstretched for balance halfway along he turned carefully on the rock and stretched out his hand urging me to follow i had my skirts tucked up already for walking through rough country and managed well enough we stretched fulllength on the cool rock head to head peering down into the water willow branches brushing our backs all it is he said is to pick a good spot and then wait he dipped one hand below the surface smoothly no splashing and let it lie on the sandy bottom just outside the line of shadow made by the rocky overhang the long fingers curled delicately toward the palm distorted by the water so that they seemed to wave gently to and fro in unison like the leaves of a water plant though i saw from the still muscling of his forearm that he was not moving his hand at all the column of his arm bent abruptly at the surface seeming as disjointed as it had been when i had met him little more than a month my god only a month before met one month married one day bound by vows and by blood and by friendship as well when the time came to leave i hoped that i would not hurt him too badly i found myself glad that for the moment i need not think about it we were far from craigh na dun and not a chance in the world of escape from dougal for the present there he is jamies voice was low hardly more than a breath he had told me that trout have sensitive ears from my angle of view the trout was little more than a stirring of the speckled sand deep in the rock shadow there was no telltale gleam of scales speckles moved on speckles shifted by the fanning of transparent fins invisible but for their motion the minnows that had gathered to pluck curiously at the hairs on jamies wrist fled away into the brightness of the pool one finger bent slowly so slowly it was hard to see the movement i could tell it moved only by its changing position relative to the other fingers another finger slowly bent and after a long long moment another i scarcely dared breathe and my heart beat against the cold rock with a rhythm faster than the breathing of the fish sluggishly the fingers bent back lying open one by one and the slow hypnotic wave began again one finger one finger one finger more the movement a smooth ripple like the edge of a fishs fin as though drawn by the slowmotion beckoning the trouts nose pressed outward a delicate gasping of mouth and gills busy in the rhythm of breathing pink lining showing not showing showing not showing as the opercula beat like a heart the chewing mouth groped and bit water most of the body was clear of the rock now hanging weightless in the water still in the shadow i could see one eye twitching to and fro in a blank directionless stare an inch more would bring the flapping gillcovers right over the treacherous beckoning fingers i found that i was gripping the rock with both hands pressing my cheek hard against the granite as though i could make myself still more inconspicuous there was a sudden explosion of motion everything happened so fast i couldnt see what actually did take place there was a heavy splatter of water that sluiced across the rock an inch from my face and a flurry of plaid as jamie rolled across the rock above me and a heavy splat as the fishs body sailed through the air and struck the leafstrewn bank jamie surged off the ledge and into the shallows of the side pool splashing across to retrieve his prize before the stunned fish could succeed in flapping its way back to the sanctuary of the water seizing it by the tail he slapped it expertly against a rock killing it at once then waded back to show it to me a good size he said proudly holding out a solid fourteenincher do nicely for breakfast he grinned up at me wet to the thighs hair hanging in his face shirt splotched with water and dead leaves i told you id not let ye go hungry he wrapped the trout in layers of burdock leaves and cool mud then he rinsed his fingers in the cold water of the burn and clambering up onto the rock handed me the neatly wrapped parcel an odd wedding present may be he nodded at the trout but not without precedent as ned gowan might say there are precedents for giving a new wife a fish i asked entertained he stripped off his stockings to dry and laid them on the rock to lie in the sun his long bare toes wiggled in enjoyment of the warmth its an old love song from the isles dye want to hear it yes of course er in english if you can i added oh aye ive no voice for music but ill give you the words and fingering the hair back out of his eyes he recited thou daughter of the king of brightlit mansions on the night that our wedding is on us if living man i be in duntulm i will go bounding to thee with gifts thou wilt get a hundred badgers dwellers in banks a hundred brown otters natives of streams a hundred silver trout rising from their pools and on through a remarkable list of the flora and fauna of the isles i had time watching him declaim to reflect on the oddity of sitting on a rock in a scottish pool listening to gaelic love songs with a large dead fish in my lap and the greater oddity that i was enjoying myself very much indeed when he finished i applauded keeping hold of the trout by gripping it between my knees oh i like that one especially the i will go bounding to thee with gifts he sounds a most enthusiastic lover eyes closed against the sun jamie laughed i suppose i could add a line for myself i will leap into pools for thy sake we both laughed and then were quiet for a time basking in the warm sun of the early summer it was very peaceful there with no sound but the rushing of water beyond our still pool jamies breathing had calmed i was very conscious of the slow rise and fall of his breast and the slow beat of the pulse in his neck he had a small triangular scar just there at the base of his throat i could feel the shyness and constraint beginning to creep back i reached out a hand and grasped his tightly hoping that the touch would reestablish the ease between us as it had before he slid an arm about my shoulders but it only made me aware of the hard lines of his body beneath the thin shirt i pulled away under the pretext of plucking a bunch of pinkflowered storksbill that grew from a crack in the rock good for headache i explained tucking them into my belt it troubles you he said tilting his head to look at me intently not headache i dont mean frank youre thinking of him and so it troubles you when i touch you because ye canna hold us both in your mind is that it youre very perceptive i said surprised he smiled but made no move to touch me again no great task to puzzle that out lass i knew when we married that you couldna help but have him often in your mind did ye want to or no i didnt at the moment but he was right i couldnt help it am i much like him he asked suddenly no in fact it would be difficult to imagine a greater contrast frank was slender lithe and dark where jamie was large powerful and fair as a ruddy sunbeam while both men had the compact grace of athletes franks was the build of a tennis player jamies the body of a warrior shaped and battered by the abrasion of sheer physical adversity frank stood a scant four inches above my own five foot six facetoface with jamie my nose fitted comfortably into the small hollow in the center of his chest and his chin could rest easily on top of my head nor was the physical the only dimension where the two men varied there was nearly fifteen years difference in their ages for one thing which likely accounted for some of the difference between franks urbane reserve and jamies frank openness as a lover frank was polished sophisticated considerate and skilled lacking experience or the pretense of it jamie simply gave me all of himself without reservation and the depth of my response to that unsettled me completely jamie was watching my struggle not without sympathy well then it would seem i have two choices in the matter he said i can let you brood about it or he leaned down and gently fitted his mouth over mine i had kissed my share of men particularly during the war years when flirtation and instant romance were the lightminded companions of death and uncertainty jamie though was something different his extreme gentleness was in no way tentative rather it was a promise of power known and held in leash a challenge and a provocation the more remarkable for its lack of demand i am yours it said and if you will have me then i would and my mouth opened beneath his wholeheartedly accepting both promise and challenge without consulting me after a long moment he lifted his head and smiled down at me or i can try to distract ye from your thoughts he finished he pressed my head against his shoulder stroking my hair and smoothing the leaping curls around my ears i do not know if it will help he said quietly but i will tell you this it is a gift and a wonder to me to know that i can please you that your body can rouse to mine i hadna thought of such a thing beforehand i drew a long breath before replying yes i said it helps i think we were silent again for what seemed a long time at last jamie drew away and looked down at me smiling i told ye ive neither money nor property sassenach i nodded wondering what he intended i should have warned ye before that wed likely end up sleeping in haystacks wi naught but heather ale and drammach for food i dont mind i said he nodded toward an opening in the trees not taking his eyes off me i havena got a haystack about me but theres a fair patch of fresh bracken yonder if yed care to practice just to get the way of it a little later i stroked his back damp with exertion and the juice of crushed ferns if you say thank you once more i will slap you i said instead i was answered with a gentle snore an overhanging fern brushed his cheek and an inquisitive ant crawled across his hand making the long fingers twitch in his sleep i brushed it away and leaned back on one elbow watching him his lashes were long seen thus with his eyes closed and thick oddly colored though dark auburn at the tips they were very light almost blond at the roots the firm line of his mouth had relaxed in sleep while it kept a faintly humorous curl at the corner his lower lip now eased into a fuller curve that seemed both sensual and innocent damn i said softly to myself i had been fighting it for some time even before this ridiculous marriage i had been more than conscious of his attraction it had happened before as it doubtless happens to almost everyone a sudden sensitivity to the presence the appearance of a particular man or woman i suppose the urge to follow him with my eyes to arrange for small inadvertent meetings to watch him unawares as he went about his work an exquisite sensitivity to the small details of his body the shoulderblades beneath the cloth of his shirt the lumpy bones of his wrists the soft place underneath his jaw where the first prickles of his beard begin to show infatuation it was common among the nurses and the doctors the nurses and the patients among any gathering of people thrown for long periods into one anothers company some acted on it and brief intense affairs were frequent if they were lucky the affair flamed out within a few months and nothing resulted from it if they were not well pregnancy divorce here and there the odd case of venereal disease dangerous thing infatuation i had felt it several times but had had the good sense not to act on it and as it always does after a time the attraction had lessened and the man lost his golden aura and resumed his usual place in my life with no harm done to him to me or to frank and now now i had been forced to act on it and god only knew what harm might be done by that action but there was no turning back from this point he lay at ease sprawled on his stomach the sun glinted off his red mane and lit the tiny soft hairs that crested his spine running down to the reddishgold fuzz that dusted his buttocks and thighs and deepened into the thicket of soft auburn curls that showed briefly between his spread legs i sat up admiring the long legs with the smooth line of muscling that indented the thigh from hip to knee and another that ran from knee to long elegant foot the bottoms of his feet were smooth and pink slightly callused from going barefoot my fingers ached wantingto trace the line of his small neat ear and the blunt angle of his jaw well i thought the action had been taken and it was far past the time for restraint nothing i did now could make matters worse for either of us i reached out and gently touched him he slept very lightly with a suddenness that made me jump he flipped over bracing himself on his elbows as though to leap to his feet seeing me he relaxed smiling madam you have me at a disadvantage he made a very creditable courtly bow for a man stretched at full length in a patch of ferns wearing nothing but a few dappled splotches of sunlight and i laughed the smile stayed on his face but it altered as he looked at me naked in the ferns his voice was suddenly husky in fact madam you have me at your mercy have i then i said softly he didnt move as i reached out once more and drew my hand slowly down his cheek and neck over the gleaming slope of his shoulder and down he didnt move but he closed his eyes dear holy lord he said he drew his breath in sharply dont worry i said it doesnt have to be rough thank god for small mercies keep still his fingers dug deeply into the crumbling earth but he obeyed please he said after a time glancing up i could see that his eyes were open now no i said enjoying myself he closed his eyes again youll pay for this he said a short time later a fine dew of sweat shone on the straight bridge of his nose really i said what are you going to do the tendons stood out in his forearms as he pressed his palms against the earth and he spoke with an effort as though his teeth were clenched i dont know but by christ and st agnes i will ththink of ssomething god please all right i said releasing him and i uttered a small shriek as he rolled onto me pinning me against the ferns your turn he said with considerable satisfaction we returned to the inn at sunset pausing at the top of the hill to be sure that the horses of the watch were no longer hobbled outside the inn looked welcoming light already shining through the small windows and through the chinks in the walls the last of the sun glowed behind us as well so that everything on the hillside threw a double shadow the breeze rose with the cooling of the day and the fluttering leaves of the trees made the multiple shadows dance on the grass i could easily imagine that there were fairies on the hill dancing with those shadows threading their way through the slender trunks to blend into the depths of the wood dougals not back yet either i observed as we came down the hill the large black gelding he customarily rode was not in the inns small paddock several other beasts were missing as well ned gowans for one no he shouldna come back for another day at least maybe two jamie offered me his arm and we descended the hill slowly careful of the many rocks that poked through the short grass where on earth has he gone caught in the rush of recent events i had not thought to question his absence or even to notice it jamie handed me over the stile at the back of the inn to do his business wi the cottars nearby hes got but a day or two before hes supposed to produce you at the fort ye ken he squeezed my arm reassuringly captain randall willna be best pleased when dougal tells him hes not to have ye and dougal would as soon not linger in the area afterward sensible of him i observed also kind of him to leave us here to er get acquainted with each other jamie snorted not kindness that was one of the conditions i set for takin ye i said id wed if i must but damned if id consummate my marriage under a bush wi twenty clansmen lookin on and offering advice i stopped staring at him so that was what the shouting had been about one of the conditions i said slowly and what were the others it was growing too dark to see his face clearly but i thought he seemed embarrassed only two others he said finally which were well he said kicking a pebble diffidently out of the way i said ye must wed me proper in kirk before a priest not just by contract as for the other he must find ye a suitable gown to be wed in he looked away avoiding my gaze and his voice was so soft i could scarcely hear him i i knew ye didna wish to wed i wanted to make it as pleasant as might be for you i thought ye might feel a bit less well i wanted ye to have a decent dress is all i opened my mouth to say something but he turned away toward the inn come along sassenach he said gruffly im hungry the price of food was company as was obvious from the moment of our appearance at the door of the inns main room we were greeted by raucous cheers and hurriedly pushed into seats at the table where a hearty supper was already in progress having been somewhat prepared this time i didnt mind the rough jests and crude remarks at our expense for once i was pleased to be modestly selfeffacing scrunching back into the corner and leaving jamie to deal with the rough teasing and bawdy speculations about what we had been doing all day sleeping said jamie in answer to one question of this sort didna catch a wink last night the roars of laughter that greeted this were topped by louder ones as he added in confidential tones she snores ye ken i obligingly cuffed his ear and he gathered me to him and kissed me soundly to general applause after supper there was dancing to the accompaniment of the landlords fiddle i had never been much of a dancer being rather prone to trip over my own feet in times of stress i scarcely expected that i would do better attired in long skirts and clumsy footgear once i had shed the clogs though i was surprised to find that i danced with no difficulty and great enjoyment women being in short supply the innkeepers wife and i tucked up our skirts and danced jigs and reels and strathspeys without ceasing until i had to stop and lean against the settle redfaced and gasping for breath the men were absolutely indefatigable whirling about like plaid tops by themselves or with each other finally they stood back against the wall watching cheering and clapping as jamie took both my hands and led me through something fast and frantic called the cock o the north ending up by forethought near the stair we swirled to a close with his arm about my waist here we paused and he made a short speech mixed in gaelic and english which was received with further applause particularly when he reached into his sporran and tossed a small washleather bag to the landlord instructing that worthy to serve whisky so long as it lasted i recognized it as his share of the wagers from his fight at tunnaig likely all the money he had in the world i thought it could not have been better spent we had made it up to the balcony followed by a hail of indelicate good wishes when a voice louder than the others called jamies name turning i saw ruperts broad face redder than usual above its bush of black beard grinning up from below no good rupert called jamie shes mine wasted on ye lad said rupert mopping his face with his sleeve shell haye on the floor in an hour no stayin power these young lads he called to me ye want a man who doesna waste his time sleepin lass let me know in the meantime he flung something upward a fat little bag clanked on the floor at my feet a wedding present he called courtesy of the men of the shimi bogil watch eh jamie stooped to pick it up some of us dinna spend our day idlin about the grassy banks lad he said reprovingly rolling his eyes lewdly at me that money was hard earned oh aye said jamie grinning dice or cards both a raffish grin split the black beard skint em to the bone lad to the bone jamie opened his mouth but rupert held up a broad callused palm nay lad nay need o thanks just give her a good one for me eh i pressed my fingers to my lips and blew him a kiss slapping a hand to his face as though struck he staggered back with an exclamation and reeled off into the taproom weaving as though drunk which he wasnt after all the hilarity below the room seemed a haven of peace and quiet jamie still laughing quietly to himself sprawled out on the bed to recover his breath i loosened my bodice which was uncomfortably tight and sat down to comb the tangles out of my dancedisordered hair youve the loveliest hair said jamie watching me what this i raised a hand selfconsciously to my locks which as usual could be politely described as higgledypiggledy he laughed well i like the other too he said deliberately straightfaced but yes i meant that but its so curly i said blushing a little aye of course he looked surprised i heard one of dougals girls say to a friend at the castle that it would take three hours with the hot tongs to make hers look like that she said shed like to scratch your eyes out for looking like that and not lifting a hand to do so he sat up and tugged gently on one curl stretching it down so that uncurled it reached nearly to my breast my sister jennys hair is curly too but not so much as yours is your sisters hair red like yours i asked trying to envision what the mysterious jenny might look like she seemed to be often in jamies mind he shook his head still twisting curls in and out between his fingers no jennys hair is black black as night im red like my mother and jenny takes after father brian dhu they called him black brian for his hair and his beard ive heard that captain randall is called black jack i ventured jamie laughed humorlessly oh aye but thats with reference to the color of his soul not his hair his gaze sharpened as he looked down at me youre not worrying about him are ye lass ye shouldna do so his hands left my hair and tightened possessively on my shoulders i meant it ye know he said softly i will protect you from him or anyone else to the last drop of my blood mo duinne mo duinne i asked a little disturbed by the intensity of this speech i didnt want to be responsible for any of his blood being spilt last drop or first it means my brown one he raised a lock of hair to his lips and smiled with a look in his eyes that started all the drops of my own blood chasing each other through my veins mo duinne he repeated softly i have been longing to say that to you rather a dull color brown ive always thought i said practically trying to delay things a bit i kept having the feeling of being whirled along much faster than i intended jamie shook his head still smiling no id not say that sassenach not dull at all he lifted the mass of my hair with both hands and fanned it out its like the water in a burn where it ruffles over the stones dark in the wavy spots with bits of silver on the surface where the sun catches it nervous and a little breathless i pulled away in order to pick up the comb i had dropped on the floor i came up to find jamie eyeing me steadily i said i wouldna ask for anything you did not wish to tell me he said and i wont but i draw my own conclusions colum thought perhaps you were an english spy though he couldna imagine in that case why youd no gaelic dougal thinks youre likely a french spy maybe looking for support for king james but in that case he canna imagine why you were alone and what about you i asked pulling hard at a stubborn tangle what do you think i am he tilted his head appraisingly looking me over carefully to look at you could be french youve that fineboned look through the face that some of the angevin ladies have frenchwomen are usually sallowfaced though and you have skin like an opal he traced a finger slowly across the curve of my collarbone and i felt the skin glow beneath his touch the finger moved to my face drawing from temple to cheek smoothing the hair back behind my ear i remained immobile under his scrutiny trying not to move as his hand passed behind my neck thumb gently stroking my earlobe golden eyes ive seen a pair like that once before on a leopard he shook his head nay lass ye could be french but youre not how do you know ive talked with you a good deal and listened to you besides dougal thinks youre french because you speak french well verra well thank you i said sarcastically and the fact that i speak french well proves im not french he smiled and tightened his grip on my neck vous parlez très bien but not quite as well as i do he added dropping back into english he released me suddenly i spent a year in france after i left the castle and two more later on with the army i know a native speaker of french when i hear one and french is not your mother tongue he shook his head slowly spanish perhaps but why spains no interests in the highlands german surely not he shrugged whoever you are the english would want to find out they canna afford to have unknown quantities at large with the clans restless and prince charlie waiting to set sail from france and their methods of finding out are not very gentle ive reason to know and how do you know im not an english spy then dougal thought i was you said so its possible though your spoken english is more than a little odd too if you were though why would you choose to wed me rather than go back to your own folk that was another reason for dougals makin ye wed me to see would ye bolt last night when it came to the point and i didnt bolt so what does that prove he laughed and lay back down on the bed an arm over his eyes to shield them from the lamp damned if i know sassenach damned if i know there isna any reason able explanation i can think of for you you might be one of the wee folk for all i know he peeked sideways from under his arm no i suppose not youre too big arent you afraid i might kill you in your sleep some night if you dont know who i am he didnt answer but took his arm away from his eyes and his smile widened his eyes must be from the fraser side i thought not deepset like the mackenzies they were set at an odd angle so that the high cheekbones made them look almost slanted without troubling to lift his head he opened the front of his shirt and spread the cloth aside laying his chest bare to the waist he drew the dirk from its sheath and tossed it toward me it thunked on the boards at my feet he put his arm back over his eyes and stretched his head back showing the place where the dark stubble of his sprouting beard stopped abruptly just below the jaw straight up just under the breastbone he advised quick and neat though it takes a bit of strength the throatcuttings easier but its verra messy i bent to pick up the dirk serve you right if i did i remarked cocky bastard the grin visible beneath the crook of his arm widened still further sassenach i stopped dirk still in my hand what ill die a happy man chapter we meet a beggar we slept fairly late the next morning and the sun was high as we left the inn heading south this time most of the horses were gone from the paddock and none of the men from our party seemed to be about i wondered aloud where they had gone jamie grinned i canna say for sure but i could guess the watch went that way yesterday he pointed west so i should say rupert and the others have gone that way pointing east cattle he explained seeing that i still didnt understand the estateholders and tacksmen pay the watch to keep an eye out and get back their cattle if theyre stolen in a raid but if the watch is riding west toward lag cruime any herds to the east are helpless for a bit anyway its the grants lands down that way and ruperts one of the best cattlelifters ive ever seen beasts will follow him anywhere wi scarcely a bleat amongst them and since theres no more entertainment to be had here most likely hes got restless jamie himself seemed rather restless and set a good pace there was a deer trail through the heather and the going was fairly easy so i kept up with no difficulty after a bit we came out onto a stretch of moorland where we could walk side by side what about horrocks i asked suddenly hearing him mention the town of lag cruime i had remembered the english deserter and his possible news you were supposed to meet him in lag cruime werent you he nodded aye but i canna go there now wi both randall and the watch headed that way too dangerous could someone go for you or do you trust anyone enough he glanced down at me and smiled well theres you since ye didna kill me last night after all i suppose i may trust you but im afraid you couldna go to lag cruime alone no if necessary murtagh will go for me but i may be able to arrange something else well see you trust murtagh i asked curiously i had no very friendly feelings toward the scruffy little man since he was more or less responsible for my present predicament having kidnapped me in the first place still there was clearly a friendship of some kind between him and jamie oh aye he glanced at me surprised murtaghs known me all my life a second cousin of my fathers i think his father was my hes a fraser you mean i interrupted hastily i thought he was one of the mackenzies he was with dougal when i met you jamie nodded aye when i decided to come over from france i sent word to him asking him to meet me at the coast he smiled wryly i didna ken ye see whether it was dougal had tried to kill me earlier and i did not quite like the idea of meeting several mackenzies alone just in case didna want to end up washing about in the surf off skye if thats what they had in mind i see so dougal isnt the only one who believes in witnesses he nodded very handy things witnesses on the other side of the moorland was a stretch of twisted rocks pitted and gouged by the advance and retreat of glaciers long gone rainwater filled the deeper pits and thistle and tansy and meadowsweet surrounded these tarns with thick growth the flowers reflected in the still water sterile and fishless these pools dotted the landscape and formed traps for unwary travelers who might easily stumble into one in darkness and be forced to spend a wet and uncomfortable night on the moor we sat down beside one pool to eat our morning meal of bread and cheese this tarn at least had birds swallows dipped low over the water to drink and plovers and curlews poked long bills into the muddy earth at its edges digging for insects i tossed crumbs of bread onto the mud for the birds a curlew eyed one suspiciously but while it was still making up its mind a quick swallow zoomed in under its bill and made off with the treat the curlew ruffled its feathers and went back to its industrious digging jamie called my attention to a plover calling and dragging a seemingly broken wing near us shes a nest somewhere near i said over there he had to point it out several times before i finally spotted it a shallow depression quite out in the open but with its four spotted eggs so close in appearance to the leafspeckled bank that when i blinked i lost sight of the nest again picking up a stick jamie gently poked the nest pushing one egg out of place the mother plover excited ran up almost in front of him he sat on his heels quite motionless letting the bird dart back and forth squalling there was a flash of movement and he held the bird in his hand suddenly still he spoke to the bird in gaelic a quiet hissing sort of speech as he stroked the soft mottled plumage with one finger the bird crouched in his hand completely motionless even the reflections frozen in its round black eyes he set it gently on the ground but the bird did not move away until he said a few more words and waved his hand slowly back and forth behind it it gave a short jerk and darted away into the weeds he watched it go and quite unconscious crossed himself why did you do that i asked curious what he was momentarily startled i think he had forgotten i was there you crossed yourself when the bird flew off i wondered why he shrugged mildly embarrassed ah well its an old tale is all why plovers cry as they do and run keening about their nests like that he motioned to the far side of the tarn where another plover was doing exactly that he watched the bird for a few moments abstracted plovers have the souls of young mothers dead in childbirth he said he glanced aside at me shyly the story goes that they cry and run about their nests because they canna believe the young are safe hatched theyre mourning always for the lost one or looking for a child left behind he squatted by the nest and nudged the oblong egg with his stick turning it bit by bit until the pointed end faced in like the others he stayed squatting even after the egg had been replaced balancing the stick across his thighs staring out over the still waters of the tarn its only habit i suppose he said i did it first when i was much younger when i first heard that story i didna really believe they have souls of course even then but ye ken just as a bit of respect he looked up at me and smiled suddenly done it so often now id not even notice theres quite a few plovers in scotland ye ken he rose and tossed the stick aside lets go on now theres a place i want to show you near the top of the hill yon he took my elbow to help me out of the declivity and we set off up the slope i had heard what he said to the plover he released though i had only a few words of gaelic i had heard the old salutation often enough to be familiar with it god go with ye mother he had said a young mother dead in childbirth and a child left behind i touched his arm and he looked down at me how old were you i asked he gave me a halfsmile eight he answered weaned at least he spoke no more but led me uphill we were in sloping foothills now thick with heather just beyond the countryside changed abruptly with huge heaps of granite rearing up from the earth surrounded by clusters of sycamore and larch we came over the crest of the hill and left the plovers crying by the tarns behind us the sun was growing hot and after an hour of shoving through thick foliage even with jamie doing most of the shoving i was ready for a rest we found a shady spot at the foot of one of the granite outcrops the spot reminded me a bit of the place where i had first met murtagh and parted company with captain randall still it was pleasant here jamie told me that we were alone because of the constant birdsong all around if anyone came near most birds would stop singing though the jays and the jackdaws would screech and call in alarm always hide in a forest sassenach he advised me if ye dinna move too much yourself the birds will tell you in plenty of time if anyones near looking back from pointing out a squawking jay in the tree overhead his eyes caught mine and we sat as though frozen within hands reach but not touching barely breathing after a time the jay grew bored with us and left it was jamie who looked away first with an almost imperceptible shiver as though he were cold the heads of shaggycap mushrooms poked whitely through the mold beneath the ferns jamies blunt forefinger flipped one off its stem and traced the spokes of the basidium as he marshaled his next words when he spoke carefully as now he all but lost the slight scots accent that usually marked his speech i do not wish to that is i do not mean to imply he looked up suddenly and smiled with a helpless gesture i dinna want to insult you by sounding as though i think youve a vast experience of men is all but it would be foolish to pretend that ye dont know more than i do about such matters what i meant to ask is is this usual what it is between us when i touch you when you lie with me is it always so between a man and a woman in spite of his difficulties i knew exactly what he meant his gaze was direct holding my eyes as he waited my answer i wanted to look away but couldnt theres often something like it i said and had to stop and clear my throat but no no it isnt usual i have no idea why but no this is different he relaxed a bit as though i had confirmed something about which he had been anxious i thought perhaps not ive not lain with a woman before but ive ah had my hands on a few he smiled shyly and shook his head it wasna the same i mean ive held women in my arms before and kissed them and well he waved a hand dismissing the and it was verra pleasant indeed made my heart pound and my breath come short and all that but it wasna at all as it is when i take you in my arms and kiss you his eyes i thought were the color of lakes and skies and as fathomless as either he reached out and touched my lower lip barely brushing the edge it starts out the same but then after a moment he said speaking softly suddenly its as though ive a living flame in my arms his touch grew firmer outlining my lips and caressing the line of my jaw and i want only to throw myself into it and be consumed i thought of telling him that his own touch seared my skin and filled my veins with fire but i was already alight and glowing like a brand i closed my eyes and felt the kindling touch move to cheek and temple ear and neck and shuddered as his hands dropped to my waist and drew me close jamie seemed to have a definite idea where we were going at length he stopped at the foot of a huge rock some twenty feet high warty with lumps and jagged cracks tansy and eglantine had taken root in the cracks and waved in precarious yellow flags against the stone he took my hand and nodded at the rock face before us dye see the steps there sassenach think ye can manage it there were in fact faintly marked protuberances in the stone rising at an angle across the face of the rock some were bona fide ledges and others merely a foothold for lichens i couldnt tell whether they were natural or perhaps had known some assistance in their forming but i thought it might just be possible to climb them even in a fulllength skirt and tight bodice with some slippages and scares and with jamie pushing helpfully from the rear on occasion i made it to the top of the rock and paused to look around the view was spectacular the dark bulk of a mountain rose to the east while far below to the south the foothills ran out into a vast barren moorland the top of the rock sloped inward from all sides forming a shallow dish in the center of the dish was a blackened circle with the sooty remnants of charred sticks we were not the first visitors then you knew this place jamie stood to one side a little observing me and taking pleasure in my raptness he shrugged deprecating oh aye i know most places through this part of the highlands come here theres a spot ye can sit and see down to where the road comes past the hill the inn also was visible from here reduced from dollhouse to childs buildingblock by the distance a few tethered horses were clustered under the trees by the road small blobs of brown and black from here no trees grew on the top of the rock and the sun was hot on my back we sat side by side legs dangling over the edge and companionably shared one of the bottles of ale that jamie had thoughtfully lifted from the well in the inn yard as we left there were no trees atop the rock but the smaller plants the ones that could gain a foothold in the precarious cracks and root themselves in meager soil sprouted here and there raising their faces bravely to the hot spring sun there was a small clump of daisies sheltering in the lee of an outcrop near my hand and i reached to pluck one there was a faint whir and the daisy leaped off its stem and landed on my knee i stared stupidly my mind unable to make sense of this bizarre behavior jamie a good deal faster than i in his apprehensions had flung himself flat on the rock get down he said a large hand fastened on my elbow and jerked me flat beside him as i hit the spongy moss i saw the shaft of the arrow still quivering above my face where it had struck home in a cleft of the outcrop i froze afraid even to look around and tried to press myself still flatter against the ground jamie was motionless at my side so still that he might have been a stone himself even the birds and insects seemed to have paused in their song and the air hung breathless and waiting suddenly jamie began to laugh he sat up and grasping the arrow by the shaft twisted it carefully out of the rock it was fletched with the split tailfeathers of a woodpecker i saw and banded with blue thread wrapped in a line half an inch wide below the quills laying the arrow aside jamie cupped his hands around his mouth and gave a remarkably good imitation of the call of a green woodpecker he lowered his hands and waited in a moment the call was answered from the grove below and a broad smile spread across his face a friend of yours i guessed he nodded eyes intent on the narrow path up the rockface hugh munro unless someone else has taken to making arrows in his style we waited a moment longer but no one appeared on the path below ah said jamie softly and whirled around just in time to confront a head rising slowly above the edge of the rock behind us the head burst into a jackolantern grin snaggletoothed and jolly beaming with pleasure at surprising us the head itself was roughly pumpkinshaped the impression enhanced by the orangebrown leathery skin that covered not only the face but the round bald crown of the head as well few pumpkins however could boast such a luxuriant growth of beard nor such a pair of bright blue eyes stubby hands with filthy nails planted themselves beneath the beard and swiftly hoisted the remainder of the jackolantern up into view the body rather matched the head having a distinct look of the halloween goblin about it the shoulders were very broad but hunched and slanted one being considerably higher than the other one leg too seemed somewhat shorter than its fellow giving the man a rather hopping hitching sort of gait munro if this was indeed jamies friend was clad in what appeared to be multiple layers of rags the faded colors of berrydyed fabric peeking out through rents in a shapeless garment that might once have been a womans smock he carried no sporran at his belt which was in any case no more than a frayed length of rope from which two furry carcasses swung headdown instead he had a fat leather wallet slung across his chest of surprisingly good quality considering the rest of his outfit a collection of small metal oddments dangled from the strap of the wallet religious medals military decorations what looked to be old uniform buttons worn coins pierced and sewn on and three or four small rectangular bits of metal dull grey and with cryptic marks incised in their surfaces jamie rose as the creature hopped nimbly over the intervening protrusions of rock and the two men embraced warmly thumping each other hard on the back in the odd fashion of manly greeting and how goes it then with the house of munro inquired jamie standing back at length and surveying his old companion munro ducked his head and made an odd gobbling noise grinning then raising his eyebrows he nodded in my direction and waved his stubby hands in a strangely graceful interrogatory gesture my wife said jamie reddening slightly with a mixture of shyness and pride at the new introduction married but the two days munro smiled more broadly still at this information and executed a remarkably complex and graceful bow involving the rapid touching of head heart and lips and ending up in a nearhorizontal position on the ground at my feet having executed this striking maneuver he sprang to his feet with the grace of an acrobat and thumped jamie again this time in apparent congratulation munro then began an extraordinary ballet of the hands motioning to himself away down toward the forest at me and back to himself with such an array of gestures and wavings that i could hardly follow his flying hands i had seen deafmute talk before but never executed so swiftly and gracefully is that so then jamie exclaimed it was his turn to buffet the other man in congratulation no wonder men got impervious to superficial pain i thought it came from this habit of hammering each other incessantly hes married as well jamie explained turning to me six months since to a widow oh all right to a fat widow he amended in response to an emphatic gesture from munro with six children down in the village of dubhlairn how nice i said politely it looks as though theyll eat well at least i motioned to the rabbits hanging from his belt munro at once unfastened one of the corpses and handed it to me with such an expression of beaming goodwill that i felt obliged to accept it smiling back and hoping privately that it didnt harbor fleas a wedding gift said jamie and most welcome munro ye must allow us to return the favor with which he extracted one of the bottles of ale from its mossy bed and handed it across the courtesies attended to in this manner we all sat down again to a companionable sharing of the third bottle jamie and munro carried on an exchange of news gossip and conversation which seemed no less free for the fact that only one of them spoke i took little part in the conversation being unable to read munros handsigns though jamie did his best to include me by translation and reference at one point jamie jabbed a thumb at the rectangular bits of lead that adorned munros strap gone official have ye he asked or is that just for when the game is scarce munro bobbed his head and nodded like a jackinthebox what are they i asked curiously gaberlunzies oh to be sure i said pardon my asking a gaberlunzie is a license to beg sassenach jamie explained its good within the borders of the parish and only on the one day a week when beggings allowed each parish has its own so the beggars from one parish canna take overmuch advantage of the charity of the next a system with a certain amount of elasticity i see i said eyeing munros stock of four lead seals ah well munros a special case dye see he was captured by the turks at sea spent a good many years rowing up and down in a galley and a few more as a slave in algiers thats where he lost his tongue they cut it out i felt a bit faint jamie seemed undisturbed by the thought but then he had apparently known munro for some time oh aye and broke his leg for him as well the back too munro no he amended at a series of signs from munro the back was an accident something that happened jumping off a wall in alexandria the feet though that was the turks doing i didnt really want to know but both munro and jamie seemed dying to tell me all right i said resigned what happened to his feet with something approaching pride munro stripped off his battered clogs and hose exposing broad splayed feet on which the skin was thickened and roughened white shiny patches alternating with angry red areas boiling oil said jamie its how they force captive christians to convert to the mussulman religion it looks a very effective means of persuasion i said so thats why several parishes will give him leave to beg to make up for his trials on behalf of christendom aye exactly jamie was evidently pleased with my swift appreciation of the situation munro also expressed his admiration with another deep salaam followed by a very expressive if indelicate sequence of hand movements which i gathered were meant to be praising my physical appearance as well thank ye man aye shell do me proud i reckon jamie seeing my uplifted brows tactfully turned munro so that his back was to me and the flying fingers hidden now tell me whats doing in the villages the two men drew closer together continuing their lopsided conversation with an increased intensity since jamies part seemed to be limited mainly to grunts and exclamations of interest i could glean little of the content and busied myself instead with a survey of the strange little rock plants sprouting from the surfaces of our perch i had collected a pocketful of eyebright and dittany by the time they finished talking and hugh munro rose to go with a final bow to me and a thump on the back for jamie he shuffled to the edge of the rock and disappeared as quickly as one of the rabbits he poached might vanish into its hole what fascinating friends you have i said oh aye nice fellow hugh i hunted wi him and some others last year hes on his own now that hes an official beggar but his work keeps him moving about the parishes hell know everything that goes on within the borders of ardagh and chesthill including the whereabouts of horrocks i guessed jamie nodded aye and hell carry a message for me to change the meeting place which foxes dougal rather neatly i observed if he had any ideas about holding you to ransom over horrocks he nodded and a smile creased one corner of his mouth aye theres that about it it was near suppertime again as we reached the inn this time though dougals big black and its five companions were standing in the inn yard contentedly munching hay dougal himself was inside washing the road dust from his throat with sour ale he nodded to me and swung round to greet his nephew instead of speaking though he just stood there head on one side eyeing jamie quizzically ah thats it he said finally in the satisfied tones of a man who has solved a difficult puzzle now i know what ye mind me of lad he turned to me ever seen a red stag near the end of the rutting season lass he said confidentially the poor beasts dinna sleep nor eat for several weeks because they canna spare the time between fightin off the other stags and serving the does by the end o the season theyre naught but skin and bones their eyes are deepsunk in their heads and the only part o them that doesna shake wi palsy is their the last of this was lost in a chorus of laughter as jamie pulled me up the stairs we did not come down to supper much later on the edge of sleep i felt jamies arm around my waist and felt his breath warm against my neck does it ever stop the wanting you his hand came around to caress my breast even when ive just left ye i want you so much my chest feels tight and my fingers ache with wanting to touch ye again he cupped my face in the dark thumbs stroking the arcs of my eyebrows when i hold ye between my two hands and feel you quiver like that waitin for me to take you lord i want to pleasure you til ye cry out under me and open yourself to me and when i take my own pleasure from you i feel as though ive given ye my soul along with my cock he rolled above me and i opened my legs wincing slightly as he entered me he laughed softly aye im a bit sore too do ye want me to stop i wrapped my legs around his hips in answer and pulled him closer would you stop i asked no i cant we laughed together and rocked slowly lips and fingers exploring in the dark i see why the church says it is a sacrament jamie said dreamily this i said startled why or at least holy he said i feel like god himself when im in you i laughed so hard he nearly came out he stopped and gripped my shoulders to steady me whats so funny its hard to imagine god doing this jamie resumed his movements well if god made man in his own image i should imagine hes got a cock he started to laugh as well losing his rhythm again though ye dinna remind me much of the blessed virgin sassenach we shook in each others arms laughing until we came uncoupled and rolled apart recovering jamie slapped my hip get on your knees sassenach why if youll not let me be spiritual about it youll have to put up wi my baser nature im going to be a beast he bit my neck do ye want me to be a horse a bear or a dog a hedgehog a hedgehog and just how does a hedgehog make love he demanded no i thought i wont i will not but i did very carefully i replied giggling helplessly so now we know just how old that one is i thought jamie collapsed in a ball wheezing with laughter at last he rolled over and got to his knees groping for the flint box on the table he glowed like red amber against the rooms darkness as the wick caught and the light swelled behind him he flopped back on the foot of the bed grinning down at me where i still shook on the pillow with spasms of giggles he rubbed the back of his hand across his face and assumed a mockstern expression all right woman i see the time has come when i shall have to exert my authority as your husband oh you will aye he dived forward grabbing my thighs and spreading them i squeaked and tried to wriggle upward no dont do that why not he lay fulllength between my legs squinting up at me he kept a firm hold on my thighs preventing my struggles to close them tell me sassenach why dont ye want me to do that he rubbed his cheek against the inside of one thigh ferocious young beard rasping the tender skin be honest why not he rasped the other side making me kick and squirm wildly to get away to no avail i turned my face into the pillow which felt cool against my flushed cheek well if you must know i muttered i dont think well im afraid that it doesnt i mean the smell my voice faded off into an embarrassed silence there was a sudden movement between my legs as jamie heaved himself up he put his arms around my hips laid his cheek on my thigh and laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks jesus god sassenach he said at last snorting with mirth dont ye know whats the first thing you do when youre getting acquainted with a new horse no i said completely baffled he raised one arm displaying a soft tuft of cinnamoncolored hair you rub your oxter over the beasts nose a few times to give him your scent and get him accustomed to you so he wont be nervous of ye he raised himself on his elbows peering up over the slope of belly and breast thats what you should have done wi me sassenach you should ha rubbed my face between your legs first thing then i wouldnt have been skittish skittish he lowered his face and rubbed it deliberately back and forth snorting and blowing in imitation of a nuzzling horse i writhed and kicked him in the ribs with exactly as much effect as kicking a brick wall finally he pressed my thighs flat again and looked up now he said in a tone that brooked no opposition lie still i felt exposed invaded helpless and as though i were about to disintegrate jamies breath was alternately warm and cool on my skin please i said not knowing whether i meant please stop or please go on it didnt matter he didnt mean to stop consciousness fragmented into a number of small separate sensations the roughness of the linen pillow nubbled with embroidered flowers the oily reek of the lamp mingled with the fainter scent of roast beef and ale and the still fainter wisps of freshness from the wilting flowers in the glass the cool timber of the wall against my left foot the firm hands on my hips the sensations swirled and coalesced behind my closed eyelids into a glowing sun that swelled and shrank and finally exploded with a soundless pop that left me in a warm and pulsing darkness dimly from a long way away i heard jamie sit up well thats a bit better said a voice gasping between words takes a bit of effort to make you properly submissive doesnt it the bed creaked with a shifting of weight and i felt my knees being nudged further apart not as dead as you look i hope said the voice coming nearer i arched upward with an inarticulate sound as exquisitely sensitive tissues were firmly parted in a fresh assault jesus christ i said there was a faint chuckle near my ear i only said i felt like god sassenach he murmured i never said i was and later as the rising sun began to dim the glow of the lamp i roused from a drifting sleep to hear jamie murmur once more does it ever stop claire the wanting my head fell back onto his shoulder i dont know jamie i really dont chapter raiders in the rocks what did captain randall say i asked with dougal on one side and jamie on the other there was barely room for the three horses to ride abreast down the narrow road here and there one or both of my companions would have to drop back or spur up in order to avoid becoming entangled in the overgrowth that threatened to reclaim the crude track dougal glanced at me then back at the road in order to guide his horse around a large rock a wicked grin spread slowly across his features he wasna best pleased about it he said circumspectly though i am not sure i should tell ye what he actually said theres likely limits even to your tolerance for bad language mistress fraser i overlooked his sardonic use of my new title as well as the implied insult though i saw jamie stiffen in his saddle i er dont suppose he means to take any steps about it i asked despite jamies assurances i had visions of scarletcoated dragoons bursting out of the bushes slaughtering the scots and dragging me away to randalls lair for questioning i had an uneasy feeling that randalls ideas of interrogation might be creative to say the least shouldnt think so dougal answered casually hes more to worry about than one stray sassenach wench no matter how pretty he raised an eyebrow and halfbowed toward me as though the compliment were meant in apology hes also better sense than to rile colum by kidnapping his niece he said more matteroffactly niece i felt a small shiver run down my spine in spite of the warm weather niece to the mackenzie chieftain not to mention to the war chieftain of clan mackenzie riding so nonchalantly by my side and on the other side i was now presumably linked with lord lovat chief of clan fraser with the abbot of a powerful french abbey and with who knew how many other assorted frasers no perhaps john randall wouldnt think it worthwhile to pursue me and that after all had been the point of this ridiculous arrangement i stole a glance at jamie riding ahead now his back was straight as an alder sapling and his hair shone under the sun like a helmet of burnished metal dougal followed my glance could have been worse no he said with an ironic lift of his brow two nights later we were encamped on a stretch of moorland near one of those strange outcroppings of glacierpocked granite it had been a long days travel with only a hasty meal eaten in the saddle and everyone was pleased to stop for a cooked dinner i had tried early on to assist with the cooking but my help had been more or less politely rejected by the taciturn clansman whose job it apparently was one of the men had killed a deer that morning and a portion of the fresh meat cooked with turnips onions and whatever else he could find had made a delicious dinner bursting with food and contentment we all sprawled around the fire listening to stories and songs surprisingly enough little murtagh who seldom opened his mouth to speak had a beautiful clear tenor voice while it was difficult to persuade him to sing the results were worth it i nestled closer to jamie trying to find a comfortable spot to sit on the hard granite we had camped at the edge of the rocky outcrop where a broad shelf of reddish granite gave us a natural hearth and the towering jumble of rocks behind made a place to hide the horses when i asked why we did not sleep more comfortably on the springy grass of the moor ned gowan had informed me that we were now near the southern border of the mackenzie lands and thus near the territory of both grants and chisholms dougals scouts say theres no sign of anyone nearabouts he had said standing on a large boulder to peer into the sunset himself but ye can never tell better safe than sorry ye ken when murtagh called it quits rupert began to tell stories while he lacked gwyllyns elegant way with words he had an inexhaustible fund of stories about fairies ghosts the tannasg or evil spirits and other inhabitants of the highlands such as the waterhorses these beings i was given to understand inhabited almost all bodies of water being especially common at fords and crossings though many lived in the depths of the lochs theres a spot at the eastern end of loch garve ye ken he said rolling his eyes around the gathering to be sure everyone was listening that never freezes its always black water there even when the rest o the loch is frozen solid for thats the waterhorses chimney the waterhorse of loch garve like so many of his kind had stolen a young girl who came to the loch to draw water and carried her away to live in the depths of the loch and be his wife woe betide any maiden or any man for that matter who met a fine horse by the waters side and thought to ride upon him for a rider once mounted could not dismount and the horse would step into the water turn into a fish and swim to his home with the hapless rider still stuck fast to his back now a waterhorse beneath the waves has but fishs teeth said rupert wiggling his palm like an undulating fish and feeds on snails and waterweeds and cold wet things his blood runs cold as the water and hes no need of fire dye ken but a human womans a wee bit warmer than that here he winked at me and leered outrageously to the enjoyment of the listeners so the waterhorses wife was sad and cold and hungry in her new home beneath the waves not caring owermuch for snails and waterweed for her supper so the waterhorse being a kindly sort takes himself to the bank of the loch near the house of a man with the reputation of a builder and when the man came down to the river and saw the fine golden horse with his silver bridle shining in the sun he couldna resist seizing the bridle and mounting sure enough the waterhorse carries him straight into the water and down through the depths to his own cold fishy home and there he tells the builder if he would be free he must build a fine hearth and a chimney as well that the waterhorses wife might have a fire to warm her hands and fry her fish i had been resting my head on jamies shoulder feeling pleasantly drowsy and looking forward to bed even if that was only a blanket spread over granite suddenly i felt his body tense he put a hand on my neck warning me to keep still i looked around the campsite and could see nothing amiss but i caught the air of tension running from man to man as though transmitted by wireless looking in ruperts direction i saw him nod fractionally as he caught dougals eye though he went on with the story imperturbably so the builder havin little choice did as he was bid and so the waterhorse kept his word and returned the man to the bank near his home and the waterhorses wife was warm then and happy and full of the fish she fried for her supper and the water never freezes over the east end of loch garve because the heat from the waterhorses chimney melts the ice rupert was seated on a rock his right side toward me as he spoke he bent down as though casually to scratch his leg without the slightest hitch in his movements he grasped the knife that lay on the ground near his foot and transferred it smoothly to his lap where it lay hidden in the folds of his kilt i wriggled closer and pulled jamies head down as though overcome by amorousness what is it i whispered in his ear he seized my earlobe between his teeth and whispered back the horses are restless someones near one man got up and strolled to the edge of the rock to relieve himself when he returned he sat down in a new spot next to one of the drovers another man rose and peered into the cookpot helping himself to a morsel of venison all around the campsite there was a subtle shifting and moving while rupert kept on talking watching carefully with jamies arm tight around me i finally realized that the men were moving closer to wherever their weapons had been placed all of them slept with their dirks but generally left swords pistols and the round leather shields called targes in small neat heaps near the edge of the campsite jamies own pair of pistols lay on the ground with his sword just a few feet away i could see the firelight dancing on the damascened blade while his pistols were no more than the customary hornhandled dags worn by most of the men both broadsword and claymore were something special he had showed them to me with pride at one of our stops turning the gleaming blades over lovingly in his hands the claymore was wrapped inside his blanket roll i could see the enormous tshaped hilt the grip roughened for battle by careful sanding i had lifted it and nearly dropped it it weighed close to fifteen pounds jamie told me if the claymore was somber and lethallooking the broadsword was beautiful twothirds the weight of the larger weapon it was a deadly gleaming thing with islamic tracery snaking its way up the blue steel blade to the spiraled basket hilt enameled in reds and blues i had seen jamie use it in playful practice first righthanded with one of the menatarms later lefthanded with dougal he was a glory to watch under those conditions swift and sure with a grace made the more impressive by his size but my mouth grew dry at the thought of seeing that skill used in earnest he bent toward me planting a tender kiss under the edge of my jaw and taking the opportunity to turn me slightly so that i faced one of the jumbled piles of rocks soon i think he murmured kissing me industriously dye see the small opening in the rock i did a space less than three feet high formed by two large slabs fallen together he clasped my face and nuzzled me lovingly when i say go get into it and stay there have ye the dirk he had insisted i keep the dirk he had tossed to me that night at the inn despite my own insistence that i had neither the skill nor the inclination to use it and when it came to insisting dougal had been right jamie was stubborn consequently the dirk was in one of the deep pockets of my gown after a day of uncomfortable awareness of its weight against my thigh i had grown almost oblivious to it he ran a hand playfully down my leg checking to make certain of its presence he lifted his head then like a cat scenting the breeze looking up i could see him glance at murtagh then down at me the little man gave no outward sign but rose and stretched himself thoroughly when he sat down again he was several feet nearer to me a horse whickered nervously behind us as though it had been a signal they came screaming over the rocks not english as i had feared nor bandits highlanders shrieking like banshees grants i supposed or campbells on hands and knees i made for the rocks i banged my head and scraped my knees but managed to wedge myself into the small crevice heart hammering i fumbled for the dirk in my pocket almost jabbing myself in the process i had no idea what to do with the long wicked knife but felt slightly better for having it there was a moonstone set in the hilt and it was comforting to feel the small bulge against my palm at least i knew i had hold of the right end in the darkness the fighting was so confused that at first i had no idea what was going on the small clearing was filled with yelling bodies heaving to and fro rolling on the ground and running back and forth my sanctuary was luckily to one side of the main combat so i was in no danger for the moment glancing around i saw a small crouching figure close by pressed against my rock in the shadow i took a firmer grip on my dirk but realized almost at once that it was murtagh so that was the purpose of jamies glance murtagh had been told off to guard me i couldnt see jamie himself anywhere most of the fighting was taking place in the rocks and shadows near the wagons of course that must be the object of the raid the wagons and the horses the attackers were an organized band well armed and decently fed from the little i could see of them in the light of the dying fire if these were grants then perhaps they were seeking either booty or revenge for the cattle rupert and friends had pilfered a few days before confronted with the results of that impromptu raid dougal had been mildly annoyed not with the fact of the raid but only concerned that the cattle would slow our progress he had managed to dispose of them almost at once though at a small market in one of the villages it was soon clear that the attackers were not much concerned with inflicting harm on our party only with getting to the horses and wagons one or two succeeded i crouched low as a barebacked horse leaped the fire and disappeared into the darkness of the moor a caterwauling man clinging to its mane two or three more raced away on foot clutching bags of colums grain pursued by furious mackenzies shouting gaelic imprecations from the sound of it the raid was dying down then a large group of men staggered out into the firelight and the action picked up again this seemed to be serious fighting an impression borne out by the flashing of blades and the fact that the participants were grunting a good deal but not yelling at length i got it sorted out jamie and dougal were at the center of it fighting back to back each of them held his broadsword in the left hand dirk in the right and both of them were putting the arms to good use so far as i could see they were surrounded by four men or five i lost count in the shadows armed with short swords though one man had a broadsword hung on his belt and at least two more carried undrawn pistols it must be dougal or jamie or both that they wanted alive for preference for ransom i supposed thus the deliberate use of smallswords which might merely wound rather than the more lethal broadsword or pistols dougal and jamie suffered from no such scruples and were attending to business with considerable grim efficiency back to back they formed a complete circle of threat each man covering the others weaker side when dougal drove his dirk hand upward with considerable force i thought that weaker might not be precisely the term the whole roiling grunting cursing mess was staggering toward me i pressed myself back as far as i could but the crevice was barely two feet deep i caught a stir of movement from the corner of my eye murtagh had decided to take a more active part in affairs i could scarcely pull my horrified gaze away from jamie but saw the little clansman draw his pistol so far unfired in a leisurely manner he checked the firing mechanism carefully rubbed the weapon on his sleeve braced it on his forearm and waited and waited i was shivering with fear for jamie who had given up finesse and was slashing savagely from side to side beating back the two men who now faced him with sheer bloodymindedness why in hell didnt the man fire i thought furiously and then i realized why not both jamie and dougal were in the line of fire i seemed to recall that flintlock pistols sometimes lacked a bit in the way of accuracy this supposition was borne out in the next minute as an unexpected lunge by one of dougals opponents caught him at the wrist the blade ripped up the length of his forearm and he sank to one knee feeling his uncle fall jamie pulled back his own blade and took two quick steps backward this put his back near a rock face dougal crouched to one side within reach of the protection of his single blade it also brought the attackers sideon to my hidingplace and murtaghs pistol close at hand the report of the pistol was startlingly loud it took the attackers by surprise particularly the one who was hit the man stood still for a moment shook his head in a confused way then very slowly sat down fell limply backward and rolled down a slight decline into the dying embers of the fire taking advantage of the surprise jamie knocked the sword from the hand of one attacker dougal was on his feet again and jamie moved to the side to give him room for swordplay one of the fighters had abandoned the fray and run down the hill to drag his wounded companion out of the hot ashes still that left three of the raiders and dougal wounded i could see dark drops splashing against the rock face as he wielded the sword they were close enough now that i could see jamies face calm and intent absorbed with the exultancy of battle suddenly dougal shouted something to him jamie tore his eyes from his opponents face for a split second and glanced down glancing back just in time to avoid being skewered he ducked to one side and threw his sword his opponent gazed in considerable surprise at the sword sticking in his leg he touched the blade in some bemusement then grasped it and pulled from the ease with which it came out i assumed the wound was not deep the man still seemed slightly bewildered and glanced up as though to ask the purpose of this unorthodox behavior he uttered a scream dropped the sword and ran limping heavily startled by the noise the other two attackers looked over turned and likewise fled pursued by jamie moving like an avalanche he had succeeded in yanking the huge claymore out of the blanket roll and was swinging it in a murderous two handed arc backing him up came murtagh shouting something highly uncomplimentary in gaelic and brandishing both sword and reloaded pistol things mopped up quite quickly after that and it was only a quarter of an hour or so before the mackenzie party had reassembled and assessed its damages these had been slight two horses had been taken and three bags of grain but the drovers who slept with their loads had prevented further depredations on the wagons while the menatarms had succeeded in driving off the wouldbe horse thieves the major loss seemed to be one of the men i thought when he was missed at first that he must have been wounded or killed in the scrimmage but a thorough search of the area failed to turn him up kidnapped said dougal grimly blast hell cost me a months income in ransom could ha been worse dougal said jamie mopping his face on his sleeve think what colum would say if theyd taken you if theyd taken you lad id ha let them keep ye and ye could change your name to grant dougal retorted but the mood of the party lightened substantially i unearthed the small box of medical supplies i had packed and lined up the injured in order of severity nothing really bad i was pleased to see the wound on dougals arm was likely the worst ned gowan was brighteyed and fizzing with vitality apparently so intoxicated with the thrill of the fight as hardly to notice the tooth that had been knocked out by an illaimed dagger hilt he had however retained sufficient presence of mind to keep it carefully held under his tongue just on the offchance dye see he explained spitting it into the palm of his hand the root was not broken and the socket still bled slightly so i took the chance and pressed the tooth firmly back into place the little man went quite white but didnt utter a sound he gratefully swished his mouth with whisky for disinfectant purposes though and thriftily swallowed it i had bound dougals wound at once with a pressure bandage and was glad to see that the bleeding had all but stopped by the time i unwrapped it it was a clean slash but a deep one a tiny rim of yellow fat showed at the edge of the gaping cut which went at least an inch deep into the muscle no major vessels severed thank goodness but it would have to be stitched the only needle available turned out to be a sturdy thing like a slender awl used by the drovers to mend harness i eyed it dubiously but dougal merely held out his arm and looked away i dinna mind blood in general he explained but ive some objection to seein my own he sat on a rock as i worked teeth clenched hard enough to make his jaw muscles quiver the night was turning cold but sweat stood out on the high forehead in beads at one point he asked me politely to stop for a moment turned aside and was neatly sick behind a rock then turned back and braced his arm on his knee again by good luck one tavern owner had chosen to remit his rent this quarter in the form of a small keg of whisky and it came in quite handily i used it to disinfect some of the open wounds and then let my patients selfmedicate as they liked i even accepted a cupful myself at the conclusion of the doctoring i drained it with pleasure and sank thankfully onto my blanket the moon was sinking and i was shivering half with reaction and half with cold it was a wonderful feeling to have jamie lie down and firmly gather me in next to his large warm body will they come back do you think i asked but he shook his head nay it was malcolm grant and his two boys it was the oldest i stuck in the leg theyll be home in their own beds by now he replied he stroked my hair and said in softer tones ye did a braw bit o work tonight lass i was proud of ye i rolled over and put my arms about his neck not as proud as i was you were wonderful jamie ive never seen anything like that he snorted deprecatingly but i thought he was pleased nonetheless only a raid sassenach ive been doin that since i was fourteen its only in fun ye see its different when youre up against someone who really means to kill ye fun i said a little faintly yes quite his arms tightened around me and one of the stroking hands dipped lower beginning to inch my skirt upward clearly the thrill of the fight was being transmuted into a different kind of excitement jamie not here i said squirming away and pushing my skirt down again are ye tired sassenach he asked with concern dinna worry i wont take long now both hands were at it rucking the heavy fabric up in front no i replied all too mindful of the twenty men lying a few feet away im not tired its just i gasped as his groping hand found its way between my legs lord he said softly its slippery as waterweed jamie there are twenty men sleeping right next to us i shouted in a whisper they wilna be sleeping long if you keep talking he rolled on top of me pinning me to the rock his knee wedged between my thighs and began to work gently back and forth despite myself my legs were beginning to loosen twentyseven years of propriety were no match for several hundred thousand years of instinct while my mind might object to being taken on a bare rock next to several sleeping soldiers my body plainly considered itself the spoils of war and was eager to complete the formalities of surrender he kissed me long and deep his tongue sweet and restless in my mouth jamie i panted he pushed his kilt out of the way and pressed my hand against him bloody christ i said impressed despite myself my sense of propriety slipped another notch fighting gives ye a terrible cockstand after ye want me do ye no he said pulling back a little to look at me it seemed pointless to deny it what with all the evidence to hand he was hard as a brass rod against my bared thigh er yes but he took a firm grip on my shoulders with both hands be quiet sassenach he said with authority it isna going to take verra long it didnt i began to climax with the first powerful thrust in long racking spasms i dug my fingers hard into his back and held on biting the fabric of his shirt to muffle any sounds in less than a dozen strokes i felt his testicles contract tight against his body and the warm flood of his own release he lowered himself slowly to the side and lay trembling the blood was still beating heavily in my ears echoing the fading pulse between my legs jamies hand lay on my breast limp and heavy turning my head i could see the dim figure of the sentry leaning against a rock on the far side of the fire he had his back tactfully turned i was mildly shocked to realize that i was not even embarrassed i wondered rather dimly whether i would be in the morning and then wondered no more in the morning everyone behaved as usual if moving a little more stiffly from the effects of fighting and sleeping on rocks everyone was in a cheerful humor even those with minor wounds the general humor was improved still further when dougal announced that we would travel only as far as the clump of woods we could see from the edge of our rocky platform there we could water and graze the horses and rest a bit ourselves i wondered whether this change of plan would affect jamies rendezvous with the mysterious horrocks but he seemed undisturbed at the announcement the day was overcast but not drizzling and the air was warm once the new camp was made the horses taken care of and the wounded all rechecked everyone was left to his own devices to sleep in the grass to hunt or fish or merely to stretch legs after several days in the saddle i was sitting under a tree talking to jamie and ned gowan when one of the menatarms came up and flipped something into jamies lap it was the dirk with the moonstone hilt yours lad he asked found it in the rocks this morning i must have dropped it in all the excitement i said just as well ive no idea what to do with it id likely have stabbed myself if id tried to use it ned eyed jamie censoriously over his halfspectacles ye gave her a knife and didnt teach her to use it there wasna time under the circumstances jamie defended himself but neds right sassenach ye should learn how to handle arms theres no tellin what may happen on the road as ye saw last night so i was marched out into the center of a clearing and the lessons began seeing the activity several of the mackenzie men came by to investigate and stayed to offer advice in no time i had half a dozen instructors all arguing the fine points of technique after a good deal of amiable discussion they agreed that rupert was likely the best among them at dirks and he took over the lesson he found a reasonably flat spot free of rocks and pine cones in which to demonstrate the art of daggerwielding look lass he said he held the dagger balanced on his middle finger resting an inch or so below the haft the balance point thats where ye want to hold it so it fits comfortable in yer hand i tried it with my dagger when i had it comfortably fitted he showed me the difference between an overhand strike and an underhanded stab generally ye want to use the underhand overhand is only good when yere comin down on someone wi a considerable force from above he eyed me speculatively then shook his head nay youre tall for a woman but even if ye could reach as high as the neck ye wouldna have the force to penetrate unless hes sittin best stick to underhand he pulled up his shirt revealing a substantial furry paunch already glistening with sweat now here he said pointing to the center just under the breastbone is the spot to aim for if yere killin face to face aim straight up and in as hard as ye can thatll go into the heart and it kills wiin a minute or two the only problem is to avoid the breastbone it goes down lower than ye think and if ye get yer knife stuck in that soft bit on the tip it will hardly harm yer victim at all but yell be wiout a knife and hell ha you murtagh ye ha a skinny back come ere and well show the lass how to stick from the back spinning a reluctant murtagh around he yanked up the grubby shirt to show a knobbly spine and prominent ribs he poked a blunt forefinger under the lower rib on the right making murtagh squeak in surprise this is the spot in back either side see wi all the ribs and such tis verra difficult to hit anythin vital when ye stab in the back if ye can slip the knife between the ribs thats one thing but thats harder to do than ye might think but here under the last rib ye stab upward into the kidney get him straight up and hell drop like a stone rupert then set me to try stabbing in various positions and postures as he grew winded all the men took it in turns to act as victim obviously finding my efforts hilarious they obligingly lay on the grass or turned their backs so i could ambush them or leaped at me from behind or pretended to choke me so i could try to stab them in the belly the spectators urged me on with cries of encouragement and rupert instructed me firmly not to pull back at the last moment thrust as though ye meant it lass he said ye canna pull back if its in earnest and if any o these laggards canna get themselves out of the way in time they deserve what they get i was timid and extremely clumsy at first but rupert was a good teacher very patient and good about demonstrating moves over and over he rolled his eyes in mock lewdness when he moved behind me and put his arm about my waist but he was quite businesslike about taking hold of my wrist to show me the way of ripping an enemy across the eyes dougal sat under a tree minding his wounded arm and making sardonic comments on the training as it progressed it was he though who suggested the dummy give her something she can sink her dirk into he said when i had begun to show some facility at lunging and jabbing its a shock the first time so it is jamie agreed rest a bit sassenach while i manage something he went off to the wagons with two of the menatarms and i could see them standing heads together gesticulating and pulling bits of things from the wagon bed thoroughly winded i collapsed under the tree next to dougal he nodded a slight smile on his face like most of the men he had not bothered to shave while traveling and a heavy growth of dark brown beard framed his mouth accentuating the full lower lip how is it then he asked not meaning my skill with small arms well enough i answered warily not meaning knives either dougals gaze flicked toward jamie busy with something by the wagons marriage seems to suit the lad he observed rather healthy for him under the circumstances i agreed somewhat coldly his lips curved at my tone and you lass as well a good arrangement for everyone it seems particularly for you and your brother and speaking of him just what do you think colums going to say when he hears about it the smile widened colum ah well i should think hed be only too pleased to welcome such a niece to the family the dummy was ready and i went back into training it proved to be a large bag of wool about the size of a mans torso with a piece of tanned bulls hide wrapped around it secured with rope this i was to practice stabbing first as it was tied to a tree at manheight later as it was thrown or rolled past me what jamie hadnt mentioned was that they had inserted several flat pieces of wood between the wool sack and the hide to simulate bones as he later explained the first few stabs were uneventful though it took several tries to get through the bullhide it was tougher than it looked so is the skin on a mans belly i was informed on the next try i tried a direct overhand strike and hit one of the wood pieces i thought for a moment that my arm had suddenly fallen off the shock of impact reverberated all the way to my shoulder and the dirk dropped from my nerveless fingers everything below the elbow was numb but an ominous tingling warned me that it wouldnt be for long jesus h roosevelt christ i said i stood gripping my elbow and listening to the general hilarity finally jamie took me by the shoulder and massaged some feeling back into the arm pressing the tendon at the back of the elbow and digging his thumb into the hollow at the base of my wrist all right i said through my teeth gingerly flexing my tingling right hand what do you do when you hit a bone and lose your knife is there a standard operating procedure for that oh aye said rupert grinning draw your pistol wi the left hand and shoot the bastard dead this resulted in more howls of laughter which i ignored all right i said more or less calmly i gestured at the long clawhandled pistol jamie wore on his left hip are you going to show me how to load and shoot that then i am not he was firm i bristled a bit at this why not because youre a woman sassenach i felt my face flush at this oh i said sarcastically you think women arent bright enough to understand the workings of a gun he looked levelly at me mouth twisting a bit as he thought over various replies ive a mind to let ye try it he said at last it would serve ye right rupert clicked his tongue in annoyance at us both dinna be daft jamie as for you lass turning to me its not that women are stupid though sure enough some o em are its that theyre small eh i gaped stupidly at him for a moment jamie snorted and drew the pistol from its loop seen up close it was enormous a full eighteen inches of silvered weapon measured from stock to muzzle look he said holding it in front of me ye hold it here ye brace it on your forearm and ye sight along here and when ye pull the trigger it kicks like a mule im near a foot taller than you four stone heavier and i know what im doin it gives me a wicked bruise when i fire it it might knock you flat on your back if it didna catch ye in the face he twirled the pistol and slid it back into its loop id let ye see for yourself he said raising one eyebrow but i like ye better wi all of your teeth youve a nice smile sassenach even if ye are a bit feisty slightly chastened by this episode i accepted without argument the mens judgment that even the lighter smallsword was too heavy for me to wield efficiently the tiny sgian dhu the sock dagger was deemed acceptable and i was provided with one of those a wickedlooking needlesharp piece of black iron about three inches long with a short hilt i practiced drawing it from its place of concealment over and over while the men watched critically until i could sweep up my skirt grab the knife from its place and come up in the proper crouch all in one smooth move ending up with the knife held underhand ready to slash across an adversarys throat finally i was passed as a novice knifewielder and allowed to sit down to dinner amid general congratulations with one exception murtagh shook his head dubiously i still say the only good weapon for a woman is poison perhaps replied dougal but it has its deficiencies in facetoface combat chapter the waterhorse we camped the next night on the banks above loch ness it gave me an odd feeling to see the place again so little had changed or would change i should say the larches and alders were a deeper green because it was now midsummer not late spring the flowers had changed from the fragile pinks and whites of may blossom and violets to the warmer golds and yellows of gorse and broom the sky above was a deeper blue but the surface of the loch was the same a flat blueblack that caught the reflections from the bank above and held them trapped colors muted under smoked glass there were even a few sailboats visible far up the loch though when one drew near i saw it was a coracle a rough halfshell of tanned leather on a frame not the sleek wooden shape i was used to the same pungent scent that pervades all watercourses was there a sharp mix of tangy greenness and rotted leaf fresh water dead fish and warm mud above all there was that same feeling of lurking strangeness about the place the men as well as the horses seemed to feel it and the air of the camp was subdued having found a comfortable place for my own bedroll and jamies i wandered down to the edge of the loch to wash my face and hands before supper the bank sloped sharply down until it broke in a jumble of large rock slabs that formed a sort of irregular jetty it was very peaceful under the bank out of sight and sound of the camp and i sat down beneath a tree to enjoy a moments privacy since my hasty marriage to jamie i was no longer followed every moment that much had been accomplished i was idly plucking the clusters of winged seeds from a lowhanging branch and tossing them out into the loch when i noticed the tiny waves against the rocks growing stronger as though pushed by an oncoming wind a great flat head broke the surface not ten feet away i could see the water purling away from keeled scales that ran in a crest down the sinuous neck the water was agitated for some considerable distance and i caught a glimpse here and there of dark and massive movement beneath the surface of the loch though the head itself stayed relatively still i stood quite still myself oddly enough i was not really afraid i felt some faint kinship with it a creature further from its own time than i the flat eyes old as its ancient eocene seas eyes grown dim in the murky depths of its shrunken refuge and there was a sense of familiarity mingled with its unreality the sleek skin was a smooth deep blue with a vivid slash of green shining with brilliant iridescence beneath the jaw and the strange pupilless eyes were a deep and glowing amber so very beautiful and so very different from the smaller mudcolored replica i remembered adorning the fifthfloor diorama in the british museum but the shape was unmistakable the colors of living things begin to fade with the last breath and the soft springy skin and supple muscle rot within weeks but the bones sometimes remain faithful echoes of the shape to bear some last faint witness to the glory of what was valved nostrils opened suddenly with a startling hiss of breath a moment of suspended motion and the creature sank again a churning roil of waters the only testimony to its passage i had risen to my feet when it appeared and unconsciously i must have moved closer in order to watch it for i found myself standing on one of the rock slabs that jutted out into the water watching the dying waves fall back into the smoothness of the loch i stood there for a moment looking out across the fathomless loch goodbye i said at last to the empty water i shook myself and turned back to the bank a man was standing at the top of the slope i was startled at first then recognized him as one of the drovers from our party his name was peter i recalled and the bucket in his hand gave the reason for his presence i was about to ask him whether he had seen the beast but the expression on his face as i drew near was more than sufficient answer his face was paler than the daisies at his feet and tiny droplets of sweat trickled down into his beard his eyes showed white all around like those of a terrified horse and his hand shook so that the bucket bumped against his leg its all right i said as i came up to him its gone instead of finding this statement reassuring it seemed occasion for fresh alarm he dropped the bucket fell to his knees before me and crossed himself hahave mercy lady he stammered to my extreme embarrassment he then flung himself flat on his face and clutched at the hem of my dress dont be ridiculous i said with some asperity get up i prodded him gently with my toe but he only quivered and stayed pressed to the ground like a flattened fungus get up i repeated stupid man its only a i paused trying to think telling him its latin name was unlikely to help its only a wee monster i said at last and grabbing his hand tugged him to his feet i had to fill the bucket as he would not unreasonably not go near the waters edge again he followed me back to the camp keeping a careful distance and scuttled off at once to tend to his mules casting apprehensive glances over his shoulder at me as he went as he seemed undisposed to mention the creature to anyone else i thought perhaps i should keep quiet as well while dougal jamie and ned were educated men the rest were largely illiterate highlanders from the remote crags and glens of the mackenzie lands they were courageous fighters and dauntless warriors but they were also as superstitious as any primitive tribesmen from africa or the middle east so i ate my supper quietly and went to bed conscious all the time of the wary gaze of the drover peter chapter deserted glades two days after the raid we turned again to the north we were drawing closer to the rendezvous with horrocks and jamie seemed abstracted from time to time perhaps considering what importance the english deserters news might have i had not seen hugh munro again but i had wakened in darkness the night before to find jamie gone from the blanket beside me i tried to stay awake waiting for him to return but fell asleep as the moon began to sink in the morning he was sound asleep beside me and on my blanket rested a small parcel done up in a sheet of thin paper fastened with the tailfeather of a woodpecker thrust through the sheet unfolding it carefully i found a large chunk of rough amber one face of the chunk had been smoothed off and polished and in this window could be seen the delicate dark form of a tiny dragonfly suspended in eternal flight i smoothed out the wrapping a message was incised on the grimy white surface written in small and surprisingly elegant lettering what does it say i asked jamie squinting at the odd letters and marks i think its in gaelic he raised up on one elbow squinting at the paper not gaelic latin munro was a schoolmaster once before the turks took him its a bit from catullus he said da mi basia mille diende centum dein mille altera dein secunda centum a faint blush pinkened his earlobes as he translated then let amorous kisses dwell on our lips begin and tell a thousand and a hundred score a hundred and a thousand more well thats a bit more highclass than your usual fortune cookie i observed amused what jamie looked startled never mind i said hastily did munro find horrocks for you oh aye its arranged ill meet him in a small place i know in the hills a mile or two above lag cruime in four days time if nothing goes wrong meanwhile the mention of things going wrong made me a bit nervous do you think its safe i mean do you trust horrocks he sat up rubbing the remnants of sleep from his eyes and blinking an english deserter god no i imagine hed sell me to randall as soon as hed spit except that he canna very well go to the english himself they hang deserters no i dinna trust him thats why i came wi dougal on this journey instead of seeking out horrocks alone if the mans up to anything at least ill have company oh i wasnt sure that dougals presence was all that reassuring given the apparent state of affairs between jamie and his two scheming uncles well if you think so i said doubtfully i dont suppose dougal would take the opportunity to shoot you at least he did shoot me jamie said cheerfully buttoning his shirt you should know ye dressed the wound i dropped the comb i had been using dougal i thought the english shot you well the english shot at me he corrected and i shouldna say it was dougal shot me in fact it was probably rupert hes the best marksman among dougals men no when we were running from the english i realized we were near the edge of the fraser lands and i thought id take my chances there so i spurred up and cut to the left around dougal and the rest there was a good deal of shooting goin on mind ye but the ball that hit me came from behind dougal rupert and murtagh were back of me then and the english were all in front in fact when i fell off the horse i rolled down the hill and ended almost in their laps he bent over the bucket of water i had brought splashing cold handfuls over his face he shook his head to clear his eyes then blinked at me grinning glistening drops clinging to his thick lashes and brows come to that dougal had a sore fight to get me back i was lyin on the ground not fit for much and he was standing over me pulling on my belt with one hand to get me up and his sword in the other going handtohand with a dragoon who thought he had a certain cure for my ills dougal killed the man and got me on his own horse he shook his head everything was a bit dim to me then all i could think of was how hard it must be on the horse tryin to make it up a hill like that with four hundred pounds on his back i sat back a little stunned but if hed wanted to dougal could have killed you then jamie shook his head taking out the straight razor he had borrowed from dougal he moved the bucket slightly so the surface formed a reflecting pool and pulling his face into the tortuous grimace men use when they shave began to scrape his cheeks no not in front of the men besides dougal and colum didna necessarily want me dead especially not dougal but my head was beginning to whirl again as it seemed to do whenever i encountered the complexities of scottish family life jamies words were a little muffled as he stuck out his chin tilting his head to reach the bit of stubble beneath his jaw its lallybroch he explained feeling with his free hand for stray whiskers besides being a rich bit of ground the estate sits at the head of a mountain pass dye see the only good pass into the highlands for ten miles in either direction come to another rising it would be a valuable bit of land to control and if i were to die before wedding chances are the land would go back to the frasers he grinned stroking his neck no im a pretty problem to the brothers mackenzie on the one hand if im a threat to young hamishs chieftainship they want me safely dead on the other if im not they want me and my property securely on their side if it comes to war not wi the frasers thats why theyre willing to help me wi horrocks ye see i canna do that much wi lallybroch while im outlawed even though the lands still mine i rolled up the blankets shaking my head in bewilderment over the intricate and dangerous circumstances through which jamie seemed to move so nonchalantly and it struck me suddenly that not only jamie was involved now i looked up you said that if you died before wedding the land would go back to the frasers i said but youre married now so who thats right he said nodding at me with a lopsided grin the morning sun lit his hair with flames of gold and copper if im killed now sassenach lallybroch is yours it was a beautiful sunny morning once the mist had risen birds were busy in the heather and the road was wide here for a change and softly dusty under the horses hooves jamie rode up close beside me as we crested a small hill he nodded to the right see that wee glade down below there yes it was a small green patchwork of pines oaks and aspens set back some distance from the road theres a spring with a pool there under the trees and smooth grass a very bonny place i looked over at him quizzically a little early for lunch isnt it thats not precisely what i had in mind jamie i had found out by accident a few days previously had never mastered the art of winking one eye instead he blinked solemnly like a large red owl and just what did you have in mind i inquired my suspicious look met an innocent childlike gaze of blue i was just wondering what youd look like on the grass under the trees by the water with your skirts up around your ears er i said ill tell dougal were going to fetch water he spurred up ahead returning in a moment with the water bottles from the other horses i heard rupert shout something after us in gaelic as we rode down the hill but couldnt make out the words i reached the glade first sliding down i relaxed on the grass and shut my eyes against the glare of the sun jamie reined up beside me a moment later and swung down from the saddle he slapped the horse and sent it away reins dangling to graze with mine before dropping to his knees on the grass i reached up and pulled him down to me it was a warm day redolent with grass and flower scents jamie himself smelled like a freshplucked grass blade sharp and sweet well have to be quick i said theyll be wondering why its taking so long to get water they wont wonder he said undoing my laces with a practiced ease they know what do you mean did ye no hear what rupert said as we left i heard him but i couldnt tell what he said my gaelic was improving to the point that i could understand the more common words but conversation was still far beyond me good it wasna fit for your ears having freed my breasts he buried his face in them sucking and biting gently until i could stand it no more and slid down beneath him tucking my skirts up out of the way feeling absurdly selfconscious after that fierce and primitive encounter on the rock i had been shy about letting him make love to me near the camp and the woods were too thick to safely move very far from the campsite both of us were feeling the mild and pleasant strain of abstinence and now safely removed from curious eyes and ears we came together with an impact that made my lips and fingers tingle with a rush of blood we were both nearing the end when jamie froze abruptly opening my eyes i saw his face dark against the sun wearing a perfectly indescribable expression there was something black pressed against his head my eyes at last adjusting to the glare i saw it was a musket barrel get up you rutting bastard the barrel moved sharply jarring against jamies temple very slowly he rose to his feet a drop of blood began to well from the graze dark against his white face there were two of them redcoat deserters from the look of their ragtag remnants of uniform both were armed with muskets and pistols and looked very much amused by what chance had delivered into their hands jamie stood with his hands raised the barrel of a musket pressed against his chest face carefully expressionless you might ha let im finish arry said one of the men he grinned broadly with a fine display of rotting teeth stoppin in the middle like thats bad for a mans ealth his fellow prodded jamie in the chest with the musket is ealths no concern o mine an it wont be any concern to im for much longer ive a mind to take a piece o that he nodded briefly in my direction an i dont care to come second to any man let alone a scottish whoreson like this rottenteeth laughed i baint so bloody particular kill im then and get on wi it harry a short stout man with a squint considered a moment eyeing me speculatively i still sat on the ground knees drawn up and skirts pressed firmly around my ankles i had made some effort to close my bodice but a good deal was still exposed finally the short man laughed and beckoned to his companion no let im watch come ower ere arnold and old your musket on im arnold obeyed still grinning widely harry set his musket down on the ground and dropped his pistol belt beside it in preparation pressing my skirts down i became aware of a hard object in the righthand pocket the dagger jamie had given me could i bring myself to use it yes i decided looking at harrys pimpled leering face i definitely could i would have to wait til the last possible second though and i had my doubts as to whether jamie could control himself that long i could see the urge to kill marked strong on his features soon consideration of the consequences would no longer be enough to hold him back i didnt dare let too much show on my face but narrowed my eyes and glared at him as hard as i could willing him not to move the cords stood out in his neck and his face was suffused with dark blood but i saw an infinitesimal nod in acknowledgment of my message i struggled as harry pressed me to the ground and tried to pull up my skirts more in order to get my hand on the dagger hilt than in actual resistance he slapped me hard across the face ordering me to be still my cheek burned and my eyes watered but the dagger was now in my hand concealed under the folds of my skirt i lay back breathing heavily i concentrated on my objective trying to erase everything else from my mind it would have to be in the back the quarters were too close to try for the throat the filthy fingers were digging into my thighs now wrenching them apart in my mind i could see ruperts blunt finger stabbing at murtaghs ribs and hear his voice here lass up under the lowest ribs close to the backbone stab hard upward into the kidney and hell drop like a stone it was almost time harrys foul breath was disgustingly warm on my face and he was fumbling between my bared legs intent on his goal take a good look laddiebuck and see how its done he panted ill ave your slut moaning for more before i whipped my left arm around his neck to hold him close holding the knife hand high i plunged it in as hard as i could the shock of impact reverberated up my arm and i nearly lost my hold on the dagger harry yelped and squirmed twisting to get away unable to see i had aimed too high and the knife had skittered off a rib i couldnt let go now luckily my legs were free of the entangling skirts i wrapped them tightly around harrys sweating hips holding him down for the precious seconds i needed for another try i stabbed again with a desperate strength and this time found the spot rupert had been right harry bucked in a hideous parody of the act of love then collapsed without a sound in a limp heap on top of me blood jetting in diminishing spurts from the wound in his back arnolds attention had been distracted for an instant by the spectacle on the ground and an instant was more than long enough for the maddened scotsman he held at bay by the time i had gathered my wits sufficiently to wriggle out from under the defunct harry arnold had joined his companion in death throat neatly cut from ear to ear by the sgian dhu that jamie carried in his stocking jamie knelt beside me pulling me out from under the corpse we were both shaking with nerves and shock and we clung together without speaking for minutes still without speaking he picked me up and carried me away from the two bodies to a grassy space behind a screen of aspen he lowered me to the ground and sat down awkwardly beside me collapsing as though his knees had suddenly given way i felt a chilly isolation as though the winter wind blew through my bones and reached for him he raised his head from his knees face haggard and stared at me as though he had never seen me before when i put my hands on his shoulders he pulled me hard against his chest with a sound midway between a groan and a sob we took each other then in a savage urgent silence thrusting fiercely and finishing within moments driven by a compulsion i didnt understand but knew we must obey or be lost to each other forever it was not an act of love but one of necessity as though we knew that left alone neither of us could stand our only strength lay in fusion drowning the memories of death and nearrape in the flooding of the senses we clung together on the grass then disheveled bloodstained and shivering in the sunshine jamie muttered something his voice so low that i caught only the word sorry not your fault i muttered stroking his hair its all right were both all right i felt dreamlike as though nothing whatever was real around me and i dimly recognized the symptoms of delayed shock not that he said not that it was my fault so foolish to come here without taking proper heed and to let you be i didna mean that though i meant im sorry for using ye as i did just now to take you like that so soon after like some sort of animal im sorry claire i dont know what i couldna help it but lord youre so cold mo duinne your hands are ice come then let me warm ye shock too i thought fuzzily funny how it takes some people in talk others just shake quietly like me i pressed his mouth against my shoulder to quiet him its all right i said over and over its all right suddenly a shadow fell across us making us both jump dougal stood glowering down at us arms folded he courteously averted his eyes while i hastily did up my laces frowning instead at jamie now look ye lad takin your pleasure wi your wife is all verra weel but when it comes to leavin us all waiting for more than an hour and being so taen up wi each other that ye dinna even hear me comin that kind o behavior will get ye in trouble one day laddie why someone could come up behind ye and clap a pistol to your head before ye knew he stopped in his tirade to stare incredulously at me rolling on the grass in hysterics jamie red as a beetroot led dougal to the other side of the aspen screen explaining in a subdued voice i continued to whoop and giggle uncontrollably finally stuffing a handkerchief in my mouth to muffle the noise the sudden release of emotions coupled with dougals words had evoked a picture of jamies face caught in the act as it were that i found totally hilarious in my unhinged state i laughed and moaned until my sides ached finally i sat up wiping my eyes on my kerchief to see dougal and jamie standing over me wearing identical expressions of disapproval jamie hoisted me to my feet and led me still hiccuping and snorting occasionally to where the rest of the men were waiting with the horses except for a lingering tendency to laugh hysterically over nothing i seemed to suffer no ill effects from our encounter with the deserters though i became very cautious about leaving the campsite dougal assured me that bandits were not in fact that common on the highland roads only because there were not many travelers worth robbing but i found myself starting nervously at sounds in the wood and hastening back from routine chores like fetching wood and water eager for the sight and sound of the mackenzie men i also found new reassurance in the sound of their snoring around me at night and lost whatever selfconsciousness i might have had about the discreet writhings that took place under our blankets i was still somewhat fearful of being alone when a few days later the time for the meeting with horrocks arrived stay here i said in disbelief no im going with you you cant said jamie patiently once more the bulk of the men will go on to lag cruime wi ned to collect the rents as expected dougal and a few of the others are coming wi me to the meeting in case of any treachery by horrocks you cant be seen in the open near lag cruime though randalls men may be about and i wouldna put it past him to take ye by force and as for the meeting wi horrocks ive no idea what may happen no theres a small copse near the bend of the road its thick and grassy and theres water nearby youll be comfortable there until i come back for ye no i said stubbornly im coming with you some sense of pride made me unwilling to tell him that i was frightened of being away from him but i was willing to tell him that i was frightened for him you said yourself you dont know what will happen with horrocks i argued i dont want to wait here wondering all day whats happening to you let me come with you i coaxed i promise ill stay out of sight during the meeting but i dont want to stay here alone worrying all day he sighed impatiently but didnt argue further when we reached the copse though he leaned over and seized my horses bridle forcing me off the road into the grass he slid off his horse tying both sets of reins to a bush ignoring my vociferous objections he disappeared into the trees stubbornly i refused to dismount he couldnt make me stay i thought he came down at last to the road the others had gone on before but jamie mindful of our last experience with deserted glades wouldnt leave until he had thoroughly searched the copse quartering methodically through the trees and swishing the tall grass with a stick coming back he untied the horses and swung up into his saddle its safe he said ride up well into the thicket claire and hide yourself and the horse ill be back for ye as soon as our business is done i canna tell how long but surely by sunset no im coming with you i couldnt stand the thought of stewing in a forest not knowing what was happening i would far rather be in active danger than be left for anxious hours waiting and wondering and alone jamie curbed his impatience to be gone he reached over and grasped my shoulder did ye no promise to obey me he asked shaking me gently yes but but only because i had to i was going to say but he was already urging my horses head around toward the thicket its verra dangerous and ill not have ye there claire i shall be busy and if it comes to it i cant fight and protect you at the same time seeing my mutinous look he dropped his hand to the saddlebag and began rummaging what are you looking for rope if ye wilna do as i say i shall tie ye to a tree until i come back you wouldnt aye i would plainly he meant it i gave in with bad grace and reluctantly reined in my horse jamie leaned to kiss me glancingly on the cheek already turning to go take care sassenach youve your dirk good i shall come back as soon as i can oh one more thing whats that i said sullenly if you leave that copse before i come for ye ill tan your bare arse wi my sword belt ye wouldna enjoy walking all the way to bargrennan remember he said pinching my cheek gently i dinna make idle threats he didnt either i rode slowly toward the grove looking back to watch him racing away bent low over the saddle one with the horse the ends of his plaid flying behind it was cool under the trees the horse and i both exhaled with relief as we entered the shade it was one of those rare hot days in scotland when the sun blazes out of a bleached muslin sky and the early haze is burnt away by eight oclock the copse was loud with birds a gang of titmice was foraging in the oak clump to the left and i could hear what i thought was a thrasher in the near distance i had always been an enthusiastic amateur birder if i were marooned here til it suited my overbearing domineering pigheaded jackass of a husband to finish risking his stupid neck id use the time to see what i could spot i hobbled the gelding and turned him loose to graze in the lush grass at the edge of the copse knowing he wouldnt go far the grass ceased abruptly a few feet from the trees smothered by the encroaching heather it was a glade of mixed conifers and oak saplings perfect for birdwatching i wandered through it still mentally fuming at jamie but growing gradually calmer as i listened for the distinctive tsee of a flycatcher and the harsh chatter of the mistle thrush the glade ended quite suddenly on the far side on the edge of a small precipice i thrust my way through the saplings and the sound of bird song was drowned in rushing water i stood on the lip of a small burn a steep rocky canyon with waterfalls bounding down the jagged walls to splash in the brown and silver pools below i sat down on the edge of the bank and let my feet dangle over the water enjoying the sun on my face a crow shot past overhead closely pursued by a pair of redstarts the bulky black body zigzagged through the air trying to avoid the tiny divebombers i smiled watching the furious small parents chivying the crow to and fro and wondered whether crows left to their own devices really did fly in a straight line that one if it kept to a straight path would head straight for i stopped dead i had been so intent on arguing with jamie that it had not until this minute dawned on me that the situation i had been vainly trying to bring about for two months had finally occurred i was alone and i knew where i was looking across the burn my eyes were dazzled by the morning sun blazing through the red ash trees on the far bank so that was east my heart began to beat faster east was over there lag cruime was directly behind me lag cruime was four miles to the north of fort william and fort william was no more than three miles due west of the hill of craigh na dun so for the first time since my meeting with murtagh i knew approximately where i was no more than seven miles from that bloody hill and its accursed stone circle seven miles perhaps from home from frank i started back into the copse but changed my mind i dared not take the road this close to fort william and the several small villages that surrounded it there was too much risk of meeting someone and i could not take a horse down the precipitous course of the burn in fact i had some doubt that it could be managed on foot the rock walls were sheer in some spots plunging directly into the foaming water of the stream with no real footing save the tops of scattered rocks sticking out of the rushing water but it was by far the most direct path in the direction i wanted and i did not dare to take too circuitous a route i might easily lose my way in the wild growth or be overtaken by jamie and dougal returning my stomach gave a sudden lurch as i thought of jamie god how could i do it leave him without a word of explanation or apology disappear without a trace after what he had done for me with that thought i finally decided to leave the horse at least he would think i had not left him willingly he might believe i had been killed by wild beasts i touched the dagger in my pocket or possibly kidnapped by outlaws and finding no trace of me eventually he would forget me and wed again perhaps the lovely young laoghaire back at leoch absurdly enough i found that the thought of jamie sharing laoghaires bed upset me as much as the thought of leaving him i cursed myself for idiocy but i couldnt help imagining her sweet round face flushed with ardent longing and his big hands burying themselves in that moonbeam hair i unclenched my teeth and resolutely wiped the tears off my cheeks i hadnt time nor energy for senseless reflections i must go and now while i could it might be the best chance i would get i hoped that jamie would forget me i knew that i would never be able to forget him but for now i must put him out of my mind or i wouldnt be able to concentrate on the job at hand which was tricky enough cautiously i picked my way down the steep bank to the edge of the water the noise of the rushing stream drowned out the birds in the copse above the going was rough but there was at least room to walk by the waters edge here the bank was muddy and strewn with rocks but passable further down i saw that i would have to step out actually into the water and make my way precariously from rock to rock balancing above the flood until the bank widened enough to go ashore again i picked my way painfully along estimating how much time i might have jamie had said only that they would return before sundown three or four miles to lag cruime but i had no way of knowing what the roads were like nor how long the business with horrocks might take if he was there but he would be i argued with myself hugh munro had said so and outlandish as that grotesque figure had been jamie plainly considered him a reliable source of information my foot slipped off the first rock in the stream plunging me into icy water to the knee and soaking my skirt i withdrew to the bank tucked my skirts as high as i could and removed both shoes and stockings i slipped these into the pocket made by my tuckedup skirt and set my foot again on the rock i found that by gripping with my toes i could manage to step from rock to rock without slipping the bunches of my skirt made it difficult to see where i was going to step next though and more than once i found myself sliding into the water my legs were chilled and as my feet grew numb it got harder to maintain my grip luckily the bank widened again and i stepped gratefully ashore into warm sticky mud short periods of more or less comfortable squelching alternated with much longer periods of precarious rockhopping through the freezing rapids and i found to my relief that i was much too busy to think very much about jamie after a time i had the routine worked out step grip pause look around locate next step step grip pause and so on i must have become overconfident or perhaps only tired because i got careless and undershot my goal my foot skidded helplessly down the near side of the slimecoated rock i waved my arms wildly trying to move back to the rock i had been on but my balance had shifted too far skirts petticoats dagger and all i plunged into the water and kept on plunging while the stream overall was only a foot or two deep there were intermittent deep pools where the scouring water had scooped out deep depressions in the rock the one on which id lost my footing was perched on the edge of one such pool and when i hit the water i sank like a rock myself i was so stunned by the shock of the icy water rushing into my nose and mouth that i didnt cry out silvery bubbles shot out of the bodice of my dress and rushed past my face toward the surface above the cotton fabric soaked through almost at once and the freezing grip of the water paralyzed my breathing i began almost at once to fight my way up to the surface but the weight of my garments pulled me down i yanked frantically at the laces of my bodice but there was no hope of getting everything off before i drowned i made a number of savage and uncharitable silent observations about dressmakers womens fashions and the stupidity of long skirts while kicking frenziedly to keep the entangling folds away from my legs the water was crystal clear my fingers brushed the rock wall sliding through the dark slick streamers of duckweed and algae slippery as waterweed thats what jamie said about my the thought jarred me out of my panic suddenly i realized that i shouldnt be exhausting myself trying to kick to the surface the pool couldnt be more than eight or nine feet deep what i needed to do was relax float down to the bottom brace my feet and spring upward with luck that would get my head clear for a breath and even if i went down again i could continue bouncing off the bottom until i worked my way close enough to the edge to get a decent grip on a rock the descent was agonizingly slow as i was no longer fighting upward my skirts rose round me in billows floating in front of my face i batted them away i must keep my face clear my lungs were bursting and there were dark spots behind my eyes by the time my feet touched the smooth bottom of the pool i let my knees bend slightly pressing my skirts down around me then shoved upward with all my might it worked just barely my face broke the surface at the top of my leap and i had just time for the briefest of lifesaving gulps before the water closed over me again but it was enough i knew i could do it again i pressed my arms down to my sides to streamline myself and make the descent more rapid once more beauchamp i thought bend your knees brace yourself jump i shot upward arms extended overhead i had seen a flash of red overhead when i broke water last there must be a rowan tree overhanging the water perhaps i could get hold of a branch as my face broke water something seized my outstretched hand something hard warm and reassuringly solid another hand coughing and spluttering i groped blindly with my free hand too glad of rescue to regret the interruption of my escape attempt glad at least until wiping the hair out of my eyes i looked up into the beefy anxious lancashire face of young corporal hawkins chapter une mauvais quart dheure after another i delicately removed a strand of stilldamp waterweed from my sleeve and placed it squarely in the center of the blotter then seeing the inkstand handy i picked up the weed and dipped it in using the result to paint interesting patterns on the thick blotting paper getting fully into the spirit of the thing i finished off my masterpiece with a rude word carefully sprinkled it with sand and blotted it before propping it up against the bank of pigeonholes i stepped back to admire the effect then looked around for any other diversions that might take my mind off the impending advent of captain randall not bad for the private office of a captain i thought eyeing the paintings on the wall the silver desk fittings and the thick carpet on the floor i moved back onto the carpet in order to drip more effectively the ride to fort william had dried my outer garments fairly well but the underlying layers of petticoat were still wringing wet i opened a small cupboard behind the desk and discovered the captains spare wig neatly bestowed on one of a pair of wroughtiron stands with a matched silverbacked set of looking glass military brushes and tortoiseshell comb laid out in orderly ranks before it carrying the wig stand over to the desk i gently sifted the remaining contents of the sander over it before replacing it in the cupboard i was seated behind the desk comb in hand studying my reflection in the looking glass when the captain came in he gave me a glance that took in my disheveled appearance the rifled cupboard and the disfigured blotter without blinking he drew up a chair and sat down across from me lounging casually with one booted foot resting on the opposite knee a riding crop dangled from one fine aristocratic hand i watched the braided tip black and scarlet as it swung slowly back and forth over the carpet the idea has its attractions he said watching my eyes follow the sweep of the whip but i could probably think of something better given a few moments to collect myself i daresay you could i said fingering a thick sheaf of hair out of my eyes but you arent allowed to flog women are you only under certain circumstances he said politely which your situation doesnt meet yet thats rather public though i had thought we might get better acquainted in private first he reached to the sideboard behind him for a decanter we sipped the claret in silence eyeing each other over the wine i had forgotten to offer you felicitations on your marriage he said suddenly forgive my lack of manners think nothing of it i said graciously im sure my husbands family will be most obliged to you for offering me hospitality oh i rather doubt it he said with an engaging smile but then i didnt think id tell them you were here what makes you think they dont know i asked beginning to feel rather hollow despite my earlier resolve to brazen it out i cast a quick glance at the window but it was on the wrong side of the building the sun wasnt visible but the light looked yellow perhaps midafternoon how long before jamie found my abandoned horse and how long after that before he followed my trail into the stream and promptly lost it disappearing without a trace had its drawbacks in fact unless randall decided to send word of my whereabouts to dougal there was no way on earth the scots could know where i had gone if they knew the captain said arching one elegantly shaped brow they would presumably be calling on me already considering the sorts of names dougal mackenzie applied to me on the occasion of our last meeting i scarcely think he feels me a suitable chaperon for a kinswoman and the clan mackenzie seems to think youre of such value that theyd rather adopt you as one of their own than see you fall into my hands i can hardly imagine they would allow you to languish in durance vile here he looked me over disapprovingly taking in every detail of my waterlogged costume unkempt hair and generally disheveled appearance damned if i know what they want you for he observed or if youre so valuable to them why the devil they let you wander about the countryside by yourself i thought even barbarians took better care of their womenfolk than that a sudden gleam came into his eyes or have you perhaps decided to part company with them he sat back intrigued by this new speculation the wedding night was more of a trial than you anticipated he inquired i must confess i was somewhat put out to hear that you preferred the alternative of bedding one of those hairy halfnaked savages to further discussions with me that argues a high devotion to duty madam and i must congratulate whomever employs you on their ability to inspire it but he leaned still further back in his chair balancing the claret cup on his knee i am afraid i still must insist on the name of your employer if you have indeed parted company with the mackenzies the most likely supposition is that youre a french agent but whose he stared at me intently like a snake hoping to fascinate a bird by now i had had enough claret to fill part of the hollow space inside me though and i stared back oh i said elaborately polite im included in this conversation am i i thought you were doing quite well by yourself pray continue the graceful line of his mouth tightened a bit and the deep crease at the corner grew deeper but he didnt say anything setting his glass aside he rose and taking off his wig went to the cupboard where he placed it on an empty stand i saw him pause for a moment as he saw the dark grains of sand adorning his other wig but his expression didnt change noticeably unwigged his hair was dark thick finetextured and shiny it was also disturbingly familiarlooking though it was shoulderlength and tied back with a blue silk ribbon he removed this plucked the comb from the desk and tidied the hair flattened by the wig then retied the ribbon with some care i helpfully held up the looking glass so that he could judge the final effect he took it from me in a marked manner and restored it to its place shutting the cupboard door with what was almost a slam i couldnt tell whether this delay was in hopes of unnerving me in which case it was working or merely because he couldnt decide what to do next the tension was slightly relieved by the entrance of an orderly bearing a tray of tea things still silent randall poured out and offered me a cup we sipped some more dont tell me i said finally let me guess its a new form of persuasion youve invented torture by bladder you ply me with drinkables until i promise to tell you anything in exchange for five minutes with a chamber pot he was so taken by surprise that he actually laughed it quite transformed his face and i had no difficulty seeing why there were so many scented envelopes with feminine handwriting in the bottom lefthand drawer of his desk having let the facade crack he didnt stifle the laugh but let it go finished he stared at me again a halfsmile lingering on his mouth whatever else you may be madam at least youre a diversion he remarked he yanked at a bellpull hanging by the door and when the orderly reappeared instructed him to convey me to the necessary facilities but take care not to lose her on the way thompson he added opening the door for me with a sardonic bow i leaned weakly against the door of the privy to which i was shown being out of his presence was a relief but a shortlived one i had had ample opportunity to judge randalls true character both from the stories i had heard and from personal experience but there were those damnable flashes of frank that kept showing through the gleaming ruthless exterior it had been a mistake to make him laugh i thought i sat down ignoring the stench in my concentration on the problem at hand escape seemed unlikely the vigilant thompson aside randalls office was in a building located near the center of the compound and while the fort itself was no more than a stone stockade the walls were ten feet high and the double gates well guarded i thought of feigning illness and remaining in my refuge but dismissed it and not only because of the unpleasantness of the surroundings the unpalatable truth was that there was little point in delaying tactics unless i had something to delay for and i didnt no one knew where i was and randall didnt mean to tell anyone i was his for as long as he cared to amuse himself with me once again i regretted making him laugh a sadist with a sense of humor was particularly dangerous thinking frantically in search of something useful i might know about the captain i latched onto a name halfheard and carelessly remembered i hoped i had it right it was a pitifully small card to play but the only one i had i drew a deep breath hastily let it out again and stepped out of my sanctuary back in the office i added sugar to my tea and stirred it carefully then cream having drawn out the ceremony as long as i could i was forced to look at randall he was sitting back in his favorite pose cup elegantly suspended in midair the better to look at me over well i said you neednt worry about spoiling my appetite since i havent got one what do you mean to do about me he smiled and took a careful sip of the scalding tea before replying nothing really i lifted my brows in surprise invention failed you has it i shouldnt care to think so he said polite as usual his eyes traveled over me once more far from polite no he said his gaze lingering on the edge of my bodice where the tucked kerchief left the upper swell of my breasts visible much as i would like to give you a badly needed lesson in manners i am afraid the pleasure must be postponed indefinitely im sending you to edinburgh with the next posting of dispatches and i shouldnt care to have you arrive damaged in any visible way my superiors might consider it careless of me edinburgh i couldnt hide my surprise yes youve heard of the tolbooth i imagine i had one of the most noisome and notorious prisons of the period it was famous for filth crime disease and darkness a good many of the prisoners held there died before they could be brought to trial i swallowed hard forcing down the bitter bile that had risen at the back of my throat mingling with the swallow of sweet tea randall sipped his own tea pleased with himself you should feel quite cozy there after all you seem to prefer a certain dank squalor in your surroundings he cast a condemning glance at the soggy hem of my petticoat sagging below my gown should be quite homelike after castle leoch i rather doubted that the cuisine at the tolbooth was as good as that to be had at colums board and general questions of amenities aside i couldnt could not allow him to send me to edinburgh once immured in the tolbooth i would never get back to the stone circle the time to play my card had arrived now or never i raised my own cup just as you like i said calmly what do you suppose the duke of sandringham will have to say about it he upset the hot tea on his doeskin lap and made several very gratifying noises tsk i said reprovingly he subsided glaring the teacup lay on its side its brown contents soaking into the pale green carpet but he made no move toward the bellpull a small muscle jumped in the side of his neck i had already found the pile of starched handkerchiefs in the upper lefthand drawer of the desk alongside an enameled snuffbox i pulled one out and handed it to him i do hope it doesnt stain i said sweetly no he said ignoring the handkerchief he eyed me closely no it isnt possible why not i asked affecting nonchalance wondering what wasnt possible i would have been told and if you were working for sandringham why the devil would you act in such a damned ridiculous manner perhaps the duke is testing your loyalty i suggested at random preparing to leap to my feet if necessary his fists were bunched at his side and the discarded riding crop was within much too easy a reach on the desk nearby he snorted in response to this suggestion you may be testing my gullibility or my tolerance to irritation both madam are extremely low his eyes narrowed speculatively and i braced myself for a quick dash he lunged and i flung myself to one side getting hold of the teapot i threw it at him he dodged and it hit the door with a satisfying crash the orderly who must have been lingering just outside poked a startled head in breathing heavily the captain motioned him impatiently into the room hold her he ordered brusquely crossing toward the desk i began to breathe deeply both in hopes of calming myself and in anticipation of not being able to do it in a moment instead of hitting me though he merely pulled out the lower righthand drawer which i had not had time to investigate and pulled out a long strand of thin rope what kind of gentleman keeps rope in his desk drawers i inquired indignantly a prepared one madam he murmured tying my wrists securely behind me go he said impatiently to the orderly jerking his head toward the door and dont come back no matter what you hear this sounded distinctly ominous and my forebodings were abundantly justified as he reached into the drawer once more there is something unnerving about a knife men who are fearless in personal combat will shrink from a naked blade i shrank myself until my bound hands collided with the whitewashed wall the wicked gleaming point lowered and pressed between my breasts now he said pleasantly you are going to tell me everything you know about the duke of sandringham the blade pressed a little harder making a dent in the fabric of my gown take as long as you like about it my dear i am in no hurry whatsoever there was a small pop as the point punctured the fabric i felt it cold as fear a tiny spot directly over my heart randall slowly drew the knife in a semicircle under one breast the homespun came free and fell away with a flutter of white chemise and my breast sprang out randall seemed to have been holding his breath he exhaled slowly now his eyes fixed on mine i sidled away from him but there was very little room to maneuver i ended up pressed against the desk bound hands gripping the edge if he came close enough i thought i might be able to rock backward on my hands and kick the knife out of his hand i doubted that he meant to kill me certainly not until he had found out just what i knew about his relations with the duke somehow that conclusion was of relatively little comfort he smiled with that unnerving resemblance to franks smile that lovely smile which i had seen charm students and melt the stoniest college administrator possibly under other circumstances i would have found this man charming but just at present no he moved in fast thrusting a knee between my thighs and pushing my shoulders back unable to keep my balance i fell heavily backward on the desk crying out as i landed painfully on my bound wrists he pressed himself between my legs scrabbling with one hand to raise my skirts while the other fastened on my bared breast rolling and pinching i kicked frantically but my skirts got in the way he grasped my foot and ran a hand up my leg pushing damp petticoats skirt and chemise out of the way tossing them up above my waist his hand dropped to his breeches shades of harry the deserter i thought furiously what in gods name is the british army coming to glorious traditions my aunt fanny in the midst of an english garrison screaming was unlikely to attract any helpful attention but i filled my lungs and had a try more as a pro forma protest than anything else i had expected a slap or shake in return to shut me up instead unexpectedly he appeared to like it go ahead and scream sweeting he murmured busy with his flies ill enjoy it much more if you scream i looked him straight in the eye and snapped get stuffed with perfect clarity and terrible inaptness a lock of dark hair came loose and fell across his forehead in rakish disarray he looked so like his sixtimesgreat grandson that i was seized by a horrible impulse to open my legs and respond to him he twisted my breast savagely and the impulse disappeared at once i was furiously angry disgusted humiliated and revolted but curiously not very frightened i felt a heavy flopping movement against my leg and suddenly realized why he wasnt going to enjoy it unless i screamed and possibly not then oh like that is it i said and was rewarded at once with a sharp slap across the face i shut my mouth grimly and turned my head away lest i be tempted into any more injudicious remarks i realized that rape or not i was in considerable danger from his unstable temper looking away from the sight of randall i caught a sudden flicker of movement at the window ill thank ye said a cool level voice to take your hands off my wife randall froze with a hand still on my breast jamie was crouched in the window frame a large brasshandled pistol braced across one forearm randall stood frozen for a second as though unable to believe his ears as his head turned slowly toward the window his right hand shielded from jamies view left my breast sliding stealthily toward the knife which he had laid on the desk next to my head what did you say he said incredulously as his hand fastened on the knife he turned far enough to see who had spoken he stopped again for a moment staring then began to laugh lord help us its the young scottish wildcat i thought id dealt with you once and for all back healed after all did it and this is your wife you say quite a tasty little wench she is quite like your sister still shielded by his partly turned body randalls knifehand swiveled the blade was now pointed at my throat i could see jamie over his shoulder braced in the window like a cat about to spring the pistol barrel didnt waver nor did he change expression the only clue to his emotions was the dusky red creeping up his throat his collar was unbuttoned and the small scar on his neck flamed crimson almost casually randall slowly raised the knife into view point almost touching my throat he half turned toward jamie perhaps youd better toss that pistol over here unless youre weary of married life if youd prefer to be a widower of course their eyes locked tight as a lovers embrace neither man moved for a long minute finally jamies body relaxed its springlike tension he let out his breath in a long sigh of resignation and tossed the pistol into the room it hit the floor with a clunk and slid almost to randalls feet randall bent and scooped up the gun in a quicksilver motion as soon as the knife left my throat i tried to sit up but he placed a hand on my chest and shoved me flat again he held me down with one hand using the other to aim the pistol at jamie the discarded knife lay somewhere on the floor near my feet i thought now if only i had prehensile toes the dirk in my pocket was as unreachable as if it were on mars the smile had not left randalls features since jamies appearance now it broadened enough to show the pointed dog teeth well thats a bit better the pressing hand left my chest to return to the swelling flies of his breeches i was engaged when you arrived my dear fellow youll forgive me if i get on with what i was doing before i attend to you the red color had spread completely over jamies face but he stood motionless the gun pointed at his middle as randall finished his maneuvers jamie launched himself at the open mouth of the pistol i tried to scream to stop him but my mouth was dry with terror randalls knuckles whitened as he squeezed the trigger the hammer clicked on an empty chamber and jamies fist drove into randalls stomach there was a dull crunching sound as his other fist splintered the officers nose and a fine spray of blood spattered my skirt randalls eyes rolled up in his head and he dropped to the floor like a stone jamie was behind me pulling me up sawing at the rope around my wrists you bluffed your way in here with an empty gun i croaked hysterically if it were loaded i would ha just shot him in the first place wouldnt i jamie hissed feet were coming down the corridor toward the office the rope came free and jamie yanked me to the window it was an eightfoot drop to the ground but the footsteps were almost to the door we jumped together i landed with a boneshaking jar and rolled in a tumble of skirts and petticoats jamie jerked me to my feet and pressed me against the wall of the building feet were passing the corner of the building six soldiers came into view but didnt look in our direction as soon as they were safely past jamie took my hand and motioned toward the other corner we sidled along the building stopping short of the corner i could see where we were now about twenty feet away a ladder led up to a sort of catwalk that ran along the inside of the forts outer wall he nodded toward it this was our objective he brought his head close to mine and whispered when ye hear an explosion run like hell and get up that ladder ill be behind ye i nodded understanding my heart was going like a triphammer glancing down i saw that one breast was still exposed not much to be done about it just at present i rucked up my skirts ready to run there was an almighty roar from the other side of the building like a mortar explosion jamie gave me a shove and i was off running as fast as i could go i jumped for the ladder caught it and scrambled up i felt the wood jerk and tremble as jamies weight hit the ladder below me turning at the top of the ladder i had a birdseye view of the fort black smoke was billowing up from a small building near the back wall and men were running toward it from every direction jamie popped up beside me this way he ran crouching along the catwalk and i followed we stopped near the flag staff set in the wall the ensign flapped heavily above us halyard beating a rhythmic tattoo against the pole jamie was peering over the wall looking for something i looked back over the camp the men were clustering at the small building milling and shouting off to one side i spotted a small wooden platform set three or four feet high with steps leading up a heavy wooden post rose out of the center crossbeamed with rope manacles dangling from the arms of the cross suddenly jamie gave a whistle looking over the wall i saw rupert mounted and leading jamies horse he looked up at the sound of the whistle and maneuvered the horses close to the wall below us jamie was cutting the halyard from the flagpole the heavy red and blue folds of the flag drooped and slid down landing with a swishing thud next to me twisting a rope end rapidly around one of the struts jamie tossed the rest down the outside of the wall come on he said hold tight with both hands brace your feet against the wall go i went bracing my feet and paying out rope the thin cordage slipped and burned in my hands i dropped next to the horses and hurried to mount jamie vaulted into the saddle behind me a moment later and we took off at a gallop we slowed our pace a mile or two from the camp when it became apparent that we had lost any pursuers after a short conference dougal decided that we had better make for the border of the mackintosh lands as being the closest safe clan territory doonesburys within riding distance by tonight and likely to be safe enough therell be word out on us tomorrow but well be across the border before it reaches there it was midafternoon by then we set off at a steady pace our horse with its double load lagging slightly behind the others my horse i supposed was still happily eating grass in the copse waiting to be led home by whoever was lucky enough to find it how did you find me i asked i was beginning to shake in reaction and folded my arms around myself to still the quivering my clothes had dried completely by this time but i felt a chill that went bonedeep i thought better of leaving ye alone and sent a man back to stay wi ye he didna see ye leave but he saw the english soldiers cross the ford and you wi them jamies voice was cold i couldnt blame him i supposed my teeth were beginning to chatter im ssurprised that you didnt just think i was an english spy and lleave me there dougal wanted to but the man who saw ye with the soldiers said you were struggling i had to go and see at least he glanced down at me not changing expression youre lucky sassenach that i saw what i did in that room at least dougal must admit that youre not in league wi the english ddougal eh and what about you whwhat do you think i demanded he did not reply but only snorted briefly he did at last take pity on me to the extent of jerking off his plaid and flinging it over my shoulders but he would not put his arm around me nor touch me more than strictly necessary he rode in grim silence handling the reins with an angry jerkiness quite unlike his usual smooth grace upset and unsettled myself i was in no frame of mind to put up with moods well what is it then whats the matter i asked impatiently dont sulk for heavens sake i spoke more sharply than i intended and i felt him stiffen still further suddenly he turned the horses head aside and reined up at the side of the road before i knew what was happening he had dismounted and jerked me from the saddle as well i landed awkwardly staggering to keep my balance as my feet hit the ground dougal and the others paused seeing us stop jamie made a short sharp gesture sending them on and dougal waved in acknowledgment dont take too long he called and they set off again jamie waited until they were out of earshot then he yanked me around to face him he was clearly furious on the verge of explosion i felt my own wrath rising what right did he have to treat me like this sulking he said sulking is it im using all the selfcontrol ive got to keep from shakin ye til your teeth rattle and you tell me not to sulk what in the name of god is the matter with you i asked angrily i tried to shake off his grip but his fingers dug into my upper arms like the teeth of a trap whats the matter wi me ill tell ye what the matter is since ye want to know he said through clenched teeth im tired of having to prove over and over that youre no an english spy im tired of having to watch ye very minute for fear of what foolishness youll try next and im verra tired of people trying to make me watch while they rape you i dinna enjoy it a bit and you think i enjoy it i yelled are you trying to make out its my fault at this he did shake me slightly it is your fault did ye stay put where i ordered ye to stay this mornin this would never have happened but no ye wont listen to me im no but your husband why mind me you take it into your mind to do as ye damn please and next i ken i find ye flat on your back wi your skirts up an the worst scum in the land between your legs on the point of takin ye before my eyes his scots accent usually slight was growing broader by the second sure sign that he was upset had i needed any further indication we were almost nose to nose by this time shouting into each others face jamie was flushed with fury and i felt the blood rising in my own face its your own fault for ignoring me and suspecting me all the time i told you the truth about who i am and i told you there was no danger in my going with you but would you listen to me no im only a woman why should you pay any attention to what i say women are only fit to do as theyre told and follow orders and sit meekly around with their hands folded waiting for the men to come back and tell them what to do he shook me again unable to control himself and if yed done that we wouldna be on the run with a hundred redcoats on our tail god woman i dinna know whether to strangle ye or throw ye on the ground and hammer ye senseless but by jesus i want to do something to you at this i made a determined effort to kick him in the balls he dodged and jammed his own knee between my legs effectively preventing any further attempts try that again and ill slap you til your ears ring he growled youre a brute and a fool i panted struggling to escape his grip on my shoulders do you think i went out and got captured by the english on purpose i do think ye did it on purpose to get back at me for what happened in the glade my mouth fell open in the glade with the english deserters aye ye think i should ha been able to protect ye there an youre right but i couldna do it you had to do it yourself and now youre tryin to make me pay for it by deliberately putting yourself my wife in the hands of a man thats shed my blood your wife your wife you dont care a thing about me im just your property it only matters to you because you think i belong to you and you cant stand to have someone take something that belongs to you ye do belong to me he roared digging his fingers into my shoulders like spikes and you are my wife whether ye like it or no i dont like it i dont like it a bit but that doesnt matter either does it as long as im there to warm your bed you dont care what i think or how i feel thats all a wife is to you something to stick your cock into when you feel the urge at this his face went dead white and he began to shake me in earnest my head jerked violently and my teeth clacked together making me bite my tongue painfully let go of me i shouted let go you i deliberately used the words of harry the deserter trying to hurt him you rutting bastard he did let go and fell back a pace eyes blazing ye foultongued bitch yell no speak to me that way ill speak any way i want to you cant tell me what to do seems i cant yell do as ye wish no matter who ye hurt by it wont ye ye selfish willful its your bloody pride thats hurt i shouted i saved us both from those deserters in the glade and you cant stand it can you you just stood there if i hadnt had a knife wed both be dead now until i spoke the words i had had no idea that i had been angry with him for failing to protect me from the english deserters in a more rational mood the thought would never have entered my mind it wasnt his fault i would have said it was just luck that i had the knife i would have said but now i realized that fair or not rational or not i did somehow feel that it was his responsibility to protect me and that he had failed me perhaps because he so clearly felt that way he stood glaring at me panting with emotion when he spoke again his voice was low and ragged with passion you saw that post in the yard of the fort i nodded shortly well i was tied to that post tied like an animal and whipped til my blood ran ill carry the scars from it til i die if id not been lucky as the devil this afternoon thats the least as would have happened to me likely theyd have flogged me then hanged me he swallowed hard and went on i knew that and i didna hesitate for one second to go into that place after you even thinking that dougal might be right do ye know where i got the gun i used i shook my head numbly my own anger beginning to fade i killed a guard near the wall he fired at me thats why it was empty he missed and i killed him wi my dirk left it sticking in his wishbone when i heard you cry out i would have killed a dozen men to get to you claire his voice cracked and when ye screamed i went to you armed wi nothing but an empty gun and my two hands jamie was speaking a little more calmly now but his eyes were still wild with pain and rage i was silent unsettled by the horror of my encounter with randall i had not at all appreciated the desperate courage it had taken for him to come into the fort after me he turned away suddenly shoulders slumping youre right he said quietly aye youre quite right suddenly the rage was gone from his voice replaced by a tone i had never heard in him before even in the extremities of physical pain my pride is hurt and my pride is about all ive got left to me he leaned his forearms against a roughbarked pine and let his head drop onto them exhausted his voice was so low i could barely hear him youre tearin my guts out claire something very similar was happening to my own tentatively i came up behind him he didnt move even when i slipped my arms around his waist i rested my cheek on his bowed back his shirt was damp sweated through with the intensity of his passion and he was trembling im sorry i said simply please forgive me he turned then to hold me tightly i felt his trembling ease bit by bit forgiven lass he murmured at last into my hair releasing me he looked down at me sober and formal im sorry too he said ill ask your pardon for what i said i was sore and i said more nor i meant will ye forgive me too after his last speech i hardly felt that there was anything for me to forgive but i nodded and pressed his hands forgiven in an easier silence we mounted again the road was straight for a long way here and far ahead i could see a small cloud of dust that must be dougal and the other men jamie was back with me again he held me with one arm as we rode and i felt safer but there was still a vague sense of injury and constraint things were not yet healed between us we had forgiven each other but our words still hung in memory not to be forgotten chapter reckonings we reached doonesbury well after dark it was a fairsized coachstop with an inn fortunately dougal closed his eyes briefly in pain as he paid the innkeeper it would take quite a bit of extra silver to insure his silence as to our presence the silver however also insured a hearty supper with plenty of ale despite the food supper was a grim affair eaten mostly in silence sitting there in my ruined gown modestly covered by jamies extra shirt i was plainly in disgrace except for jamie the men behaved as though i were completely invisible and even jamie did no more than shove bread and meat in my direction from time to time it was a relief at last to go up to our chamber small and cramped though it was i sank on the bed with a sigh disregarding the state of the bedclothes im done in its been a long day aye it has that jamie unfastened his collar and cuffs and unbuckled his sword belt but made no move to undress further he pulled the strap from the scabbard and doubled it flexing the leather meditatively come to bed jamie what are you waiting for he came to stand by the bed swinging the belt gently back and forth well lass im afraid weve a matter still to settle between us before we sleep tonight i felt a sudden stab of apprehension what is it he didnt answer at once deliberately not sitting down on the bed by me he pulled up a stool and sat facing me instead do ye realize claire he said quietly that all of us came close to bein killed this afternoon i looked down at the quilt shamefaced yes i know my fault im sorry aye so ye realize he said do ye know that if a man among us had done such a thing to put the rest in danger he would ha likely had his ears cropped or been flogged if not killed outright i blanched at this no i didnt know well i know as youre not yet familiar wi our ways and its some excuse still i did tell ye to stay hid and had ye done so it would never have happened now the english will be lookin high and low for us we shall have to lie hid during the days and travel at night now he paused and as for captain randall aye thats something else again hell be looking for you especially you mean now that he knows youre here he nodded absently looking off into the fire aye he its personal with him ye know im so sorry jamie i said jamie dismissed this with a wave of the hand eh if it were only me yed hurt by it i wouldna say more about it though since were talkin he shot me a sharp glance ill tell ye that it near killed me to see that animal with his hands on you he looked off into the fire grimfaced as though reliving the afternoons events i thought of telling him about randalls difficulties but was afraid it would do more harm than good i desperately wanted to hold jamie and beg him to forgive me but i didnt dare to touch him after a long moment of silence he sighed and stood up slapping the belt lightly against his thigh well then he said best get on wi it youve done considerable damage by crossing my orders and im going to punish ye for it claire yell recall what i told ye when i left ye this morning i recalled all right and i hastily flung myself across the bed so my back was pressed to the wall what do you mean ye know quite well what i mean he said firmly kneel down by the bed and lift your skirts lass ill do no such thing i took a good hold on the bedpost with both hands and wormed my way further into the corner jamie watched me through narrowed eyes for a moment debating what to do next it occurred to me that there was nothing whatever to stop him doing anything he liked to me he outweighed me by a good five stone he at last decided on talk rather than action though and carefully laid the strap aside before crawling over the bedclothes to sit beside me now claire he began ive said im sorry i burst out and i am ill never do such a thing again well thats the point he said slowly ye might and its because ye dinna take things as serious as they are ye come from a place where things are easier i think tis not a matter of life or death where ye come from to disobey orders or take matters into your own hands at worst ye might cause someone discomfort or be a bit of a nuisance but it isna likely to get someone killed i watched his fingers pleating the brownish plaid of his kilt as he arranged his thoughts its the hard truth that a light action can have verra serious consequences in places and times like these especially for a man like me he patted my shoulder seeing that i was close to tears i know ye would never endanger me or anyone else on purpose but ye might easily do so without meanin it like ye did today because ye do not really believe me yet when i tell ye that some things are dangerous youre accustomed to think for yourself and i know he glanced sidewise at me that youre not accustomed to lettin a man tell ye what to do but you must learn to do so for all our sakes all right i said slowly i understand youre right of course all right ill follow your orders even if i dont agree with them good he stood up and picked up the belt now then get off the bed and well get it over with my mouth dropped open in outrage what i said id follow your orders he sighed exasperated then sat down again on the stool he looked at me levelly now listen ye understand me ye say and i believe it but theres a difference between understandin something with your mind and really knowing it deep down i nodded reluctantly all right now i will have to punish you and for two reasons first so that ye will know he smiled suddenly i can tell ye from my own experience that a good hiding makes ye consider things in a more serious light i took a tighter hold on the bedpost the other reason he went on is because of the other men yell have noticed how they were tonight i had it had been so uncomfortable at dinner that i was glad to escape to the room theres such a thing as justice claire youve done wrong to them all and youll have to suffer for it he took a deep breath im your husband its my duty to attend to it and i mean to do it i had strong objections to this proposal on several levels whatever the justice of the situation and i had to admit that at least some of it lay on his side my sense of amourpropre was deeply offended at the thought of being beaten by whomever and for whatever reason i felt deeply betrayed that the man i depended on as friend protector and lover intended to do such a thing to me and my sense of selfpreservation was quietly terrified at the thought of submitting myself to the mercies of someone who handled a fifteenpound claymore as though it were a flywhisk i will not allow you to beat me i said firmly keeping a tight hold on the bedpost oh you wont he raised sandy brows well ill tell ye lass i doubt youve much to say about it youre my wife like it or not did i want to break your arm or feed ye naught but bread and water or lock ye in a closet for days and dont think ye dont tempt me either i could do that let alone warm your bum for you ill scream likely if not before certainly during i expect theyll hear ye at the next farm youve got good lungs he grinned odiously and came across the bed after me he pried my fingers loose with some difficulty and pulled firmly hauling me to the side of the bed i kicked him in the shins but did no damage not having shoes on grunting slightly he managed to turn me facedown on the bed twisting my arm to hold me there i mean to do it claire now if youll cooperate wi me well call the account square with a dozen strokes and if not i quavered he picked up the strap and slapped it against his leg with a nasty thwapping sound then i shall put a knee in your back and beat you til my arm tires and i warn ye youll tire of it long before i do i bounced off the bed and whirled to face him fists clenched you barbarian you you sadist i hissed furiously youre doing this for your own pleasure ill never forgive you for this jamie paused twisting the belt he replied levelly i dinna know whats a sadist and if i forgive you for this afternoon i reckon youll forgive me too as soon as ye can sit down again as for my pleasure his lip twitched i said i would have to punish you i did not say i wasna going to enjoy it he crooked a finger at me come here i was reluctant to leave the sanctuary of the room next morning and fiddled about tying and untying ribbons and brushing my hair i had not spoken to jamie since the night before but he noticed my hesitation and urged me to come out with him to breakfast you dinna need to fear meetin the others claire theyll chaff ye a bit likely but it wont be bad chin up he chucked me under the chin and i bit his hand sharply but not deep ooh he snatched his fingers back be careful lass you dont know where theyve been he left me chuckling and went in to breakfast he might well be in a good mood i thought bitterly if it were revenge hed wanted the night before hed had it it had been a most unpleasant night my reluctant acquiescence had lasted precisely as far as the first searing crack of leather on flesh this was followed by a short violent struggle which left jamie with a bloody nose three lovely gouges down one cheek and a deeply bitten wrist not surprisingly it left me half smothered in the greasy quilts with a knee in my back being beaten within an inch of my life jamie damn his black scottish soul turned out to be right the men were restrained in their greetings but friendly enough the hostility and contempt of the night before had vanished as i was dishing eggs at the sideboard dougal came up and slipped a fatherly arm around my shoulders his beard tickled my ear as he spoke in a confidential rumble i hope jamie wasna too harsh wi ye last night lass it sounded as though ye were bein murderrt at least i flushed hotly and turned away so he wouldnt see it after jamies obnoxious remarks i had resolved to keep my mouth firmly shut through the whole ordeal however when it came to the event i would have challenged the sphinx itself to keep a shut mouth while on the receiving end of a strap wielded by jamie fraser dougal turned to call to jamie seated at the table eating bread and cheese hey now jamie it wasna necessary to halfkill the lass a gentle reminder would ha sufficed he patted me firmly on the posterior in illustration making me wince i glowered at him a blistered bum never did anyone no permanent harm said murtagh through a mouthful of bread no indeed said ned grinning come have a seat lassie ill stand thank you i said with dignity making them all roar with laughter jamie was careful not to meet my eyes as he studiously cut up a bit of cheese there was a bit more goodnatured chaff during the day and each of the men made some excuse to pat my rump in mock sympathy on the whole though it was bearable and i grudgingly began to consider that jamie might have been right though i still wanted to strangle him since sitting down was completely out of the question i busied myself during the morning with small chores such as hemming and buttonsewing which could be done at the window sill with the excuse of needing the light to sew by after lunch which i ate standing we all went to our rooms to rest dougal had decided that we would wait til full dark to set out for bargrennan the next stop on our journey jamie followed me to our room but i shut the door firmly in his face let him sleep on the floor again he had been fairly tactful last night buckling his belt back on and leaving the room without speaking immediately after hed finished he had come back an hour later after id put out the light and gone to bed but had had sense enough not to try to come into bed with me after peering into the darkness where i lay unmoving he had sighed deeply wrapped himself in his plaid and gone to sleep on the floor near the door too angry upset and physically uncomfortable to sleep i had lain awake most of the night alternately thinking over what jamie had said with wanting to get up and kick him in some sensitive spot were i being objective which i was in no mood to be i might admit that he was right when he said that i didnt take things with the proper seriousness he was wrong though when he said it was because things were less precarious in my own place wherever that was in fact i thought it was more likely the opposite was true this time was in many ways still unreal to me something from a play or a fancydress pageant compared to the sights of mechanized mass warfare i had come from the small pitched battles i had seen a few men armed with swords and muskets seemed picturesque rather than threatening to me i was having trouble with the scale of things a man killed with a musket was just as dead as one killed with a mortar it was just that the mortar killed impersonally destroying dozens of men while the musket was fired by one man who could see the eyes of the one he killed that made it murder it seemed to me not war how many men to make a war enough perhaps so they didnt really have to see each other and yet this plainly was war or serious business at least to dougal jamie rupert and ned even little ratfaced murtagh had a reason for violence beyond his natural inclinations and what about those reasons one king rather than another hanovers and stuarts to me these were still no more than names on a chart on the schoolroom wall what were they compared with an unthinkable evil like hitlers reich it made a difference to those who lived under the kings i supposed though the differences might seem trivial to me still when had the right to live as one wished ever been considered trivial was a struggle to choose ones own destiny less worthwhile than the necessity to stop a great evil i shifted irritably gingerly rubbing my sore bottom i glared at jamie curled into a ball by the door he was breathing evenly but lightly perhaps he couldnt sleep either i hoped not i had been inclined at first to take this whole remarkable misadventure as melodrama such things just did not happen in real life i had had many shocks since i stepped through the rock but the worst to date had been this afternoon jack randall so like and so horribly unlike frank his touch on my breasts had suddenly forged a link between my old life and this one bringing my separate realities together with a bang like a thunderclap and then there was jamie his face stark with fear in the window of randalls room contorted with rage by the roadside tight with pain at my insults jamie jamie was real all right more real than anything had ever been to me even frank and my life in jamie tender lover and perfidious blackguard perhaps that was part of the problem jamie filled my senses so completely that his surroundings seemed almost irrelevant but i could no longer afford to ignore them my recklessness had almost killed him this afternoon and my stomach turned over at the thought of losing him i sat up suddenly intending to go and wake him to tell him to come to bed with me as my weight fell full on the results of his handiwork i just as suddenly changed my mind and flounced angrily back onto my stomach a night spent thus torn between fits of rage and philosophy had left me worn out i slept all afternoon and stumbled blearily down for a light supper when rupert roused me just before dark dougal no doubt writhing at the expense had procured another horse for me a sound beast if inelegantly built with a kindly eye and a short bristly mane at once i named it thistle i had not reckoned on the effects of a long horseback ride following a severe beating i eyed thistles hard saddle dubiously suddenly realizing what i was in for a thick cloak plopped across the saddle and murtaghs shiny black rateye winked conspiratorially at me from the opposite side i determined that i would at least suffer in dignified silence and grimly set my jaw as i hoisted myself into the saddle there seemed to be an unspoken conspiracy of gallantry among the men they took turns stopping at frequent intervals to relieve themselves allowing me to dismount for a few minutes and surreptitiously rub my aching fundament now and again one would suggest stopping for a drink which necessitated my stopping as well since thistle carried the water bottles we jolted along for a couple of hours in this manner but the pain grew steadily worse keeping me shifting in the saddle incessantly finally i decided to hell with dignified suffering i simply must get off for a while whoa i said to thistle and swung down i pretended to examine her front left foot as the other horses came to a milling stop around us im afraid shes had a stone in her shoe i lied ive got it out but id better walk her a bit dont want her to go lame no we cant have that said dougal all right walk for a bit then but someone must stay wi ye tis a quiet enough road but i canna have ye walkin alone jamie immediately swung down ill walk with her he said quietly good dinna tarry too long we must be in bargrennan before dawn the sign of the red boar landlords a friend with a wave he gathered the others and they set off at a brisk trot leaving us in the dust several hours of torture by saddle had not improved my temper let him walk with me i was damned if id speak to him the sadistic violent brute he didnt look particularly brutish in the light of the halfmoon rising but i hardened my heart and limped along carefully not looking at him my abused muscles at first protested the unaccustomed exercise but after a half hour or so i began to move much more easily youll feel much better by tomorrow jamie observed casually though you wont sit easy til the next day and what makes you such an expert i flared at him do you beat people all that frequently well no he said undisturbed by my attitude this is the first time ive tried it ive considerable experience on the other end though you i gaped at him the thought of anyone taking a strap to this towering mass of muscle and sinew was completely untenable he laughed at my expression when i was a bit smaller sassenach ive had my backside leathered more times than i could count between the ages of eight and thirteen thats when i got taller than my father and it got unhandy for him to bend me over a fence rail your father beat you aye mostly the schoolmaster too of course and dougal or one of the other uncles now and then depending on where i was and what id been doing i was growing interested in spite of my determination to ignore him what did you do he laughed again a quiet but infectious sound in the still night air well i canna remember everything i will say i generally deserved it i dont think my da ever beat me unfairly at least he paced without speaking for a minute thinking mm lets see there was once for stoning the chickens and once for riding the cows and getting them too excited for milking and then for eating all of the jam out of the cakes and leaving the cakes behind ah and letting the horses out of the barn by leaving the gate unlatched and setting the thatch of the dovecote on fire that was an accident i didna do it on purpose and losing my schoolbooks i did do that on purpose and he broke off shrugging as i laughed despite myself the usual sorts of things most often though it was for opening my mouth when i should ha kept it closed he snorted at some memory once my sister jenny broke a pitcher i made her angry teasing and she lost her temper and threw it at me when my da came in and demanded to know whod done it she was too scared to speak up and she just looked at me with her eyes all wide and frightened shes got blue eyes like mine but prettier wi black lashes all around jamie shrugged again anyway i told my father id done it that was very noble of you i said sarcastically your sister must have been grateful aye well she might have been only my fatherd been on the other side of the open door all along and hed seen what really happened so she got whipped for losing her temper and breaking the pitcher and i got whipped twice once for teasing her and again for lying thats not fair i said indignantly my father wasna always gentle but he was usually fair jamie said imperturbably he said the truth is the truth and people should take responsibility for their own actions which is right he shot me a sidelong glance but he said it was goodhearted of me to take the blame so while hed have to punish me i could take my choice between being thrashed or going to bed without my supper he laughed ruefully shaking his head father knew me pretty well i took the thrashing with no questions youre nothing but a walking appetite jamie i said aye he agreed without rancor always have been you too glutton he said to his mount wait a bit til we stop for a rest he twitched the rein pulling his horses questing nose from the tempting tufts of grass along the roadside aye father was fair he went on and considerate about it though i certainly didna appreciate that at the time he wouldnt make me wait for a beating if i did something wrong i got punished at once or as soon as he found out about it he always made sure i knew what i was about to get walloped for and if i wanted to argue my side of it i could oh so thats what youre up to i thought you disarming schemer i doubted he could charm me out of my set intention of disemboweling him at the first opportunity but he was welcome to try did you ever win an argument i asked no it was generally a straightforwardenough case with the accused convicted out of his own mouth but sometimes i got the sentence reduced a bit he rubbed his nose once i told him i thought beating your son was a most uncivilized method of getting your own way he said id about as much sense as the post i was standing next to if as much he said respect for your elders was one of the cornerstones of civilized behavior and until i learned that id better get used to looking at my toes while one of my barbaric elders thrashed my arse off this time i laughed along with him it was peaceful on the road with that sort of absolute quiet that comes when you are miles from any other person the sort of quiet so hard to come by in my own more crowded time when machines spread the influence of man so that a single person could make as much noise as a crowd the only sounds here were the stirrings of plants the occasional skreek of a nightbird and the soft thudding steps of the horses i was walking a little easier now as my cramped muscles began to stretch freely with the exercise my prickly feelings began to relax a little too listening to jamies stories all humorous and selfdeprecating i didna like being beaten at all of course but if i had a choice id rather my da than the schoolmaster wed mostly get it across the palm of the hand with a tawse in the schoolhouse instead of on the backside father said if he whipped me on the hand id not be able to do any work whereas if he whipped my arse id at least not be tempted to sit down and be idle we had a different schoolmaster each year usually they didna last long usually turned farmer or moved on to richer parts schoolmasters are paid so little theyre always skinny and starving had a fat one once and i could never believe he was a real schoolmaster he looked like a parson in disguise i thought of plump little father bain and smiled in agreement one i remember especially because hed make ye stand out in the front of the schoolroom with your hand out and then hed lecture ye at great length about your faults before he started and again in between strokes id stand there wi my hand out smarting just praying hed stop yammering and get on with the job before i lost all my courage and started crying i imagine thats what he wanted you to do i said feeling some sympathy in spite of myself oh aye he replied matteroffactly it took some time for me to realize that though and once i did as usual i couldna keep my mouth shut he sighed what happened i had all but forgotten to be furious by this time well he had me up one day i got it a lot because i couldna write properly with my right hand kept doing it with my left hed smacked me three times takin nearly five minutes to do it the bastard and he was goin on at me for being a stupid idle stubborn young lout before givin me the next my hand burned something fierce because it was the second time that day and i was scared because i knew id get an awful thrashing when i got home that was the rule if i got a beating at school id get another directly i came home for my father thought schooling important anyway i lost my temper his left hand curled involuntarily around the rein as though protecting the sensitive palm he paused and glanced at me i seldom lose my temper sassenach and generally regret it when i do and that i thought was likely to be as close to an apology as id get did you regret it that time well i doubled up my fists and glared up at him he was a tall scrawny fellow maybe twenty i suppose though he looked quite old to me and i said im not afraid o you and ye cant make me cry no matter how hard you hit me he drew a deep breath and blew it out slowly i suppose it was a bit of a mistake in judgment to tell him that while he was still holding the strap dont tell me i said he tried to prove you were wrong oh aye he tried jamie nodded head dark against the cloudlit sky his voice held a certain grim satisfaction on the word tried he didnt succeed then the shaggy head shook back and forth no at least he couldna make me cry he surely made me regret not keeping quiet though he paused for a moment turning his own face toward me the cloud cover had parted for a moment and the light touched the edges of jaw and cheek making him look gilded like one of donatellos archangels when dougal was describing my character to ye before we wed did he by chance mention that im sometimes a bit stubborn the slanted eyes glinted much more lucifer than michael i laughed thats putting it mildly as i recall what he said is that all the frasers are stubborn as rocks and youre the worst of the lot actually i said a little dryly id noticed something of the kind myself he smiled as he reined the horse around a deep puddle in the road leading mine by the checkrein after him mmph well ill no just say dougals wrong he said once the hazard had been negotiated but if im stubborn i come by it honest my father was just the same and wed get in wrangles from time to time that we couldna get out of without the application of force usually wi me bent over the fence rail suddenly he put out a hand to grab my horses rein as the beast reared and snorted hey now hush stad mo dhu his own less spooked only jerked and tossed its head nervously what is it i could see nothing despite the patches of moonlight that mottled road and field there was a pine grove up ahead and the horses seemed disinclined to go any nearer to it i dont know stay here and keep quiet mount your horse and hold mine if i call to ye drop the checkrein and run for it jamies voice was low and casual calming me as well as the horses with a muttered sguir to the horse and a slap on the neck to urge it closer to me he faded into the heather hand on his dirk i strained eyes and ears to discern whatever it was still troubling the horses they shifted and stamped ears and tails twitching in agitation the clouds by now had shredded and flown on the nightwind leaving only scattered trails across the face of a brilliant half moon in spite of the brightness i could see nothing on the road ahead or in the menacing grove it seemed a late hour and an unprofitable road for highwaymen scarce as these were anywhere in the highlands there were too few travelers to make an ambush worthwhile the grove was dark but not still the pines roared softly to themselves millions of needles scouring in the wind very ancient trees pines and eerie in the gloom gymnosperms conebearers wingedseed scatterers older and sterner by far than the softleaved fraillimbed oaks and aspens a suitable home for ruperts ghosts and evil spirits only you i thought crossly to myself could work yourself up into being afraid of a lot of trees where was jamie though the hand gripping my thigh made me squeak like a startled bat a natural consequence of trying to scream with your heart in your mouth with the unreasonable fury of the irrationally afraid i struck out at him kicking him in the chest dont sneak up on me like that hush he said come with me tugging me unceremoniously from the saddle he swung me down and hastily tethered the horses who whickered uneasily after us as he led me into the tall grass what is it i hissed stumbling blindly over roots and rocks quiet dont speak look down and watch my feet step where i step and stop when i touch you slowly and more or less silently we made our way into the edges of the pine grove it was dark under the trees with only crumbs of light falling through to the needle litter underfoot even jamie couldnt walk silently on that but the rustle of dry needles was lost in that of the green ones overhead there was a rift in the litter a mass of granite rising from the forest floor here jamie put me in front of him guiding my hands and feet to climb the sloping crumble of the mound at the top there was enough room to lie bellyflat side by side jamie put his mouth next to my ear barely breathing thirty feet ahead to the right in the clearing see them once i saw them i could hear as well wolves a small pack eight or ten animals perhaps no howling not these the kill lay in the shadow a blob of dark with an upthrust leg stickthin and vibrating under the impact of teeth yanking at the carcass there was only the occasional soft growl and yip as a cub was batted away from an adults morsel and the contented sounds of feeding crunching and the crack of a bone as my eyes grew more accustomed to the moonflecked scene i could pick out several shaggy forms stretched under the trees glutted and peaceful bits of grey fur shone here and there as those still at the carcass pushed and rooted for tender bits overlooked by the earlier diners a broad yelloweyed head thrust suddenly up into a blotch of light ears pricked the wolf made a soft urgent noise something between a whine and a growl and there was a sudden stillness under the trees below the saffron eyes seemed fixed on my own there was no fear in the animals posture nor curiosity only a wary acknowledgment jamies hand on my back warned me not to move though i felt no desire to run i could have stayed locked in the wolfs eyes for hours i think but she i was sure it was a female though i didnt know how i knew flicked her ears once as though dismissing me and bent once more to her meal we watched them for a few minutes peaceful in the scattered light at last jamie signaled that it was time to go with a touch on my arm he kept the hand on my arm to support me as we made our way back through the trees to the road it was the first time i had willingly allowed him to touch me since he had rescued me from fort william still charmed by the sight of the wolves we did not speak much but began to feel comfortable with each other again as we walked considering the stories he had told me i couldnt help but admire the job he had done without one word of direct explanation or apology he had given me the message he intended i gave you justice it said as i was taught it and i gave you mercy too so far as i could while i could not spare you pain and humiliation i make you a gift of my own pains and humiliations that yours might be easier to bear did you mind a lot i said abruptly being beaten i mean did you get over it easily he squeezed my hand lightly before letting it go mostly i forgot it as soon as it was over except for the last time that took awhile why ah well i was sixteen for one thing and a man grown i thought for another it hurt like hell you dont have to tell me about it if you dont want to i said sensing his hesitation is it a painful story not nearly as painful as the beating he said laughing no i dont mind tellin ye its a long story is all its a long way to bargrennan yet so it is well then you recall i told ye i spent a year at castle leoch when i was sixteen it was an agreement between colum and my father so id be familiar wi my mothers clan i fostered wi dougal for two years and then went to the castle for a year to learn manners and latin and such oh i wondered how youd come to be there aye that was the way of it i was big for my age or tall at least a good swordsman even then and a better horseman than most modest too i said not very cocky as hell and even faster with my tongue than i am now the mind boggles i said amused well it might sassenach i found i could make people laugh wi my remarks and i made them more frequent without carin much what i said or to whom i was cruel sometimes to the other lads not meanin it just not able to resist if i thought of something clever to say he looked up at the sky to gauge the time blacker still now that the moon had gone down i recognized orion floating near the horizon and was strangely comforted by the familiar sight so one day i went too far i was with a couple of the other lads going down a corridor when i saw mistress fitzgibbons at the other end she was carryin a big basket near as big as she was and bumping to and fro as she walked you know what she looks like now she wasna much smaller then he rubbed his nose embarrassed well i made a number of ungallant remarks concerning her appearance funny but most ungallant they amused my companions considerably i didna realize she could hear me as well i recalled the massive dame of castle leoch while i had never seen her other than goodhumored she did not appear to be the sort of person to be insulted with impunity what did she do nothing then i didna know shed heard until she got up at the hall gathering next day and told colum all about it oh dear i knew how highly colum regarded mrs fitz and didnt think he would take any irreverence directed at her lightly what happened the same thing that happened to laoghaire or almost he chuckled i got verra bold though and i stood up and said i chose to take my beating wi fists i was tryin to be verra calm and grownup about it all though my heart was going like a blacksmiths hammer and i felt a bit sick when i looked at anguss hands they looked like stones and big ones at that there were a few laughs from the folk gathered in the hall i wasna so tall then as i am now and i weighed less than half as much wee angus could ha torn my head off with one blow anyway colum and dougal both frowned at me though i thought they were really a bit pleased id had the nerve to ask it then colum said no if i was goin to behave like a child id to be punished like one he gave a nod and before i could move angus bent me across his knee turned up the edge of my kilt and blistered me with his strap in front of the entire hall oh jamie mmmphm youll have noticed angus is verra professional about his work he gave me fifteen strokes and to this day i could tell ye exactly where each one landed he shuddered reminiscently i had the marks for a week he reached out and broke a clump of pine needles from the nearest tree spreading them like a fan between thumb and fingers the scent of turpentine was suddenly sharper well i wasna allowed just to go quietly away and tend to my wounds either when angus finished wi me dougal took me by the scruff of the neck and marched me to the far end of the hall then i was made to come all the way back on my knees across the stones i had to kneel before colums seat and beg mrs fitzs pardon then colums then apologize to everyone in the hall for my rudeness and finally id to thank angus for the strapping i nearly choked over that but he was verra gracious about it he reached down and gave me a hand to get up then i was plunked down on a stool next to colum and bid to sit there til hall was ended he hunched his shoulders protectively that was the worst hour i ever had my face was on fire and so was my arse my knees were skinned and i couldna look anywhere but at my feet but the worst of it was that i had to piss something awful i almost died id ha burst before i wet myself in front of everyone on top of it all but it was a near thing i sweated right through my shirt i suppressed my urge to laugh couldnt you have told colum what was the matter i asked he knew perfectly well what was the matter so did everyone else in the hall the way i was squirming on that stool people were making wagers as to whether id last or not he shrugged colum would have let me go if id asked but well i got stubborn about it he grinned a bit sheepishly teeth white in a dark face thought id rather die than ask and nearly did when at last colum said i could go i made it out of the hall but only as far as the nearest door threw myself behind the wall and spurted streams i thought id never stop so he spread his hands deprecatingly dropping the clump of pine needles now you know the worst thing that ever happened to me i couldnt help it i laughed until i had to sit down at the side of the road jamie waited patiently for a minute then sank down on his knees what are you laughing for he demanded it wasna funny at all but he was smiling himself i shook my head still laughing no it isnt its an awful story its just i can see you sitting there being stubborn about it with your jaw clenched and steam coming out of your ears jamie snorted but laughed a little too aye its no verra easy to be sixteen is it so you did help that girl laoghaire because you felt sorry for her i said when i had recovered my composure you knew what it was like he was surprised aye i said so its a lot easier to get punched in the face at threeandtwenty than to have your bum strapped in public at sixteen bruised pride hurts worse than anything and it bruises easy then i wondered id never seen anyone grin in anticipation of being punched in the mouth couldna very well do it afterward mmh i nodded agreement i thought i said then stopped in embarrassment ye thought what oh about me and laoghaire ye mean he said divining my thought you and alec and everyone else including laoghaire id have done the same if shed been plain he nudged me in the ribs though i dinna expect youll believe that well i did see you together that day in the alcove i defended myself and somebody certainly taught you how to kiss jamie shuffled his feet in the dust embarrassed he ducked his head shyly well now sassenach im no better than most men sometimes i try but i dinna always manage ye know that bit in st paul where he says tis better to marry than burn well i was burnin quite badly there i laughed again feeling lighthearted as a sixteenyearold myself so you married me i teased to avoid the occasion of sin aye thats what marriage is good for it makes a sacrament out of things yed otherwise have to confess i collapsed again oh jamie i do love you this time it was his turn to laugh he doubled over then sat down at the roadside fizzing with mirth he slowly fell over backward and lay in the long grass wheezing and choking what on earth is the matter with you i demanded staring at him at long last he sat up wiping his streaming eyes he shook his head gasping murtagh was right about women sassenach i risked my life for ye committing theft arson assault and murder into the bargain in return for which ye call me names insult my manhood kick me in the ballocks and claw my face then i beat you half to death and tell ye all the most humiliating things have ever happened to me and you say ye love me he laid his head on his knees and laughed some more finally he rose and held out a hand to me wiping his eyes with the other youre no verra sensible sassenach but i like ye fine lets go it was getting late or early depending on your viewpoint and it was necessary to ride if we were to make bargrennan by dawn i was enough recovered by this time to bear sitting though the effects were still noticeable we rode in a companionable silence for some way left to my own thoughts i considered for the first time at leisure what would happen if and when i ever managed to find my way back to the circle of standing stones married to him by coercion and dependent on him from necessity i had undeniably grown very fond of jamie more to the point perhaps were his feelings about me linked at first by circumstance then by friendship and finally by a startlingly deep bodily passion still he had never made even a casual statement to me about his feelings and yet he had risked his life for me that much he might do for the sake of his marriage vow he would he said protect me to the last drop of his blood and i believed he meant it i was more touched by the events of the last twentyfour hours when he had suddenly admitted me to his emotions and his personal life warts and all if he felt as much for me as i thought perhaps he did what would he feel if i suddenly disappeared the remnants of physical discomfort receded as i grappled with these uncomfortable thoughts we were within three miles of bargrennan when jamie suddenly broke the silence i havena told you how my father died he said abruptly dougal said he had a stroke an apoplexy i mean i said startled i supposed that jamie alone with his thoughts as well had found them dwelling on his father as a result of our earlier conversation but i could not imagine what led him to this particular subject thats right but it he he paused considering his words then shrugged abandoning carefulness he drew a deep breath and let it out you should know about it its to do with things the road here was wide enough to ride easily abreast provided only that we kept a sharp eye out for protruding rocks my excuse to dougal about my horse had not been chosen at random it was at the fort jamie said picking his way around a bad patch where we were yesterday where randall and his men took me from lallybroch where they flogged me two days after the first time randall summoned me to his office two soldiers came for me and took me from the cells up to his room the same where i found you its how i knew where to go just outside we met my father in the courtyard hed found out where theyd taken me and come to see if he could get me out some way or at least to see for himself that i was all right jamie kicked a heel gently into his horses ribs urging it on with a soft click of his tongue there was no trace of daylight yet but the look of the night had changed dawn could be no more than an hour away i hadna realized until i saw him just how alone id felt there or how scairt the soldiers would not give us any time alone together but at least they let me greet him he swallowed and went on i told him i was sorry about jenny i meant and the whole sorry mess he told me to hush though and hugged me tight to him he asked me was i hurt badly he knew about the flogging and i said id be all right the soldiers said i must go then so he squeezed my arms tight and told me to remember to pray he said he would stand by me no matter what happened and i must just keep my head up and try not to worrit myself he kissed my cheek and the soldiers took me away that was the last time i ever saw him his voice was steady but a little thick my own throat felt tight and i would have touched him if i could but the road narrowed through a small glen and i was forced to fall back behind him for a moment by the time i came alongside again he had composed himself so he said taking a deep breath i went in to see captain randall he sent the soldiers out so we were alone and offered me a stool he said my father had offered security for my bond to have me released but that my charge was a serious one and i could not be bonded without a written clearance signed by the duke of argyll whose boundaries we were under i reckoned that was where my father was headed then to see argyll in the meantime randall went on there was the matter of this second flogging i was sentenced to he stopped a minute as though uncertain how to go on he was strange in his manner i thought verra cordial but with something under it i didna understand he kept watching me as though he expected me to do something though i was just sitting still he halfapologized to me saying he was sorry that our relations had been so difficult to the present and that he wished the circumstances had been different and so on jamie shook his head i couldna imagine what he was talking about two days earlier hed been trying his best to beat me to death when he finally got down to it though he was blunt enough what did he want then i asked jamie glanced at me then away the dark hid his features but i thought he seemed embarrassed me he said baldly i started so violently that the horse tossed its head and whickered reproachfully jamie shrugged again he was quite plain about it if i would ah make him free of my body hed cancel the second flogging if i would not then id wish id never been born he said i felt quite sick i was already wishing something of the sort he said with a glint of humor my belly felt as though id swallowed broken glass and if i hadna been sitting my knees would have knocked together but what my voice was hoarse and i cleared my throat and started over but what did you do he sighed well ill no lie to ye sassenach i considered it the first stripes were still so raw on my back i could scarce bear a shirt and i felt giddy whenever i stood up the thought of going through that again being bound and helpless waiting for the next lash he shuddered involuntarily id no real idea he said wryly but i rather thought being buggered would be at least a bit less painful men have died under the lash sometimes sassenach and from the look on his face i thought he meant me to be one of them were that my choice he sighed again but well i could still feel my fathers kiss on my cheek and thought of what hed say and well i couldna do it thats all i did not stop to think what my death might mean to my father he snorted as though finding something faintly amusing then too i thought the mans already raped my sister damned if hell have me too i didnt find this amusing i was seeing jack randall again in a new and revolting light jamie rubbed the back of his neck then dropped his hand to the pommel so i took what little courage i had left by then and said no i said it loud too and added whatever filthy names i could think of to call him all at the top of my lungs he grimaced i was afraid id change my mind if i thought about it i wanted to make sure there was no chance of going back though i dinna suppose he added thoughtfully that theres any really tactful way to refuse an offer like that no i agreed dryly i dont suppose hed have been pleased no matter what you said he wasnt he backhanded me across the mouth to shut me up i fell down i was still a bit weak and he stood over me just staring down at me id better sense than to try and get up so i just lay there until he called the soldiers to take me back to my cell he shook his head he didna change expression at all just said as i left ill see you on friday as though we had an appointment to discuss business or somesuch the soldiers had not returned jamie to the cell he had shared with three other prisoners instead he was put into a small room by himself to await fridays reckoning with no distractions save the daily visit of the garrisons physician who came to dress his back he wasna much of a doctor jamie said but he was kindly enough the second day he came along wi the goose grease and charcoal he brought me a small bible that belonged to a prisoner whod died said he understood i was a papist and whether i found the word of god any comfort or not at least i could compare my troubles with jobs he laughed oddly enough it was some comfort our lord had to put up wi being scourged too and i could reflect that at least i wasna going to be hauled out and crucified afterward on the other hand he said judiciously our lord wasna forced to listen to indecent proposals from pontius pilate either jamie had kept the small bible he rummaged in his saddlebag and handed it across now for me to look at it was a worn leathercovered volume about five inches long printed on paper so flimsy the print showed through from one side of each page to the other on the flyleaf was written alexander william roderick macgregor the ink was faded and blurred and the covers warped as though the book had gotten wet on more than one occasion i turned the little book over curiously small as it was it must have cost something in effort to keep it by him through the travels and adventures of the last four years ive never seen you read it i handed it back no thats not why i keep it he said he tucked it away stroking the edge of the worn cover with a thumb as he did so he patted the saddlebag absently theres a debt owing to alex macgregor i mean to collect it sometime anyway he continued returning to his story friday came at last and i dont know whether i was glad or sorry to see it the waiting and the fear were almost worse than i thought the pain would be when it came though he made that odd halfshrugging gesture of his easing the shirt across his back well youve seen the marks you know what it was like only because dougal told me he said he was there jamie nodded aye he was there and my father as well though i didna know it at the time id no mind for anything much beyond my own problems then oh i said slowly and your father mmm thats when it happened some of the men there told me after that they thought i was dead halfway through and i reckon my father thought so too he hesitated and his voice was thick when he resumed when i fell dougal told me my father made a small sound and put his hand to his head then he dropped like a rock and did not get up again the birds were moving in the heather trilling and calling from the stilldark leaves of the trees jamies head was bowed face still invisible i did not know he was dead he said softly they didna tell me until a month later when they thought i was strong enough to bear it so i did not bury him as his son should have done and i have never seen his grave because i am afraid to go home jamie i said oh jamie dear after what seemed a long silence i said but you dont you cant feel responsible jamie there was nothing you could have done or done differently no he said no maybe not though i wonder would it still have happened had i chosen the other way but to know that does not much help the way i feel and i feel as though i had done him to death with my own hands jamie i said again and stopped helpless he rode silently for a bit then straightened up and squared his shoulders once more ive not told anyone about it he said abruptly but i thought that now ye should know about randall i mean youve a right to know what it is that lies between him and me what it is that lies between him and me the life of a good man the honor of a girl and an indecent lust that found its vent in blood and fear and i supposed with a lurch of the stomach that there was now one more item weighting the scales me for the first time i began to realize what jamie had felt crouching in the window of randalls room with an empty gun in his hand and i began to forgive him for what he had done to me as though reading my mind he said not looking at me do you know i mean can ye understand maybe why i thought it needful to beat you i waited a moment before answering i understood all right but that was not quite all there was to it i understand i said and so far as that goes i forgive you what i cant forgive i said my voice rising slightly in spite of myself is that you enjoyed it he bent forward in the saddle clasping the pommel and laughed for a long time he reveled in the release of tension before finally tossing his head back and turning to me the sky was noticeably lighter now and i could see his face lined with exhaustion strain and mirth the scratches down his cheek were black in the dim light enjoyed it sassenach he said gasping you dont know just how much i enjoyed it you were so god you looked lovely i was so angry and you fought me so fierce i hated to hurt you but i wanted to do it at the same time jesus he said breaking off and wiping his nose yes yes i did enjoy it though come to that he said you might give me some credit for exercising restraint i was getting rather angry again i could feel my cheeks flushing hotly against the cool dawn air restraint was it i was under the impression that what you were exercising was your good left arm you almost crippled me you arrogant scottish bastard did i want to cripple ye sassenach youd know it he answered dryly i meant afterward i slept on the floor if ye recall i eyed him narrowly breathing through my nose oh so that was restraint was it well i didna think it right to roger you in that state however fierce i wanted to and i did want to he added laughing again terrible strain on my natural instincts roger me i said diverted by the expression i would hardly call it lovemaking under the circumstances would you whatever you might call it i said evenly its a good thing you didnt try it or youd now be missing a few valued bits of your anatomy that thought occurred to me and if you think you deserve applause for nobly refraining from committing rape on top of assault i choked on my choler we rode a halfmile or so in silence then he heaved a sigh i can see i should not have started this conversation what i was tryin to do was to work up to asking ye would you allow me to share your bed again once we get to bargrennan he paused shyly its a bit cold on the floor i rode for a good five minutes before answering when i had decided what to say i reined in turning across the road so as to force jamie to stop as well bargrennan was in sight rooftops just visible in the dawning light i urged my horse parallel with the other so that i was no more than a foot away from jamie i looked him in the eye for a minute before speaking will you do me the honor of sharing my bed o lord and master i asked politely obviously suspecting something he considered a moment then nodded just as formally i will thank you he was raising the reins to go when i stopped him theres just one more thing master i said still polite aye i whipped my hand from the concealed pocket in my skirt and the dawn light struck sparks from the blade of the dagger pressed against his chest if i said through my teeth you ever raise a hand to me again james fraser ill cut out your heart and fry it for breakfast there was a long silence broken only by the shiftings and creakings of horses and harness then he held out his hand palm up give it to me when i hesitated he said impatiently im no going to use it on ye give it to me he held the dirk by the blade upright so that the rising sun caught the moonstone in the hilt and made it glow holding the dagger like a crucifix he recited something in gaelic i recognized it from the oathtaking ceremony in colums hall but he followed it with the english translation for my benefit i swear on the cross of my lord jesus and by the holy iron which i hold that i give ye my fealty and pledge ye my loyalty if ever my hand is raised against you in rebellion or in anger then i ask that this holy iron may pierce my heart he kissed the dirk at the juncture of haft and tang and handed it back to me i dont make idle threats sassenach he said raising one brow and i dont take frivolous vows now can we go to bed chapter return to leoch dougal was waiting for us at the sign of the red boar impatiently pacing to and fro outside made it did ye he asked watching with approval as i dismounted without assistance staggering only slightly gallant lass ten miles without a whimper get up to your bed then yeve earned it jamie and i will stable the horses he patted me very gently on the rump in dismissal i was only too glad to follow his suggestion and was asleep almost before my head touched the pillow i didnt stir when jamie crawled in beside me but woke suddenly in the late afternoon convinced that there was something important i had forgotten horrocks i exclaimed suddenly sitting bolt upright in bed hah jamie startled out of a sound sleep shot sideways out of bed ending on the floor in a crouch hand on the dirk he had left on top of his piled clothes what he demanded staring wildly around the room what is it i stifled a giggle at the sight of him crouched naked on the floor red hair standing on end like quills you look like a fretful porpentine i said he gave me a dirty look and rose to his feet replacing the dirk on the stool that held his clothes you couldna wait til i woke to tell me that he inquired you thought it would make more impression if ye woke me out of a sound sleep by shouting hedgehog in my ear not hedgehog i explained horrocks i remembered all at once that id forgotten to ask you about him did you find him he sat down on the bed and sank his head in his hands he rubbed his face vigorously as though to restore circulation oh aye he said through the muffling fingers aye i found him i could tell from the tone of voice that the deserters information had not been good would he not tell you anything after all i asked sympathetically that had always been a possibility though jamie had gone prepared to part with not only his own money and some provided by dougal and colum but even his fathers ring if necessary jamie lay back on the bed beside me staring up at the ceiling no he said no he told me all right and at a reasonable price i rolled up onto an elbow in order to look down at his face well then i demanded who did shoot the sergeantmajor he looked up at me and smiled a trifle grimly randall he said and shut his eyes randall i said blankly but why i dont know he said eyes still shut i could guess perhaps but it doesna much matter damnall chance of proving it i had to agree that this was true i sank back on the bed beside him and stared up at the black oak beams of the low ceiling what can you do then i asked go to france or perhaps a bright thought occurred to me perhaps to america you could likely do well in the new world across the ocean a brief shudder ran through him no no i couldna do that well what then i demanded turning my head to look at him he opened one eye enough to give me a jaundiced look id thought for a start that i might get another hours sleep he said but apparently not resigned he pulled himself up in bed leaning against the wall i had been too tired to pull the bedclothes off before retiring and there was a suspicious black spot on the quilt near his knee i kept a wary eye on it as he talked youre right he agreed we could go to france i started having momentarily forgotten that whatever he decided to do i was now included in the decision but there isna that much for me there he said idly scratching his thigh only soldiering and thats no life for you or to rome to join king jamess court that might be managed ive some fraser uncles and cousins with a foot in that camp who would help me ive no great taste for politics and less for princes but aye its a possibility id rather try first to clear myself in scotland though if i did at the worst i might end up as a small crofter in the fraser lands at best i might be able to go back to lallybroch his face clouded and i knew he was thinking of his sister for myself he said softly i wouldna go but it isnt only me anymore he looked down at me and smiled his hand gently smoothing my hair i forget sometimes that theres you now sassenach he said i felt extraordinarily uncomfortable i felt like a traitor in fact here he was making plans that would affect his entire life taking my comfort and safety into account when i had been doing my best to abandon him completely dragging him into substantial danger in the process i had meant none of it but the fact remained even now i was thinking that i should try to talk him out of going to france as that would carry me farther away from my own goal the stone circle is there any way to stay in scotland though i asked looking away from him i thought the black spot on the quilt had moved but i wasnt sure i fixed my eyes on it staring hard jamies hand traveled under my hair and began idly to fondle my neck aye he said thoughtfully there may be thats why dougal waited up for me hes had some news really what sort i turned my head to look up at him again the movement brought my ear within reach of his fingers and he began to stroke lightly around it making me want to arch my neck and purr like a cat i repressed the impulse though in favor of finding out what he meant to do a messenger from colum he said he didna think to find us here but he passed dougal on the road by accident dougals to return at once to leoch and leave ned gowan to manage the rest of the rents dougals suggested we should go with him back to leoch it wasnt france but it wasnt a lot better why theres a visitor expected shortly an english noble thats had dealings wi colum before hes a powerful man and it might be he could be persuaded to do something for me ive not been tried or condemned on the charge of murder he might be able to have it dismissed or arrange to have me pardoned he grinned wryly it goes a bit against the grain to be pardoned for something ive not done but its better than being hanged yes thats true the spot was moving i squinted trying to focus on it which english noble is it the duke of sandringham i jerked upright with an exclamation what is it sassenach jamie asked alarmed i pointed a trembling finger at the black spot which was now proceeding up his leg at a slow but determined pace whats that i said he glanced at it and casually flicked it off with a fingernail oh that its only a bedbug sassenach nothing to he was interrupted by my abrupt exit at the word bedbug i had shot out from under the covers and stood pressed against the wall as far away as possible from the teeming nest of vermin i now envisioned as our bed jamie eyed me appreciatively fretful porpentine was it he asked he tilted his head examining me inquisitively mmm he said running a hand over his head to smooth down his own hair fretful at least youre a fuzzy wee thing when ye wake to be sure he rolled over toward me reaching out a hand come here my wee milkweed well not leave before sunset if were not going to sleep in the end we did sleep a bit more peacefully entangled on the floor atop a hard but bugless bed composed of my cloak and jamies kilt it was a good thing that we had slept while we had the chance anxious to reach castle leoch before the duke of sandringham dougal kept to a fast pace and a grueling schedule traveling without the wagons we made much better time despite bad roads dougal pushed us though stopping only for the briefest of rests by the time we rode once more through the gates of leoch we were nearly as bedraggled as the first time we had arrived there and certainly as tired i slid off my horse in the courtyard then had to catch the stirrup to keep from falling jamie caught my elbow then realizing that i couldnt stand swung me up into his arms he carried me through the archway leaving the horses to the grooms and stableboys are ye hungry sassenach he asked pausing in the corridor the kitchens lay in one direction the stairs to the bedchambers in the other i groaned struggling to keep my eyes open i was hungry but knew i would end up facedown in the soup if i tried to eat before sleeping there was a stir to one side and i groggily opened my eyes to see the massive form of mrs fitzgibbons looming disbelievingly alongside why whats the matter wi the poor child she demanded of jamie has she had an accident o some sort no its only shes married me he said though if ye care to call it an accident ye may he moved to one side to push through what proved to be an increasing throng of kitchenmaids grooms cooks gardeners menatarms and assorted castle inhabitants all inquisitively drawn to the scene by mrs fitzs loud questions making up his mind jamie pressed to the right toward the stairs making disjointed explanations to the hail of questions from every side blinking owlishly against his chest i could do no more than nod to the surrounding welcomers though most of the faces seemed friendly as well as curious as we came around a corner of the hallway i saw one face that seemed a good deal friendlier than the rest it was the girl laoghaire face shining and radiant as she heard jamies voice her eyes grew wide and the rosebud mouth dropped unbecomingly open though as she saw what he carried there was no time for her to ask questions though before the stir and bustle around us halted abruptly jamie stopped too raising my head i saw colum whose startled face was now on a level with mine what he began theyre married said mrs fitz beaming how sweet you can give them your blessing sir while i get a room ready she turned and made off for the stairs leaving a substantial gap in the crowd through which i could see the now pastywhite face of the girl laoghaire colum and jamie were both talking together questions and explanations colliding in midair i was beginning to wake up though it would have been overstating matters to say i was entirely myself well colum was saying not altogether approvingly if youre married youre married ill have to talk to dougal and ned gowan therell be legal matters to attend to there are a few things youre entitled to when ye wed by the terms of your mothers dower contract i felt jamie straighten slightly since ye mention it he said casually i believe thats true and one of the things im entitled to is a share of the quarterly rents from the mackenzie lands dougals brought back what hed collected so far perhaps youll tell him to leave aside my share when he does the reckoning now if yell excuse me uncle my wife is tired and hoisting me into a more solid position he turned to the stairs i staggered across the room still wobblylegged and collapsed gratefully on the huge tester bed our newly married status apparently entitled us to it was soft inviting and thanks to the evervigilant mrs fitz clean i wondered whether it was worth the effort to get up and wash my face before succumbing to the urge to sleep i had just about decided that i might get up for gabriels trump but not much else when i saw that jamie who had not only washed face and hands but combed his hair to boot was headed toward the door arent you going to sleep i called i thought he must be at least as tired as i if less saddle sore in a bit sassenach ive a small errand to do first he went out leaving me staring at the oaken door with a very unpleasant sensation in the pit of my stomach i was remembering the look of gay anticipation on laoghaires face as she came around the corner hearing jamies voice and the look of angry shock that replaced it when she saw me cradled in his arms i remembered the momentary tightening of his joints as he saw her and wished most fervently that i had been able to see his face at that moment i thought it likely he had gone now unrested but washed and combed to find the girl and break the news of his marriage had i seen his face i would at least have some idea what he meant to say to her absorbed in the events of the last month i had forgotten the girl entirely and what she might mean to jamie or he to her granted i had thought of her when the question of our abrupt marriage first occurred and jamie then had given no sign that she constituted an impediment so far as he was concerned but of course if her father would not allow her to marry an outlaw and if jamie needed a wife in order to collect his share of the mackenzie rents well one wife would do as well as another in that case and doubtless he would take what he could get i thought i knew jamie well enough now to see that practicality with him went deep as it must with a man who had spent the last few years of his life on the run he would not i thought be swayed in his decisions by sentiment or the attraction of roseleaf cheeks and hair like liquid gold but that didnt mean that neither sentiment nor attraction existed there was after all the little scene i had witnessed in the alcove jamie holding the girl on his knee and kissing her ardently ive held women in my arms before his voice came back to me and theyve made my heart pound and my breath come short i found that my hands were clenched making bunched ridges in the green and yellow quilt i released it and wiped my hands over my skirt realizing in the process just how filthy they were grimed with the dirt of two days of holding reins with no respite in between for washing i rose and went to the basin forgetting my tiredness i found a bit to my surprise that i strongly disliked the memory of jamie kissing laoghaire i remembered what he had said about that too tis better to marry than burn and i was burning badly then i burned a bit myself flushing strongly as i remembered the effect of jamies kisses on my own lips burning indeed i splashed water on my face spluttering trying to dissipate the feeling i had no claim on jamies affections i reminded myself firmly i had married him from necessity and he had married me for his own reasons one of them being the frankly stated desire to alter his virginal state another reason apparently being that he needed a wife in order to collect his income and could not induce a girl of his own kind to marry him a reason much less flattering than the first if no more lofty quite awake by now i slowly changed from my stained traveling garments into a fresh shift provided as was the basin and ewer by mrs fitzs minions how she had managed to make accommodation for two newlyweds in the time between jamies abrupt announcement to colum and the time we had mounted the stairs was one of the mysteries of the ages mrs fitz i reflected would have done quite well in charge of the waldorfastoria or the london ritz such reflections made me suddenly more lonely for my own world than i had been in many days what am i doing here i asked myself for the thousandth time here in this strange place unreachable distances from everything familiar from home and husband and friends adrift and alone among what amounted to savages i had begun to feel safe and even intermittently happy during the last weeks with jamie but now i realized that the happiness was likely an illusion even if the safety was not i had no doubt that he would abide by what he conceived to be his responsibilities and continue to protect me from any harm that threatened but here returned from the dreamlike isolation of our days among the wild hills and dusty roads the filthy inns and fragrant haystacks he must surely feel the pull of his old associations as i felt mine we had grown very close in the month of our marriage but i had felt that closeness crack under the strains of the last few days and thought it might now shatter completely back among the practical realities of life at castle leoch i leaned my head against the stone of the window casement looking out across the courtyard alec mcmahon and two of his stable lads were visible at the far side rubbing down the horses we had ridden in the beasts fed and watered adequately for the first time in two days exuded contentment as willing hands curried the glossy sides and cleansed the dirt from hock and fetlock with twists of straw a stableboy led away my fat little thistle who followed him happily toward the wellearned rest of her stable and with her i thought went my hopes of any imminent escape and return to my own place oh frank i closed my eyes letting a tear slide down the side of my nose i opened my eyes wide on the courtyard then blinked and shut them tight trying frantically to recall franks features just for a moment when i closed my eyes i had seen not my beloved husband but his ancestor jack randall full lips curved in a mocking smile and shying mentally from that image my mind had summoned at once a picture of jamie face set in fear and anger as i had seen him in the window of randalls private office try as i might i could not bring back franks remembered image with any certainty i felt suddenly quite cold with panic and clasped my hands about my elbows and what if i had succeeded in escaping and finding my way back to the circle of stone i thought what then jamie would i hoped soon find solace with laoghaire perhaps i had worried before about his reaction to finding me gone but aside from that hasty moment of regret on the edge of the burn it had not before occurred to me to wonder how i would feel to part with him i fiddled idly with the ribbon drawstring that gathered the neck of my shift tying and untying it if i meant to leave as i did i was doing neither of us a favor by allowing the bond between us to strengthen any further i should not allow him to fall in love with me if he meant to do any such thing i thought remembering once more laoghaire and the conversation with colum if he had married me so coldbloodedly as it seemed perhaps his emotions were safer than mine between fatigue hunger disappointment and uncertainty i had by this time succeeded in reducing myself to such a state of confused misery that i could neither sleep or sit still instead i roamed unhappily about the room picking up objects and putting them down at random the draft from the opening door upset the delicate equilibrium of the comb i had been balancing on its end heralding jamies return he looked faintly flushed and oddly excited oh youre awake he said obviously surprised and disconcerted to find me so yes i said unkindly were you hoping id be asleep so you could go back to her his brows drew together for a moment then raised in inquiry her to laoghaire ye mean hearing her name spoken in that casual highland lilt lheer suddenly made me irrationally angry oh so you have been with her i snapped jamie looked puzzled and wary and slightly annoyed aye he said i met her by the stair as i went out are ye well sassenach ye look a bit fashed all in all he eyed me appraisingly i picked up the looking glass and found that my hair was standing out in a bushy mane round my head and there were dark circles under my eyes i put it down again with a thump no im perfectly all right i said with an effort at controlling myself and how is laoghaire i asked assuming casualness oh quite bonny he said he leaned back against the door arms crossed watching me speculatively a bit surprised to hear we were married i reckon bonny i said and took a deep breath i looked up to find him grinning at me youd not worrit yourself over the lassie would ye now sassenach he asked shrewdly shes naught to you or me he added oh no she wouldnt or couldnt marry you you had to have someone so you took me when the chance offered i dont blame you for that not much i didnt but i he crossed the room in two steps and took me by the hands interrupting me he put a finger under my chin and forced my gaze up claire he said evenly i shall tell ye in my own time why ive wed ye or i wont i asked honesty of you and ive given ye the same and i give it to you now the girl has no claim on me beyond that of courtesy he squeezed my chin lightly but that claim she has and ill honor it he released my chin and chucked me softly under it dye hear me sassenach oh i hear i jerked free rubbing my chin resentfully and im sure youll be very courteous to her but next time draw the drapes of the alcove i dont want to see it the coppery brows shot up and his face reddened slightly are ye suggesting ive played ye false he said unbelievingly weve been back to the castle less than an hour im covered wi the sweat and dust of two days in the saddle and so tired my knees wabble and yet ye think ive gone straight out to seduce a maid of sixteen he shook his head looking stunned i canna tell whether ye mean to compliment my virility sassenach or insult my morals but i dinna care much for either suggestion murtagh told me women were unreasonable but jesus god he ran a large hand through his hair making the short ends stick up wildly of course i dont mean i think youve been seducing her i said struggling to inject an air of calmness into my tone all i mean it occurred to me that frank had handled this kind of thing much more gracefully than i was managing to do and yet i had been angry then too likely there was no good way to suggest such a possibility to ones mate i simply mean that that i realize that you married me for your own reasons and those reasons are your own business i added hastily and that i have no claim at all on you youre at perfect liberty to behave as you wish if you if theres an attraction elsewhere i mean i wont stand in your way i finished lamely the blood was hot in my cheeks and i could feel my ears burning looking up i found that jamies ears were burning as well visibly and so was the rest of him from the neck up even his eyes bloodshot from lack of sleep seemed to be flaming slightly no claim on me he exclaimed and what dye think a wedding vow is lassie just words in a church he brought one big fist down on the chest with a crash that shook the porcelain ewer no claim he muttered as though to himself at liberty to behave as i wish and youll not stand in my way he bent to pull off his boots then picked them up and threw them one after the other as hard as he could at the wall i winced as each one thudded off the stones and bounced to the floor he yanked off his plaid and tossed it heedlessly behind him then he started toward me glaring so youve no claim on me sassenach youll free me to take my pleasure where i like is that it well is it he demanded er well yes i said taking a step backward despite myself thats what i meant he grabbed my arms and i found the combustion had spread to his hands as well his callused palms were so hot on my skin that i jerked involuntarily well if youve no claim on me sassenach he said ive one on you come here he took my face in his hands and set his mouth on mine there was nothing either gentle or undemanding about that kiss and i fought against it trying to pull back from him he bent and scooped me up with an arm under my knees ignoring my attempts to get down i hadnt realized just how bloody strong he really was let go of me i said what do you think youre doing well i should ha thought that was reasonably clear sassenach he said through his teeth he lowered his head the clear gaze piercing me like a hot iron though if ye want telling he said i mean to take ye to bed now and keep ye there until youve learned just what claim i have on you and he kissed me again deliberately hard cutting off my protest i dont want to sleep with you i said when at last he freed my mouth i dinna intend to sleep sassenach he replied evenly not just yet he reached the bed and set me carefully on the rosepatterned quilt you know bloody well what i mean i rolled meaning to escape from the other side but was stopped by a solid grip on my shoulder that flipped me back to face him i dont want to make love with you either blue eyes blazed down at me from close range and my breath came thick in my throat i didna ask your preferences in the matter sassenach he answered voice dangerously low you are my wife as ive told ye often enough if ye didna wish to wed me still ye chose to and if ye didna happen to notice at the time your part of the proceedings included the word obey youre my wife and if i want ye woman then ill have you and be damned to ye his voice rose throughout until he was near shouting i rose to my knees fists balled at my sides and shouted back at him the contained misery of the last hour had reached explosion point and i let him have it pointblank i will be damned if ill have you you bullying swine you think you can order me to your bed use me like a whore when you feel like it well you cant you fucking bastard do that and youre no better than your precious captain randall he glared at me for a moment then stood abruptly aside leave then he said jerking his head toward the door if thats what ye think of me go ill not hinder ye i hesitated for a moment watching him his jaw was clenched with anger and he was looming over me like the colossus of rhodes his temper this time was under tight rein though he was as angry now as he had been by the roadside near doonesbury but he meant it if i chose to leave he wouldnt stop me i lifted my chin my own jaw clenched as tightly as his no i said no i dont run away from things and im not afraid of you his gaze fastened on my throat where my pulse was going at a frantic rate aye i see he said he stared down at me and his face gradually relaxed into a look of grudging acquiescence he sat down gingerly on the bed keeping a good distance between us and i sat back warily he breathed deeply several times before speaking his face fading a bit toward its natural ruddy bronze i dont run either sassenach he said gruffly now then what does fucking mean my surprise must have shown plainly for he said irritably if ye must call me names thats one thing but i dinna care to be called things i cant answer i know its a damn filthy word from the way ye said it but what does it mean taken off guard i laughed a little shakily it it means what you were about to do to me one brow lifted and he looked sourly amused oh swiving then i was right it is a damn filthy word and whats a sadist ye called me that the other day i suppressed the urge to laugh its er its a person who who er gets sexual pleasure from hurting someone my face was crimsoning but i couldnt stop the corners of my mouth from turning up slightly jamie snorted briefly well ye dinna flatter me overmuch he said but i canna fault your observations he took a deep breath and leaned back unclenching his hands he stretched his fingers deliberately then laid his hands flat on his knees and looked directly at me what is it then why are ye doing this the girl ive told ye the plain truth there but its not a matter for proof its a question of whether ye believe me or no do ye believe me yes i believe you i admitted grudgingly but thats not it or not all of it i added in an attempt at honesty its i think its finding that you married me for the money youd get i looked down tracing the pattern of the quilt with my finger i know ive no right to complain i married you for selfish reasons too but i bit my lip and swallowed to steady my voice but i have a small bit of pride too you know i stole a glance at him and found him staring at me with an expression of complete dumbfoundedness money he said blankly yes money i blazed angered at his pretense of ignorance when we came back you couldnt wait to tell colum you were married and collect your share of the mackenzie rents he stared at me for a moment longer mouth opening gradually as though to say something instead he began to shake his head slowly back and forth and then began to laugh he threw his head back and roared in fact then sank his head between his hands still laughing hysterically i flung myself back on the pillows in indignation funny was it still shaking his head and wheezing intermittently he stood up and set hands to the buckle of his belt i flinched involuntarily as he did so and he saw it face still flushed with a mixture of anger and laughter he looked down at me in total exasperation no he said dryly i dinna mean to beat you i gave ye my word id not do so again though i didna think id regret it quite so soon he laid the belt aside groping in the sporran attached to it my share of the mackenzie rents comes to about twenty pounds a quarter sassenach he said digging through the oddments inside the badgerskin and thats scots not sterling about the price of half a cow thats thats all i said stupidly but thats all he confirmed and all i ever will have from the mackenzies yell have noticed dougals a thrifty man and colums twice as tightfisted wi his coin but even the princely sum of twenty pound a quarter is hardly worth marrying to get i should think he added sarcastically eyeing me i wouldna have asked for it straight away at that he added bringing out a small paperwrapped parcel but there was something i wanted to buy with it thats where my errand took me meeting laoghaire was an accident and what did you want to buy so much i asked suspiciously he sighed and hesitated for a moment then tossed the small package lightly into my lap a wedding ring sassenach he said i got it from ewen the armorer he makes such things in his own time oh i said in a small voice go ahead he said a moment later open it its yours the outlines of the little package blurred under my fingers i blinked and sniffed but made no move to open it im sorry i said well so ye should be sassenach he said but his voice was no longer angry reaching he took the package from my lap and tore away the wrapping revealing a wide silver band decorated in the highland interlace style a small and delicate jacobean thistle bloom carved in the center of each link so much i saw and then my eyes blurred again i found a handkerchief thrust into my hand and did my best to stanch the flow with it its beautiful i said clearing my throat and dabbling at my eyes will ye wear it claire his voice was gentle now and his use of my name mostly reserved for occasions of formality or tenderness nearly made me break down again you needna do so he said looking at me seriously over his cupped palm the marriage contract between us is satisfied its legal youre protected safe from anything much save a warrant and even from that so long as youre at leoch if ye wish we may live apart if thats what ye were trying to say wi all yon rubbish about laoghaire you need have little more to do wi me if thats your honest choice he sat motionless waiting holding the tiny circlet near his heart so he was giving me the choice i had started out to give him forced on me by circumstance he would force himself on me no longer if i chose to reject him and there was the alternative of course to accept the ring and all that went with it the sun was setting the last rays of light shone through a blue glass flagon that stood on the table streaking the wall with a shaft of brilliant lapis i felt as fragile and as brilliant as the glass as though i would shatter with a touch and fall in glittering fragments to the floor if i had meant to spare either jamies emotions or my own it seemed i was very much too late i couldnt speak but held out my right hand to him fingers trembling the ring slipped cool and bright over my knuckle and rested snug at the base of my finger a good fit jamie held my hand a moment looking at it then suddenly pressed my knuckles hard against his mouth he raised his head and i saw his face for an instant fierce and urgent before he pulled me roughly onto his lap he held me hard against him then without speaking and i could feel the pulsebeat in his throat hammering like my own his hands went to my bare shoulders and he held me slightly away so that i was looking upward into his face his hands were large and very warm and i felt slightly dizzy i want ye claire he said sounding choked he paused a moment as though unsure what to say next i want ye so much i can scarcely breathe will he swallowed then cleared his throat will ye have me by now i had found my voice it squeaked and wobbled but it worked yes i said yes ill have you i think he began then stopped he fumbled loose the buckle of his kilt but then looked up at me bunching his hands at his sides he spoke with difficulty controlling something so powerful that his hands shook with the effort ill not i cant claire i canna be gentle about it i had time only to nod once in acknowledgment or permission before he bore me back before him his weight pinning me to the bed he did not pause to undress further i could smell the road dust in his shirt and taste the sun and sweat of travel on his skin he held me arms outstretched wrists pinioned one hand brushed the wall and i felt the tiny scrape of one wedding ring chiming against the stone one ring for each hand one silver one gold and the thin metal suddenly heavy as the bonds of matrimony as though the rings were tiny shackles fastening me spreadeagled to the bed stretched forever between two poles held in bondage like prometheus on his lonely rock divided love the vulture that tore at my heart he spread my thighs with his knee and sheathed himself to the root in a single thrust that made me gasp he made a sound that was almost a groan and gripped me tighter youre mine mo duinne he said softly pressing himself into my depths mine alone now and forever mine whether ye will it or no i pulled against his grip and sucked in my breath with a faint ah as he pressed even deeper aye i mean to use ye hard my sassenach he whispered i want to own you to possess you body and soul i struggled slightly and he pressed me down hammering me a solid inexorable pounding that reached my womb with each stroke i mean to make ye call me master sassenach his soft voice was a threat of revenge for the agonies of the last minutes i mean to make you mine i quivered and moaned then my flesh clutching in spasms at the invading battering presence the movement went on disregarding on and on for minutes striking me over and over with an impact on the edge between pleasure and pain i felt dissolved as though i existed only at the point of the assault being forced to the edge of some total surrender no i gasped stop please youre hurting me beads of sweat ran down his face and dropped on the pillow and on my breasts our flesh met now with the smack of a blow that was fast crossing the edge into pain my thighs were bruising with the repeated impact and my wrists felt as though they would break but his grip was inexorable aye beg me for mercy sassenach ye shallna have it though not yet his breath came hot and fast but he showed no signs of tiring my entire body convulsed legs rising to wrap around him seeking to contain the sensation i could feel the jolt of each stroke deep in my belly and cringed from it even as my hips rose traitorously to welcome it he felt my response and redoubled his assault pressing now on my shoulders to keep me pinned under him there was no beginning and no end to my response only a continuous shudder that rose to a peak with each thrust the hammering was a question repeated over and over in my flesh demanding my answer he pushed my legs flat again and bore me down past pain and into pure sensation over the edge of surrender yes i cried oh god jamie yes he gripped my hair and forced my head back to meet his eyes glowing with furious triumph aye sassenach he muttered answering my movements rather than my words ride ye i will his hands dropped to my breasts squeezing and stroking then slid down my sides his whole weight rested on me now as he cupped and raised me for still greater penetration i screamed then and he stopped my mouth with his not a kiss but another attack forcing my mouth open bruising my lips and rasping my face with bearded stubble he thrust harder and faster as though he would force my soul as he forced my body in body or soul somewhere he struck a spark and an answering fury of passion and need sprang from the ashes of surrender i arched upward to meet him blow for blow i bit his lip and tasted blood i felt his teeth then on my neck and dug my nails into his back i raked him from nape to buttocks spurring him to rear and scream in his turn we savaged each other in desperate need biting and clawing trying to draw blood trying each to pull the other into ourselves tearing each others flesh in the consuming desire to be one my cry mingled with his and we lost ourselves finally in each other in that last moment of dissolution and completion i returned only slowly to myself lying half on jamies breast sweated bodies still glued together thigh to thigh he breathed heavily eyes closed i could hear his heart under my ear beating with the preternaturally slow and powerful rhythm that follows climax he felt me wake and drew me close as though to preserve a moment longer the union we had reached in those last seconds of our perilous joining i curled beside him putting my arms around him he opened his eyes then and sighed the long mouth curling in a faint smile as his glance met mine i raised my brows in silent question oh aye sassenach he answered a bit ruefully i am your master and youre mine seems i canna possess your soul without losing my own he turned me on my side and curled his body around me the room was cooling in the evening breeze from the window and he reached to draw a quilt over us youre too quick by half lad i thought drowsily to myself frank never did find that out i fell asleep with his arms locked hard around me and his breathing warm in my ear i was lame and sore in every muscle when i woke next morning i shuffled to the privy closet then to the wash basin my innards felt like churned butter it felt as though i had been beaten with a blunt object i reflected then thought that that was very near the truth the blunt object in question was visible as i came back to bed looking now relatively harmless its possessor woke as i sat down next to him and examined me with something that looked very much like male smugness looks as though it was a hard ride sassenach he said lightly touching a blue bruise on my inner thigh a bit saddlesore are ye i narrowed my eyes and traced a deep bitemark on his shoulder with my finger you look a bit ragged around the edges yourself my lad ah weel he said in broad scots if ye bed wi a vixen ye must expect to get bit he reached up and grasped me behind the neck pulling me down to him come here to me vixen bite me some more oh no you dont i said pulling back i cant possibly im too sore james fraser was not a man to take no for an answer ill be verra gentle he wheedled dragging me inexorably under the quilt and he was gentle as only big men can be cradling me like a quails egg paying me court with a humble patience that i recognized as reparation and a gentle insistence that i knew was a continuation of the lesson so brutally begun the night before gentle he would be denied he would not he shook in my arms at his own finish shuddering with the effort not to move not to hurt me by thrusting letting the moment shatter him as it would afterward still joined he traced the fading bruises his fingers had left on my shoulders by the roadside two days before im sorry for those mo duinne he said gently kissing each one i was in a rare temper when i did it but its no excuse its shameful to hurt a woman in a rage or no ill not do it again i laughed a bit ironically youre apologizing for those what about the rest im a mass of bruises from head to toe och he drew back to look me over judiciously well now these ive apologized for touching my shoulder those slapping my rear lightly ye deserved and ill not say im sorry for it because im not as for these he said stroking my thigh ill not apologize for that either ye paid me full measure already he rubbed his shoulder grimacing ye drew blood in at least two places sassenach and my back stings like holy hell well bed with a vixen i said grinning you wont get an apology for that he laughed in response and pulled me on top of him i didna say i wanted an apology did i if i recall aright what i said was bite me again part four a whiff of brimstone chapter by the pricking of my thumbs the hubbub occasioned by our sudden arrival and the announcement of our marriage was overshadowed almost at once by an event of greater importance we were sitting at supper in the great hall the next day accepting the toasts and good wishes being offered in our honor buidheachas mo caraid jamie bowed gracefully to the latest toaster and sat down amid the increasingly sporadic applause the wooden bench shook under his weight and he closed his eyes briefly getting a bit much for you i whispered he had borne the brunt of the toasting matching each cup drained on our behalf while i had so far escaped with no more than token sips accompanied by bright smiles at the incomprehensible gaelic toasts he opened his eyes and looked down at me smiling himself am i drunk do ye mean nay i could drink this stuff all night you practically have i said peering at the array of empty wine bottles and stone alejars lined up on the board in front of us its getting rather late the candles on colums table burned low in their holders and the guttered wax glowed gold the light marking the mackenzie brothers with odd patches of shadow and glinting flesh as they leaned together talking in low voices they could have joined the company of carved gnomic heads that edged the huge fireplace and i wondered how many of those caricatured figures had in fact been drawn from the patronizing features of earlier mackenzie lairds perhaps by a carver with a sense of humor or a strong family connection jamie stretched slightly in his seat grimacing in mild discomfort on the other hand he said my bladders going to burst in another moment or two ill be back shortly he put his hands on the bench and hopped nimbly up and over it disappearing through the lower archway i turned my attention to my other side where geillis duncan sat demurely sipping at a silver cup of ale her husband arthur sat at the next table with colum as befitted the procurator fiscal of the district but geilie had insisted on sitting next to me saying that she had no wish to be wearied by hearing mantalk all through supper arthurs deepset eyes were halfclosed bluepouched and sunk with wine and fatigue he leaned heavily on his forearms face slack ignoring the conversation of the mackenzies next to him while the light threw the sharpcut features of the laird and his brother into a high relief it merely made arthur duncan look fat and ill your husband isnt looking very well i observed has his stomach trouble got worse the symptoms were rather puzzling not like ulcer i thought nor cancer not with that much flesh still on his bones perhaps just chronic gastritis as geilie insisted she cast the briefest of glances at her spouse before turning back to me with a shrug oh hes well enough she said no worse at any rate but what about your husband er what about him i replied cautiously she dug me familiarly in the ribs with a rather sharp elbow and i realized that there were a fair number of bottles at her end of the table as well well what dye think does he look as nice out of his sark as he does in it um i groped for an answer as she craned her neck toward the entryway and you claiming you didna care a bit for him cleverboots half the girls in the castle would like to tear your hair out by the roots id be careful what i ate if i were you what i eat i looked down in bafflement at the wooden platter before me empty but for a smear of grease and a forlorn boiled onion poison she hissed dramatically in my ear along with a considerable wafting of brandy fumes nonsense i said rather coldly drawing away from her no one would want to poison me simply because i well because i was floundering a bit and it occurred to me that i might have had a few sips more than i had realized now really geilie this marriage i didnt plan it you know i didnt want it no lie there it was merely a sort of necessary business arrangement i said hoping the candlelight hid my blushes ha she said cynically i ken the look of a lass thats been well bedded she glanced toward the archway where jamie had disappeared and damned if i think those are midge bites on the laddies neck either she raised one silver brow at me if it was a business arrangement id say ye got your moneys worth she leaned close again is it true she whispered about the thumbs thumbs geilie what in gods name are you babbling about she looked down her small straight nose at me frowning in concentration the beautiful grey eyes were slightly unfocused and i hoped she wouldnt fall over surely ye know that everyone knows a mans thumbs tell ye the size of his cock great toes too of course she added judiciously but those are harder to judge usually what wi the shoon and all yon wee foxcub she nodded toward the archway where jamie had just reappeared he could cup a goodsized marrow in those hands of his or a goodsized arse hm she added nudging me once more geillis duncan will you shut up i hissed face flaming someone will hear you oh no one who she began but stopped staring jamie had passed right by our table as though he didnt see us his face was pale and his lips set firmly as though bent on some unpleasant duty whatever ails him geilie asked he looks like arthur after hes eaten raw turnips i dont know i pushed back the bench hesitating he was heading for colums table should i follow him plainly something had happened geilie peering back down the room suddenly tugged at my sleeve pointing in the direction from which jamie had appeared a man stood just within the archway hesitating even as i was his clothes were stained with mud and dust a traveler of some sort a messenger and whatever the message he had passed it on to jamie who was even now bending to whisper it in colums ear no not colum dougal the red head bent low between the two dark ones the broad handsome features of the three faces taking on an unearthly similarity in the light of the dying candles and as i watched i realized that the similarity was due not so much to the inheritance of bone and sinew that they shared but to the expression of shocked grief that they now held in common geilies hand was digging into the flesh of my forearm bad news she said unnecessarily twentyfour years i said softly it seems a long time to be married aye it does jamie agreed a warm wind stirred the branches of the tree above us lifting the hair from my shoulders to tickle my face longer than ive been alive i glanced at him leaning on the paddock fence all lanky grace and strong bones i tended to forget how young he really was he seemed so selfassured and capable still he said flicking a straw into the churned mud of the paddock i doubt dougal spent more than three years of that with her he was generally here ye ken at the castle or here and there about the lands doing colums business for him dougals wife maura had died at their estate of beannachd a sudden fever dougal himself had left at dawn in company with ned gowan and the messenger who had brought the news the night before to arrange the funeral and dispose of his wifes property not a close marriage then i asked curiously jamie shrugged as close as most i should reckon she had the children and the running of the house to keep her busy i doubt she missed him greatly though she seemed glad enough to see him when he came home thats right you lived with them for a time didnt you i was quiet thinking i wondered whether this was jamies idea of marriage separate lives joining only infrequently for the breeding of children yet from the little he had said his own parents marriage had been a close and loving one with that uncanny trick of reading my thoughts he said it was different wi my own folk ye ken dougals was an arranged marriage like colums and a matter more of lands and business than the wanting of each other but my parents well they wed for love against the wishes of both families and so we were not cut off exactly but more by ourselves at lallybroch my parents didna go often to visit relatives or do business outside and so i think they turned more to each other than husband and wife usually do he laid a hand low on my back and urged me closer to him he bent his head and brushed his lips across the top of my ear it was an arrangement between us he said softly still i would hope perhaps one day he broke off awkwardly with a crooked smile and a gesture of dismissal not wanting to encourage him in that direction i smiled back as neutrally as i could and turned toward the paddock i could feel him there beside me not quite touching big hands gripping the top rail of the fence i gripped the rail myself to keep from taking his hand i wanted more than anything to turn to him offer him comfort assure him with body and words that what lay between us was more than a business arrangement it was the truth of it that stopped me what it is between us he had said when i lie with you when you touch me no it wasnt usual at all it wasnt a simple infatuation either as i had first thought nothing could be less simple the fact remained that i was bound by vows and loyalty and law to another man and by love as well i could not could not tell jamie what i felt for him to do that and then to leave as i must would be the height of cruelty neither could i lie to him claire he had turned to me was looking down at me i could feel it i didnt speak but raised my face to him as he bent to kiss me i couldnt lie to him that way either and didnt after all i thought dimly i had promised him honesty we were interrupted by a loud ahem from behind the paddock fence jamie startled whirled toward the sound instinctively thrusting me behind him then he stopped and grinned seeing old alec macmahon standing there in his filthy trews viewing us sardonically with his one bright blue eye the old man held a wickedlooking pair of gelding shears which he raised in ironic salute i was goin to use these on mahomet he remarked perhaps they could be put to better use here eh he snicked the thick blades invitingly itd keep your mind on your work and off your cock laddie dont even jest about it man said jamie grinning wanting me were ye alec waggled an eyebrow like a woolly caterpillar no what gives ye to think that i thought id like to try gelding a blooded twoyearold all by mysel for the joy of it he wheezed briefly at his own wit then waved the shears toward the castle off wi ye lassie ye can have him back at supper for what good hell be to ye by then apparently not trusting the nature of this last remark jamie reached out a long arm and neatly snagged the shears ill feel safer if ive got these he said cocking an eyebrow at old alec go along sassenach when ive finished doing all of alecs work for him ill come and find ye he leaned down to kiss my cheek and whispered in my ear the stables when the suns midsky the stables of castle leoch were better built than many of the cottages i had seen on our journey with dougal stone floored and stone walled the only openings were the narrow windows at one end the door at the other and the narrow slits under the thick thatched roof intended for the convenience of the owls who kept down the mice in the hay they let in plenty of air though and enough light that the stables were pleasantly dim rather than gloomy up in the hayloft just under the roof the light was even better striping the piled hay with yellow bars and lighting the drifting dust motes like showers of gold dust the air came in through the chinks in warm drafts scented with stock and sweet william and garlic from the gardens outside and the pleasant animal smell of the horses wafted up from below jamie stirred under my hand and sat up the movement bringing his head from the shadow into a blaze of sunlight like the lighting of a candle what is it i asked sleepily turning my head in the direction he was looking wee hamish he said softly peering over the edge of the loft into the stable below wants his pony i expect i rolled awkwardly onto my stomach beside him dragging the folds of my shift over me for modestys sake a silly thought as no one below could see more than the top of my head colums son hamish was walking slowly down the aisle of the stable between the stalls he seemed to hesitate near some stalls though he ignored the curious heads of chestnut and sorrel poking out to inspect him clearly he was looking for something and it wasnt his fat brown pony placidly munching straw in its stall near the stable door holy god hes going for donas jamie seized his kilt and wrapped it hurriedly about himself before swinging down from the edge of the loft not bothering with the ladder he hung by his hands and then dropped to the floor he landed lightly on the strawscattered stones but with enough of a thud to make hamish whirl around with a startled gasp the small freckled face relaxed somewhat as he realized who it was but the blue eyes stayed wary needing a bit of help coz jamie inquired pleasantly he moved toward the stalls and leaned against one of the uprights managing to insert himself between hamish and the stall the boy had been heading for hamish hesitated but then drew himself up small chin thrust out im going to ride donas he said in a tone that tried for determination but fell somewhat short donas his name meant demon and was in no way meant as flattery was in a horsebox to himself at the far end of the stable safely separated by an empty stall from the nearest neighboring horses a huge eviltempered sorrel stallion he was ridable by no one and only old alec and jamie dared go near him there was an irritable squeal from the shadows of his stall and an enormous copper head shot suddenly out huge yellow teeth clacking together as the horse made a vain attempt to bite the bare shoulder so temptingly displayed jamie stayed motionless knowing that the stallion couldnt reach him hamish jumped back with a squeak clearly scared speechless by the sudden appearance of that monstrous shimmering head with its rolling bloodshot eyes and flaring nostrils i dinna think so observed jamie mildly he reached down and took his small cousin by the shoulder steering him away from the horse who kicked his stall in protest hamish shuddered in concert with the boards of the stall as the lethal hooves crashed against the wood jamie turned the boy around to face him and stood looking down at him hands on his kilted hips now then he said firmly whats this all about why are ye wanting aught to do wi donas hamishs jaw was set stubbornly but jamies face was both encouraging and adamant he punched the boy gently on the shoulder getting a tiny smile response come on duine jamie said softly ye know i wilna tell anyone have ye done something foolish a faint flush came up on the boys fair skin no at least no well maybe a bit foolish after a bit more encouragement the story came out reluctantly at first then in a tumbling flood of confession he had been out on his pony riding with some of the other boys the day before several of the older lads had started competing to see who could jump his horse over a higher obstacle jealously admiring them hamishs better judgment was finally overcome by bravado and he had tried to force his fat little pony over a stone fence lacking both ability and interest the pony had come to a dead stop at the fence tossing young hamish over his head over the fence and ignominiously into a nettle patch on the other side stung both by nettles and by the hoots of his comrades hamish was determined to come out today on a proper horse as he put it they wouldna laugh if i came out on donas he said envisioning the scene with grim relish no they wouldna laugh jamie agreed theyd be too busy picking up the pieces he eyed his cousin shaking his head slowly ill tell ye lad it takes courage and sense to make a good rider youve the courage but the sense is a wee bit lacking yet he put a consoling arm round hamishs shoulders drawing him down toward the end of the stable come along man help me fork the hay and well get ye acquainted wi cobhar youre right ye should have a better horse if youre ready but it isna necessary to kill yourself to prove it glancing up into the loft as he passed he raised his eyebrows and shrugged helplessly i smiled and waved down at him telling him to go ahead it was all right i watched them as jamie took an apple from the basket of windfalls kept near the door fetching a pitchfork from the corner he led hamish back to one of the center stalls here coz he said pausing he whistled softly through his teeth and a widebrowed bay horse put its head out blowing through its nostrils the dark eyes were large and kind and the ears had a slight forward cock that gave the horse an expression of friendly alertness now then cobhar ciamar a tha thu jamie patted the sleek neck firmly and scratched the cocked ears come on up he said motioning to his small cousin thats it next to me near enough he can smell ye horses like to smell ye i know hamishs high voice was scornful he barely reached the horses nose but reached up and patted he stood his ground as the big head came down and sniffed interestedly around his ear whuffling in his hair give me an apple he said to jamie who obliged the soft velvet lips plucked the fruit delicately out of hamishs palm and flicked it back between the huge molars where it vanished with a juicy crunch jamie watched approvingly aye youll get on fine go on and make friends then while i finish feeding the others then ye can take him out to ride by myself hamish asked eagerly cobhar whose name meant foam was goodtempered but a sound spirited hand gelding nonetheless and a far cry from the brown pony twice round the paddock wi me watchin ye and if ye dinna fall off or jerk his mouth ye can take him by yourself no jumping him til i say though the long back bent gleaming in the warm dusk of the stable as jamie caught up a forkful of hay from the pile in one corner and carried it to one of the stalls he straightened and smiled at his cousin gi me one of those will ye he leaned the fork against a stall and bit into the proffered fruit the two stood companionably eating leaning side by side against the stable wall when he finished jamie handed the core to a nuzzling sorrel and fetched his fork again hamish followed him down the aisle chewing slowly ive heard my father was a good rider hamish offered tentatively after a moments silence before before he couldnt anymore jamie shot a swift glance at his cousin but finished pitching hay into the sorrels stall before speaking when he did he answered the thought rather than the words i never saw him ride but ill tell ye lad i hope never to need as much courage as colum has i saw hamishs gaze rest curiously on jamies scarred back but he said nothing after a second apple his thoughts appeared to have shifted to another topic rupert said ye had to get married he remarked through a mouthful of apple i wanted to get married jamie said firmly replacing the pitchfork against the wall oh well good hamish said uncertainly as though disconcerted by this novel idea i only wondered do ye mind mind what seeing that this conversation might take a while jamie sat down on a bale of hay hamishs feet did not quite reach the floor or he might have shuffled them instead he drummed his heels lightly against the firmpacked hay do ye mind being married he said staring at his cousin getting into bed every night with a lady i mean no said jamie no in fact its verra pleasant hamish looked doubtful i dinna think i should like it much but then all the girls i know are skinny as sticks and they smell o barely water the lady claire your lady i mean he added hastily as though wishing to avoid confusion shes er she looks as though shed be nicer to sleep with soft i mean jamie nodded aye thats true smells all right too he offered even in the dim light i could see a small muscle twitching near the corner of his mouth and knew he didnt dare look up in the direction of the loft there was a long pause how dye know hamish said know what which is the right lady to get married to the boy said impatiently oh jamie rocked back and settled himself against the stone wall hands behind his head i asked my own da that once he said he said ye just ken and if ye dinna ken then shes no the right lassie mmmphm this seemed a less than satisfactory explanation to judge from the expression on the small frecklespattered face hamish sat back consciously aping jamies posture his stockinged feet stuck out over the edge of the hay bale small as he was his sturdy frame gave promise of someday matching his cousins the set of the square shoulders and the tilt of the solid graceful skull were nearly identical wheres your shoon then jamie asked accusingly youll no ha left them in the pasture again your mother will box your ears for ye if yeve lost them hamish shrugged this off as a threat of no consequence clearly there was something of more importance on his mind john he started wrinkling his sandy brows in thought john says john the stablelad john the cookboy or john cameron jamie asked the stablelad hamish waved a hand pushing away the distraction he said er about getting married mmm jamie made an encouraging noise keeping his face tactfully turned away rolling his eyes upward his glance met mine as i peered over the edge i grinned down at him causing him to bite his lip to keep from grinning back hamish drew a deep breath and let it out in a rush propelling his words like a burst of birdshot hesaidyemustservealasslikeastalliondoesamareandididnabelievehimbutisittrue i bit my finger hard to keep from laughing out loud not so fortunately placed jamie dug his fingers into the fleshy part of his leg turning as red in the face as hamish they looked like two tomatoes set side by side on a hay bale for judging at a county vegetable show er aye weel in a way he said sounding strangled then he got a grip on himself yes he said firmly yes ye do hamish cast a halfhorrified glance into the nearby stall where the bay gelding was relaxing a foot or so of reproductive equipment protruding from its sheath he glanced doubtfully down into his lap then and i stuffed a handful of fabric into my mouth as far as it would go theres some difference ye ken jamie went on the rich color was beginning to fade from his face though there was still an ominous quiver around his mouth for one thing its more gentle ye dinna bite them on the neck then hamish had the serious intent expression of one taking careful notes to make them keep still er no not customarily anyway exercising his not inconsiderable willpower jamie faced up manfully to the responsibilities of enlightenment theres another difference as well he said carefully not looking upward ye may do it face to face instead of from the back as the lady prefers the lady hamish seemed dubious about this i think id rather do it from the back i dinna think id like to have anyone lookin at me while i did something like that is it hard he inquired is it hard to keep from laughing i was still thinking about jamie and hamish when i came to bed that night i turned down the thick quilts smiling to myself there was a cool draft from the window and i looked forward to crawling under the quilts and nestling against jamies warmth impervious to cold he seemed to carry a small furnace within himself and his skin was always warm sometimes almost hot as though he burned more fiercely in answer to my own cool touch i was still a stranger and an outlander but no longer a guest at the castle while the married women seemed somewhat friendlier now that i was one of them the younger girls seemed strongly to resent the fact that i had removed an eligible young bachelor from circulation in fact noting the number of cold glances and behindthehand remarks i rather wondered just how many of the castle maidens had found their way into a secluded alcove with jamie mactavish during his short residency mactavish no longer of course most of the castle inhabitants had always known who he was and whether i was an english spy or not i now knew of necessity as well so he became fraser publicly and so did i it was as mistress fraser that i was welcomed into the room above the kitchens where the married women did their sewing and rocked their babies exchanging bits of motherlore and eyeing my own waistline with frank appraisal because of my earlier difficulties in conceiving i had not considered the possibility of pregnancy when i agreed to marry jamie and i waited in some apprehension until my monthly occurred on time my feelings this time were entirely of relief with none of the sadness that usually accompanied it my life was more than complicated enough at the moment without introducing a baby into it i thought that jamie perhaps felt a small twinge of regret though he also professed himself relieved fatherhood was a luxury that a man in his position could ill afford the door opened and he came in still rubbing his head with a linen towel water droplets from his wet hair darkening his shirt where have you been i asked in astonishment luxurious as leoch might be in contrast to the residences of village and croft it didnt boast any bathing facilities beyond a copper tub that colum used to soak his aching legs and a slightly larger one used by such ladies as thought the labor involved in filling it worth the privacy all other washing was done either in bits using basin and ewer or outside either in the loch or in a small stonefloored chamber off the garden where the young women were accustomed to stand naked and let their friends throw buckets of water over them in the loch he answered hanging the damp towel neatly over the windowsill someone he said grimly left the stall door ajar and the stable door as well and cobhar had a wee swim in the twilight oh so thats why you werent at supper but horses dont like to swim do they i asked he shook his head running his fingers through his hair to dry it no they dont but theyre just like folk ye ken all different and cobhar is fond of the young water plants he was down nibbling by the waters edge when a pack of dogs from the village came along and chased him into the loch i had to run them off and then go in after him wait til i get my hands on wee hamish he said with grim intent ill teach him to leave gates ajar are you going to tell colum about it i asked feeling a qualm of sympathy for the culprit jamie shook his head groping in his sporran he drew out a roll and a chunk of cheese apparently filched from the kitchens on his way up to the chamber no he said colums fair strict wi the lad if he heard hed been so careless hed not let him ride for a month not that he could after the thrashing hed get lord im starving he bit ferociously into the roll scattering crumbs dont get into bed with that i said sliding under the quilts myself what are you planning to do to hamish then he swallowed the remainder of the roll and smiled at me dinna worry im going to row him out on the loch just before supper tomorrow and toss him in by the time he makes it to shore and dries off supper will be over he finished the cheese in three bites and unashamedly licked his fingers let him go to bed wet and hungry and see how he likes it he concluded darkly he peered hopefully in the drawer of the desk where i sometimes kept apples or other small bits of food there was nothing there tonight though and he shut the drawer with a sigh i suppose ill live til breakfast he said philosophically he stripped rapidly and crawled in next to me shivering though his extremities were chilled from his swim in the icy loch his body was still blissfully warm mm youre nice to croodle wi he murmured doing what i assumed was croodling you smell different been digging plants today no i said surprised i thought it was you the smell i mean it was a tangy herbal smell not unpleasant but unfamiliar i smell like fish he observed sniffing the back of his hand and wet horse no he leaned closer inhaling no it isna you either but its close by he slid out of bed and turned back the quilts searching we found it under my pillow what on earth i picked it up and promptly dropped it ouch it has thorns it was a small bundle of plants plucked up roughly by the roots and bound together with a bit of black thread the plants were wilted but a pungent smell still rose from the drooping leaves there was one flower in the bouquet a crushed primrose whose thorny stem had pricked my thumb i sucked the offended digit turning the bundle over more cautiously with my other hand jamie stood still staring down at it for a moment then he suddenly picked it up and crossing to the open window flung it out into the light returning to the bed he energetically brushed the crumbs of earth from the plants roots into the palm of his hand and threw them out after the bundle he closed the window with a slam and came back dusting his palms its gone he said unnecessarily he climbed back into bed come back to bed sassenach what was it i asked climbing in beside him a joke reckon he said a nasty one but only a joke he raised himself on one elbow and blew out the candle come here mo duinne he said im cold despite the unsettling illwish i slept well secure in the dual protection of a bolted door and jamies arms toward dawn i dreamed of grassy meadows filled with butterflies yellow brown white and orange they swirled around me like autumn leaves lighting on my head and shoulders sliding down my body like rain the tiny feet tickling on my skin and the velvet wings beating like faint echoes of my own heart i floated gently to the surface of reality and found that the butterfly feet against my stomach were the flaming tendrils of jamies soft red thatch and the butterfly trapped between my thighs was his tongue mmm i said sometime later well thats all very well for me but what about you about threequarters of a minute if you keep on in that fashion he said putting my hand away with a grin but id rather take my time over it im a slow and canny man by nature dye see might i ask the favor of your company for this evening mistress you might i said i put my arms behind my head and fixed him with a halflidded look of challenge if you mean to tell me that youre so decrepit you cant manage more than once in a day anymore he regarded me narrowly from his seat on the edge of the bed there was a sudden flash of white as he lunged and i found myself pressed deep into the featherbed aye well he said into the tangles of my hair youll no say i didna warn ye two and a half minutes later he groaned and opened his eyes he scrubbed his face and head vigorously with both hands making the shorter ends stick up like quills then with a muffled gaelic oath he slid reluctantly out from under the blankets and began to dress shivering in the chilly morning air i dont suppose i asked hopefully that you could tell alec youre sick and come back to bed he laughed and bent to kiss me before groping under the bed for his stockings would that i could sassenach i doubt much short of pox plague or grievous bodily harm would answer as an excuse though if i werent bleeding old alec would be up here in a trice dragging me off my deathbed to help wi the worming i eyed his graceful long calves as he pulled a stocking up neatly and folded the top grievous bodily harm eh i might manage something along those lines i said darkly he grunted as he reached across for the other stocking well watch where ye toss your elfdarts sassenach he tried a lewd wink but wound up squinting at me instead aim too high and ill be no good to you either i arched one eyebrow and snuggled back under the quilts not to worry nothing above the knee i promise he patted one of my rounder bulges and left for the stables singing rather loudly the air from up among the heather the refrain floated back from the stairwell sittin wi a wee girl holdin on my knee when a bumblebee stung me weel above the kneeeee up among the heather at the head o bendikee he was right i decided he didnt have any ear for music i relapsed temporarily into a state of satisfied somnolence but roused myself shortly to go down for breakfast most of the castle inhabitants had eaten and gone to their work already those still in the hall greeted me pleasantly enough there were no sidelong looks no expressions of veiled hostility of someone wondering how well their nasty little trick had worked but i watched the faces nonetheless the morning was spent alone in the garden and fields with my basket and digging stick i was running short of some of the most popular herbs generally the village people went to geillis duncan for help but there had been several patients from the village turning up of late in my dispensary and the traffic in nostrums had been heavy maybe her husbands illness was keeping her too busy to care for her regular customers i spent the latter part of the afternoon in my dispensary there were few patients to be seen only a case of persistent eczema a dislocated thumb and a kitchen boy who had spilled a pot of hot soup down one leg having dispensed ointment of yawroot and blue flag and reset and bound the thumb i settled down to the task of pounding some very aptly named stoneroot in one of the late beatons smaller mortars it was tedious work but well suited to this sort of lazy afternoon the weather was fair and i could see blue shadows lengthening under the elms to the west when i stood on my table to peer out inside the glass bottles gleamed in orderly ranks neat stacks of bandages and compresses in the cupboards next to them the apothecarys cabinet had been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected and now held stores of dried leaves roots and fungi neatly packed in cottongauze bags i took a deep breath of the sharp spicy odors of my sanctum and let it out in a sigh of contentment then i stopped pounding and set the pestle down i was contented i realized with a shock despite the myriad uncertainties of life here despite the unpleasantness of the illwish despite the small constant ache of missing frank i was in fact not unhappy quite the contrary i felt immediately ashamed and disloyal how could i bring myself to be happy when frank must be demented with worry assuming that time was in fact continuing without me and i couldnt see why it wouldnt i must have gone missing for upwards of four months i imagined him searching the scottish countryside calling the police waiting for some sign some word of me by now he must nearly have given up hope and be waiting instead for word that my body had been found i set down the mortar and paced up and down the length of my narrow room rubbing my hands on my apron in a spasm of guilty sorrow and regret i should have got away sooner i should have tried harder to return but i had i reminded myself i had tried repeatedly and look what had happened yes look i was married to a scottish outlaw the both of us hunted by a sadistic captain of dragoons and living with a lot of barbarians who would as soon kill jamie as look at him if they thought him a threat to their precious clan succession and the worst of it all was that i was happy i sat down staring helplessly at the array of jars and bottles i had been living day to day since our return to leoch deliberately suppressing the memories of my earlier life deep down i knew that i must soon make some kind of decision but i had delayed putting off the necessity from day to day and hour to hour burying my uncertainties in the pleasures of jamies company and his arms there was a sudden bumping and cursing out in the corridor and i rose hastily and went to the door just in time to see jamie himself stumble in supported by the bowed form of old alec mcmahon on one side and the earnest but spindly efforts of one of the stable lads on the other he sank onto my stool left foot outstretched and grimaced unpleasantly at it the grimace seemed to be more of annoyance than pain so i knelt to examine the offending appendage with relatively little concern mild strain i said after a cursory inspection what did you do fell off jamie said succinctly off the fence i asked teasing he glowered no off donas you were riding that thing i asked incredulously in that case youre lucky to get off with a strained ankle i fetched a length of bandage and began to wrap the joint weel it wasna sae bad as a that said old alec judiciously in fact lad ye were doin quiet weel wi him for a bit i know i was snapped jamie gritting his teeth as i pulled the bandage tight a bee stung him the bushy brows lifted oh that was it beast acted like hed been struck wi an elfdart he confided to me went straight up in the air on all fours and came down again then went stark staring mad all over the pen like a bumblebee in a jar yon wee laddie stuck on too he said nodding at jamie who invented a new unpleasant expression in response until the big yellow fiend went ower the fence over the fence where is he now i asked standing up and dusting my hands halfway back to hell i expect said jamie putting his foot down and trying his weight gingerly on it and welcome to stay there wincing he sat back i doubt the deils got much use for a halfbroke stallion observed alec bein able to turn himself into a horse when needed perhaps thats who donas really is i suggested amused i wouldna doubt it said jamie still smarting but beginning to recover his usual good humor the deils customarily a black stallion though is he no oh aye said alec a great black stallion that travels as fast as the thought between a man and a maid he grinned genially at jamie and rose to go and speakin of that he said with a wink at me ill no expect ye in the stables tomorrow keep to your bed laddie and er rest why is it i demanded looking after the crusty old horsemaster that everyone seems to assume weve no more on our minds than to get into bed with each other jamie tried his weight on the foot again bracing himself on the counter for one thing weve been married less than a month he observed for another he looked up and grinned shaking his head ive told ye before sassenach everything ye think shows on your face bloody hell i said aside from a quick trip to the dispensary to check for emergencies i spent the next morning ministering to the rather demanding needs of my solitary patient you are supposed to be resting i said reprovingly at one point i am well my ankle is resting at least see a long unstockinged shin thrust up into the air and a bony slender foot waggled back and forth it stopped abruptly in midwaggle with a muffled ouch from its owner he lowered it and tenderly massaged the stillpuffy ankle thatll teach you i said swinging my own legs out from under the blankets come along now youve been frowsting in bed quite long enough you need fresh air he sat up hair falling over his face i thought ye said it was rest i needed you can rest in the fresh air get up im making up the bed amid complaints about my general unfeelingness and lack of consideration for a gravely injured man he got dressed and sat long enough for me to bind up the weak ankle before his natural exuberance asserted itself its a bit saft out he said with a glance through the casement where the mild drizzle had just decided to buckle down to it and become a major downpour lets go up to the roof the roof oh to be sure i couldnt think of a better prescription for a strained ankle than climbing six flights of stairs five besides ive a stick he produced the stick in question an aged hawthorn club from behind the door with a triumphant flourish wherever did you get that i inquired examining it at closer range it was even more battered a threefoot length of chipped hardwood agehardened as a diamond alec lent it me he uses it on the mules raps them twixt the eyes wi it to make them pay attention sounds very effective i said eyeing the scuffed wood i must try it sometime on you we emerged at last in a small sheltered spot just under the overhang of the slate roof a low parapet guarded the edge of this small lookout oh its beautiful despite the gusty rain the view from the roof was magnificent we could see the broad silver sweep of the loch and the towering crags beyond thrusting into the solid grey of the sky like ridged black fists jamie leaned on the parapet taking the weight from his injured foot aye it is i used to come up here sometimes when i was at the castle before he pointed across the loch dimpling under the beat of the rain dye see the notch there between those two craigs in the mountains yes thats the way to lallybroch when id feel lonely for my home sometimes id come up here and look that way id imagine flying like a corbie across that pass and the look of the hills and the fields falling down the other side of the mountain and the manor house at the end of the valley i touched him gently on the arm do you want to go back jamie he turned his head and smiled down at me well ive been thinking of it i dont know if i want to precisely but i think we must i canna say what well find there sassenach but aye im wed now youre lady of broch tuarach outlaw or no i need to go back even if just long enough to set things straight i felt a thrill compounded of relief and apprehension at the thought of leaving leoch and its assorted intrigues when will we go he frowned drumming his fingers on the parapet the stone was dark and slick with rain well i think we must wait for the duke to come its possible that he might see his way to doing colum a favor by taking up my case if he cannot get me cleared he might be able to arrange a pardon thered be a good deal less danger in going back to lallybroch then ye see well yes but he glanced sharply at me as i hesitated what is it sassenach i took a deep breath jamie if i tell you something will you promise not to ask me how i know he took me by both arms looking down into my face the rain misted his hair and small droplets ran down the sides of his face he smiled at me i told you that i wouldna ask for anything that ye dinna wish to tell me yes i promise lets sit down you shouldnt be standing on that foot so long we made our way to the wall where the overhanging slates of the roof sheltered a small dry patch of pavement and settled ourselves comfortably backs against the wall all right sassenach what is it jamie asked the duke of sandringham i said i bit my lip jamie dont trust him i dont know everything about him myself but i do know theres something about him something wrong you know about that he looked surprised now it was my turn to stare you mean you know about him already have you met him i was relieved perhaps the mysterious links between sandringham and the jacobite cause were much better known than frank and the vicar had thought oh aye he was here visiting when i was sixteen when i left why did you leave i was curious remembering suddenly what geillis duncan had said when first id met her in the wood the odd rumor that jamie was the real father of colums son hamish i knew myself that he wasnt couldnt have been but i was quite possibly the only person in the castle who did know a suspicion of that sort could easily have led to dougals earlier attempt on jamies life if in fact thats what the attack at carryarick had been it wasnt because of the lady letitia was it i asked with some hesitation letitia his startled astonishment was plain and something inside me that i hadnt known was clenched suddenly relaxed i hadnt really thought there was anything to geilies supposition but still what on earth makes ye mention letitia jamie asked curiously i lived at the castle for a year and had speech of her maybe once that i remember when she called me to her chamber and gave me the raw side of her tongue for leading a game of shinty through her rose garden i told him what geilie had said and he laughed breath misting in the cool rainy air god he said as though id have the nerve you dont think colum suspected any such thing do you i asked he shook his head decidedly no i dont sassenach if he had any inkling of such a thing i wouldna have lived to be seventeen let alone achieve the ripe old age of threeandtwenty this more or less confirmed my own impression of colum but i was relieved nonetheless jamies expression had grown thoughtful blue eyes suddenly remote come to think on it though i dont know that colum does know why i left the castle so sudden then and if geillis duncan is goin about the place spreading such rumors that womans a troublemaker sassenach a gossip and a scold if not the witch folk say she is well id best see that he finds out then he glanced up at the sheet of water pouring from the eaves perhaps wed best go down sassenach its getting a wee bit damp out we took a different way down crossing the roof to an outer stairway that led down to the kitchen gardens where i wanted to pull a bit of borage if the downpour would let me we sheltered under the wall of the castle one of the jutting window ledges diverting the rain above what do ye do wi borage sassenach jamie asked with interest looking out at the straggly vines and plants beaten to the earth by the rain when its green nothing first you dry it and then i was interrupted by a terrific noise of barking and shouting coming from outside the garden wall i raced through the downpour toward the wall followed more slowly by jamie limping father bain the village priest was running up the path puddles exploding under his feet pursued by a yelping pack of dogs hampered by his voluminous soutane the priest tripped and fell water and mud flying in spatters all around him in a moment the dogs were upon him growling and snapping a blur of plaid vaulted over the wall next to me and jamie was among them laying about with his stick and shouting in gaelic adding his voice to the general racket if the shouts and curses had little effect the stick had more there were sharp yelps as the club struck hairy flesh and gradually the pack retreated finally turning and galloping off in the direction of the village jamie wiped the hair out of his eyes panting bad as wolves he said id told colum about that pack already theyre the ones that chased cobhar into the loch two days ago best he has them shot before they kill someone he looked down at me as i knelt next to the fallen priest inspecting the rain dripped from the ends of my hair and i could feel my shawl growing sodden they havent yet i said bar a few toothmarks hes basically all right father bains soutane was ripped down one side showing an expanse of hairless white thigh with an ugly gash and several puncture marks beginning to ooze blood the priest pastywhite with shock was struggling to his feet plainly he wasnt too badly injured if youll come to the surgery with me father ill cleanse those cuts for you i offered suppressing a smile at the spectacle the fat little priest presented soutane flapping and argyle socks revealed at the best of times father bains face resembled a clenched fist this similarity was made more pronounced at the moment by the red mottling that streaked his jowls and emphasized the vertical creases between cheeks and mouth he glared at me as though i had suggested that he commit some public indecency apparently i had for his next words were what a man o god to expose his pairsonal parts to the handling of a wumman weel ill tell ye madam ive no notion what sorts of immorality are practiced in the circles youre accustomed to move in but ill have ye to ken that suchll no be tolerated here not sae long as ive the cure of the souls in this parish with that he turned and stumped off limping rather badly and trying unsuccessfully to hold up the torn side of his robe suit yourself i called after him if you dont let me cleanse it it will fester the priest did not respond but hunched his round shoulders and hitched his way up the garden stair a step at a time like a penguin hopping up an ice floe that man doesnt care overmuch for women does he i remarked to jamie considering his occupation i imagine thats as well he replied lets go and eat after lunch i sent my patient back to bed to rest alone this time in spite of his protestations and went down to the surgery the heavy rain seemed to have made business slack people tended to stay safely inside rather than running over their feet with ploughshares or falling off roofs i passed the time pleasantly enough bringing the records in davie beatons book up to date just as i finished though a visitor darkened my door he literally darkened it his bulk filling it from side to side squinting in the semidarkness i made out the form of alec macmahon swathed in an extraordinary getup of coats shawls and odd bits of horseblanket he advanced with a slowness that reminded me of colums first visit to the surgery with me and gave me a clue to his problem rheumatism is it i asked with sympathy as he subsided stiffly into my single chair with a stifled groan aye the damp settles in my bones he said aught to be done about it he laid his huge gnarled hands on the table letting the fingers relax the hands opened slowly like a nightblooming flower to show the callused palms within i picked up one of the knotted appendages and turned it gently to and fro stretching the fingers and massaging the horny palm the seamed old face above the hand contorted for a moment as i did it but then relaxed as the first twinges passed like wood i said a good slug of whisky and a deep massage is the best i can recommend tansy tea will do only so much he laughed shawls slipping off his shoulder whisky eh i had my doubts lassie but i see yeve the makings of a fine physician i reached into the back of my medicine cupboard and pulled out the anonymous brown bottle that held my supply from the leoch distillery i plunked it on the table before him with a horn cup drink up i said then get stripped off as far as you think decent and lie on the table ill make up the fire so it will be warm enough the blue eye surveyed the bottle with appreciation and a crooked hand reached slowly for the neck best have a nip yourself lassie he advised itll be a big job he groaned with a cross between pain and contentment as i leaned hard on his left shoulder to loosen it then lifted from underneath and rotated the whole quarter of his body my wife used to iron my back for me he remarked for the lumbago but this is even better yeve a good strong pair of hands lassie make a good stablelad ye would ill assume thats a compliment i said dryly pouring more of the heated oilandtallow mixture into my palm and spreading it over the broad white expanse of his back there was a sharp line of demarcation between the weathered mottled brown skin of his arms where the rolledup sleeves of his shirt stopped and the milkwhite skin of his shoulders and back well you were a fine fair laddie at one time i remarked the skin of your backs as white as mine a deep chuckle shook the flesh under my hands never know now would ye aye ellen mackenzie once saw me wi my sark off birthin a foal and told me it looked like the good lord had put the wrong head to my body should have had a bag of milkpudding on my shoulders instead of a face from the altarpiece i gathered he was referring to the rood screen in the chapel which featured a number of extremely unattractive demons engaged in torturing sinners ellen mackenzie sounds as though she were rather free with her opinions i observed i was more than slightly curious about jamies mother from the small things he said now and then i had some picture of his father brian but he had never mentioned his mother and i knew nothing about her other than that she had died young in childbed oh she had a tongue on her did ellen and a mind of her own to go wi it untying the garters of his trews i tucked them up out of the way and began operations on the muscular calves of his legs but enough sweetness with it that no one minded much other than her brothers and she wasna one to pay much heed to colum or dougal mm so i heard eloped didnt she i dug my thumbs into the tendons behind his knee and he let out a sound that would have been a squeak in anyone less dignified oh aye ellen was the eldest o the six mackenzie bairns a year or two older than colum and the apple of auld jacobs eye thats why shed gone so long unwed wouldna ha aught to do wi john cameron or malcolm grant or any of the others she might have gone to and her father wouldna force her against her will when old jacob died though colum had less patience with his sisters foibles struggling desperately to consolidate his shaky hold on the clan he had sought an alliance with munro to the north or grant to the south both clans had young chieftains who would make useful brothersinlaw young jocasta only fifteen had obligingly accepted the suit of john cameron and gone north ellen on the verge of spinsterhood at twentytwo had been a good deal less cooperative i take it malcolm grants suit was rather firmly rejected judging from his behavior two weeks ago i observed old alec laughed the laugh turning to a satisfied groan as i pressed deeper aye i never heard exactly what she said to him but i expect it stung it was at the big gathering ye ken that they met out in the rose garden they went in the evening and everyone waiting to see would she tak him or no and it grew dark and they still waiting and darker still and the lanterns all lit and the singing begun and no sign yet of ellen or malcolm grant goodness it must have been quite a conversation i poured another dollop of the liniment between his shoulder blades and he grunted with the warm pleasure of it so it seemed but time went on and they didna come back and colum began to fear as grant had eloped wi her taken her by force ye see and it seemed as that must be the way of it for they found the rose garden empty and when he sent down to the stables for me sure enough i told him grants men had come for the horses and the whole boiling of em gone awa without a word of farewell furious eighteenyearold dougal had mounted his horse at once and set out on the track of malcolm grant not waiting either for company nor for conference with colum when colum heard as dougal had gone after grant he sent me and some others helterskelter after him colum being well acquent wi dougals temper and not wishing to have his new brotherinlaw slain in the road before the banns were called for he reckoned as how malcolm grant not being able to talk ellen into wedding him must ha taken her away in order to have his way wi her and force her into marriage that way alec paused meditatively all dougal could see was the insult of course but i dinna think colum was that upset about it to tell the truth insult or no it would ha solved his problem and grant would likely have had to take ellen wiout her dower and pay reparation to colum as well alec snorted cynically colum is no the man to let an opportunity pass by him hes quick and hes ruthless is colum the single iceblue eye swiveled back to regard me over one humped shoulder yed be wise to bear that in mind lassie im not likely to forget it i assured him with some grimness i remembered jamies story of his punishment at colums order and wondered how much of that had been in revenge for his mothers rebellion still colum had had no chance to seize the opportunity of marrying his sister to the laird of clan grant toward dawn dougal had found malcolm grant camped along the main road with his followers asleep under a gorse bush wrapped in his plaid and when alec and the others had come pelting along the road sometime later they had been stopped in their tracks by the sight of dougal mackenzie and malcolm grant both stripped to the waist and scarred with the marks of battle swaying and staggering up and down the roadway still exchanging random blows whenever they got within reach of each other grants retainers were perched along the roadway like a row of owls heads turning one way and then the other as the waning fight meandered up and down in the dripping dawn they were both of them puffing like blown horses and the steam rising off their bodies in the chill grants nose was swelled to twice its size and dougal could scarce see out o either eye and both wi their blood dripping down and dried ower their breasts upon the appearance of colums men grants tacksmen had all sprung to their feet hands upon their swords and the meeting would likely have resulted in serious bloodshed had some sharpeyed lad among the mackenzies not noted the rather important fact that ellen mackenzie was nowhere to be seen among the grants weel after theyd poured water on malcolm grant and brought him to his senses he managed to tell them what dougal wouldna pause to hear that ellen had spent but a quarterhour wi him in the rose garden he wouldna say what had passed between them but whatever it was hed been so offended as to wish to take his leave at once without showing his face in the hall and hed left her there and seen her no more nor did he wish ever to hear the name of ellen mackenzie spoken in his presence again and wi that he mounted his horse a bit unsteady still and rode awa and been no friend since to anyone of the clan mackenzie i listened fascinated and where was ellen all this time old alec laughed with the sound of a stable door hinge creaking ower the hills and far away but they didna find it out for some time yet we turned about and pelted home again to find ellen still missing and colum standing whitefaced in the courtyard leanin on angus mhor there followed more confusion still for with all the guests the rooms of the castle were full as were all the lofts and cubbyholes the kitchens and closets it seemed hopeless to tell which of all the folk in the castle might also be missing but colum called all of the servants and went doggedly down the lists of the invited asking who had been seen the evening before and where and when and finally he found a kitchenmaid who recalled seeing a man in a back passage just before the supper was served she had noticed him only because he was so handsome tall and sturdy she said with hair like a black silkies and eyes like a cat she had watched him down the passage admiring him and seen him meet someone at the outer door a woman dressed in black from head to toe and shrouded in a hooded cloak whats a silkie i asked alecs eye slanted toward me crinkling at the corners ye call them seals in english for quite a bit after that even after they knew the truth of it folk in the village would tell the tale to each other that ellen mackenzie was taken to the sea to live among the seals did ye know that the silkies put aside their skins when they come ashore and walk like men and if ye find a silkies skin and hide it he or she he added fairly canna go into the sea again but must stay with ye on the land its thought good to take a sealwife that way for theyre very good cooks and most devoted mothers still he said judiciously colum wasna inclined to believe his sisterd gone off wi a seal and said so so he called the guests down one by one and asked them all who knew a man of that description and at long last they worked it out that his name was brian but no one knew his clan or his surname hed been at the games but there they only called him brian dhu so there the matter seemed to rest for a time for the searchers had no idea in which direction to look still even the best of hunters must stop at a cottage now and then to ask for a handful of salt or a pannikin of milk and eventually word of the pair reached leoch for ellen mackenzie was a maid of no ordinary appearance hair like fire alec said dreamily enjoying the warmth of the oil on his back and eyes like colums grey and fringed wi black lashes verra pretty but the kind would go through ye like a bolt a tall woman even taller than you and sae fair it would hurt the eyes to see her i heard tell later as theyd met at the gathering taken one look and decided on the spot as there could be none other for either one o them so they laid their plans and they stole awa under the noses of colum mackenzie and three hundred guests he laughed suddenly remembering dougal finally found them living in a crofters cottage on the edge of the fraser lands theyd decided the only way to manage was to hide until ellen was wi child and big enough that thered be no question whose it was then colum would have to give his blessing to the marriage like it or no and he didnt alec grinned whiles ye were on the road did ye chance to see a scar dougal carries running down his breast i had a thin white line that crossed his heart and ran from shoulder to ribs did brian do that i asked no ellen he replied grinning at my expression to stop him cutting brians throat which he was about to do i wouldna mention it to dougal if i were you no i dont suppose i will luckily the plan had worked and ellen was five months gone with child by the time that dougal found them there was the great todo about it all and a lot of verra nasty letters exchanged between leoch and beauly but they settled it in the end and ellen and brian took up house at lallybroch the week before the child was born they were married in the dooryard he added as an afterthought so he could carry her over the threshold for the first time as a wife he said after as he nearly ruptured himself lifting her you talk as though you knew them well i said finishing my ministrations i wiped the slippery ointment off my hands with a towel oh a bit alec said drowsy with warmth the lid drooped over his single eye and the lines of his old face had relaxed from the expression of mild discomfort that normally made him look so fierce i kent ellen weel of course then brian i met years later when he brought the lad to stay we got on a good man wi a horse his voice trailed off and the lid fell shut i drew a blanket up over the old mans prostrate form and tiptoed away leaving him dreaming by the fire leaving alec asleep i had gone up to our chamber only to find jamie in the same condition there are a limited number of activities suitable for indoor amusement on a dark rainy day and assuming that i didnt wish either to rouse jamie or to join him in oblivion that seemed to leave reading or needlework given the worsethanmediocre state of my abilities in the latter direction i had decided to borrow a book from colums library in accordance with the peculiar architectural principles governing the construction of leoch based on a general abhorrence of straight lines the stair leading to colums suite had two rightangle bends in it each marked by a small landing an attendant usually stood on the second landing ready to run errands or lend assistance to the laird but he wasnt at his station today i could hear the rumble of voices from above perhaps the attendant was with colum i paused outside the door uncertain whether to interrupt ive always known ye to be a fool dougal but i didna think ye quite such an idiot accustomed to the company of tutors since youth and unused to venturing out as his brother did among fighting men and common people colums voice normally lacked the broad scots that marked dougals speech the cultured accent had slipped a bit now though and the two voices were nearly indistinguishable both thickened by anger i might have expected such behavior from ye when ye were in your twenties but for gods sake man youre fiveandforty well it isna a matter youd know owermuch about now is it dougals voice held an ugly sneer no colums response came in a cutting tone and while ive seldom found cause to thank the lord perhaps hes done better by me than ive thought ive heard it said often enough that a mans brain stops workin when his cocks standin and now i think maybe i believe it there was a loud scrape as chairlegs were pushed back across the stone flooring if the brothers mackenzie have but one cock and one brain between the two of them then im glad of my half of the bargain i decided that a third participant in this particular conversation would be decidedly unwelcome and stepped softly back from the door turning to go down the stair the sound of rustling skirts from the first landing made me stop in my tracks i didnt wish to be discovered eavesdropping outside the lairds study and turned back toward the door the landing here was wide and a tapestry covered one wall almost from floor to ceiling my feet would show but it couldnt be helped lurking like a rat behind the arras i heard the steps from below slow as they approached the door and stop at the far side of the landing as the unseen visitor realized as i had the private nature of the brothers conversation no colum was saying calmer now no of course not the womans a witch or next thing to it aye but dougals response was cut short by his brothers impatient tones ive said ill attend to it man dont worry yourself over it little brother ill see shes done rightly by a note of grudging affection had crept into colums voice ill tell ye man ive written the duke as he may have leave to hunt the lands above erlick hes keen to have a shot at the stags there i mean to send jamie along wi him may be as he still has some feeling for the lad dougal interrupted with something in gaelic evidently a coarse remark for colum laughed and said nay i reckon jamies big enough to have a care for himself but if the dukes a mind to intercede for him with his royal majesty its the lads best chance for a pardon if ye will ill tell his grace youll go as well you can aid jamie as ye may and youll be out of the way while i settle matters here there was a muffled thump from the far side of the landing and i risked peeping out it was the girl laoghaire pale as the plastered wall behind her she was holding a tray with a decanter a pewter cup had fallen from the tray to the carpeted floor making the sound i had heard whats that colums voice suddenly sharp spoke from inside the study laoghaire dropped the tray on the table next to the door almost upsetting the decanter in her haste and turning fled precipitately i could hear dougals footsteps approaching the door and knew i would never make it down the stairs without discovery i barely had time to wriggle out of my hiding place and pick up the fallen cup before the door opened oh its you dougal sounded mildly surprised is that the stuff mrs fitz sent for colums raw throat yes i said glibly she says she hopes hell be better presently ill do moving more slowly colum came into view in the open door he smiled at me thank mrs fitz for me and my thanks to you my dear for bringing it will ye sit a moment while i drink it the conversation i had overheard had effectually made me forget my original purpose but i now remembered my intention of borrowing a book dougal excused himself and i followed colum slowly into his library where he offered me the run of his shelves colums color was still high the quarrel with his brother still fresh in his mind but he answered my questions about the books with a good approximation of his usual poise only the brightness of his eyes and a certain tenseness of posture betrayed his thoughts i found one or two herbals that looked interesting and put them aside while i browsed a novel colum crossed to the birds cage no doubt intending to soothe himself as per his usual custom by watching the beautiful little selfabsorbed creatures hop about amongst the branches each a world unto itself the sound of shouts from outside attracted my attention from this high point the fields behind the castle were visible all the way to the loch a small group of horsemen was sweeping around the end of the loch shouting with exhilaration as the rain pelted them on as they drew nearer i could see that they werent men after all but boys mostly teenagers but with a younger lad here and there on a pony pressing hard to stay up with the older youths i wondered if hamish was with them and quickly found the telltale spot of bright hair gleaming wildly from cobhars back in the middle of the pack the gang came charging toward the castle headed for one of the innumerable stone walls that separated one field from another one two three four the older boys on their mounts popped over the wall with the careless ease born of experience it was doubtless my imagination that made the bay seem to hang back a moment for cobhar followed the other horses with apparent eagerness he charged the fence set himself braced and leaped he seemed to do it just as the others had and yet something happened perhaps a hesitation by his rider a toohard pulling on the reins or a notquitefirm seat for the front hooves struck the wall just a few inches too low and horse rider and all somersaulted over the wall in the most spectacular parabola of doom i had ever seen oh drawn by my exclamation colum turned his head to the window in time to see cobhar land heavily on his side the small figure of hamish pinned beneath crippled as he was colum moved with speed he was by my side leaning out of the window before the horse had even begun to struggle to his feet the wind and rain beat in soaking the velvet of colums coat peering anxiously over his shoulder i saw a cluster of lads pushing and shoving each other in their eagerness to help it seemed a long time before the crowd parted and we saw the small sturdy figure stumble out of the press clutching his stomach he shook his head to the many offers of help and staggered purposefully to the wall where he leaned over and vomited profusely then he slid down the wall and sat in the wet grass legs sprawled face upturned to the rain when i saw him stick out his tongue to catch the falling drops i laid a hand on colums shoulder hes all right i said only had the wind knocked out of him colum closed his eyes and let his breath out body sagging suddenly with the release of tension i watched him with sympathy you care for him as though he were your own dont you i asked the grey eyes blazed suddenly into mine with the most extraordinary expression of alarm for an instant there was no sound in the study but the ticking of the glass clock on the shelf then a drop of water rolled down colums nose to hang glimmering from the tip i reached involuntarily to blot it with my handkerchief and the tension in his face broke yes he said simply in the end i told jamie only about colums plan to send him hunting with the duke i was convinced by now that his feelings for laoghaire were only those of a chivalrous friendship but i didnt know what he might do if he knew that his uncle had seduced the girl and got her with child apparently colum didnt mean to procure the services of geilie duncan in the emergency i wondered if the girl would be wed to dougal or if colum would find her another husband before the child began to show in any case if jamie and dougal were going to be shut up together in a hunting lodge for days on end i thought it might be as well if the shade of laoghaire were not one of the party hm he said thoughtfully worth a try ye get verra friendly wi each other hunting all day and coming back to drink whisky by the fire he finished fastening my gown up the back and bent to kiss my shoulder briefly id be sorry to leave ye sassenach but it might be best dont mind for me i said i hadnt realized before that his departure would necessarily leave me alone at the castle and the thought made me more than slightly nervous still i was resolved to manage if it might help him are you ready for supper i asked his hand lingered on my waist and i turned toward him mmm he said a moment later id be willing to go hungry well i wouldnt i said youll just have to wait i glanced down the dinnertable and across the room by now i knew most of the faces some intimately and a motley crew they were i reflected frank would have been fascinated by the gathering so many different facial types thinking about frank was rather like touching a sore tooth my inclination was to shy away but the time was coming when i would be able to delay no longer and i forced my mind back carefully drawing him in my mind tracing the long smooth arcs of his brows with my thoughts as i had once traced them with my fingers no matter that my fingers tingled suddenly with the memory of rougher thicker brows and the deep blue of the eyes beneath them i hastily turned toward the nearest face as an antidote to such disturbing thoughts it happened to be murtaghs well at least he looked like neither of the men who haunted my thoughts short slightly built but sinewy as a gibbon with long arms that reinforced the simian resemblance he had a low brow and narrow jaw that for some reason made me think of cave dwellers and pictures of early man shown in some of franks texts not a neanderthal though a pict that was it there was something very durable about the small clansman that reminded me of the weathered patterned stones ancient even now that stood their implacable guard over crossroads and burial grounds amused at the idea i looked over the other diners with an eye to spotting ethnic types that man near the hearth for example john cameron his name was was a norman if id ever seen one not that i had high cheekbones and a high narrow brow long upper lip and the dark skin of a gaul the odd fair saxon here and there ah laoghaire the perfect exemplar paleskinned blueeyed and just the tiniest bit plump i repressed the uncharitable observation she carefully avoided looking at either me or jamie chattering animatedly with her friends at one of the lower tables i looked in the opposite direction toward the next table where dougal mackenzie sat apart from colum for once a bloody viking that one with his impressive height and those broad flat cheekbones i could easily imagine him in command of a dragon ship deepsunk eyes gleaming with avarice and lust as he peered through the fog at some rocky coastal village a large hand wrist lightly haired with copper reached past me to take a small loaf of oatbread from the tray another norseman jamie he reminded me of mrs bairds legends of the race of giants who once walked scotland and laid their long bones in the earth of the north the conversation was general as it usually was small groups buzzing between mouthfuls but my ears suddenly caught a familiar name spoken at a nearby table sandringham i thought the voice was murtaghs and turned around to see he was seated next to ned gowan munching industriously sandringham ah old willie the arsebandit said ned meditatively what said one of the younger menatarms choking on his ale our revered duke has something of a taste for boys or so i understand ned explained mmm agreed rupert his mouth full swallowing he added had a wee bit of a taste for young jamie here last time he visited these parts if i remember rightly that were when dougal thirtyeight thirtynine thirtyseven dougal answered from the next table he narrowed his eyes at his nephew ye were rather a pretty lad at sixteen jamie jamie nodded chewing aye fast too when the laughter had died down dougal began to tease jamie i didna ken ye were a favorite jamie lad theres several about the duke as ha traded a sore arse for lands and offices yell notice i havena got either one responded jamie with a grin to further roars of laughter what never even got close said rupert chewing noisily a good bit closer than i would have liked truth be known ah but how close would ye ha liked it hey lad the shout came from further down the table from a tall brownbearded man i didnt recognize and was greeted with more laughter and ribald remarks jamie smiled tranquilly and reached for another loaf undisturbed by the teasing is that why ye left the castle so sudden and went back to your father asked rupert aye why ye should ha told me ye were having trouble that way jamie lad said dougal with mock concern jamie made a low scottish noise in his throat and if id told ye about it you old rogue ye would have slipped a bit of poppy juice in my ale some evening and left me in his graces bed as a wee gift the table roared and jamie dodged as dougal hurled an onion at him rupert squinted across at jamie seems to me lad i saw ye soon before ye left goin into the dukes chambers near nightfall yere sure yere not holdin back on us jamie grabbed another onion and threw it at him it missed and rolled away into the rushes nay jamie said laughing im a maiden still that way at least but if ye must know all about it before you can sleep rupert ill tell ye and welcome amid shouts of tell tell he deliberately poured a mug of ale and sat back in the classic storytellers posture i could see colum at the head table head cocked forward to hear as attentive as the ostlers and fightingmen at our table well he began its true enough what ned says his grace had something of an eye for me though being the innocent i was at sixteen here he was interrupted by a number of cynical remarks and raised his voice to go on bein as i say innocent of such carryings on id no idea what he meant though it seemed a bit strange to me the way his grace was always wanting to pat me like a wee dog and was so interested in what i might ha in my sporran or under it shouted a drunken voice i thought it stranger still he went on when he found me washing myself at the river and wanted to wash my back for me when he finished my back and went on wi the rest i began to get a wee bit nervous and when he put his hand under my kilts i began to get the general idea i may have been an innocent but no a complete fool ye ken i got out of that particular situation by diving into the water kilts and all and swimming across to the other side his grace being not of a mind to risk his costly clothes in the mud and water anyway after that i was verra wary of being alone with him he caught me once or twice in the garden or the courtyard but there was room to get away wi no more harm than him kissing my ear the only other bad time was when he came on me alone in the stables in my stables old alec looked aghast he halfrose to his feet and called across the room to the head table colum yell see that man stays oot o my sheds ill not have him frightening my horses duke or no or troubling the boys neither he added as an obvious afterthought jamie went on with his story unperturbed by the interruption dougals two teenaged daughters were listening raptly mouths slightly agape i was in a horsebox ye ken and there wasna room to maneuver much i was bendin over more ribald remarks bendin over the manger i say muckin up husks from the bottom when i hear a sound behind me and before i can straighten up my kilts are tossed up round my waist and theres something hard pressed against my arse he waved a hand to still the tumult before going on weel i didna care much for the thought of being buggered in a horsebox but i didna see much way out at that point either i was just gritting my teeth and hoping it wouldnt hurt too much when the horse it was that big black gelding ned the one ye got at brocklebury you know the one colum sold to breadalbin anyway the horse took an objection to the noise his grace was making now most horses like ye to talk to them and so did that one but he had a peculiar aversion to verra high voices i couldna take him in the yard when there were small bairns about because hed get nervous at their squeaks and start pawing and stamping his grace ye might recall has a rather highpitched voice and it was a bit higher than usual on this occasion him bein a trifle excited weel as i say the horse didna care for it nor did i i must say and he starts stamping and snorting and swings his body round and squashes his grace flat against the side of the box as soon as the duke let go of me i jumped into the manger and eased away round the other side of the horse leavin his grace to get out as best he might jamie paused for breath and a sip of ale he had the attention of the whole room by this time faces turned toward him gleaming in the light of the torchères here and there might have been discerned a frown at these revelations concerning a most puissant noble of the english crown but the overriding reaction was an untrammeled delight in the scandal i gathered that the duke was not a particularly popular personage at castle leoch havin been so close as ye might say his grace made up his mind as hed have me come what might so next day he tells the mackenzie that his body servants fallen ill and can he borrow me to help him wash and dress colum covered his face in mock dismay to the amusement of the crowd jamie nodded to rupert thats why ye saw me go to his graces room in the evening under orders ye might say you could have told me jamie id not have made you go colum called with a look of reproach jamie shrugged and grinned i was prevented by my natural modesty uncle besides i knew ye were trying to deal with the man i thought it might impair your negotiations a bit if you were forced to tell his grace to keep his hands off your nephews bum very thoughtful of you jamie said colum dryly so you sacrificed yourself for my interests did you jamie raised his mug in a mocktoast your interests are always foremost in my mind uncle he said and i thought that in spite of the teasing tone there was a sharp undercurrent of truth to this one that colum perceived as well as i he drained the mug and set it down but no he said wiping his mouth in this case i didna feel that family duty required quite that much of me i went to the dukes rooms because you told me to but that was all and ye came out again wi yer arsehole unstretched rupert sounded skeptical jamie grinned aye i did ye see directly i heard about it i went to mrs fitz and told her i was in desperate need of a dose of syrup of figs when she gave it to me i saw where she put the bottle and i came back quiet a bit later and drank the whole lot the room rocked with laughter including mrs fitz who turned so red in the face i thought she might have a seizure she rose ceremoniously from her place waddled round the table and cuffed jamie goodnaturedly on the ear so thats what became of my good physick ye young wretch hands on her hips she wagged her head making the green earbobbles wink like dragonflies the best lot i ever made too oh it was most effective he assured her laughing up at the massive dame i should think so when i think what that much physick must have done to your innards lad i hope it was worth it to ye ye canna have been much good to yourself for days after he shook his head still laughing i wasnt but then i wasna much good for what his grace had in mind either he did not seem to mind at all when i begged leave to remove myself from his presence but i knew i couldna do it twice so as soon as the cramps eased up i got a horse from the stables and lit out it took a long time to get home since i had to stop every ten minutes or so but i made it by supper next day dougal beckoned for a new jug of ale which he passed down the board handtohand to jamie aye your father sent word he thought perhaps youd learned enough of castle life for the present he said smiling ruefully i thought there was a tone to his letter i did not quite understand at the time weel i hope yeve laid up a new batch of fig syrup mrs fitz rupert interrupted poking her familiarly in the ribs his grace is like to be here in a day or two or are ye counting on your new wife to guard ye this time jamie he leered at me from all accounts ye may need to guard her i hear the dukes servant does not share his graces preferences though hes every bit as active jamie pushed back the bench and rose from the table handing me out he put an arm around my shoulders and smiled back at rupert well then i suppose the two of us will just have to fight it out backtoback ruperts eyes flew open in horrified dismay back to back he exclaimed i knew wed forgot to tell ye something before your wedding lad no wonder youve not got her with child yet jamies hand tightened on my shoulder turning me toward the archway and we made our escape pelted by a hail of laughter and bawdy advice in the dark hall outside jamie leaned against the stones doubled over unable to stand i sank to the ground at his feet and giggled helplessly you didnt tell him did you jamie gasped at last i shook my head no of course not still wheezing i groped for his hand and he hauled me upright i collapsed against his chest let me see if ive got it right now he cupped my face between his hands and pressed his forehead to mine face so close that his eyes blurred into one large blue orb and his breath was warm on my chin face to face is that it the fizz of laughter was dying down in my blood replaced by something else just as potent i touched my tongue against his lips while my hands busied themselves lower down faces are not the essential parts but youre learning next day i was in my surgery listening patiently to an elderly lady from the village some relation to the soup cook who was rather garrulously detailing her daughterinlaws bout with the morbid sore throat which theoretically had something to do with her current complaint of quinsy though i couldnt at the moment see the connection a shadow fell across the doorway interrupting the old ladys catalog of symptoms i looked up startled to see jamie rush in followed by old alec both men looking worried and excited jamie unceremoniously removed the makeshift tongue depressor i was holding and pulled me to my feet clasping both hands between his own what i began but was interrupted by alec peering over jamies shoulder at my hands which jamie was displaying to him aye thats verra weel but the arms man has she the arm for it look jamie grasped one of my hands and stretched my arm out straight measuring it along one of his weel said alec examining it doubtfully could do aye it could would you care to tell me what you think youre doing i inquired but before i could finish i was being hustled down the stairs between the two men leaving my aged patient to gape after us in perplexity a few moment later i was dubiously eyeing the large shiny brown hindquarters of a horse located some six inches from my face the problem had been made clear on the way to the stables jamie explaining and old alec chiming in with remarks imprecations and interjections losgann customarily a good foaler and a prize member of colums stable was having trouble this much i could see for myself the mare lay on her side and periodically the shining flanks heaved and the enormous body seemed to shiver down on hands and knees at the rear of the horse i could see the lips of the vagina gape slightly with each contraction but nothing further happened no sight of tiny hoof or delicate wet nose appeared at the opening the foal a late one was evidently presenting sideon or backward alec thought sideon jamie thought backward and they paused to argue about it for a moment until i impatiently called the meeting to order to ask what they expected me to do about it in either case jamie looked at me as though i were a bit simple turn the foal of course he said patiently bring the forelegs round so it can get out oh is that all i looked at the horse losgann whose elegant name actually meant frog was delicately boned for a horse but bloody big for all that er reach inside you mean i glanced covertly at my hand it probably would fit the opening was big enough but what then both mens hands were clearly too big for the job and roderick the stable lad who was usually pressed into service in such delicate situations was of course immobilized with a splint and sling of my devising on his right arm he had broken his arm two days before willie the other stable lad had gone to fetch roderick nonetheless to give advice and moral encouragement at this juncture he arrived clad in nothing but a pair of ragged breeches thin chest glimmering whitely in the dim stable its hard work he said dubiously apprised of the situation and the suggestion that i substitute for him tricky ye ken theres a knack to it but it takes a bit of strength as well nay worry said jamie confidently claires stronger by far than you ye poor weed if youll but tell her what to feel for and what to do shell have it round in no time i appreciated the vote of confidence but was in no way so sanguine myself telling myself firmly that this was no worse than assisting at abdominal surgery i retired to a stall to change my gown for breeches and a rough smock of sacking and lathered my hand and arm up to the shoulder with greasy tallow soap well over the top i muttered under my breath and slid my hand inside there was very little room to maneuver and at first i couldnt tell what i was feeling i closed my eyes to concentrate better though and groped cautiously there were smooth expanses and bumpy bits the smooth parts would be body and the bumps legs or head it was legs i wanted forelegs to be specific gradually i became accustomed to the feel of things and the necessity for keeping quite still when a contraction came on the amazingly powerful muscles of the uterus clamped down on my hand and arm like a vise grinding my own bones very painfully until the constriction eased and i could resume my groping at last my fumbling fingers encountered something i was sure of ive got my fingers in its nose i cried triumphantly ive found the head good lass good dinna let go alec crouched anxiously alongside patting the mare reassuringly as another contraction set in i gritted my teeth and leaned my forehead against the shining rump as my wrist was crushed by the force it eased though and i kept my grip feeling cautiously upward i found the curve of eyesocket and brow and the small ridge of the folded ear waiting through one more contraction i followed the curve of the neck down to the shoulder its got its head turned back on its shoulder i reported the heads pointing the right way at least good jamie at the horses head ran his hand soothingly down the sweating chestnut neck likely the legs will be folded under the chest see can you get a hand on one knee so it went on feeling fumbling up to my shoulder in the warm darkness of the horse feeling the awful force of the birth pangs and their grateful easing struggling blindly to reach my goal i felt rather as though i were giving birth myself and bloody hard work it was too at last i had my hand on a hoof i could feel the rounded surface and the sharp edge of the yetunused curve following the anxious often contradictory instructions of my guides as best i could i alternately pulled and pushed easing the unwieldy mass of the foal around bringing one foot forward pushing another back sweating and groaning along with the mare and then suddenly everything worked a contraction eased and all at once everything slid smoothly into place i waited not moving for the next contraction it came and a small wet nose popped suddenly out pushing my hand out with it the tiny nostrils flared briefly as though interested in this new sensation then the nose vanished next one will do it alec was almost dancing in ecstasy his arthritic form capering up and down in the hay come on losgann come on my sweet wee froggie as though in answer there was a convulsive grunt from the mare her hindquarters flexed sharply and the foal slid smoothly onto the clean hay in a slither of knobbly legs and big ears i sat back on the hay grinning idiotically i was covered with soap and slime and blood exhausted and aching and smelt strongly of the less pleasant aspects of horse i was euphoric i sat watching as willy and the onehanded roderick tended the new arrival wiping him down with wisps of straw and cheered with the rest when losgann turned and licked him butting him gently and nosing him to stand at last on his huge wobbly feet a damn good job lassie damn good alec was exuberant pumping my unslimed hand in congratulation suddenly realizing that i was swaying on my perch and much less than presentable he turned and barked at one of the lads to bring some water then he circled behind me and set his horny old hands on my shoulders with an amazingly deft and gentle touch he pressed and stroked easing the strain in my shoulders relaxing the knots in my neck there lassie he said at last hard work no he smiled down at me then beamed adoringly at the new colt bonny laddie he crooned whos a sweet lad then jamie helped me to clean up and change my fingers were too stiff to manage the buttons of my bodice and i knew my entire arm would be blue with bruising by morning but i felt thoroughly peaceful and contented the rain seemed to have lasted forever so that when a day finally dawned bright and fair i squinted in the daylight like a newly emerged mole your skin is so fine i can see the blood moving beneath it jamie said tracing the path of a sunbeam across my bare stomach i could follow the veins from your hand to your heart he drew his finger gently up my wrist to the bend of the elbow up the inner side of my upper arm and across the slope below my collarbone thats the subclavian vein i remarked looking down my nose at the path of his tracking finger is it oh aye because its below your clavicle tell me some more the finger moved slowly downward i like to hear the latin names for things i never dreamed it would be so pleasant to make love to a physician that i said primly is an areola and you know it because i told you last week so ye did he murmured and theres another one fancy that the bright head dipped to let his tongue replace the finger then traveled lower umbilicus i said with a short gasp um he said muffled lips stretching in a smile against my transparent skin and whats this then you tell me i said clutching his head but he was incapable of speech later i lounged in my surgery chair basking dreamily in memories of awaking in a bed of sunbeams sheets tumbled in blinding shoals of white like the sands of a beach one hand rested on my breast and i toyed idly with the nipple enjoying the feel of it rising against my palm beneath the thin calico of my bodice enjoying yourself the sarcastic voice from the door brought me upright so quickly that i bumped my head on a shelf oh i said rather grumpily geilie who else what are you doing here she glided into the surgery moving as though on wheels i knew she had feet id seen them what i couldnt figure out was where she put them when she walked i came to bring mrs fitz some saffron from spain she was wanting it against the dukes coming more spices i said beginning to recover my good humor if the man eats half the things shes fixing for him theyll need to roll him home they could do that now hes a wee round ball of a fellow ive heard dismissing the duke and his physique she asked whether id like to join her for an expedition to the nearby foothills im needing a bit of moss she explained she waved her long boneless hands gracefully to and fro makes a wonderful lotion for the hands boiled in milk with a bit of sheeps wool i cast a look up at my slit window where the dust motes were going mad in the golden light a faint scent of ripe fruit and freshcut hay floated on the breeze why not waiting as i gathered my baskets and bottles together geilie strolled about my surgery picking things up and putting them down at random she stopped at a small table and picked up the object that lay there frowning whats this i stopped what i was doing and came to stand beside her she was holding a small bundle of dried plants tied with three twisted threads black white and red jamie says its an illwish hes right where did ye come to get it i told her about the finding of the small bundle in my bed i went and found it under the window next day where jamie threw it i meant to bring it round to your house and ask if you knew anything about it but i forgot she stood tapping a fingernail thoughtfully against her front teeth shaking her head no i canna say that i do but there might be a way of finding out who left it for ye really aye come to my house in the morning tomorrow and ill tell ye then refusing to say more she whirled about in a swirl of green cloak leaving me to follow as i would she led me well up into the foothills galloping when there was road enough to do so walking when there wasnt an hours ride from the village she stopped near a small brook overhung by willows we forded the brook and wandered up into the foothills gathering such late summer plants as still lingered together with the ripening berries of early autumn and the thick yellow shelf fungus that sprouted from the trunks of trees in the small shady glens geilies figure disappeared into the bracken above me as i paused to scrape a bit of aspen bark into my basket the globules of dried sap on the papery bark looked like frozen drops of blood the deep crimson refulgent with trapped sunlight a sound startled me out of my reverie and i looked up the hill in the direction it seemed to come from i heard the sound again a highpitched mewling cry it seemed to come from above from a rocky notch near the crest of the hill i set my basket down and began to climb geilie i shouted come up here someones left a baby the sound of scrabbling and muttered imprecations preceded her up the hill as she fought her way through the entangling bushes on the slope her fair face was flushed and cross and she had twigs in her hair what in gods name she began and then darted forward christs blood put it down she hastily snatched the baby from my arms then laid it back where i had found it in a small depression in the rock the smooth bowlshaped hollow was less than a yard across at one side of the hollow was a shallow wooden bowl halffull of fresh milk and at the babys feet was a small bouquet of wildflowers tied with a bit of red twine but its sick i protested stooping toward the child again who would leave a sick child up here by itself the baby was plainly very ill the small pinched face was greenish with dark hollows under the eyes and the little fists waved weakly under the blanket the child had hung slack in my arms when i picked it up i wondered that it had had the strength to cry its parents geilie said briefly restraining me with a hand on my arm leave it lets get out of here its parents i said indignantly but its a changeling she said impatiently leave it and come now dragging me with her she dodged back into the undergrowth protesting i followed her down the slope until we arrived breathless and red faced at the bottom where i forced her to stop what is this i demanded we cant just abandon a sick child out in the open like that and what do you mean its a changeling a changeling she said impatiently surely you know what a changeling is when the fairies steal a human child away they leave one of their own in its place you know its a changeling because it cries and fusses all the time and doesnt thrive or grow of course i know what it is i said but you dont believe that nonsense do you she shot me a sudden strange look full of wary suspicion then the lines of her face relaxed into their normal expression of halfamused cynicism no i dont she admitted but the folk here do she glanced nervously up the slope but no further sound came from the rocky notch the family will be somewhere near about lets go reluctantly i allowed her to tow me away in the direction of the village why did they put it up there i asked sitting on a rock to remove my stockings before wading across a small stream do they hope the wee folk will come and cure it i was still bothered about the child it seemed desperately ill i didnt know what was wrong with it but perhaps i could help maybe i could leave geilie in the village then come back for the child it would have to be soon though i glanced up at the eastern sky where soft grey rain clouds were swiftly darkening into purple dusk a pink glow still showed to the west but there could be no more than half an hours light left geilie looped the twisted withy handle of her basket over her neck picked up her skirt and stepped into the stream shivering at the cold water no she said or rather yes thats one of the fairies hills and its dangerous to sleep there if ye leave a changeling out overnight in such a place the folk will come and take it back and leave the human child theyve stolen in its place but they wont because it isnt a changeling i said sucking in my breath at the touch of the melted snow water its only a sick child it might very well not survive a night in the open it wont she said briefly it will be dead by morning and i hope to god no one saw us near it i stopped abruptly in the midst of putting on my shoes dead geilie im going back for it i cant leave it there i turned and started back across the stream she caught me from behind and pushed me flat on my face into the shallow water floundering and gasping i managed to rise to my knees sloshing water in all directions geilie stood calfdeep in the stream skirts soaked glaring down at me you bloody pigheaded english ass she shouted at me theres nothing ye can do do ye hear me nothing that childs as good as dead ill not stand here and let ye risk your own life and mine for some crackbrained notion of yours snorting and grumbling under her breath she reached down and got me under the arms with both hands lugging me to my feet claire she said urgently shaking me by the arms listen to me if ye go near that child and it dies and it will believe me ive seen them like that then the family will blame you for it do ye no see the danger of it dont ye know what they say about you in the village i stood shivering in the cold breeze of sunset torn between her obvious panic for my safety and the thought of a helpless child slowly dying alone in the dark with wildflowers at its feet no i said shaking the wet hair out of my face geilie no i cant ill be careful i promise but i have to go i pulled myself out of her grasp and turned toward the far bank stumbling and splashing in the uncertain shadows of the streambed there was a muffled cry of exasperation from behind me then a frenzied sploshing in the opposite direction well at least she wouldnt hamper me further it was growing dark fast and i pushed through the bushes and weeds as quickly as i could i wasnt sure that i could find the right hill if it grew dark before i reached it there were several nearby all about the same height and fairies or not the thought of wandering about alone out here in the dark was not one i cared for the question of how i was going to make it back to the castle with a sick baby was something i would deal with when the time came i found the hill finally by spotting the stand of young larches i remembered at the base it was nearly full dark by this time a moonless night and i stumbled and fell frequently the larches stood huddled together talking quietly in the evening breeze with clicks and creaks and rustling sighs bloody place is haunted i thought listening to the leafy conversation overhead as i threaded my way through the slender trunks i wouldnt be surprised to meet a ghost behind the next tree i was surprised though actually i was scared out of my wits when the shadowy figure slid out and grabbed me i let out a piercing shriek and struck at it jesus christ i said what are you doing here i crumpled for a moment against jamies chest relieved to see him in spite of the fright he had given me he took me by the arm and turned to lead me out of the wood came for you he said low voiced i was coming to meet you because night was comin on i met geillis duncan near st johns brook and she told me where you were but the baby i began turning back toward the hill the childs dead he said briefly tugging me back i went up there first to see i followed him then without demur distressed over the childs death but relieved that i would not after all have to face the climb to the fairies crest or the long journey back alone oppressed by the dark and the whispering trees i didnt speak until we had crossed the brook again still damp from the previous immersion i didnt bother removing my stockings but sloshed across regardless jamie still dry stayed that way by leaping from the bank to a central boulder that stood above the current then vaulted to my bank like a broadjumper have ye any idea how dangerous it is to be out alone at night like that sassenach he inquired he didnt seem angry just curious no i mean yes im sorry if i worried you but i couldnt leave a child out there i just couldnt aye i know he hugged me briefly youve a kind heart sassenach but youve no idea what youre dealing with here fairies hm i was tired and disturbed over the incident but covered it with flippancy im not afraid of superstitions a thought struck me do you believe in fairies and changelings and all that he hesitated for a moment before answering no no i dinna believe in such things though damned if id care to sleep all night on a fairies hill for a that but im an educated man sassenach i had a german tutor at dougals house a good one who taught me latin and greek and such and later when i went to france at eighteen well i studied history and philosophy and i saw that there was a good deal more to the world than the glens and the moors and the waterhorses in the lochs but these people he waved an arm taking in the darkness behind us theyve neer been more than a days walk from the place they were born except for a great thing like a clan gathering and that might happen twice in a lifetime they live among the glens and the lochs and they hear no more of the world than what father bain tells them in kirk of a sunday that and the old stories he held aside an alder branch and i stooped under it we were on the deer trail geilie and i had followed earlier and i was heartened by this fresh evidence that he could find his way even in the dark away from the fairies hill he spoke in his normal voice only pausing occasionally to brush away some tangling growth from his path those tales are naught but entertainment in gwyllyns hands when ye sit in the hall drinking rhenish wine he preceded me down the path and his voice floated back to me soft and emphatic in the cool night air out here though and even in the village nay thats something else folk live by them i suppose theres some truth behind some of them i thought of the amber eyes of the waterhorse and wondered which others were true and others well his voice grew softer and i had to strain to hear him for the parents of that child maybe it will ease them a bit to believe it is the changeling who died and think of their own child healthy and well living forever with the fairies we reached the horses then and within half an hour the lights of castle leoch shone through the darkness to welcome us i had never thought i would consider that bleak edifice an outpost of advanced civilization but just now the lights seemed those of a beacon of enlightenment it was not until we drew closer that i realized the impression of light was due to the string of lanterns blazing along the parapet of the bridge somethings happened i said turning to jamie and seeing him for the first time in the light i realized that he was not wearing his usual worn shirt and grubby kilt his snowy linen shone in the lantern light and his best his only velvet coat lay across his saddle aye he nodded thats why i came to get you the dukes come at last the duke was something of a surprise i dont know quite what i had been expecting but it wasnt the bluff hearty redfaced sportsman i met in leochs hall he had a pleasantly blunt weatherbeaten face with light blue eyes that always squinted slightly as though looking into the sun after the flight of a pheasant i wondered for a moment whether that earlier bit of theatrics regarding the duke might have been overstated looking around the hall though i noticed that every boy under eighteen wore a slightly wary expression keeping his eyes fixed on the duke as he laughed and talked animatedly with colum and dougal not merely theatrics then they had been warned when i was presented to the duke i had some difficulty in keeping a straight face he was a big man fit and solid the sort you so often see booming out their opinions in pubs bearing down the opposition by dint of loudness and repetition i had been warned of course by jamies story but the physical impression was so overwhelming that when the duke bowed low over my hand and said but how charming to find a countrywoman in this remote spot mistress in a voice like an overwrought mouse i had to bite the inside of my cheek to keep from disgracing myself in public worn out from travel the duke and his party retired early to bed the next night though there was music and conversation after dinner and jamie and i joined colum dougal and the duke sandringham grew expansive over colums rhenish wine and talked volubly expounding equally upon the horrors of travel in the highlands and the beauties of the countryside we listened politely and i tried not to catch jamies eye as the duke squeaked out the story of his travails broke an axletree outside of stirling and we were becalmed three days in the pouring rain mind you before my footman could find a blacksmith to come and repair the blasted thing and not half a day later we bounced into the most tremendous pothole ive ever seen and broke the damn thing again and then one horse threw a shoe and we had to unload the coach and walk beside it in the mud leading the lame nag and then as the tale went on from misfortune to misfortune i felt an increasing urge to giggle and attempted to drown it with more wine possibly an error in judgment but the game mackenzie the game the duke exclaimed at one point rolling his eyes in ecstasy i could scarce believe it no wonder you set such a table he gently patted his large solid stomach i swear id give my eyeteeth for a try at a stag like the one we saw two days ago splendid beast simply splendid leapt out of the brush right in front of the coach mdear he confided to me startled the horses so we near as a toucher went off the road again colum raised the bellshaped decanter with an inquiring cock of one dark brow as he poured to the proffered glasses he said well perhaps we might arrange a hunt for ye your grace my nephews a bonny huntsman he glanced sharply from under his brows at jamie there was a scarcely perceptible nod in response colum sat back replacing the decanter and said casually aye thatll do well then perhaps early next week its too early for pheasant but the stag hunting will be fine he turned to dougal lounging in a padded chair to one side my brother might go along if you have it in mind to travel northwards he can show ye the lands we were discussing earlier capital capital the duke was delighted he patted jamie on the leg i saw the muscles tighten but jamie didnt move he smiled tranquilly and the duke let his hand linger just a moment too long then his grace caught my eye on him and smiled jovially at me his expression saying worth a try eh despite myself i smiled back much to my surprise i quite liked the man in the excitement of the dukes arrival i had forgotten geilies offer to help me discover the sender of the illwish and after the unpleasant scene with the changeling child on the fairies hill i wasnt sure that i wanted to try anything she might suggest still curiosity overcame suspicion and when colum asked jamie to ride down and escort the duncans to the castle for the dukes banquet two days later i went with him thus it was that thursday found me and jamie in the duncans parlor being entertained with a sort of awkward friendliness by the fiscal while his wife finished her dressing upstairs largely recovered from the effects of his last gastric attack arthur still did not look terribly healthy like many fat men who lose too much weight abruptly the weight had gone from his face rather than his stomach his paunch still swelled the green silk of his waistcoat while the skin of his face drooped in flabby folds perhaps i could slip upstairs and help geilie with her hair or something i suggested ive brought her a new ribbon foreseeing the possible need of an excuse for talking to geilie alone i had brought a small package with me producing it as an excuse i was through the door and up the stairs before arthur could protest she was ready for me come on she said well go up to my private room for this well have to hurry but it wont take too long i followed geilie up the narrow twisting stair the steps were irregular heights some of the risers were so high i had to lift my skirts to avoid tripping on the way up i concluded that seventeenthcentury carpenters either had faulty methods of measuring or rich senses of humor geilies private sanctum was at the top of the house in one of the remote attics above the servants quarters it was guarded by a locked door opened by a truly formidable key which geilie produced from her apron pocket it must have been at least six inches long with a broad fretwork head ornamented with a vineandflower pattern the key must have weighed nearly a pound held by the barrel it would have made a good weapon both lock and hinges were well oiled and the thick door swung inward silently the attic room was small cramped by the gabled dormers that cut across the front of the house shelves lined every inch of wall space holding jars bottles flasks vials and beakers bunches of drying herbs carefully tied with threads of different colors hung neatly in rows from the rafters overhead brushing my hair with a fragrant dust as we passed beneath this was nothing like the clean businesslike order of the herb room downstairs though it was crowded almost cluttered and dark in spite of the dormer windows one shelf held books mostly old and crumbling the spines unmarked i ran a curious finger over the row of leather bindings most were calf but there were two or three bound in something different something soft but unpleasantly oily to the touch and one that to all appearances was bound in fish skin i pulled a volume out and opened it gingerly it was handwritten in a mixture of archaic french and even more obsolete latin but i could make out the title lgrimoire dle comte st germain i closed the book and set it back on the shelf feeling a slight shock a grimoire a handbook of magic i could feel geilies gaze boring into my back and turned to meet a mixture of mischief and wary speculation what would i do now that i knew so it isnt a rumor then is it i said smiling you really are a witch i wondered just how far it went and whether she believed it herself or whether these were merely the trappings of an elaborate makebelieve that she used to alleviate the boredom of marriage to arthur i also wondered just what sort of magic she practiced or thought she practiced oh white she said grinning definitely white magic i thought ruefully that jamie must be right about my face everyone seemed to be able to tell what i was thinking well thats good i said im really not much of a one for dancing round bonfires at midnight and riding brooms let alone kissing the devils arse geilie tossed back her hair and laughed delightedly ye dont kiss anyones much that i can see she said nor do i though if i had a sweet fiery devil like yours in my bed ill not say i might not come to it in time that reminds me i began but she had already turned away and was about her preparations murmuring to herself checking first to see that the door was securely locked behind us geilie crossed to the gabled window and rummaged in a chest built into the window seat she pulled out a large shallow pan and a tall white candle stuck in a pottery holder a further foray produced a worn quilt which she spread on the floor as protection against dust and splinters what exactly is it youre planning to do geilie i asked examining the preparations suspiciously offhand i couldnt see much sinister intent in a pan a candle and a quilt but then i was a novice magician to say the least summoning she said tugging the corners of the quilt around so that the sides lay straight with the boards of the floor summoning whom i asked or what she stood and brushed her hair back babyfine and slippery it was coming down from its fastenings muttering she yanked the pins from her hair and let it fall down in a straight shiny curtain the color of heavy cream oh ghosts spirits visions anything ye might have need of she said it starts the same in any case but the herbs and the words are different for each thing what we want now is a vision to see who it is whos illwished ye then we can turn the illwish back upon them er well i really had no wish to be vindictive but i was curious both to see what summoning was like and to know who had left me the illwish setting the pan in the middle of the quilt she poured water into it from a jug explaining you can use any vessel big enough to make a good reflection though the grimoire says to use a silver bassin even a pond or a puddle of water outside will do for some kinds of summoning though it must be secluded ye need peace and quiet to do this she passed rapidly from window to window drawing the heavy black curtains until virtually all the light in the room was extinguished i could barely see geilies slender form flitting through the gloom until she lit the candle the wavering flame lit her face as she carried it back to the quilt throwing wedgeshaped shadows under the bold nose and chiseled jaw she set the candle next to the pan of water on the side away from me she filled the pan very carefully so full that the water bulged slightly above the rim kept from spilling by its surface tension leaning over i could see that the surface of the water provided an excellent reflection far better than that obtainable in any of the castles looking glasses as though mind reading again geilie explained that in addition to its use in summoning spirits the reflecting pan was an excellent accessory for dressing the hair dont bump into it or youll get soaked she advised frowning in concentration as she lit the candle something about the practical tone of the remark so prosaic in the midst of these supernatural preparations reminded me of someone looking up at the slender pallid figure stooping elegantly over the tinderbox i couldnt think at first of whom she reminded me but of course while no one could be less like that dowdy figure athwart the teapot in reverend wakefields study the tone of voice had been that of mrs graham exactly perhaps it was an attitude they shared a pragmatism that regarded the occult as merely a collection of phenomena like the weather something to be approached with cautious respect of course much as one would take care in using a sharp kitchen knife but certainly nothing to avoid or fear or it might have been the smell of lavender water geilies loose flowing gowns smelled always of the essences she distilled marigold chamomile bay leaf spikenard mint marjoram today though it was lavender that drifted from the folds of the white dress the same scent that permeated mrs grahams practical blue cotton and wafted from the corrugations of her bony chest if geilies chest was likewise underlaid by such skeletal supports there was no hint of it visible in spite of her robes low neckline it was the first time i had seen geilie duncan en déshabille customarily she wore the severe and voluminous gowns buttoned high at the neck that were suitable to the wife of a fiscal the swelling opulence now revealed was a surprise a creamy abundance almost the same shade as the dress she wore and gave me some idea why a man like arthur duncan might have married a penniless girl of no family my eye went involuntarily to the line of neatly labeled jars along the wall looking for saltpeter geilie selected three of the jars from the shelf pouring a small quantity from each into the bowl of a tiny metal brazier she lit the layer of charcoal underneath from the candle flame and blew on the dawning flame to encourage it a fragrant smoke began to rise as the spark took hold the air in the attic was so still that the greyish smoke rose straight up without diffusing forming a column that echoed the shape of the tall white candle geilie sat between the two columns like a priestess in her temple legs folded gracefully under her well then that will do nicely i think briskly dusting crumbs of rosemary from her fingers geilie surveyed the scene with satisfaction the black drapes with their mystic symbols shut out all intrusive beams of sunlight and left the candle as the only source of direct illumination the flame was reflected and diffused through the pan of still water which seemed to glow as though it too were a source rather than a reflection of light what now i inquired the large grey eyes glowed like the water alight with anticipation she waved her hands across the surface of the water then folded them between her legs just sit quiet for a moment she said listen to your heartbeat do you hear it breathe easy slow and deep in spite of the liveliness of her expression her voice was calm and slow a distinct contrast to her usual sprightly conversation i obediently did as she instructed feeling my heart slow as my breathing steadied to an even rhythm i recognized the scent of rosemary in the smoke but i wasnt sure of the other two herbs foxglove perhaps or cinquefoil i had thought the purple flowers were those of nightshade but surely that couldnt be whatever they were the slowness of my breathing did not seem to be attributable only to the power of geilies suggestion i felt as though a weight were pressing against my breastbone slowing my breathing without my having to will it geilie herself sat perfectly still watching me with unblinking eyes she nodded once and i looked down obediently into the still surface of the water she began to talk in an even conversational way that reminded me again of mrs graham calling down the sun in the circle of stones the words were not english and yet not quite not english either it was a strange tongue but one i felt that i should know as though the words were spoken just below the level of my hearing i felt my hands begin to go numb and wanted to move them from their folded position in my lap but they wouldnt move her even voice went on soft and persuading now i knew that i understood what was being said but still could not summon the words to the surface of my mind i realized dimly that i was either being hypnotized or under the influence of some drug and my mind took some last foothold on the edge of conscious thought resisting the pull of the sweetscented smoke i could see my reflection in the water pupils shrunk to pinpoints eyes wide as a sunblind owls the word opium drifted through my fading thoughts who are you i couldnt tell which of us had asked the question but i felt my own throat move as i answered claire who sent you here i came why did you come i cant tell why cant you tell because no one will believe me the voice in my head grew still more soothing friendly beguiling i will believe you believe me who are you claire a sudden loud noise broke the spell geilie started and her knee bumped the bassin startling the reflection back into the water geillis my dear a voice called through the door tentative yet commanding we must be going my dear the horses are ready and youre not yet gowned muttering something rude under her breath geilie rose and flung open the window so that the fresh air rushed into my face making me blink and dispelling some of the fog in my head she stood looking down at me speculatively then stooped to help me up come along then she said come over a bit queer have you sometimes it takes folk that way youd best lie down on my bed while i dress i lay flat on the coverlet in her bedroom below eyes closed listening to the small rustling noises geilie made in her privy closet wondering what the hell that had been all about nothing to do with the illwish or its sender clearly only with my identity with sharpness returning gradually to my wits it occurred to me to wonder whether geilie perhaps was a spy for colum placed as she was she heard the business and the secrets of the whole district and who other than colum would be so interested in my origins what would have happened i wondered had arthur not interrupted the summoning would i have heard somewhere in the scented fog the standard hypnotists injunction when you wake you will remember nothing but i did remember and i wondered in the event however there was no chance to ask geilie about it the bedroom door flew open and arthur duncan came in crossing to the door of the privy closet he knocked once hastily and went in there was a small startled scream from within and then dead silence arthur duncan reappeared in the door eyes wide and staringblind face so white that i thought perhaps he was suffering an attack of some sort i leaped to my feet and hurried toward him as he leaned heavily against the door jamb before i reached him though he pushed himself away from the door and went out of the room staggering slightly pushing past me as though he didnt see me i knocked on the door myself geilie are you all right there was a moments silence then a perfectly composed voice said aye of course ill be out in a moment when we at length descended the stairs we found arthur apparently somewhat recovered sipping brandy with jamie he seemed a bit abstracted as though he were thinking of something but greeted his wife with a mild compliment on her appearance before sending the groom for the horses the banquet was just beginning as we arrived and the fiscal and his wife were shown to their places of honor at the head table jamie and i somewhat lower in status took our places at a table with rupert and ned gowan mrs fitz had excelled herself and beamed in gratification at the compliments heaped upon the food the drink and other preparations it was in fact delicious i had never tasted roast pheasant stuffed with honeyed chestnuts and was helping myself to a third slice when ned gowan watching in some amusement at my appetite asked whether i had yet tried the suckling pig my reply was interrupted by a stir at the far end of the hall colum had risen from his table and was headed toward me accompanied by old alec macmahon i see there is no end to your talents mistress fraser colum remarked bowing slightly a broad smile marked the arresting features from dressing wounds and healing the sick to delivering foals we shall be calling upon you to raise the dead before long i suppose there was a general chuckle at this though i noticed one or two men glancing nervously in the direction of father bain in attendance this evening who was methodically stuffing himself with roast mutton in the corner in any case colum continued reaching into his coat pocket you must allow me to present you with a small token of my gratitude he handed me a small wooden box lid carved with the mackenzie badge i hadnt realized just how valuable a horse losgann was and mentally thanked whatever benign spirits presided over such events that nothing had gone wrong nonsense i said trying to give it back i didnt do anything out of the way it was only luck that i have small hands nevertheless colum was firm if you prefer consider it a small wedding gift but i wish you to have it at a nod from jamie i reluctantly accepted the box and opened it it contained a beautiful rosary of jet each bead intricately carved and the crucifix inlaid with silver its lovely i said sincerely and it was though i had no notion what i might do with it though nominally a catholic i had been raised by uncle lamb the completest of agnostics and had only the vaguest idea of the significance of a rosary nonetheless i thanked colum warmly and gave the rosary to jamie to keep for me in his sporran i curtsied to colum gratified to find that i was mastering the art of doing so without falling on my face he opened his mouth to take a gracious leave but was interrupted by a sudden crash that came from behind me turning i could see nothing but backs and heads as people leapt from their benches to gather round whatever had caused the uproar colum made his way with some difficulty around the table clearing aside the crowd with an impatient wave of the hand as people stepped respectfully out of his way i could see the rotund form of arthur duncan on the floor limbs flailing convulsively batting away the helpful hands of wouldbe assistants his wife pushed her way through the muttering throng dropped to the floor beside him and made a vain attempt to cradle his head in her lap the stricken man dug his heels into the floor and arched his back making gargling choking noises glancing up geilies green eyes anxiously scanned the crowd as though looking for someone assuming that i was the one she was looking for i took the path of least resistance dodging under the table and crawling across on hands and knees reaching geilies side i grabbed her husbands face between my hands and tried to pry his jaws open i thought from the sounds he was making that he had perhaps choked on a piece of meat which might still be lodged in his windpipe his jaws were clamped and rigid though lips blue and flecked with a foamy spittle that didnt seem consistent with choking choking he surely was though the plump chest heaved vainly fighting for breath quickly turn him on his side i said several hands reached out at once to help and the heavy body was deftly turned broad blackserge back toward me i drove the heel of my hand hard between the shoulderblades smacking him repeatedly with a dull thumping noise the massive back quivered slightly with the blows but there was no answering jerk as of an obstruction suddenly released i gripped a meaty shoulder and pulled him onto his back once more geilie bent close over the staring face calling his name massaging his mottled throat the eyes were rolled back now and the drumming heels began to slacken their beat the hands clawed in agony suddenly flung wide smacking an anxiously crouching onlooker in the face the sputtering noises abruptly ceased and the stout body went limp lying inert as a sack of barley on the stone flags i felt frantically for a pulse in one slack wrist noticing with half an eye that geilie was doing the same pulling up the round shaven chin and pressing her fingertips hard into the flesh under the angle of the jaw in search of the carotid artery both searches were futile arthur duncans heart already taxed by the necessity of pumping blood through that massive frame for so many years had given up the struggle i tried all the resuscitative techniques at my disposal useless though i knew them now to be armflapping chestmassage even mouthtomouth breathing distasteful as that was but with the expected result arthur duncan was dead as a doornail i straightened wearily and stood back as father bain with a nasty glare at me dropped to his knees by the fiscals side and began hastily to administer the final rites my back and arms ached and my face felt oddly numb the hubbub around me seemed strangely remote as though a curtain separated me from the crowded hall i closed my eyes and rubbed a hand across my tingling lips trying to erase the taste of death despite the death of the fiscal and the subsequent formalities of obsequies and burial the dukes stag hunt was delayed by no more than a week the realization of jamies imminent departure was deeply depressing i suddenly realized just how much i looked forward to seeing him at dinner after the days work how my heart would leap when i saw him unexpectedly at odd moments during the day and how much i depended on his company and his solid reassuring presence amid the complexities of life in the castle and to be perfectly honest how much i liked the smooth warm strength of him in my bed each night and waking to his tousled smiling kisses in the mornings the prospect of his absence was bleak he held me closely my head snuggled under his chin ill miss you jamie i said softly he hugged me tighter and gave a rueful chuckle so will i sassenach i hadna expected it to tell the truth but it will hurt me to leave ye he stroked my back gently fingers tracing the bumps of the vertebrae jamie youll be careful i could feel the deep rumble of amusement in his chest as he answered of the duke or the horse he was much to my apprehension intending to ride donas on the stag hunt i had visions of the huge sorrel beast plunging over a cliff out of sheer wrongheadedness or trampling jamie under those lethal hooves both i said dryly if the horse throws you and you break a leg youll be at the dukes mercy true dougal will be there though i snorted hell break the other leg he laughed and bent his head to kiss me ill be careful mo duinne will ye give me the same promise yes i said meaning it do you mean whoever left the illwish the momentary amusement was gone now perhaps i dinna think youre in any danger or i wouldna leave ye but still oh and stay away from geillis duncan what why i drew back a little to look up at him it was a dark night and his face was invisible but his tone was altogether serious the womans known as a witch and the stories about her well theyve got a deal worse since her husband died i dinna want ye anywhere near her sassenach do you honestly think shes a witch i demanded his strong hands cupped my bottom and scooped me in close to him i put my arms around him enjoying the feel of his smooth solid torso no he said finally but it isna what i think that could be a danger to ye will ye promise all right in truth i had little reluctance to give the promise since the incidents of the changeling and the summoning i had not felt much desire to visit geilie i put my mouth on jamies nipple flicking it lightly with my tongue he made a small sound deep in his throat and pulled me nearer open your legs he whispered i mean to be sure youll remember me while im gone sometime later i woke feeling cold groping sleepily for the quilt i couldnt find it suddenly it came up over me of its own accord surprised i raised up on one elbow to look im sorry jamie said i didna mean to wake ye lass what are you doing why are you awake i squinted over my shoulder at him it was still dark but my eyes were so accustomed that i could see the faintly sheepish expression on his face he was wide awake sitting on a stool by the side of the bed his plaid flung around him for warmth its only well i dreamed you were lost and i couldna find ye it woke me and i wanted to look at ye is all to fix ye in my mind to remember while im gone i turned back the quilt im sorry you were chilled its all right the night was cold and very quiet as though we were the only two souls in the world come into bed you must be chilled too he slid in next to me and curled himself against my back his hands stroked me from neck to shoulder waist to hip tracing the lines of my back the curves of my body mo duinne he said softly but now i should say mo airgeadach my silver one your hair is silvergilt and your skin is white velvet calman geal white dove i pressed my hips back against him inviting and settled against him with a sigh as his solid hardness filled me he held me against his chest and moved with me slowly deeply i gasped a little and he slackened his hold im sorry he murmured i didna mean to hurt ye but i do want to be in you to stay in you so deep i want to leave the feel of me deep inside ye with my seed i want to hold ye so and stay wi you til dawn and leave you sleeping and go with the shapes of you warm in my hands i pressed firmly back against him you wont hurt me after jamies departure i moped about the castle i saw patients in the surgery i occupied myself as much as i could in the gardens and i tried to distract myself by browsing in colums library but still time hung heavy on my hands i had been alone nearly two weeks when i met the girl laoghaire in the corridor outside the kitchens i had watched her covertly now and then since the day when i had seen her on the landing outside colums study she seemed blooming enough but there was an air of tenseness about her that was easily discernible she seemed distracted and moody and little wonder poor girl i thought kindly today though she looked somewhat excited mrs fraser she said ive a message for you the widow duncan she said had sent word that she was ill and requested me to come and tend her i hesitated remembering jamies injunctions but the twin forces of compassion and boredom were sufficient to set me on the road to the village within the hour my medicine box strapped behind me on the horses saddle the duncans house when i arrived had an air of neglected abandon a sense of disorder that extended through the house itself there was no answer to my knock and when i pushed the door open i found the entry hall and parlor scattered with books and dirty glasses mats askew and dust thick on the furniture my calls produced no maidservant and the kitchen proved to be as empty and disordered as the rest of the house increasingly anxious i went upstairs the bedroom in front also was vacant but i heard a faint shuffling noise from the stillroom across the landing pushing open the door i saw geilie sitting in a comfortable chair feet propped on the counter she had been drinking there was a glass and decanter on the counter and the room smelled strongly of brandy she was startled to see me but struggled to her feet smiling her eyes were slightly out of focus i thought but she certainly seemed well enough whats the matter i asked arent you ill she goggled at me in amazement ill me no the servants have all left and theres no food in the house but theres plenty of brandy will ye have a drop she turned back toward the decanter i grabbed her sleeve you didnt send for me no she stared at me wideeyed then why my question was interrupted by a noise from outside a faroff rumbling muttering sort of noise i had heard it before from this room and my palms had grown sweaty then at the thought of confronting the mob that made it i wiped my hands on the skirts of my dress the rumbling was nearer and there was neither need nor time for questions chapter thou shalt not suffer a witch to live the drabclad shoulders ahead of me parted on darkness my elbow struck wood with a bonenumbing thump as i was shoved roughly over a threshold of some sort and i fell headlong into a black stench alive and wriggling with unseen forms i shrieked and thrashed trying to free myself from entanglement with innumerable scrabbling tiny feet and an attack by something larger that squealed and struck me a hard blow on the thigh i succeeded in rolling away though only a foot or two before i hit an earthen wall that sent a shower of dirt cascading down on my head i huddled as close to it as i could get trying to suppress my own gasping breath so that i could hear whatever was trapped in this reeking pit with me whatever it was was large and breathing hoarsely but not growling a pig perhaps whos there came a voice from the stygian black sounding scared but defiantly loud claire is it you geilie i gasped and groped toward her meeting her hands likewise searching we clasped each other tightly rocking slightly back and forth in the gloom is there anything else in here besides us i asked glancing cautiously around even with my eyes now accustomed to the dark there was precious little to be seen there were faint streaks of light coming from somewhere above but the tenebrous shadows were shoulderhigh here below i could barely make out geilies face level with my own and only a few inches away she laughed a little shakily several mice i think and other vermin and a smell that would knock a ferret over i noticed the smell where in gods name are we the thieves hole stand back there was a grating sound from overhead and a sudden shaft of light i pressed myself against the wall barely in time to avoid a shower of mud and filth that cascaded through a small opening in the roof of our prison a single soft plop followed the deluge geilie bent and picked up something from the floor the opening above remained and i could see that what she held was a small loaf stale and smeared with assorted muck she dusted it gingerly with a fold of her skirt dinner she said hungry are you the hole above remained open and empty save for the occasional missile flung by a passerby the drizzle came in and a searching wind it was cold damp and thoroughly miserable suitable i supposed for the malefactors it was meant to house thieves vagrants blasphemers adulterers and suspected witches geilie and i huddled together for warmth against one wall not speaking much there was little to say and precious little either of us could do for ourselves beyond possess our souls in patience the hole above grew gradually darker as the night came on until it faded into the black all around how long do you think they mean to keep us here geilie shifted stretching her legs so that the small oblong of morning light from above shone on the striped linen of her skirt originally a fresh pink and white it was now considerably the worse for wear not too long she said theyll be waiting for the ecclesiastical examiners arthur had letters last month arranging for it the second week of october it was they should be here any time she rubbed her hands together to warm them then put them on her knees in the little square of sunlight tell me about the examiners i said what will happen exactly i canna say exactly ive neer seen a witch trial though ive heard of them of course she paused a moment considering theyll not be expecting a witch trial since they were coming to try some land disputes so theyll not have a witchpricker at least a what witches canna feel pain geilie explained nor do they bleed when theyre pricked the witchpricker equipped with a variety of pins lancets and other pointed implements was charged with testing for this condition i vaguely recalled something of this from franks books but had thought it a practice common to the seventeenth century not this one on the other hand i thought wryly cranesmuir was not exactly a hotbed of civilization in that case its too bad there wont be one i said though recoiling slightly at the thought of being stabbed repeatedly we could pass that test with no difficulty or i could i added caustically i imagine theyd get ice water not blood when they tried it on you id not be too sure she said reflectively overlooking the insult ive heard of witchprickers with special pins made to collapse when theyre pressed against the skin so it looks as though they dont go in but why why try to prove someone a witch on purpose the sun was on the decline now but the afternoon light was enough to suffuse our hutch with a dim glow the elegant oval of geilies face showed only pity for my innocence ye still dinna understand do ye she said they mean to kill us and it doesna matter much what the charge is or what the evidence shows well burn all the same the night before i had been too shocked from the mobs attack and the misery of our surroundings to do more than huddle with geilie and wait for the dawn with the light though what remained of my spirit was beginning to awake why geilie i asked feeling rather breathless do you know the atmosphere in the hole was thick with the stench of rot filth and damp soil and i felt as though the impenetrable earthen walls were about to cave in upon me like the sides of an illdug grave i felt rather than saw her shrug the shaft of light from above had moved with the sun and now struck the wall of our prison leaving us in cold dark below if its much comfort to ye she said dryly i misdoubt ye were meant to be taken its a matter between me and colum you had the illluck to be with me when the townsfolk came had ye been wi colum youd likely have been safe enough sassenach or no the term sassenach spoken in its usual derogatory sense suddenly struck me with a sense of desperate longing for the man who called me so in affection i wrapped my arms around my body hugging myself to contain the lonely panic that threatened to envelop me why did you come to my house geilie asked curiously i thought you had sent for me one of the girls at the castle brought me a message from you she said ah she said thoughtfully laoghaire was it i sat down and rested my back against the earth wall despite my revulsion for the muddy stinking surface feeling my movement geilie shifted closer friends or enemies we were each others only source of warmth in the hole we huddled together perforce how did you know it was laoghaire i asked shivering twas her that left the illwish in your bed geilie replied i told ye at the first there were those minded your taking the redhaired laddie i suppose she thought if ye were gone shed have a chance at him again i was struck dumb at this and it took a moment to find my voice but she couldnt geilies laugh was hoarsened by cold and thirst but still held that edge of silver anyone seein the way the lad looks at ye would know that but i dinna suppose shes seen enough o the world to ken such things let her lie wi a man once or twice and shell know but not now thats not what i meant i burst out it isnt jamie she wants the girls with child by dougal mackenzie what she was genuinely shocked for a moment and her fingers bit into the flesh of my arm how dye come to think that i told her of seeing laoghaire on the stair below colums study and the conclusions i had come to geilie snorted pah she heard colum and dougal talking about me thats what made her blench shed think colum had heard shed been to me for the illwish hed have her whipped to bleeding for that he doesna allow any truck wi such arts you gave her the illwish i was staggered geilie drew herself sharply away at this i didnt give it to her no i sold it to her i stared trying to meet her eyes through the gathering darkness theres a difference of course there is she spoke impatiently it was a matter of business was all and i dont give away my customers secrets besides she didna tell me who it was meant for and youll remember that i did try to warn ye thanks i said with some sarcasm but my brain was churning trying to rearrange my ideas in light of this new information but if she put the illwish in my bed then it was jamie she wanted that would explain her sending me to your house but what about dougal geilie hesitated for a moment then seemed to come to some decision the girls no more wi child by dougal mackenzie than you are how can you be so sure she groped for my hand in the darkness finding it she drew it close and placed it squarely on the swelling bulge beneath her gown because i am she said simply not laoghaire then i said you me she spoke quite simply without any of her usual affectation what was it colum said ill see that shes done rightly by well i suppose this is his idea of a suitable disposal of the problem i was silent for a long time mulling things over geilie i said at last that stomach trouble of your husbands she sighed white arsenic she said i thought it would finish him before the child began to show too much but he hung on longer than i thought possible i remembered the look of mingled horror and realization on arthur duncans face as he burst out of his wifes closet on the last day of his life i see i said he didnt know you were with child until he saw you halfdressed the day of the dukes banquet and when he found out i suppose he had good reason to know it wasnt his there was a faint laugh from the far corner the saltpeter came dear but it was worth every farthing i shuddered slightly hunched against the wall but thats why you had to risk killing him in public at the banquet he would have denounced you as an adulteress and a poisoner or do you think he realized about the arsenic oh arthur knew she said he wouldna admit it to be sure not even to himself but he knew wed sit across the board from each other at supper and id ask will ye have a bit more o the cullen skink my dear or a sup of ale my own and him watching me with those eyes like boiled eggs and hed say no he didna feel himself with an appetite just then and hed push his plate back and later id hear him in the kitchen secretlike gobbling his food standing by the hutch thinking himself safe because he ate no food that came from my hand her voice was light and amused as though she had been recounting some bit of juicy gossip i shuddered again drawing away from the thing that shared the darkness with me he didna guess it was in the tonic he took hed take no medicine i made ordered a patent tonic from london cost the earth too her voice was resentful at the extravagance the stuff had arsenic in it to start he didna notice any difference in the taste when i added a bit more i had always heard that vanity was the besetting weakness of murderers it seemed this was true for she went on ignoring our situation in the pride of recounting her accomplishments it was a bit risky to kill him before the whole company like that but i had to manage something quickly not arsenic either to kill like that i remembered the fiscals hard blue lips and the numbness of my own where they had touched him a quick and deadly poison and here i had thought that dougal was confessing to an affair with laoghaire but in that case while colum might be disapproving there would have been nothing to prevent dougal marrying the girl he was a widower and free but an adulterous affair with the wife of the fiscal that was a different kettle of fish for all concerned i seemed to recall that the penalties for adultery were severe colum could hardly smooth over an affair of that magnitude but i couldnt see him condemning his brother to public whipping or banishment and geilie might well consider murder a reasonable alternative to being burnt on the face with a hot iron and shut up for several years in a prison pounding hemp for twelve hours a day so she had taken her preventive measures and colum had taken his and here was i caught up in the middle the child though i asked surely there was a grim chuckle in the blackness accidents happen my friend to the best of us and once it happened i felt rather than saw her shrug i meant to get rid of it but then i thought it might be a way to make him marry me once arthur was dead a horrible suspicion struck me but dougals wife was still alive then geillis did you her dress rustled as she shook her head and i caught a faint gleam from her hair i meant to she said but god saved me the trouble i rather thought that was a sign you know and it might all have worked nicely too if not for colum mackenzie i hugged my elbows against the cold i was talking now only for distraction was it dougal you wanted or only his position and money oh i had plenty of money she said with a note of satisfaction i knew where arthur kept the key to all his papers and notes ye ken and the man wrote a fair hand ill say that for him twas simple enough to forge his signature id managed to divert near on to ten thousand pound over the last two years but what for i asked completely startled for scotland what for a moment i thought i had misheard then i decided that one of us was possibly a trifle unbalanced and going on the evidence to hand it wasnt me what do you mean scotland i asked cautiously drawing away a bit i wasnt sure just how unstable she was perhaps pregnancy had unhinged her mind ye needna fear im not mad the cynical amusement in her voice made me flush grateful for the darkness oh no i said stung by your own admission youve committed fraud theft and murder it might be charitable to consider that youre mad because if youre not neither mad nor depraved she said decisively im a patriot the light dawned i let out the breath i had been holding in expectation of a deranged attack a jacobite i said holy christ youre a bloody jacobite she was and that explained quite a bit why dougal generally the mirror of his brothers opinions should have shown such initiative in raising money for the house of stuart and why geillis duncan so well equipped to lead any man she wanted to the altar had chosen two such dissimilar specimens as arthur duncan and dougal mackenzie the one for his money and position the other for his power to influence public opinion colum would have been better she continued a pity his misfortune is my own as well its him would have been the one i should have had the only man ive seen could be my proper match together we could well no help for it the one man id want and the one man in the world i couldnt touch with the weapon i had so you took dougal instead oh aye she said deep in her own thoughts a strong man and with some power a bit of property the ear of the people but really hes no more than the legs and the cock she laughed briefly of colum mackenzie its colum has the strength almost as much as i have her boastful tone annoyed me colum has a few small things that you havent so far as i can see such as a sense of compassion ah yes bowels of mercy and compassion is it she spoke ironically much good it may do him death sits on his shoulder ye can see it with half an eye the man may live two years past hogmanay not much longer than that and how much longer will you live i asked the irony turned inward but the silver voice stayed steady a bit less than that i expect no great matter ive managed a good deal in the time i had ten thousand pounds diverted to france and the district roused for prince charles come the rising i shall know i helped if i live so long she stood nearly under the hole in the roof my eyes were sufficiently accustomed to the darkness that she showed as a pale shape in the murk a premature and unlaid ghost she turned abruptly toward me whatever happens with the examiners i have no regrets claire i regret only that i have but one life to give for my country i asked ironically thats nicely put she said isnt it just we fell silent as it grew darker the black of the hole seemed a tangible force pressing cold and heavy on my chest clogging my lungs with the scent of death at last i huddled into as close a ball as i could put my head on my knees and gave up the fight lapsing into an uneasy doze on the edge between cold and panic do ye love the man then geilie asked suddenly i raised my head from my knees startled i had no idea what time it was one faint star shone overhead but shed no light into the hole who jamie who else she said dryly its his name ye call out in your sleep i didnt know i did that well do ye the cold encouraged a sort of deadly drowsiness but geilies prodding voice dragged me a bit further out of my stupor i hugged my knees rocking slightly back and forth the light from the hole above had faded away to the soft dark of early night the examiners would arrive within the next day or so it was getting a bit late for prevarications either to myself or anyone else while i still found it difficult to admit that i might be in serious danger of death i was beginning to understand the instinct that made condemned prisoners seek shriving on the eve of execution really love him i mean geilie persisted not just want to bed him i know you want that and he does too they all do but do you love him did i love him beyond the urges of the flesh the hole had the dark anonymity of the confessional and a soul on the verge of death had no time for lies yes i said and laid my head back on my knees it was silent in the hole for some time and i hovered once more on the verge of sleep when i heard her speak once more as though to herself so its possible she said thoughtfully the examiners arrived a day later from the dankness of the thieves hole we could hear the stir of their arrival the shouts of the villagers and the clopping of horses on the stone of the high street the bustle grew fainter as the procession passed down the street toward the distant square theyve come said geilie listening to the excitement above we clasped hands reflexively enmities buried in fear well i said with attempted bravado i suppose being burned is better than freezing to death in the event we continued to freeze it was not until noon of the next day that the door of our prison slid abruptly back and we were pulled out of the pit to be taken to trial no doubt to accommodate the crowd of spectators the session was held in the square before the duncans house i saw geilie glance up briefly at the diamondpaned windows of her parlor then turn away expressionless there were two ecclesiastical examiners seated on padded stools behind a table that had been erected in the square one judge was abnormally tall and thin the other short and stout they reminded me irresistibly of an american comicpaper i had once seen not knowing their names i mentally christened the tall one mutt and the other jeff most of the village was there looking about i could see a good many of my former patients but the inhabitants of the castle were notably absent it was john macrae locksman of the village of cranesmuir who read out the dittay or indictment against the persons of one geillis duncan and one claire fraser both accused before the churchs court of the crime of witchcraft stating in evidence whereof the accused did cause the death of arthur duncan by means of witchcraft macrae read in a firm steady voice and whereas they did procure the death of the unborn child of janet robinson did cause the boat of thomas mackenzie to sink did bring upon the village of cranesmuir a wasting sickness of the bowels it went on for some time colum had been thorough in his preparations after the reading of the dittay the witnesses were called most of them were villagers i didnt recognize none of my own patients were among them a fact for which i was grateful while the testimony of many of the witnesses was simply absurd and other witnesses had plainly been paid for their services some had a clear ring of truth to their words janet robinson for example who was haled before the court by her father pale and trembling with a purple bruise on her cheek to confess that she had conceived a child by a married man and sought to rid herself of it through the offices of geillis duncan she gave me a draft to drink and a charm to say three times at the rising o the moon the girl mumbled glancing fearfully from geillis to her father unsure which one posed the greatest threat she said twould bring my courses on and did it jeff asked with interest not at the first your honor the girl answered bobbing her head nervously but i took the draft again at the waning o the moon and then it started started the lassie near bled to death an elderly lady plainly the girls mother broke in twas only because she felt herself to be dyin as she told me the truth o the matter more than willing to add to the gory details mrs robinson was shut up with some difficulty in order to make way for the succeeding witnesses there seemed to be no one with anything in particular to say about me aside from the vague accusation that since i had been present at arthur duncans death and had laid hands on him before he died clearly i must have had something to do with it i began to think that geilie was right i had not been colums target that being so i thought it possible that i would escape or at least i thought so until the hill woman appeared when she came forward a thin bowed woman with a yellow shawl i sensed that we were in serious trouble she was not one of the villagers no one i had ever seen before her feet were bare stained with the dust of the road she had walked to come here have ye a charge to make against either o the women here asked the tall thin judge the woman was afraid she wouldnt raise her eyes to look at the judges she bobbed her head briefly though and the crowd quieted its murmur to hear her her voice was low and mutt had to ask her to repeat herself she and her husband had an ailing child born healthy but then turned puny and unthrifty finally deciding that the child was a fairy changeling they had placed it in the fairys seat on the hill of croich gorm keeping watch so as to recover their own child when the fairies should return it they had seen the two ladies standing here go to the fairys seat pick up the child and speak strange spells over it the woman twisted her thin hands together working them under her apron we watched through the nicht sirs and when the dark came soon after there cam a great demon a huge black shape comin through the shadows wi no sound to lean ower the spot where wed laid the babe there was an awed murmur from the crowd and i felt the hair on the back of my neck stir slightly even knowing as i did that the great demon had been jamie gone to see whether the child still lived i braced myself knowing what was coming next and when the sun rose my man and i went to see and there we found the changeling babe dead on the hill and no sign of our own wee bairn at this she broke and threw her apron over her face to hide her weeping as though the mother of the changeling had been a signal of some sort the crowd parted and the figure of peter the drover came out i groaned inwardly when i saw him i had felt the emotions of the crowd turn against me as the woman spoke all i needed now was for this man to tell the court about the waterhorse enjoying his moment of celebrity the drover drew himself up and pointed dramatically at me tis right ye are to call her witch my lords wi my own eyes i saw this woman call up a waterhorse from the waters of the evil loch to do her bidding a great fearsome creature sirs tall as a pine tree wi a neck like a great blue snake an eyes big as apples wi a look in them as would steal the soul from a man the judges appeared impressed with his testimony and whispered between themselves for several minutes while peter glared defiantly at me with a thatll show you sort of look at length the fat judge broke from the conference and beckoned imperiously to john macrae who stood to one side alert for trouble locksman he said he turned and pointed at the drover tak that man away and shut him up in the pillory for public drunkenness this is a solemn coort o law well no ha the time of the examiners wasted by frivolous accusations from a sot who sees waterhorses when hes taken too much whisky peter the drover was so astonished that he did not even resist as the locksman strode firmly forward and took him by the arm mouth hanging open he glared back wildly in my direction as he was led away i couldnt resist fluttering my fingers in a tiny salute after him after this slight break in the tension of the proceedings though things got rapidly worse there was a procession of girls and women to swear that they had bought charms and philtres from geillis duncan for purposes such as causing illness ridding oneself of an unwanted babe or casting spells of love upon some man all without exception swore that the charms had worked an enviable record for a general practitioner i thought cynically while no one claimed such results for me there were several to say truthfully that they had seen me often in mrs duncans herb room mixing medicines and grinding herbs still that might not have been fatal there were an equal number of people to claim that i had healed them using nothing more than ordinary medicines with nothing in the way of spells charms or general hocuspocus given the force of public opinion it took some nerve for these people to step forward to testify in my behalf and i was grateful my feet were aching from standing so long while the judges sat in relative comfort no stools were provided for the prisoners but when the next witness appeared i entirely forgot my feet with an instinct for drama that rivaled colums father bain flung wide the door of the kirk and emerged into the square limping heavily on an oaken crutch he advanced slowly to the center of the square inclined his head to the judges then turned and surveyed the crowd until his steely glare had reduced the noise to a low uneasy muttering when he spoke his voice lashed out like the crack of a whip its a judgment on ye ye folk o cranesmuir before him went the pestilence and burning coals went forth with his feet aye yeve allowed yerselves to be seduced from the paths o righteousness yeve sown the wind and the whirlwinds amongst ye now i stared somewhat taken aback by this unsuspected gift for rhetoric or perhaps he was capable of such flights of oratory only under the stimulus of crisis the florid voice thundered on the pestilence will come upon ye and ye shall die o your sins unless ye be cleansed yeve welcomed the whore of babylon into yer midst that was me i assumed from the glare he shot at me yeve sold your soul to your enemies yeve taken the english viper to your bosom and now the vengeance o the lord god almighty is on ye deliver thee from the strange woman even from the stranger that flattereth with her words for her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the dead repent people before its too late fall to your knees i say and pray for forgiveness cast out the english whore and renounce your bargain wi the spawn o satan he snatched the rosary from his belt and brandished the large wooden crucifix in my direction entertaining as this all was i could see mutt becoming rather restive professional jealousy perhaps er your reverence the judge said with a slight bow in father bains direction have ye evidence to bring as to the charge regarding these women that i have the first explosion of oratory spent the little priest was calm now he leveled a menacing forefinger in my direction and i had to brace myself to keep from taking a step backward at noonday on a tuesday two weeks past i met this woman in the gardens of castle leoch using unnatural powers she called down a pack of hounds upon me such that i fell before them and was in mortal peril bein wounded grievously in the leg i made to leave her presence the woman tried to lure me wi her sinfulness to go awa in private with her and when i resisted her wiles she cast a curse upon me what bloody nonsense i said indignantly thats the most ridiculous exaggeration ive ever heard father bains eye dark and glittering as with fever swiveled from the examiners and fixed on me do ye deny woman that ye said these words to me come with me now priest or your wound shall fester and go putrid well tone it down a bit but something to that effect perhaps i admitted jaw clenched in triumph the priest whipped aside the skirts of his soutane a bandage stained with dried blood and wet with yellow pus encircled his thigh the pale flesh of the leg puffed above and below the bandage with ominous red streaks extending up from the hidden wound jesus christ man i said shocked at the sight youve got blood poisoning you need it tended and right now or youll die there was a deep murmur of shock from the crowd even mutt and jeff seemed a bit stunned father bain shook his head slowly you hear he demanded the temerity of the woman kens nae bounds she curses me wi death a man of god before the judgment seat of the kirk itself the excited murmuring of the crowd grew louder father bain spoke again raising his voice slightly in order to be heard over the noise i leave ye gentlemen wi the judgment o your own senses and the injunction o the lord ye shallna suffer a witch to live father bains dramatic evidence put a stop to the testimony presumably no one was prepared to top that performance the judges called a short recess and were brought refreshments from the inn no such amenities were forthcoming for the accused i braced myself and pulled experimentally against my bonds the leather of the straps creaked a bit but didnt give an inch this i thought cynically trying to still my panic was surely where the dashing young hero was meant to ride through the crowd beating back the cringing townspeople and scooping the fainting heroine up onto his saddle but my own dashing young hero was out in the forest somewhere swilling ale with an aging poofter of noble blood and slaughtering innocent deer it was rather unlikely i thought gritting my teeth that jamie would return in time even to gather up my ashes for ceremonial disposal before i was scattered to the four winds preoccupied with my growing fear i didnt at first hear the hoofbeats it was only as the faint murmurs and headturnings of the crowd attracted my attention that i noticed the rhythmic clopping ringing from the stones of the high street the murmurs of surprise grew louder and the fringes of the crowd began to draw apart to admit the rider still beyond the range of my sight despite my earlier despair i began to feel a faint flicker of illogical hope what if jamie had come back early perhaps the dukes advances had been too pressing or the deer too few and far between whatever it might be i strained on tiptoe to see the face of the approaching rider the ranks of the crowd parted reluctantly as the horse a strong bay poked its long nose between two sets of shoulders before the astonished eyes of everyone including me the sticklike figure of ned gowan spryly dismounted jeff surveyed the spare neat form before him with some astonishment and you are sir no doubt his tone of reluctant courtesy was a result of the visitors silver shoebuckles and velvet coat employment with the laird of clan mackenzie was not without its compensations my name is edward gowan your lordship he said precisely solicitor mutt hunched his shoulders and wriggled a bit the stool he had been provided had no back and his lengthy torso was no doubt feeling the strain i stared hard at him wishing him a herniated lumbar disk if i were about to be burnt for having an evil eye i thought let it count for something solicitor he rumbled what brings you here then ned gowans grey peruke inclined itself in the most precise of formal bows i have come to offer my humble services in the support of mistress fraser your lordships he said a most gracious lady whom i know of my own witness to be as kind and beneficial in the administration of the healing arts as she is knowledgeable in their application very nice i thought approvingly get a blow in for our side first thing looking across the square i could see geilies mouth quirk up in a halfadmiring halfderisive smile while ned gowan wouldnt be everyones choice as prince charming i was not inclined to be picky at a time like this i would take my champions as they came with a bow to the judges and another no less formal to myself mr gowan drew himself still straighter than his normal upright posture braced both thumbs in the waist of his breeks and prepared with all the romanticism of his aged gallant heart to do battle fighting with the laws chosen weapon of excruciating boredom boring he most certainly was with the deadly precision of an automated mincing machine he arranged each charge of the dittay on the slab of his scrutiny and diced it ruthlessly into shreds with the blade of statute and the cleaver of precedent it was a noble performance he talked and he talked and he talked some more seeming occasionally to pause respectfully for instruction from the bench but in fact only drawing breath for another onslaught of verbiage with my life hanging in the balance and my future entirely dependent on the eloquence of this skinny little man i should have hung rapt on his every word instead i found myself yawning appallingly unable to cover my gaping mouth and shifting from foot to aching foot wishing fervently that they would burn me at once and end this torture the crowd appeared to feel much the same and as the high excitement of the morning faded into ennui mr gowans small tidy voice went on and on and on people began to drift away suddenly mindful of beasts that needed milking and floors that wanted sweeping secure in the surety that nothing of any interest could possibly happen while that deadly voice droned on when ned gowan finally finished his initial defense evening had set in and the squatty judge i had named jeff announced that the court would reconvene in the morning after a short muttering conference amongst ned gowan jeff and john macrae the locksman i was led off toward the inn between two burly townsmen casting a glance over my shoulder i saw geilie being moved away in the opposite direction back straight refusing to be hurried or for that matter to acknowledge her surroundings in any way in the dark back room of the inn my bonds were at last removed and a candle brought then ned gowan arrived bearing a bottle of ale and a plate of meat and bread ive but the few minutes with ye my dear and that hardwon so listen closely the little man leaned nearer conspiratorial in the flickering candlelight his eyes were bright and save a slight disarrangement of his peruke he gave no hint of exertion or fatigue mr gowan i am so glad to see you i said sincerely yes yes my dear he said but theres no time for that now he patted my hand in a kindly but perfunctory fashion ive succeeded in getting them to consider your case as separate from that of mrs duncan and that may be of help it would appear that there was no original intent to arrest you but that you were taken because of your association with the w with mrs duncan still he continued briskly there is some danger to ye and ill not hide it from you the climate of opinion in the village is none too favorable to ye at present what possessed ye he demanded with uncharacteristic heatedness to touch that child i opened my mouth to reply but he waved the question aside impatiently ah well its of no matter now what we must do is to play upon the fact of your englishness and hence your ignorance ye ken not your strangeness and draw matters out so long as we may time is on our side ye see for the worst of these trials take place in a climate of hysteria when the soundness of evidence may be disregarded for the sake of satisfyin bloodhunger bloodhunger that captured completely the feeling of the emotion i had felt emanating from the faces of the mob here and there i saw some traces of doubt or sympathy but it was a rare soul who would stand against a crowd and cranesmuir was rather lacking in characters of that stamp or no i corrected myself there was one this dry little edinburgh lawyer tough as the old boot he so strongly resembled the longer we go on mr gowan continued matteroffactly the less inclined anyone will be to take hasty action so he said hands on his knees your part on the morrow is only to keep silent i shall do all the talkin and pray god it will be to some effect that seems sound enough i said with a weary attempt at a smile i glanced at the door to the front of the inn where voices were being raised catching my look mr gowan nodded aye ill have to leave ye momentarily ive arranged that youll spend the night here he glanced around dubiously a small shed tacked on to the inn and used mostly for the storage of oddments and spare supplies it was cold and dark but an improvement of severalfold over the thieves hole the door to the shed opened silhouetting the form of the innkeeper peering into the dark behind the pale waver of a candle flame mr gowan rose to go but i gripped him by the sleeve there was one thing i needed to know mr gowan did colum send you to help me he hesitated in his reply but within the limits of his profession he was a man of irreproachable honesty no he said bluntly a look almost of embarrassment flitted over his withered features and he added i came for for myself he clapped his hat upon his head and turned to the door wishing me a brief good een before disappearing into the light and bustle of the inn there had been little preparation for my accommodation but a small jug of wine and a loaf of bread clean this time sat on one of the hogsheads and there was an old blanket folded on the ground at its foot i wrapped myself in the blanket and sat down on one of the smaller casks to dine musing as i munched the sparse fare so colum had not sent the lawyer had he known even that mr gowan intended to come chances were that colum had forbidden anyone to come down to the village for fear of being caught up in the witchhunt the waves of fear and hysteria that swept over the village were palpable i could feel them beating against the walls of my flimsy shelter a noisy outburst from the nearby taproom distracted me from my thoughts perhaps it was only deathwatch plus one but on the edge of destruction even an extra hour was cause for thanks i rolled myself up in the blanket pulled it over my head to shut out the noises from the inn and tried very hard to feel nothing but gratitude after an exceedingly restless night i was roused soon after dawn and marched back out to the square though the judges didnt arrive for another hour fine fat and full of breakfast they buckled straight down to work jeff turned to john macrae who had returned to his station behind the accused we find ourselves unable to determine guilt solely on the basis of the evidence presented there was a burst of outrage from the regathered crowd which had made its own determination but this was quelled by mutt who turned a pair of eyes like gimlets on the young workmen in the front row quieting their yapping like dogs doused with cold water order restored he turned his angular face back to the locksman conduct the prisoners to the loch side if ye please there was a pleased sound of expectation at this that roused all my worst suspicions john macrae took me by one arm and geilie by the other to steer us along but he had plenty of help vicious hands tore at my gown pinching and pushing as i was yanked along some idiot had a drum and was beating out a ragged tattoo the crowd was chanting in a rough rhythm to the tuck of the drum something that i didnt catch among the random shouts and cries i didnt think i wanted to know what they were saying the procession flowed down the meadow to the edge of the loch where a small wooden quay projected into the water we were pulled out to the end of this where the two judges had taken up their posts one at either side of the quay jeff turned to the crowd waiting onshore bring out the cords there was a general mutter and expectant looking around from one to another until someone ran up hastily with a length of thin rope macrae took it and approached me rather hesitantly he stole a glance at the examiners though which seemed to harden his resolve please be so kind as to remove your shoon maam he ordered what the he what for i demanded crossing my arms he blinked plainly unprepared for resistance but one of the judges forestalled his reply tis the proper procedure for trial by water the suspected witch shall have the right thumb bound by a cord of hemp to the great toe of the left foot likewise the left thumb shall be bound to the right great toe and then he cast an eloquent glance at the waters of the loch two fishermen stood barefooted in the mud of the shore trews rolled above their knees and tied with twine grinning insinuatingly at me one of them picked up a small stone and heaved it out across the steely surface it skipped once and sank upon entering the water the short judge chimed in a guilty witch will float as the purity of the water rejects her tainted person an innocent woman will sink so ive the choice of being condemned as a witch or being found innocent but drowned have i i snapped no thank you i hugged my elbows harder trying to still the shiver that seemed to have become a permanent part of my flesh the short judge puffed himself up like a threatened toad youll nae speak before this court without leave woman do ye dare to refuse lawful examination do i dare refuse to be drowned too right i do too late i caught sight of geilie frantically shaking her head so that the fair hair swirled around her face the judge turned to macrae strip her and skelp her he said flatly through a daze of disbelief i heard a collective inhalation presumably of shocked dismay in truth of anticipatory enjoyment and i realized just what hate really meant not theirs mine they didnt bother taking me back to the village square so far as i was now concerned i had little left to lose and i didnt make it easy for them rough hands jerked me forward yanking at the edges of blouse and bodice let go of me you bloody lout i yelled and kicked one manhandler squarely where it would do most good he crumpled with a groan but his doubled form was quickly lost in a boiling eruption of shouting spitting glaring faces more hands seized my arms and hustled me stumbling onward halflifting me over bodies fallen in the crush pushing me bodily through gaps too small to walk through someone hit me in the stomach and i lost my breath my bodice was virtually in shreds by this time so it was with no great difficulty that the remainder was stripped off i had never suffered from excessive modesty but standing halfnaked before the jeers of that crowd of illwishers with the prints of sweaty hands on my bare breasts filled me with a hatred and humiliation i could not even have imagined john macrae bound my hands before me looping a woven rope about my wrists leaving a length of several feet he had the grace to look ashamed as he did it but would not raise his eyes to mine and it was clear i could expect neither help nor lenience from that quarter he was as much at the mercy of the crowd as i was geilie was there no doubt similarly treated i caught a glimpse of her platinum hair flying in a sudden breeze my arms stretched high above my head as the rope was thrown over the branch of a large oak and hauled tight i gritted my teeth and held tight to my fury it was the only thing i had to combat my fear there was an air of breathless expectancy punctuated by the excited murmurs and shouts from the crowd of watchers give it er john one shouted get on wi it john macrae sensitive to the theatrical responsibilities of his profession paused scourge held level at waist height and surveyed the crowd he walked forward and gently adjusted my position so that i faced the trunk of the tree almost touching the rough bark then he drew back two paces raised the whip and let it fall the shock of it was worse than the pain in fact it was only after several blows that i realized the locksman was doing his level best to spare me what he could still one or two blows were hard enough to break the skin i felt the sharp tingle in the wake of the impact i had my eyes shut tight cheek pressed hard against the wood trying for all i was worth to be somewhere else suddenly though i heard something that recalled me at once to the here and now claire there was a little slack in the rope that bound my wrists enough to let me make a lunge that brought me clear around facing the mob my sudden escape disconcerted the locksman who brought his lash down on empty air stumbled forward offbalance and knocked his head against a limb this had a very good effect on the mob who roared insults and started jeering at him my hair was in my eyes stuck to my face with sweat tears and the filth of confinement i shook my head to free it and managed at least a sidelong glance that confirmed what my ears had heard jamie was shoving his way through the hindering crowd face like thunder ruthlessly taking advantage of his size and muscle i felt very much like general macauliffe at bastogne sighting pattons third army in the offing in spite of the horrible danger to geilie to me and now to jamie himself i had never been so happy to see anyone the witchs man her husband it is stinkin fraser crowner and similar epithets began to be heard among the more general abuse aimed at me and geilie take him too burn em burn em all the crowds hysteria temporarily dispersed by the locksmans accident was rising to fever pitch once more hampered by the clinging forms of the locksmans assistants who were trying to restrain him jamie had come to a dead halt a man hanging from each arm he struggled to force his hand toward his belt thinking him reaching for a knife one man punched him hard in the belly jamie doubled slightly then came up smashing an elbow to the nose of the man whod hit him one arm temporarily freed he ignored the frantic pawings of the man on the other side he dipped a hand into his sporran raised his arm and threw his shout reached me as the object left his hand claire stand still not much place for me to go i thought dazedly there was a dark blur headed straight for my face and i started to flinch backward but stopped in time the blur struck my face with a clattering sting and the black beads fell on my shoulders as the jet rosary flung bolastyle neatly ringed my neck or not quite neatly the strand had caught on my right ear i shook my head eyes watering from the blow and the circlet settled into place crucifix swinging jauntily between my naked breasts the faces in the front row were staring at it in a kind of horrified bemusement their sudden silence affected those further back and the roaring seethe of noise subsided jamies voice customarily softspoken even in anger rang out in the silence there was nothing soft about it now cut her down the hangerson had dropped away and the waves of the crowd parted before him as he strode forward the locksman watched him come standing gapejawed and frozen i said cut her down now the locksman freed from his trance by the apocalyptic vision of redhaired death bearing down on him stirred himself and fumbled hastily for his dirk the rope sawn through let go with a shuddering snap and my arms dropped like bolsters aching with released strain i staggered and would have fallen but a strong familiar hand caught my elbow and pulled me upright then my face was against jamies chest and nothing mattered to me anymore i may have lost consciousness for a few moments or only been so overcome with relief that it seemed that way jamies arm was hard around my waist holding me up and his plaid had been thrown over me hiding me at last from the stare of the villagers there was a confusion of voices all around but it was no longer the crazed and gleeful bloodlust of the mob the voice of mutt or was it jeff cut through the confusion who are you how dare ye to interfere wi the investigations of the court i could feel rather than see the crowd pushing forward jamie was large and he was armed but he was only one man i cowered against him under the folds of the plaid his right arm tightened around me but his left hand went to the sheath on his hip the silverblue blade hissed with menace as it came half out of its scabbard and those in the forefront of the crowd came to a sudden stop the judges were made of somewhat tougher fabric peering out from my hiding place i could see jeff glaring at jamie mutt appeared more bemused than annoyed at this sudden intrusion do ye dare to draw arms against the justice of god snapped the tubby little judge jamie drew the sword completely with a flash of steel then thrust it pointfirst into the ground leaving the hilt quivering with the force of the blow i draw it in defense of this woman and the truth he said if any here be against those two theyll answer to me and then god in that order the judge blinked once or twice as though unable to credit this behavior then surged to the attack once more you have no place in the workings o this court sir ill demand that ye surrender the prisoner at once your own behavior will be dealt with presently jamie looked the judges over coolly i could feel his heart hammering beneath my cheek as i clung to him but his hands were rocksteady one resting on the hilt of his sword the other on the dirk at his belt as to that sir i swore an oath before the altar of god to protect this woman and if youre tellin me that ye consider your own authority to be greater than that of the almighty then i must inform ye that im no of that opinion myself the silence that followed this was broken by an embarrassed titter echoed here and there by a nervous laugh while the sympathies of the crowd had not shifted to our side still the momentum carrying us to disaster had been broken jamie turned me with a hand on my shoulder i couldnt bear to face the crowd but i knew i must i kept my chin as high as i could and my eyes focused beyond the faces to a small boat in the center of the loch i stared at it til my eyes watered jamie turned back the plaid holding it around me but letting it drop far enough to show my neck and shoulders he touched the black rosary and set it swinging gently to and fro jet will burn a witchs skin no he demanded of the judges still more i should think would the cross of our lord but look he dipped a finger under the beads and lifted up the crucifix my skin beneath was pure white unmarked save for the smudges of captivity and there was a gasp and murmur from the crowd raw courage an icecold presence of mind and that instinct for showmanship colum mackenzie had been right to be apprehensive of jamies ambitions and given his fear that i might reveal hamishs parentage or what he thought i knew of it what he had done to me was understandable too understandable but not forgivable the mood of the crowd now swayed to and fro uncertain the bloodlust that had driven it earlier was dissipating but it might still tilt like a cresting wave and crush us mutt and jeff glanced at each other undecided taken aback by this last development the judges had momentarily lost control of the situation geillis duncan stepped forward into the breach i do not know whether there was hope for her at that point or not in any case she now tossed her fair hair defiantly over one shoulder and threw her life away this woman is no witch she said simply but i am jamies show good as it was was no match for this the resulting uproar drowned completely the voices of the judges questioning and exclaiming there was no clue to what she thought or felt no more than there ever was her high white brow was clear the big green eyes gleaming in what might be amusement she stood straight in her ragged garments daubed with filth and stared down her accusers when the tumult had quieted a bit she began to speak not deigning to raise her voice but forcing them to quiet themselves to hear her i geillis duncan do confess that i am a witch and the mistress of satan this caused another outcry and she waited again with perfect patience for them to quiet in obedience to my master i do confess that i killed my husband arthur duncan by means of witchcraft at this she glanced aside catching my eye and the hint of a smile touched her lips her eyes rested on the woman in the yellow shawl but did not soften of malice i placed a spell upon the changeling child that it might die and the human child it replaced remain with the fairies she turned and gestured in my direction i took advantage of the ignorance of claire fraser using her for my purposes but she had neither part nor knowledge in my doings nor does she serve my master the crowd was muttering again people jostling to get a better look pushing nearer she stretched out both hands toward them palm outward stay back the clear voice cracked like a whip to much the same effect she tilted back her head to the skies and froze like one listening hear she said hear the wind of his coming beware ye people of cranesmuir for my master comes on the wings o the wind she lowered her head and screamed a high eerie sound of triumph the large green eyes were fixed and staring trancelike the wind was rising i could see the clouds of the storm rolling across the far side of the loch people began to look uneasily around a few souls dropped back from the edge of the crowd geilie began to spin twirling round and round hair whipping in the wind hand gracefully overhead like a maypole dancers i watched her in stunned disbelief as she turned her hair hid her face on the last turn though she snapped her head to throw the fair mane to one side and i saw her face clearly looking at me the mask of trance had vanished momentarily and her mouth formed a single word then her turn took her around to face the crowd once more and she began her eerie screaming again the word had been run she stopped her spinning suddenly and with a look of mad exultation gripped the remnants of her bodice with both hands and tore it down the front tore it far enough to show the crowd the secret i had learned huddled close beside her in the cold filth of the thieves hole the secret arthur duncan had learned in the hour before his death the secret for which he had died the shreds of her loose gown dropped away exposing the swelling bulge of a sixmonth pregnancy i still stood like a rock staring jamie had no such hesitations seizing me with one hand and his sword with the other he flung himself into the crowd knocking people out of the way with elbows knees and sword hilt bulling his way toward the edge of the loch he let out a piercing whistle through his teeth intent on the spectacle under the oak few people at first realized what was happening then as individuals began to shout and grab at us there was the sound of galloping hooves on the hardpacked dirt above the shore donas still didnt care much for people and was all too willing to show it he bit the first hand reaching for his bridle and a man dropped back crying out and dripping blood the horse reared squealing and pawing the air and the few bold souls still intent on stopping him suddenly lost interest jamie flung me over the saddle like a sack of meal and swung up himself in one fluid motion clearing a path with vicious swipes of his sword he turned donas through the hindering mass of the crowd as people fell back from the onslaught of teeth hooves and blade we picked up speed leaving the loch the village and leoch behind breath knocked out of me by the impact i struggled to speak to scream to jamie for i hadnt stood frozen at the revelation of geilies pregnancy it was something else i had seen that chilled me to the marrow of my bones as geilie had spun white arms stretched aloft i saw what she had seen when my own clothes were stripped away a mark on one arm like the one i bore here in this time the mark of sorcery the mark of a magus the small homely scar of a smallpox vaccination rain pattered on the water soothing my swollen face and the rope burns on my wrists i dipped a handful of water from the stream and sipped it slowly feeling the cold liquid trickle down my throat with gratitude jamie disappeared for a few minutes he came back with a handful of dark green oblate leaves chewing something he spat a glob of macerated green into the palm of his hand stuffed another wad of leaves into his mouth and turned me away from him he rubbed the chewed leaves gently over my back and the stinging eased considerably what is that i asked making an effort to control myself i was still shaky and snuffling but the helpless tears were beginning to ebb watercress he answered voice slightly muffled by the leaves in his mouth he spat them out and applied them to my back youre no the only one knows a bit about grasscures sassenach he said a bit clearer how how does it taste i asked gulping back the sobs fair nasty he replied laconically he finished his application and laid the plaid softly back across my shoulders it wont he began then hesitated i mean the cuts are not deep i i think youll no be marked he spoke gruffly but his touch was very gentle and reduced me to tears once more im sorry i mumbled dabbling my nose on a corner of the plaid i i dont know whats wrong with me i dont know why i cant stop crying he shrugged i dinna suppose anyones tried to hurt ye on purpose before sassenach he said its likely the shock of that so much as the pain he paused picking up a plaidend i did just the same lass he said matteroffactly puked after and cried while they cleansed the cuts then i shook he wiped my face carefully with the plaid then put a hand under my chin and tilted my face up to his and when i stopped shaking sassenach he said quietly i thanked god for the pain because it meant i was still alive he let go nodding at me when ye get to that point lassie tell me for ive a thing or two i want to be sayin to ye then he got up and went down to the edge of the burn to wash out the bloodstained handkerchief in cold water what brought you back i asked when he returned i had managed to stop crying but i still shook and huddled deeper into the folds of the plaid alec macmahon he said smiling i told him to watch over ye while i was gone when the villagers took you and mrs duncan he rode all night and the next day to find me and then i rode like the devil himself comin back lord thats a good horse he looked approvingly up the slope to donas tethered to a tree at the top of the bank his wet coat gleaming like copper ill have to move him he said thoughtfully i doubt anyone will follow but it isna that far from cranesmuir can ye walk now i followed him up the steep slope with some difficulty small rocks rolling under my feet and bracken and bramble catching my shift near the top of the slope was a grove of young alders grown so close together that the lower branches interlaced forming a green roof over the bracken beneath jamie shoved the branches up far enough for me to crawl into the narrow space then carefully rearranged the crushed bracken before the entrance he stood back and surveyed the hiding place critically nodding in satisfaction aye thats good no one will find ye there he turned to go then turned back try to sleep if ye can and dont worry if im not back at once ill hunt a bit on the way back weve no food with us and i dinna want to attract attention by stopping at a croft pull the tartan up over your head and make sure it covers your shift the white shows for a long way food seemed irrelevant i felt as though i would never want to eat again sleep was something else again my back and arms still ached the rope burns on my wrists were raw and i felt sore and bruised all over but worn out with fear pain and simple exhaustion i fell asleep almost at once the pungent scent of ferns rising around me like incense i awoke with something gripping my foot startled i sat up straight crashing into the springy branches overhead leaves and sticks showered down around me and i flailed my arms wildly trying to disentangle my hair from the snagging twigs scratched disheveled and irritated i crawled out of my sanctuary to find an amused jamie squatting nearby watching my emergence it was near sunset the sun had dropped below the lip of the burn leaving the rocky canyon in shadow the smell of roasting meat rose from a small fire burning among the rocks near the stream where two rabbits browned on a makeshift spit made of sharpened green sticks jamie held out a hand to help me down the slope i haughtily declined and swept down myself tripping only once on the trailing ends of the plaid my earlier nausea had vanished and i fell ravenously on the meat well move up into the forest after supper sassenach jamie said tearing a joint from the rabbit carcass i dinna want to sleep near the burn i canna hear anyone coming over the noise of the water there was not much conversation as we ate the horror of the morning and the thought of what we had left behind oppressed us both and for me there was a profound sense of mourning i had lost not only the chance of finding out more about the why and wherefore of my presence here but a friend as well my only friend i was often in doubt as to geilies motives but i had no doubt at all that she had saved my life that morning knowing herself doomed she had done her best to give me a chance of escape the fire almost invisible in daylight was growing brighter now as darkness filled the burn i looked into the flames seeing the crisp skin and browned bones of the rabbits on their spits a drop of blood from a broken bone fell into the fire hissing into nothing suddenly the meat stuck in my throat i set it down hastily and turned away retching still without speaking much we moved out of the burn and found a comfortable place near the edge of a clearing in the forest hills rose in undulant mounds all around us but jamie had chosen a high spot with a good view of the road from the village the dusk momentarily heightened all the colors of the countryside lighting the land with jewels a glowing emerald in the hollows a lovely shadowed amethyst among the clumps of heather and burning rubies on the redberried rowan trees that crowned the hills rowan berries a specific against witchcraft far in the distance the outline of castle leoch was still visible at the foot of ben aden it faded quickly as the light died jamie made a fire in a sheltered spot and sat down next to it the rain had eased to a faint drizzle that misted the air and spangled my eyelashes with rainbows when i looked at the flames he sat staring into the fire for a long time finally he looked up at me hands clasped around his knees i said before that id not ask ye things ye had no wish to tell me and id not ask ye now but i must know for your safety as well as mine he paused hesitating claire if youve never been honest wi me be so now for i must know the truth claire are ye a witch i gaped at him a witch you you can really ask that i thought he must be joking he wasnt he took me by the shoulders and gripped me hard staring into my eyes as though willing me to answer him i must ask it claire and you must tell me and if i were i asked through dry lips if you had thought i were a witch would you still have fought for me i would have gone to the stake with you he said violently and to hell beyond if i must but may the lord jesus have mercy on my soul and on yours tell me the truth the strain of it all caught up with me i tore myself out of his grasp and ran across the clearing not far only to the edge of the trees i could not bear the exposure of the open space i clutched a tree put my arms around it and dug my fingers hard into the bark pressed my face to it and shrieked with hysterical laughter jamies face white and shocked loomed up on the other side of the tree with the dim realization that what i was doing must sound unnervingly like cackling i made a terrific effort and stopped panting i stared at him for a moment yes i said backing away still heaving with gasps of unhinged laughter yes i am a witch to you i must be ive never had smallpox but i can walk through a room full of dying men and never catch it i can nurse the sick and breathe their air and touch their bodies and the sickness cant touch me i cant catch cholera either or lockjaw or the morbid sore throat and you must think its an enchantment because youve never heard of vaccine and theres no other way you can explain it the things i know i stopped backing away and stood still breathing heavily trying to control myself i know about john randall because i was told about him i know when he was born and when hell die i know about what hes done and what hell do i know about sandringham because because frank told me he knew about randall because he he oh god i felt as though i might be sick and closed my eyes to shut out the spinning stars overhead and colum he thinks im a witch because i know hamish isnt his own son i know he cant sire children but he thought i knew who hamishs father is i thought maybe it was you but then i knew it couldnt be and i was talking faster and faster trying to keep the vertigo at bay with the sound of my own voice everything ive ever told you about myself was true i said nodding madly as though to reassure myself everything i havent any people i havent any history because i havent happened yet do you know when i was born i asked looking up i knew my hair was wild and my eyes staring and i didnt care on the twentieth of october in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and eighteen do you hear me i demanded for he was blinking at me unmoving as though paying no attention to a word i said i said nineteen eighteen nearly two hundred years from now do you hear i was shouting now and he nodded slowly i hear he said softly yes you hear i blazed and you think im raving mad dont you admit it thats what you think you have to think so there isnt any other way you can explain me to yourself you cant believe me you cant dare to oh jamie i felt my face start to crumple all this time spent hiding the truth realizing that i could never tell anyone and now i realized that i could tell jamie my beloved husband the man i trusted beyond all others and he wouldnt he couldnt believe me either it was the rocks the fairy hill the standing stones merlins stones thats where i came through i was gasping halfsobbing becoming less coherent by the second once upon a time but its really two hundred years its always two hundred years in the stories but in the stories the people always get back i couldnt get back i turned away staggering grasping for support i sank down on a rock shoulders slumped and put my head in my hands there was a long silence in the wood it went on long enough for the small night birds to recover their courage and start their noises once again calling to each other with a thin high zeek as they hawked for the last insects of the summer i looked up at last thinking that perhaps he had simply risen and left me overcome by my revelations he was still there though still sitting hands braced on his knees head bowed as though in thought the hairs on his arms shone stiff as copper wires in the firelight though and i realized that they stood erect like the bristles on a dog he was afraid of me jamie i said feeling my heart break with absolute loneliness oh jamie i sat down and curled myself into a ball trying to roll myself around the core of my pain nothing mattered any longer and i sobbed my heart out his hands on my shoulders raised me enough to see his face through the haze of tears i saw the look he wore in battle of struggle that had passed the point of strain and become calm certainty i believe you he said firmly i dinna understand it a bit not yet but i believe you claire i believe you listen to me theres the truth between us you and i and whatever ye tell me i shall believe it he gave me a gentle shake it doesna matter what it is youve told me thats enough for now be still mo duinne lay your head and rest youll tell me the rest of it later and ill believe you i was still sobbing unable to grasp what he was telling me i struggled trying to pull away but he gathered me up and held me tightly against himself pushing my head into the folds of his plaid and repeating over and over again i believe you at last from sheer exhaustion i grew calm enough to look up and say but you cant believe me he smiled down at me his mouth trembled slightly but he smiled yell no tell me what i canna do sassenach he paused a moment how old are ye he asked curiously i never thought to ask the question seemed so preposterous that it took me a minute to think im twentyseven or maybe twentyeight i added that rattled him for a moment at twentyeight women in this time were usually on the verge of middleage oh he said he took a deep breath i thought ye were about my age or younger he didnt move for a second but then he looked down and smiled faintly at me happy birthday sassenach he said it took me completely by surprise and i just stared stupidly at him for a moment what i managed at last i said happy birthday its the twentieth of october today is it i said dumbly id lost track i was shaking again from cold and shock and the force of my tirade he drew me close against him and held me smoothing his big hands lightly over my hair cradling my head against his chest i began to cry again but this time with relief in my state of upheaval it seemed logical that if he knew my real age and still wanted me then everything would be all right jamie picked me up and holding me carefully against his shoulder carried me to the side of the fire where he had laid the horses saddle he sat down leaning against the saddle and held me light and close a long time later he spoke all right tell me now i told him told him everything haltingly but coherently i felt numb from exhaustion but content like a rabbit that has outrun a fox and found temporary shelter under a log it isnt sanctuary but at least it is respite and i told him about frank frank he said softly then he isna dead after all he isnt born i felt another small wave of hysteria break against my ribs but managed to keep myself under control neither am i he stroked and patted me back into silence making his small murmuring gaelic sounds when i took ye from randall at fort william he said suddenly you were trying to get back back to the stones and frank thats why ye left the grove yes and i beat you for it his voice was soft with regret you couldnt know i couldnt tell you i was beginning to feel very drowsy indeed no i dinna suppose ye could he pulled the plaid closer around me tucking it gently around my shoulders do ye sleep now mo duinne no one shall harm ye im here i burrowed into the warm curve of his shoulder letting my tired mind fall through the layers of oblivion i forced myself to the surface long enough to ask do you really believe me jamie he sighed and smiled ruefully down at me aye i believe ye sassenach but it would ha been a good deal easier if youd only been a witch i slept like the dead awakening sometime after dawn with a terrible headache stiff in every muscle jamie had a few handfuls of oats in a small bag in his sporran and forced me to eat drammach oats mixed with cold water it stuck in my throat but i choked it down he was slow and gentle with me but spoke very little after breakfast he quickly packed up the small campsite and saddled donas numb with the shock of recent events i didnt even ask where we were going mounted behind him i was content to rest my face against the broad slope of his back feeling the motion of the horse rock me into a state of mindless trance we came down from the braes near loch madoch pressing through the chilly dawn mist to the edge of a still sheet of grey wild ducks began to rise from the reeds in untidy flocks that circled the marshes quacking and calling to rouse late sleepers below by contrast a welldisciplined wedge of geese passed over us calling of heartbreak and desolation the grey fog lifted near midday on the second day and a weak sun lighted the meadows filled with yellow gorse and broom a few miles past the loch we came out onto a narrow road and turned northwest the way took us up again rising into low rolling hills that gave way gradually to granite tors and crags we met few travelers on the road and prudently turned aside into the brush whenever hoofbeats were heard ahead the vegetation turned to pine forest i sniffed deeply enjoying the crisp resinous air though it was turning chill toward dusk we stopped for the night in a small clearing some way from the path we scooped together a nestlike wallow of pine needles and blankets and huddled close together for warmth covered by jamies plaid and blanket he woke me sometime in the darkness and made love to me slowly and tenderly not speaking i watched stars winking through the lattice of black branches overhead and fell asleep again with his comforting weight still warm on top of me in the morning jamie seemed more cheerful or at least more peaceful as though a difficult decision had been reached he promised me hot tea for supper which was small comfort then in the frigid air sleepily i followed him back to the path brushing pine needles and small spiders from my skirt the narrow path faded during the morning to no more than a faint trace through rough sheeps fescue zigzagging around the more prominent rocks i had been paying little attention to our surroundings as i dreamily enjoyed the growing warmth of the sun but suddenly my eye struck a familiar rock formation and i started out of my torpor i knew where we were and why jamie he turned at my exclamation you didna know he asked curiously that we were coming here no of course not i felt mildly sick the hill of craigh na dun was no more than a mile away i could see the humpbacked shape of it through the last shreds of the morning mist i swallowed hard i had tried for nearly six months to reach this place now that i was here at last i wanted to be anywhere else the standing stones on the hilltop were invisible from below but they seemed to emanate a subtle terror that reached out for me well below the summit the footing grew too uncertain for donas we dismounted and tethered him to a scrubby pine continuing on foot i was panting and sweating by the time we reached the granite ledge jamie showed no signs of exertion save a faint flush rising from the neck of his shirt it was quiet here above the pines but with a steady wind whining faintly in the crevices of the rock swallows shot past the ledge rising abruptly on the air currents in pursuit of insects dropping like dive bombers slender wings outspread jamie took my hand to pull me up the last step to the wide flat ledge at the base of the cleft rock he didnt release it but drew me close looking carefully at me as though memorizing my features why i began gasping for breath its your place he said roughly isnt it yes i stared as though hypnotized at the stone circle it looks just the same jamie followed me into the circle taking me by the arm he marched firmly up to the split rock is it this one he demanded yes i tried to pull away careful dont go too near it he glanced from me to the rock clearly skeptical perhaps he was right to be i felt suddenly doubtful of the truth of my own story i i dont know anything about it perhaps the whatever it is closed behind me maybe it only works at certain times of the year it was near beltane when i came through last jamie glanced over his shoulder at the sun a flat disc hanging in midsky behind a thin screen of cloud its almost samhain now he said all hallows eve seems suitable no he shivered involuntarily in spite of the joke when you came through what did ye do i tried to remember i felt icecold and i folded my hands under my armpits i walked round the circle looking at things just randomly though there was no pattern and then i came near to the split rock and i heard a buzzing like bees it was still like bees i drew back as though it had been the rattle of a snake its still here i reared in panic throwing my arms around jamie but he set me firmly away from him his face white and turned me once again toward the stone what then the keening wind was sharp in my ears but his voice was sharper still i put my hand on the rock do it then he pushed me closer and when i did not respond he grasped my wrist and planted my hand firmly against the brindled surface chaos reached out and grabbed me the sun stopped whirling behind my eyes at last and the shriek faded out of my ears there was another persistent noise jamie calling my name i felt too sick to sit up or open my eyes but i flapped my hand weakly to let him know i was still alive im all right i said are ye then oh god claire he clasped me against his chest then holding me tightly jesus claire i thought ye were dead sure you you began to go somehow you had the most awful look on your face like ye were frightened to death i i pulled ye back from the stone i stopped ye i shouldna have done so im sorry lassie my eyes were open enough now to see his face above me shocked and frightened its all right it was still an effort to speak and i felt heavy and disoriented but things were coming clearer i tried to smile but felt nothing more than a twitch at least we know it still works oh god aye it works he cast a glance of fearful loathing at the stone he left me long enough to wet a kerchief in a puddle of rainwater that stood in one of the stony depressions he wet my face still muttering reassurances and apologies at last i felt well enough to sit up you didnt believe me after all did you groggy as i was i felt somehow vindicated its true though aye its true he sat next to me staring at the stone for several minutes i rubbed the wet cloth over my face feeling still faint and dizzy suddenly he sprang to his feet walked to the rock and slapped his hand against it nothing whatsoever happened and after a minute his shoulders slumped and he came back to me maybe its only women it works on i said fuzzily its always women in the legends or maybe its only me well it isna me he said better make sure though jamie be careful i shouted to no avail he marched to the stone slapped it again threw himself against it walked through the split and back again but it remained no more than a solid stone monolith as for myself i shuddered at the thought of even approaching that door to madness once again and yet yet when i had begun to pass into the realm of chaos this time i had been thinking of frank and i had felt him i was sure of it somewhere in the void had been a tiny pinprick of light and he was in it i knew i knew also that there had been another point of light one that sat still beside me staring at the stone cheeks gleaming with sweat in spite of the chill of the day at last he turned to me and grasped both my hands he raised them to his lips and kissed each one formally my lady he said softly my claire its no use in waiting i must part wi ye now my lips were too stiff to speak but the expression on my face must have been as easily readable as usual claire he said urgently its your own time on the other side of that thing youve a home there a place the things that youre used to and and frank yes i said theres frank jamie caught me by the shoulders pulling me to my feet and shaking me gently in supplication theres nothing for ye on this side lass nothing save violence and danger go he pushed me slightly turning me toward the stone circle i turned back to him catching his hands is there really nothing for me here jamie i held his eyes not letting him turn away from me he pulled himself gently from my grasp without answering and stood back suddenly a figure from another time seen in relief upon a background of hazy hills the life in his face a trick of the shadowing rock as if flattened beneath layers of paint an artists reminiscence of forgotten places and passions turned to dust i looked into his eyes filled with pain and yearning and he was flesh again real and immediate lover husband man the anguish i felt must have been reflected in my face for he hesitated then turned to the east and pointed down the slope do ye see behind the small clump of oak down there about halfway i saw the clump and saw what he was pointing at the halfruined crofters cottage abandoned on the haunted hill i shall go down to the house and i shall stay there til the evening to make sure to be sure that youre safe he looked at me but made no move to touch me he closed his eyes as though he could no longer bear to look at me goodbye he said and turned to go i watched him numb and then remembered there was something that i had to tell him i called after him jamie he stopped and stood motionless for a moment fighting to control his face it was white and strained and his lips were bloodless when he turned back to me aye theres something i mean i have to tell you something before before i go he closed his eyes briefly and i thought he swayed but it might have been only the wind tugging at his kilts theres no need he said no do ye go lass ye shouldna tarry go he made to turn away but i clutched him by the sleeve jamie listen to me you must he shook his head helplessly lifting a hand as though to push me away claire no i cant the wind was bringing the moisture to his eyes its the rising i said urgently shaking his arm jamie listen prince charlie his army colum is right do you hear me jamie colum is right not dougal eh what dye mean lass i had his attention now he rubbed his sleeve across his face and the eyes that looked down at me were sharp and clear the wind sang in my ears prince charlie there will be a rising dougals right about that but it wont succeed charlies army will do well for a bit but it will end in slaughter at culloden thats where it will end the the clans in my minds eye i saw the clanstones the grey boulders that would lie scattered on the field each stone bearing the single clan name of the butchered men who lay under it i took a breath and gripped his hand to steady myself it was cold as a corpses i shuddered and closed my eyes to concentrate on what i was saying the highlanders all the clans that follow charlie will be wiped out hundreds and hundreds of the clansmen will die at culloden those that are left will be hunted and killed the clans will be crushed and theyll not rise again not in your time not even in mine i opened my eyes to find him staring at me expressionless jamie stay out of it i begged him keep your people out of it if you can but for the lords sake jamie if you i broke off i had been going to say jamie if you love me but i couldnt i was going to lose him forever and if i could not speak of love to him before i could not do it now dont go to france i said softly go to america or to spain to italy but for the sake of the people who love you jamie dont set foot on culloden field he went on staring at me i wondered if he had heard jamie did you hear me do you understand after a moment he nodded numbly aye he said quietly so quietly i could hardly hear him beneath the whining of the wind aye i hear he dropped my hand go wi god mo duinne he stepped off the ledge and made his way down the steep incline bracing his feet against tufts of grass catching at branches to keep his balance not looking back i watched him until he disappeared into the oak clump walking slowly like a man wounded who knows he must keep moving but feels his life ebbing slowly away through the fingers he has clenched over the wound my knees were trembling slowly i lowered myself to the granite shelf and sat crosslegged watching the swallows about their business below i could just see the roof of the cottage that now held my past at my back loomed the cleft stone and my future i sat without moving through the afternoon i tried to force all emotion from my mind and use reason jamie certainly had logic on his side when he argued that i should go back home safety frank even the small amenities of life that i sorely missed from time to time like hot baths and indoor plumbing to say nothing of larger considerations such as proper medical care and convenient travel and yet while i would certainly admit the inconveniences and outright dangers of this place i would have also to admit that i had enjoyed many aspects of it if travel was inconvenient there were no enormous stretches of concrete blanketing the countryside nor any noisy stinking autos contrivances with their own dangers i reminded myself life was much simpler and so were the people not less intelligent but much more direct with a few sterling exceptions like colum ban campbell mackenzie i thought grimly because of uncle lambs work i had lived in a great many places many even cruder and more lacking in amenities than this one i adapted quite easily to rough conditions and did not really miss civilization when away from it though i adapted just as easily to the presence of niceties like electric cookers and hotwater geysers i shivered in the cold wind hugging myself as i stared at the rock rationality did not appear to be helping much i turned to emotion and began shrinking from the task to reconstruct the details of my married lives first with frank then with jamie the only result of this was to leave me shattered and weeping the tears forming icy trails on my face well if not reason nor emotion what of duty i had given frank a wedding vow and had meant it with all my heart i had given jamie the same meaning to betray it as soon as possible and which of them would i betray now i continued to sit as the sun sank lower in the sky and the swallows disappeared to their nests as the evening star began to glow among the black pines branches i concluded that in this situation reason was of little use i would have to rely on something else just what i wasnt sure i turned toward the split rock and took a step then another and another pausing i faced around and tried it in the other direction a step then another and another and before i even knew that i had decided i was halfway down the slope scrabbling wildly at grass clumps slipping and falling through the patches of granite scree when i reached the cottage breathless with fear lest he had left already i was reassured to see donas hobbled and grazing nearby the horse raised his head and eyed me unpleasantly walking softly i pushed the door open he was in the front room asleep on a narrow oak settle he slept on his back as he usually did hands crossed on his stomach mouth slightly open the last rays of daylight from the window behind me limned his face like a metal mask the silver tracks of dried tears glinted on golden skin and the copper stubble of his beard gleamed dully i stood watching him for a moment filled with an unutterable tenderness moving as quietly as i could i lay down beside him on the narrow settle and nestled close he turned to me in sleep as he so often did gathering me spoonfashion against his chest and resting his cheek against my hair halfconscious he reached to smooth my hair away from his nose i felt the sudden jerk as he came awake to realize that i was there and then we overbalanced and crashed together onto the floor jamie on top of me i didnt have the slightest doubt that he was solid flesh i pushed a knee into his abdomen grunting get off i cant breathe instead he aggravated my breathless condition by kissing me thoroughly i ignored the lack of oxygen temporarily in order to concentrate on more important things we held each other for a long time without speaking at last he murmured why his mouth muffled in my hair i kissed his cheek damp and salty i could feel his heart beating against my ribs and wanted nothing more than to stay there forever not moving not making love just breathing the same air i had to i said i laughed a little shakily you dont know how close it was the hot baths nearly won and i wept then and shook a little because the choice was so freshly made and because my joy for the man i held in my arms was mingled with a tearing grief for the man i would never see again jamie held me tightly pressing me down with his weight as though to protect me to save me from being swept away by the roaring pull of the stone circle at length my tears were spent and i lay exhausted head against his comforting chest it had grown altogether dark by this time but still he held me murmuring softly as though i were a child afraid of the night we clung to each other unwilling to let go even long enough to start a fire or light a candle at length jamie rose and picking me up carried me to the settle where he sat with me cradled on his lap the door of the cottage still hung open and we could see the stars beginning to burn over the valley below do you know i said drowsily that it takes thousands and thousands of years for the light of those stars to reach us in fact some of the stars we see may be dead by now but we wont know it because we still see the light is that so he answered stroking my back i didna know that i must have fallen asleep head on his shoulder but roused briefly when he laid me gently on the floor on a makeshift bed of blankets from the horses saddleroll he lay down beside me and drew me close again lay your head lass he whispered in the morning ill take ye home we rose just before dawn and were on the downward trail when the sun rose eager to leave craigh na dun where are we going jamie i asked rejoicing that i could look forward into a future that held him even as i left behind the last chance of returning to the man who had who would once love me jamie reined in the horse pausing to look over his shoulder for a moment the forbidding circle of standing stones was invisible from here but the rocky hillside seemed to rise impassable behind us bristling with boulders and gorse bushes from here the crumbling husk of the cottage looked like one more crag a bony knuckle jutting from the granite fist of the hill i wish i could have fought him for you he said abruptly looking back at me his blue eyes were dark and earnest i smiled at him touched it wasnt your fight it was mine but you won it anyway i reached out a hand and he squeezed it aye but thats not what i meant if id fought him man to man and won yed not need to feel any regret over it he hesitated if ever there arent any more ifs i said firmly i thought of every one of them yesterday and here i still am thank god he said smiling and god help you then he added though ill never understand why i put my arms around his waist and held on as the horse slithered down the last steep slope because i said i bloody well cant do without you jamie fraser and thats all about it now where are you taking me jamie twisted in his saddle to look back up the slope i prayed all the way up that hill yesterday he said softly not for you to stay i didna think that would be right i prayed id be strong enough to send ye away he shook his head still gazing up the hill a faraway look in his eyes i said lord if ive never had courage in my life before let me have it now let me be brave enough not to fall on my knees and beg her to stay he pulled his eyes away from the cottage and smiled briefly at me hardest thing i ever did sassenach he turned in the saddle and reined the horses head toward the east it was a rare bright morning and the early sun gilded everything drawing a thin line of fire along the edge of the reins the curve of the horses neck and the broad planes of jamies face and shoulders he took a deep breath and nodded across the moor toward a distant pass between two crags so now i suppose i can do the secondhardest thing he kicked the horse gently clicking his tongue were going home sassenach to lallybroch part five lallybroch chapter the lairds return at first we were so happy only to be with each other and away from leoch than we didnt talk much across the flat of the moor donas could carry us both without strain and i rode with my arms about jamies waist glorying in the feel of the sunwarmed muscle shifting under my cheek whatever problems we might be facing and i knew there were plenty we were together forever and that was enough as the first shock of happiness mellowed into the glow of companionship we began to talk again about the countryside through which we were passing at first then cautiously about me and where i had come from he was fascinated by my descriptions of modern life though i could tell that most of my stories seemed like fairy tales to him he loved especially the descriptions of automobiles tanks and airplanes and made me describe them over and over as minutely as i could by tacit agreement we avoided any mention of frank as we covered more countryside the conversation turned back to our present time colum the castle then the stag hunt and the duke he seems a nice chap jamie remarked as the going became rougher he had dismounted and walked alongside which made conversation easier i thought so too i answered but oh aye ye canna put too much faith in what a man seems these days he agreed still we got on he and i wed sit together and talk of an evening found the fire in the hunting lodge hes a good bit brighter than he seems for the one thing he knows how that voice makes him seem and i think he uses it to make himself look a bit of a fool while all the time the mind is there workin behind his eyes mmm thats what im afraid of did you tell him he shrugged a bit he knew my name of course from that time before at the castle i laughed at the memory of his account of that time did you er reminisce about old times he grinned the ends of his hair floating about his face in the autumn breeze oh just a bit he asked me once whether i still suffered from stomach trouble i kept my face straight and answered that as a rule no but i thought perhaps i felt a bit of griping coming on just now he laughed and said he hoped it did not discommode my beautiful wife i laughed myself right now what the duke might or mightnt do didnt seem of overwhelming importance nevertheless he might one day be of use i told him a little jamie went on that i was outlawed but not guilty of the charge though id have precious little chance of proving it he seemed sympathetic but i was cautious about telling him the circumstances let alone the fact that theres a price on my head i hadna yet made up my mind whether to trust him with the rest of it when well when old alec came tearing into the camp like the devil himself was on his tail and murtagh and i left the same way this reminded me where is murtagh i asked he came back with you to leoch i hoped the little clansman hadnt fallen afoul of either colum or the villagers of cranesmuir he started back wi me but the beast he was riding was no match for donas aye a bonny wee lad ye are donas mo buidheag he slapped the shimmering sorrel neck and donas snorted and ruffled his mane jamie glanced up at me and smiled dinna worry for murtagh theres a canty wee bird can mind for himself canty murtagh i knew the word meant cheerful which seemed incongruous to a degree i dont think ive ever seen him smile have you oh aye at least twice how long have you known him twentythree years hes my godfather oh well that explains a bit i didnt think hed bother on my account jamie patted my leg of course he would he likes you ill take your word for it having thus approached the subject of recent events i took a deep breath and asked something i badly wanted to know jamie aye geillis duncan will they will they really burn her he glanced up at me frowning slightly and nodded i expect so not til after the child is born though is that what troubles ye one of the things jamie look at this i tried to push up the voluminous sleeve failed and settled for pulling the neck of the shirt off my shoulder to display my vaccination scar god in heaven he said slowly after i had explained he looked sharply at me so thats why is she from your own time then i shrugged helplessly i dont know all i can say is that she was likely born sometime after thats when public inoculation came in i looked over my shoulder but lowlying clouds hid the crags that now separated us from leoch i dont suppose i ever will know now jamie took donass reins and led him aside under a small pine grove on the banks of a small stream he grasped me around the waist and lifted me down dinna grieve for her he said firmly holding me shes a wicked woman a murderer if not a witch she did kill her husband no yes i said with a shudder remembering arthur duncans glazed eyes i still dinna understand why she should kill him though he said shaking his head in puzzlement he had money a good position and i doubt he beat her i looked at him in exasperated amazement and thats your definition of a good husband well yes he said frowning what else might she want what else i was so taken aback i just looked at him for a moment then slid down on the grass and started to laugh whats funny i thought this was murder he smiled though and put an arm around me i was just thinking i said still snorting a bit if your definition of a good husband is one with money and position who doesnt beat his wife what does that make you oh he said he grinned well sassenach i never said i was a good husband neither did you sadist i think ye called me and a few other things that i wouldna repeat for the sake of decency but not a good husband good then i wont feel obliged to poison you with cyanide cyanide he looked down curiously at me whats that the thing that killed arthur duncan its a bloody fast powerful poison fairly common in my time but not here i licked my lips meditatively i tasted it on his lips and just that tiny bit was enough to make my whole face go numb it acts almost instantly as you saw i should have known then about geilie i mean i imagine she made it from crushed peach pits or cherry stones though it must have been the devil of a job did she tell ye why she did it then i sighed and rubbed my feet my shoes had been lost in the struggle at the loch and i tended to pick up stickers and cockleburs my feet not being hardened as jamies were that and a good deal more if theres anything to eat in your saddlebags why dont you fetch it and ill tell you all about it we entered the valley of broch tuarach the next day as we came down out of the foothills i spotted a solitary rider some distance away heading roughly in our direction he was the first person i had seen since we had left cranesmuir the man approaching us was stout and prosperouslooking with a snowy stock showing at the neck of a serviceable grey serge coat its long tails covering all but an inch or two of his breeches we had been traveling for the best part of a week sleeping outofdoors washing in the cold fresh water of the burns and living quite well off such rabbits and fish as jamie could catch and such edible plants and berries as i could find between our efforts our diet was better than that in the castle fresher and certainly more varied if a little unpredictable but if nutrition was well served by an outdoor life appearance was another thing and i took hasty stock of our looks as the gentleman on horseback hesitated frowning then changed direction and trotted slowly toward us to investigate jamie who had insisted on walking most of the way to spare the horse was a disreputable sight indeed hose stained to the knees with reddish dust spare shirt torn by brambles and a weeks growth of beard bristling fiercely from cheek and jaw his hair had grown long enough in the last months to reach his shoulders usually clubbed into a queue or laced back it was free now thick and unruly with small bits of leaf and stick caught in the disordered coppery locks face burned a deep ruddy bronze boots cracked from walking dirk and sword thrust through his belt he looked a wild highlander indeed i was hardly better covered modestly enough in the billows of jamies best shirt and the remnants of my shirt barefoot and shawled in his plaid i looked a right ragamuffin encouraged by the misty dampness and lacking any restraint in the form of comb or brush my hair rioted all over my head it had grown as well during my sojourn at the castle and floated in clouds and tangles about my shoulders drifting into my eyes whenever the wind was behind us as it was now shoving the wayward locks out of my eyes i watched the cautious approach of the gentleman in grey jamie seeing him brought our own horse to a stop and waited for him to draw near enough for speech its jock graham he said to me from up the way at murch nardagh the man came within a few yards reined up and sat looking us over carefully his eyes pouched with fat crinkled and rested suspiciously on jamie then suddenly sprang wide lallybroch he said unbelievingly jamie nodded benignly with a completely unfounded air of proprietorial pride he laid a hand on my thigh and said and my lady lallybroch jock grahams mouth dropped an inch or two then was hastily drawn up again into an expression of flustered respect ah my lady he said belatedly doffing his hat and bowing in my direction youll be er going home then he asked trying to keep his fascinated gaze from resting on my leg bared to the knee by a rent in my shift and stained with elderberry juice aye jamie glanced over his shoulder toward the rift in the hill he had told me was the entrance to broch tuarach youll have been there lately jock graham pulled his eyes away from me and looked at jamie och oh aye aye ive been there theyre all well be pleased to see ye i expect go well then fraser and with a hasty dig into his horses ribs he turned aside and headed up the valley we watched him go suddenly a hundred yards away he paused turning in the saddle he rose in his stirrups and cupped his mouth to shout the sound borne by the wind reached us thin but distinct welcome home and he disappeared over a rise broch tuarach means the northfacing tower from the side of the mountain above the broch that gave the small estate its name was no more than another mound of rocks much like those that lay at the foot of the hills we had been traveling through we came down through a narrow rocky gap between two crags leading the horse between boulders then the going was easier the land sloping more gently down through the fields and scattered cottages until at last we struck a small winding road that led to the house it was larger than i had expected a handsome threestory manor of harled white stone windows outlined in the natural grey stone a high slate roof with multiple chimneys and several smaller whitewashed buildings clustered about it like chicks about a hen the old stone broch situated on a small rise to the rear of the house rose sixty feet above the ground conetopped like a witchs hat girdled with three rows of tiny arrowslits as we drew near there was a sudden terrible racket from the direction of the outbuildings and donas shied and reared no horseman i promptly fell off landing ignominiously in the dusty road with an eye for the relative importance of things jamie leapt for the plunging horses bridle leaving me to fend for myself the dogs were almost upon me baying and growling by the time i found my feet to my panicked eyes there seemed to be at least a dozen of them all with teeth bared and wicked there was a shout from jamie bran luke sheas the dogs skidded to a halt within a few feet of me confused they milled growling uncertainly until he spoke again sheas mo maise stand ye wee heathen they did and the largest dogs tail began gradually to wag once and then twice questioningly claire come take the horse hell not let them close and its me they want walk slowly theyll no harm ye he spoke casually not to alarm either horse or dogs further i was not so sanguine but edged carefully toward him donas jerked his head and rolled his eyes as i took the bridle but i was in no mood to put up with tantrums and i yanked the rein firmly down and grabbed the headstall the thick velvet lips writhed back from his teeth but i jerked harder i put my face close to the big glaring golden eye and glared back dont try it i warned or youll end up as dogsmeat and i wont lift a hand to save you jamie meanwhile was slowly walking toward the dogs one hand held out fistlike toward them what had seemed a large pack was only four dogs a small brownish ratterrier two ruffed and spotted shepherds and a huge black and tan monster that could have stood in for the hound of the baskervilles with no questions asked this slavering creature stretched out a neck thicker than my waist and sniffed gently at the proffered knuckles a tail like a ships cable beat back and forth with increasing fervor then it flung back its enormous head baying with joy and leaped on its master knocking him flat in the road in which odysseus returns from the trojan war and is recognized by his faithful hound i remarked to donas who snorted briefly giving his opinion either of homer or of the undignified display of emotion going on in the roadway jamie laughing was ruffling the fur and pulling the ears of the dogs who were all trying to lick his face at once finally he beat them back sufficiently to rise keeping his feet with difficulty against their ecstatic demonstrations well someones glad to see me at any rate he said grinning as he patted the beasts head thats luke he pointed to the terrier and elphin and mars brothers they are and bonny sheepdogs and this he laid an affectionate hand on the enormous black head which slobbered in appreciation is bran ill take your word for it i said cautiously extending a knuckle to be sniffed what is he a staghound he scratched the pricked ears quoting thus fingal chose his hounds eye like sloe ear like leaf chest like horse hough like sickle and the tail joint far from the head if those are the qualifications then youre right i said inspecting bran if his tail joint were any further from his head you could ride him i used to when i was small not bran i dont mean but his grandfather nairn he gave the hound a final pat and straightened gazing toward the house he took the restive donass bridle and turned him downhill in which odysseus returns to his home disguised as a beggar he quoted in greek having picked up my earlier remark and now he said straightening his collar with some grimness i suppose its time to go and deal with penelope and her suitors when we reached the double doors the dogs panting at our heels jamie hesitated should we knock i asked a bit nervous he looked at me in astonishment its my home he said and pushed the door open he led me through the house ignoring the few startled servants we passed past the entrance hall and through a small gun room into the drawing room it boasted a wide hearth with a polished mantel and bits of silver and glass gleamed here and there capturing the lateafternoon sun for a moment i thought the room was empty then i saw a faint movement in one corner near the hearth she was smaller than i had expected with a brother like jamie i had imagined her at least my height or even taller but the woman by the fire barely reached five feet her back was to us as she reached for something on the shelf of the china cabinet and the ends of her dress sash dipped close to the floor jamie froze when he saw her jenny he said the woman turned and i caught an impression of brows black as inksquills and blue eyes wide in a white face before she launched herself at her brother jamie small as she was she jarred him with the impact of her embrace his arms went about her shoulders in reflex and they clung for a moment her face tight against his shirtfront his hand tender on the nape of her neck on his face was an expression of such mingled uncertainty and yearning joy that i felt almost an intruder then she pressed herself closer to him murmuring something in gaelic and his expression dissolved in shock he grasped her by the arms and held her away from him looking down the faces were much alike the same oddly slanted dark blue eyes and broad cheekbones the same thin bladebridged nose just a trifle too long but she was dark where jamie was fair with cascades of black curly hair bound back with green ribbon she was beautiful with cleardrawn features and alabaster skin she was also clearly in a state of advanced pregnancy jamie had gone white at the lips jenny he whispered shaking his head oh jenny mo cridh her attention was distracted just then by the appearance of a small child in the doorway and she pulled away from her brother without noticing his discomposure she took the little boys hand and led him into the room murmuring encouragement he hung back a little thumb in mouth for comfort peering up at the strangers from behind his mothers skirts for his mother she plainly was he had her mop of thick curly black hair and the square set of her shoulders though the face was not hers this is wee jamie she said looking proudly down at the lad and this is your uncle jamie mo cridh the one youre named for for me you named him for me jamie looked like a fighter who has just been punched very hard in the stomach he backed away from mother and child until he blundered into a chair and sank into it as though the strength had gone from his legs he hid his face in his hands his sister by this time was aware that something was amiss she touched him tentatively on the shoulder jamie what is it my dearie are ye ill he looked up at her then and i could see his eyes were full of tears did ye have to do that jenny do ye think that ive not suffered enough for what happened for what i let happen that ye must name randalls bastard for me to be a reproach to me so long as i live jennys face normally pale lost all vestiges of color randalls bastard she said blankly john randall ye mean the redcoat captain aye the redcoat captain who else would i mean for gods sake youll remember him i suppose jamie was recovering enough of his customary poise for sarcasm jenny eyed her brother closely one arched brow lifted in suspicion have ye lost your senses man she inquired or have ye taken a drop too much along the way i should never have come back he muttered he rose then stumbling slightly and tried to pass without touching her she stood her ground however and gripped him by the arm correct me brother if im wrong jenny said slowly but ive the strong impression youre saying ive played the whore to captain randall and what im askin myself is what maggots youve got in your brain to make ye say so maggots is it jamie turned to her mouth twisted with bitterness i wish it were so id rather i was dead and in my grave than to see my sister brought to such a pass he seized her by the shoulders and shook her slightly crying out why jenny why to have ye ruin yourself for me was shame enough to kill me but this he dropped his hands then with a gesture of despair that took in the protruding belly swelling accusingly under the light smocking he turned abruptly toward the door and an elderly woman who had been listening avidly with the child clinging to her skirts drew back in alarm i should not have come ill go youll do no such thing jamie fraser his sister said sharply not before youve listened to me sit yourself down then and ill tell ye about captain randall since ye want to know i dont want to know i dont want to hear it as she advanced toward him he turned sharply away to the window that looked out over the yard she followed him saying jamie but he repelled her with a violent gesture no dont talk to me ive said i canna bear to hear it och is that a fact she eyed her brother standing at the window with his legs braced wide apart hands on the sill and back stubbornly set against her she bit her lip and a calculating look came over her face quick as lightning she stooped and her hand shot under his kilt like a striking snake jamie let out a roar of sheer outrage and stood bolt upright with shock he tried to turn then froze as she apparently tightened her grip theres men as are sensible she said to me with a wicked smile and beasts as are biddable others yell do nothing with unless ye have em by the ballocks now ye can listen to me in a civil way she said to her brother or i can twist a bit hey he stood still redfaced breathing heavily through clenched teeth ill listen he said and then ill wring your wee neck janet let me go no sooner did she oblige than he whirled on her what in hell dye think youre doing he demanded tryin to shame me before my own wife jenny was not fazed by his outrage she rocked back on her heels viewing her brother and me sardonically weel and if shes your wife i expect shes more familiar wi your balls than what i am i havena seen them myself since ye got old enough to wash alone grown a bit no jamies face went through several alarming transformations as the dictates of civilized behavior struggled with the primitive impulse of a younger brother to clout his sister over the head civilization at length won out and he said through his teeth with what dignity he could summon leave my balls out of it and then since youll not rest til ye make me hear it tell me about randall tell me why ye disobeyed my orders and chose to dishonor yourself and your family instead jenny put her hands on her hips and drew herself to her full height ready for combat slower than he to lose her temper still she had one no doubt of that oh disobey your orders is it thats what eats at ye jamie isnt it you know best and well all do as ye say or well come to rack and ruin nae doubt she flounced angrily and if id done as you said that day youd ha been dead in the dooryard faither hanged or in prison for killing randall and the lands gone forfeit to the crown to say nothing of me wi my home and family gone needing to beg in the byroads to live not pale at all now jamie was flushed with anger aye so ye chose to sell yourself rather than beg id sooner have died in my blood and seen faither and the lands in hell along with me and well ye know it aye i know it youre a ninny jamie and always have been his sister returned in exasperation fine thing for you to say youre not content wi ruining your good name and my own ye must go on with the scandal and flaunt your shame to the whole neighborhood youll not speak to me in that way james fraser brother or no what dye mean my shame ye great fool you what i mean when youre goin about swelled out to here like a mad toad he mimicked her belly with a contemptuous swipe of the hand she took one step back drew back her hand and slapped him with all the force she could muster the impact jarred his head back and left a white outline of her fingers printed on his cheek he slowly raised a hand to the mark staring at his sister her eyes were glittering dangerously and her bosom heaved the words spilled out in a torrent between clenched white teeth toad is it stinking coward yeve no more courage than to leave me here thinking ye dead or imprisoned wi no word from one day to the next and then ye come strolling in one fine day with a wife no less and sit in my drawing room calling me toad and harlot and i didna call ye harlot but i should how can ye despite the differences in their heights brother and sister were almost nose to nose hissing at one another in an effort to keep their carrying voices from ringing through the old manor house the effort was largely wasted judging from the glimpses i caught of various interested faces peeping discreetly from kitchen hall and window the laird of broch tuarach was having an interesting homecoming to be sure i thought it best to let them have it out without my presence and so i stepped quietly into the hall with an awkward nod to the elderly woman and continued into the yard there was a small arbor there with a bench on which i seated myself looking about with interest besides the arbor there was a small walled garden blooming with the last of the summer roses beyond it was what jamie referred to as the doocot or so i assumed from the assorted pigeons that were fluttering in and out of the piercedwork opening at the top of the building i knew there was a barn and a shed for silage these must be to the other side of the house with the farms granary and the henyard kailyard and disused chapel which still left a small stone building on this side unaccounted for the light autumn wind was from that direction i sniffed deeply and was rewarded with the rich smell of hops and yeast that was the brewhouse then where the beer and ale for the estate were made the road past the gate led up and over a small hill as i looked a small group of men appeared at the crest silhouetted in the evening light they seemed to hover a moment as though taking leave of each other this appeared to be the case for only one came down the hill toward the house the others striking off through the fields toward a clump of cottages in the distance as the single man came down the hill i could see that he limped badly when he came through the gate the reason for it was apparent the right leg was missing below the knee and he wore a wooden peg in replacement in spite of the limp he moved youthfully in fact as he drew near to the arbor i could see that he was only in his twenties he was tall nearly as tall as jamie but much narrower through the shoulder thin in fact nearly to the point of skinniness he paused at the entrance to the arbor leaning heavily on the lattice and looked in at me with interest thick brown hair fell smoothly over a high brow and deepset brown eyes held a look of patient good humor the voices of jamie and his sister had risen while i waited outside the windows were open to the warm weather and the disputants were quite audible from the arbor though not all the words were clear interfering nosy bitch came jamies voice loud on the soft evening air havena the decency to his sisters reply was lost in a sudden breeze the newcomer nodded easily toward the house ah jamies home then i nodded in reply not sure whether i should introduce myself it didnt matter for the young man smiled and inclined his head to me im ian murray jennys husband and i imagine yell be ah the sassenach wench jamies married i finished for him my name is claire did you know about it then i asked as he laughed my mind was racing jennys husband oh aye we heard from joe orr whod got it from a tinker in ardraigh ye canna keep anything secret long in the highlands you should know that even if youve been wed as little as a month jennys been wondering for weeks what youd be like whore jamie bellowed from inside the house jennys husband didnt turn a hair but went on examining me with friendly curiosity youre a bonny lass he said looking me over frankly are ye fond of jamie well yes yes i am i answered a bit taken aback i was becoming accustomed to the directness that characterized most highlanders but it still took me unawares from time to time he pursed his lips and nodded as though satisfied and sat down beside me on the bench better let them have a few minutes longer he said with a wave at the house where the shouting had now turned to gaelic he seemed completely unconcerned as to the cause of the battle frasers dinna listen to anything when theyve their danders up when theyve shouted themselves out sometimes ye can make them see reason but not til then yes i noticed i said dryly and he laughed so youve been wed long enough to find that out eh we heard as how dougal made jamie wed ye he said ignoring the battle and concentrating his attention on me but jenny said it would take more than dougal mackenzie to make jamie do something he didna care to now that i see ye of course i can see why he did it he lifted his brows inviting further explanation but politely not forcing it i imagine he had his reasons i said my attention divided between my companion and the house where the sounds of combat continued i dont want i mean i hope ian correctly interpreted my hesitations and my glance toward the drawingroom windows oh i expect youve something to do with it but shed take it out of him whether you were here or not she loves jamie something fierce ye know and she worried a lot while he was gone especially with her father goin so sudden yell know about that the brown eyes were sharp and observant as though to gauge the depth of confidence between me and jamie yes jamie told me ah he nodded toward the house then of course shes wi child yes i noticed that too i said hard to miss is it no ian answered with a grin and we both laughed makes her frachetty he explained not that id blame her but it would take a braver man than me to cross words wi a woman in her ninth month he leaned back stretching his wooden leg out in front of him lost it at daumier with fergus nic leodhas he explained grape shot aches a wee bit toward the end of the day he rubbed the flesh just above the leather cuff that attached the peg to his stump have you tried rubbing it with balm of gilead i asked waterpepper or stewed rue might help too ive not tried the waterpepper he answered interested ill ask jenny does she know how to make it oh id be glad to make it for you i said liking him i looked toward the house again if we stay long enough i added doubtfully we chatted inconsequentially for a little both listening with one ear to the confrontation going on beyond the window until ian hitched forward carefully settling his artificial limb under him before rising i imagine we should go in now if either of them stops shouting long enough to hear the other theyll be hurting each others feelings i hope thats all they hurt ian chuckled oh i dinna think jamie would strike her hes used to forbearance in the face of provocation as for jenny she might slap his face but thats all she already did that weel the guns are locked up and all the knives are in the kitchen except what jamies wearing and i dont suppose hell let her close enough to get his dirk away from him nay theyre safe enough he paused at the door now as for you and me he winked solemnly thats a different matter inside the maids started and flitted nervously away at ians approach the housekeeper though was still hovering by the drawing room door in fascination drinking in the scene within jamies namesake cradled against her capacious bosom such was her concentration that when ian spoke to her she jumped as though he had run a hatpin into her and put a hand to her palpitating heart ian nodded politely to her took the little boy in his arms and led the way into the drawing room we paused just inside the door to survey the scene brother and sister had paused for breath both still bristling and glaring like a pair of angry cats small jamie spotting his mother struggled and kicked to get down from ians arms and once on the floor made for her like a homing pigeon mama he cried up jamie up turning she scooped up the little boy and held him like a weapon against her shoulder can ye tell your uncle how old ye are sweetheart she asked him throttling her voice down to a coo under which the sound of clashing steel was still all too apparent the boy heard it he turned and burrowed his face into his mothers neck she patted his back mechanically still glaring at her brother since hell not tell ye i will hes two come last august and if youre bright enough to count which i take leave to doubt youll see he was conceived six months past the time i last saw yon randall which was in our own dooryard beating the living daylight out of my brother with a saber thats so is it jamie glowered at his sister ive heard a bit differently its common knowledge youve taken the man to your bed not the once but as your lover that childs his he nodded contemptuously at his namesake who had turned to peer under his mothers chin at this big loud stranger i believe ye when ye say the new bastard youre carrying is not randall was in france til this march so youre not only a whore but an unchoosy one too who fathered this last devilsspawn on ye the tall young man beside me coughed apologetically breaking the tension in the room i did he said mildly that one too advancing stiffly on his wooden leg he took the little boy from his fuming wife and set him in the crook of his arm favors me a bit some say in fact seen side by side the faces of man and boy were nearly identical allowing for the round cheeks of the one and the crooked nose of the other the same high brow and narrow lips the same feathery brows arched over the same deep liquidbrown eyes jamie staring at the pair of them looked rather as though hed been hit in the small of the back with a sandbag he closed his mouth and swallowed once clearly having no idea what to do next ian he said a little weakly youre married then oh aye his brotherinlaw said cheerfully wouldnt do otherwise would it i see jamie murmured he cleared his throat and bobbed his head at his newly discovered brotherinlaw its er its kind of ye ian to take her i mean most kind feeling that he might be in need of some moral support at this point i moved to jamies side and touched his arm his sisters eyes lingered on me speculatively but she said nothing jamie looked around and seemed startled to find me there as though he had forgotten my existence and no wonder if he had i thought but he seemed relieved by the interruption at least and put out a hand to draw me forward my wife he said rather abruptly he nodded toward jenny and ian my sister and her ah he trailed off as ian and i exchanged polite smiles jenny was not to be distracted by social niceties what dye mean its kind of him to take me she demanded ignoring the introductions as if i didna ken ian looked inquiringly at her and she waved a disdainful hand at jamie he means it was kind of ye to wed me in my soiled condition she gave a snort that would have done credit to someone twice her size bletherer soiled condition ian looked startled and jamie suddenly leaned forward and grasped his sister hard about the upper arm did ye not tell him about randall he sounded truly shocked jenny how could ye do such a thing only ians hand on jennys other arm restrained her from flying at her brothers throat ian drew her firmly behind him and turning set small jamie in her arms so that she was forced to grasp the child to save him falling then ian put an arm about jamies shoulders and tactfully steered him a safe distance away its hardly a matter for the drawing room he said lowvoiced and deprecating but ye might be interested to know that your sister was virgin on her wedding night i was after all in a position to say jennys wrath was now more or less evenly divided between brother and husband how dare ye to say such things in my presence ian murray she flamed or out of it either my wedding nights no ones business but mine and yours sure its not his next youll be showing him the sheets from my bridal bed weel if i did now it would shut him up no said ian soothingly come now mi dhu ye shouldna worrit yourself its bad for the babe and the shouting troubles wee jamie too he reached out for his son who was whimpering not sure yet whether the situation required tears ian jerked his head at me and rolled an eye in jamies direction taking my cue i grabbed jamie by the arm and dragged him to an armchair in a neutral corner ian had jenny likewise installed on the loveseat a firm arm across her shoulders to keep her in place now then in spite of his unassuming manner ian murray had an undeniable authority i had my hand on jamies shoulder and could feel the tension begin to go out of it i thought that the room looked a bit like the ring of a boxing match with the fighters twitching restlessly in the corners each awaiting the signal for action under the soothing hand of a manager ian nodded at his brotherinlaw smiling jamie its good to see ye man were pleased youre home and your wife with ye are we not mi dhu he demanded of jenny his fingers tightening perceptibly on her shoulder she was not one to be forced into anything her lips compressed into a thin tight line as though forming a seal then opened reluctantly to let one word escape depends she said and shut them tight again jamie rubbed a hand over his face then raised his head ready for a fresh round i saw ye go into the house with randall he said stubbornly and from things he said to me later how comes he to know youve a mole on your breast then she snorted violently do ye remember all that went on that day or did the captain beat it out of ye wi his saber of course i remember im no likely to forget it then perhaps youll remember that i gave the captain a fair jolt in the crutch wi my knee at one point in the proceedings jamie hunched his shoulders wary aye i remember jenny smiled in a superior manner weel then if your wife here ye could tell me her name at least jamie i swear youve no manners at all anyway if she was to give ye similar treatment and richly you deserve it i might add dye think youd be able to perform your husbandly duties a few minutes later jamie who had been opening his mouth to speak suddenly shut it he stared at his sister for a long moment then one corner of his mouth twitched slightly depends he said the mouth twitched again he had been sitting hunched forward in his chair but sat back now looking at her with the halfskeptical expression of a younger brother listening to a sisters fairy tales feeling himself too old to be amazed but halfbelieving still against his will really he said jenny turned to ian go and fetch the sheets ian she ordered jamie raised both hands in surrender no no i believe ye its just the way he acted after jenny sat back relaxed in the curve of ians arm her son cuddling as close as the bulk of her belly would permit gracious in victory weel after all hed said outside he could hardly admit in front of his own men to being incapable now could he hed have to seem as though hed done as he promised no and she admitted ill have to say the man was verra unpleasant about it all he did strike me and tear my gown in fact he knocked me halfsenseless trying and by the time id come to myself and got decently covered again the english had gone taking you along with them jamie gave a long sigh and closed his eyes briefly his broad hands rested on his knees and i covered one of them with a gentle squeeze he took my hand and opened his eyes giving me a faint smile of acknowledgment before turning back to his sister all right he said but i want to know jenny did ye know when ye went with him that hed not harm you she was silent for a moment but her gaze was steady on her brothers face and at last she shook her head a slight smile on her lips she put out a hand to stop jamies protest and the gullwinged brows rose in a graceful arc of inquiry and if your life is a suitable exchange for my honor tell me why my honor is not a suitable exchange for your life the brows drew together in a scowl the twin of the one adorning her brothers face or are you telling me that i may not love you as much as you love me because if ye are jamie fraser ill tell ye right now its not true opening his mouth to reply before she was finished jamie was taken suddenly at a loss by this conclusion he closed his mouth abruptly as his sister pressed her advantage because i do love ye for all youre a thickheaded slackwitted lackbrained gomerel and ill no have ye dead in the road at my feet just because youre too stubborn to keep your mouth shut for the once in your life blue eyes glared into blue eyes shooting sparks in all directions swallowing the insults with difficulty jamie struggled for a rational reply he seemed to be making up his mind to something finally he squared his shoulders resigned to it all right then im sorry he said i was wrong and ill beg your pardon he and his sister sat staring at each other for a long moment but whatever pardon he was expecting from her was not forthcoming she examined him closely biting her lip but said nothing finally he grew impatient ive said im sorry what more dye want of me he demanded do ye want me to go on my knees to ye ill do it if i must but tell me she shook her head slowly lip still caught between her teeth no she said at last ill not have ye on your knees in your own house stand up though jamie stood and she set the child down on the loveseat and crossed the room to stand in front of him take off your shirt she ordered ill not she jerked the shirttail out of his kilt and reached for the buttons short of forcible resistance clearly he was going to obey or submit to being undressed retaining as much dignity as he could he backed away from her and tightlipped removed the disputed garment she circled behind him and surveyed his back her face displaying the same carefully blank expression i had seen jamie adopt when concealing some strong emotion she nodded as though confirming something long suspected weel and if youve been a fool jamie it seems youve paid for it she laid her hand gently on his back covering the worst of the scars it looks as though it hurt it did did you cry his fists clenched involuntarily at his sides yes jenny walked back around to face him pointed chin lifted and slanted eyes wide and bright so did i she said softly every day since they took ye away the broadcheeked faces were once more mirrors of each other but the expression that they wore was such that i rose and stepped quietly through the kitchen door to leave them alone as the door swung to behind me i saw jamie catch hold of his sisters hands and say something huskily in gaelic she stepped into his embrace and the rough bright head bent to the dark chapter the last reason we ate like wolves at dinner retired to a large airy bedroom and slept like logs the sun would have been high by the time we rose in the morning save that the sky was covered in clouds i could tell it was late by the bustling feel of the house as of people going cheerfully about their business and by the tempting aromas that drifted up the stairs after breakfast the men prepared to go out visiting tenants inspecting fences mending wagons and generally enjoying themselves as they paused in the hall to don their coats ian spotted jennys large basket resting on the table beneath the hall mirror shall i fetch home some apples from the orchard jenny twould save ye walking so far good idea said jamie casting an appraising eye at his sisters expansive frontage we dinna want her to drop it in the road ill drop you where ye stand jamie fraser she retorted calmly holding up the coat for ian to shrug into be useful for the once and take this wee fiend outside wi ye mrs crooks in the washhouse ye can leave him there she moved her foot dislodging small jamie who was clinging to her skirts chanting up up monotonously his uncle obediently grabbed the wee fiend around the middle and swept him out the door upside down and shrieking with delight ah jenny sighed contentedly bending to inspect her appearance in the goldframed mirror she wet a finger and smoothed her brows then finished doing up the buttons at her throat nice to finish dressing wiout someone clinging to your skirts or wrapped round your knees some days i can scarce go to the privy alone or speak a single sentence wiout being interrupted her cheeks were slightly flushed and her dark hair gleamed against the blue silk of her dress ian smiled at her warm brown eyes glowing at the blooming picture she presented weel youll have time to talk wi claire perhaps he suggested he cocked one eyebrow in my direction i expect shes mannerly enough to listen but for gods sake dinna tell her any of your poems or shell be on the next coach to london before jamie and i get back jenny snapped her fingers under his nose unperturbed by the teasing im none too worried man theres no coach going before next april and i reckon shell be used to us by that time get on wi ye jamies waiting while the men went about their business jenny and i spent the day in the parlor she stitching i winding up stray bits of yarn and sorting the colored silks outwardly friendly we circled each other cautiously in conversation watching each other from the corners of our eyes jamies sister jamies wife jamie was the central point unspoken about which our thoughts revolved their shared childhood linked them forever like the warp and the weft of a single fabric but the patterns of their weave had been loosened by absence and suspicion then by marriage ians thread had been present in their weaving since the beginning mine was a new one how would the tensions pull in this new pattern one thread against another our conversation ran on casual lines but with the words unspoken clearly heard beneath youve run the house here alone since your mother died oh aye since i was ten i had the nurturing and the loving of him as a boy what will you do with the man i helped make jamie says as youre a rare fine healer i mended his shoulder for him when we first met yes i am capable and kind i will care for him i hear ye married very quickly did you wed my brother for his land and money yes it was quick i didnt even know jamies true surname until just before the ceremony i didnt know he was laird of this place i can only have married him for himself and so it went through the morning a light luncheon and into the hours of the afternoon as we exchanged small talk tidbits of information opinions small and hesitant jokes taking each others measure a woman who had run a large household since the age of ten who had managed the estate since her fathers death and her brothers disappearance was not a person to be lightly esteemed i did wonder what she thought of me but she seemed as capable as her brother of hiding her thoughts when she chose to as the clock on the mantelpiece began to strike five jenny yawned and stretched and the garment she had been mending slid down the rounded slope of her belly onto the floor she began clumsily to reach for it but i dropped to my knees beside her no ill get it thank ye claire her first use of my name was accompanied by a shy smile and i returned it before we could return to our conversation we were interrupted by the arrival of mrs crook the housekeeper who poked a long nose into the parlor and inquired worriedly whether we had seen wee master jamie jenny laid aside her sewing with a sigh jenny laid aside her sewing with a sigh got away again has he nay worry lizzie hes likely gone wi his da or his uncle well go and see shall we claire i could use a breath of air before supper she rose heavily to her feet and pressed her hands against the small of her back she groaned and gave me a wry smile three weeks about i canna wait we walked slowly through the grounds outside jenny pointing out the brewhouse and the chapel explaining the history of the estate and when the different bits had been built as we approached the corner of the dovecote we heard voices in the arbor there he is the wee rascal jenny exclaimed wait til i lay hands on him wait a minute i laid a hand on her arm recognizing the deeper voice that underlaid the little boys dinna worrit yourself man said jamies voice youll learn its a bit difficult isnt it when your cock doesna stick out any further than your belly button i stuck my head around the corner to find him seated on a chopping block engaged in converse with his namesake who was struggling manfully with the folds of his smock what are you doing with the child i inquired cautiously im teachin young james here the fine art of not pissing on his feet he explained seems the least his uncle could do for him i raised one eyebrow talk is cheap seems the least his uncle could do is show him he grinned well weve had a few practical demonstrations had a wee accident last time though he exchanged accusatory looks with his nephew dinna look at me he said to the boy it was all your fault i told ye to keep still ahem said jenny dryly with a look at her brother and a matching one at her son the smaller jamie responded by pulling the front of his smock up over his head but the larger one unabashed grinned cheerfully and rose from his seat brushing dirt from his breeks he set a hand on his nephews swathed head and turned the little boy toward the house to everything there is a season he quoted and a time for every purpose under heaven first we work wee james and then we wash and then thank god its time for supper the most pressing matters of business attended to jamie took time the next afternoon to show me over the house built in it was indeed modern for its time with such innovations as porcelain stoves for heating and a great brick oven built into the kitchen wall so that bread was no longer baked in the ashes of the hearth the ground floor hallway the stairwell and the drawing room walls were lined with pictures here and there was a pastoral landscape or an animal study but most were of the family and their connections i paused before a picture of jenny as a young girl she sat on the garden wall a redleaved vine behind her lined up in front of her along the top of the wall was a row of birds sparrows a thrush a lark and even a pheasant all jostling and sidling for position before their laughing mistress it was quite unlike most of the formally posed pictures in which one ancestor or another glared out of their frames as though their collars were choking them my mother painted that jamie said noting my interest she did quite a few of the ones in the stairwell but there are only two of hers in here she always liked that one best herself a large blunt finger touched the surface of the canvas gently tracing the line of the redleaved vine those were jennys tame birds anytime there was a bird found wi a lame leg or a broken wing whoever found it would bring it along and in days shed have it healed and eatin from her hand that one always reminded me of ian the finger tapped above the pheasant wings spread to keep its balance gazing at its mistress with dark adoring eyes youre awful jamie i said laughing is there one of you oh aye he led me to the opposite wall near the window two redhaired tartanclad little boys stared solemnly out of the frame seated with an enormous staghound that must be nairn brans grandfather jamie and his older brother willie who had died of the smallpox at eleven jamie could not have been more than two when it was painted i thought he stood between his elder brothers knees one hand resting on the dogs head jamie had told me about willie during our journey from leoch one night by the fire at the bottom of a lonely glen i remembered the small snake carved of cherrywood that he had drawn from his sporran to show me willie gave it me for my fifth birthday he had said finger gently stroking the sinuous curves it was a comical little snake body writhing artistically and its head turned back to peer over what would have been its shoulder if snakes had shoulders jamie handed me the little wooden object and i turned it over curiously whats this scratched on the underside sawny sawny thats me jamie said ducking his head as though mildly embarrassed its a pet name like a play on my second name alexander its what willie used to call me the faces in the picture were very much alike all the fraser children had that forthright look that dared you to take them at less than their own valuation of themselves in this portrait though jamies cheeks were rounded and his nose still snubbed with babyhood while his brothers strong bones had begun to show the promise of the man within a promise never kept were you very fond of him i asked softly laying a hand on his arm he nodded looking away into the flames on the hearth oh aye he said with a faint smile he was five years older than i and i thought he was god or at least christ used to follow him everywhere or everywhere hed let me at least he turned away and wandered toward the bookshelves wanting to give him a moment alone i stayed looking out of the window from this side of the house i could see dimly through the rain the outline of a rocky grasstopped hill in the distance it reminded me of the fairies dun where i had stepped through a rock and emerged from a rabbit hole only six months but it seemed like a very long time ago jamie had come to stand beside me at the window staring absently out at the driving rain he said there was another reason the main one reason i said stupidly why i married you which was i dont know what i expected him to say perhaps some further revelation of his familys contorted affairs what he did say was more of a shock in its way because i wanted you he turned from the window to face me more than i ever wanted anything in my life he added softly i continued staring at him dumbstruck whatever i had been expecting it wasnt this seeing my openmouthed expression he continued lightly when i asked my da how ye knew which was the right woman he told me when the time came id have no doubt and i didnt when i woke in the dark under that tree on the road to leoch with you sitting on my chest cursing me for bleeding to death i said to myself jamie fraser for all ye canna see what she looks like and for all she weighs as much as a good draft horse this is the woman i started toward him and he backed away talking rapidly i said to myself shes mended ye twice in as many hours me lad life amongst the mackenzies being what it is it might be as well to wed a woman as can stanch a wound and set broken bones and i said to myself jamie lad if her touch feels so bonny on your collarbone imagine what it might feel like lower down he dodged around a chair of course i thought it might ha just been the effects of spending four months in a monastery without benefit of female companionship but then that ride through the dark together he paused to sigh theatrically neatly evading my grab at his sleeve with that lovely broad arse wedged between my thighs he ducked a blow aimed at his left ear and sidestepped getting a low table between us and that rocksolid head thumping me in the chest a small metal ornament bounced off his own head and went clanging to the floor i said to myself he was laughing so hard at this point that he had to gasp for breath between phrases jamie i said for all shes a sassenach bitch with a tongue like an adders with a bum like that what does it matter if shes a fface like a shshsheep i tripped him neatly and landed on his stomach with both knees as he hit the floor with a crash that shook the house you mean to tell me that you married me out of love i demanded he raised his eyebrows struggling to draw in breath have i not just been saying so grabbing me round the shoulders with one arm he wormed the other hand under my skirt and proceeded to inflict a series of merciless pinches on that part of my anatomy he had just been praising returning to pick up her embroidery basket jenny sailed in at this point and stood eyeing her brother with some amusement and what are you up to young jamie me lad she inquired one eyebrow up im makin love to my wife he panted breathless between giggling and fighting well ye could find a more suitable place for it she said raising the other eyebrow that floorll give ye splinters in your arse if lallybroch was a peaceful place it was also a busy one everyone in it seemed to stir into immediate life at cockcrow and the farm then spun and whirred like a complicated bit of clockwork until after sunset when one by one the cogs and wheels that made it run began to fall away rolling off into the dark to seek supper and bed only to reappear like magic in their proper places in the morning so essential did every last man woman and child seem to the running of the place that i could not imagine how it had fared these last few years lacking its master now not only jamies hands but mine as well were pressed into full employment for the first time i understood the stern scotch strictures against idleness that had seemed like mere quaintness before or after as the case might be idleness would have seemed not only a sign of moral decay but an affront to the natural order of things there were moments of course those small spaces of time too soon gone when everything seems to stand still and existence is balanced on a perfect point like the moment of change between the dark and the light when both and neither surround you i was enjoying such a moment on the evening of the second or third day following our arrival at the farmhouse sitting on the fence behind the house i could see tawny fields to the edge of the cliff past the broch and the mesh of trees on the far side of the pass dimming to black before the pearly glow of the sky objects near and far away seemed to be at the same distance as their long shadows melted into the dusk the air was chilly with a hint of the coming frost and i thought i must go in soon though i was reluctant to leave the still beauty of the place i wasnt aware of jamie approaching until he slid the heavy folds of a cloak around my shoulders i hadnt realized quite how cold it was until i felt the contrasting warmth of the thick wool jamies arms came around me with the cloak and i nestled back against him shivering slightly i could see ye shivering from the house he said taking my hands in his catch a chill if youre not careful and what about you i twisted about to look at him despite the increasing bite of the air he looked completely comfortable in nothing but shirt and kilt with no more than a slight reddening of the nose to show it was not the balmiest of spring evenings ah well im used to it scotsmen are none so thinblooded as ye bluenosed southrons he tilted my chin up and kissed my nose smiling i took him by the ears and adjusted his aim downward it lasted long enough for our temperatures to have equalized by the time he released me and the warm blood sang in my ears as i leaned back balancing on the fence rail the breeze blew from behind me fluttering strands of hair across my face he brushed them off my shoulders spreading the ruffled locks out with his fingers so the setting sun shone through the strands you look like youve a halo with the light behind ye that way he said softly an angel crowned with gold and you i answered softly tracing the edge of his jaw where the amber light sparked from his sprouting beard why didnt you tell me before he knew what i meant one eyebrow went up and he smiled half his face lit by the glowing sun the other half in shadow well i knew ye didna want to wed me id no wish to burden you or make myself foolish by telling you then when it was plain youd lie with me only to honor vows youd rather not have made he grinned teeth white in the shadow forestalling my protest the first time at least ive my pride woman i reached out and drew him to me pulling him close so that he stood between my legs as i sat on the fence feeling the faint chill of his skin i wrapped my legs around his hips and enfolded him with the wings of my cloak under the sheltering fabric his arms came tight around me pressing my cheek against the smudged cambric of his shirt my love he whispered oh my love i do want ye so not the same thing is it i said loving and wanting i mean he laughed a little huskily damn close sassenach for me at least i could feel the strength of his wanting hard and urgent he stepped back suddenly and stooping lifted me from the fence where are we going we were headed away from the house toward the cluster of sheds in the shadow of the elm grove to find a haystack chapter kisses and drawers i gradually found my own place in the running of the estate as jenny could no longer manage the long walk to the tenants cottages i took to visiting them myself accompanied sometimes by a stable lad sometimes by jamie or ian i took food and medicines with me treated the sick as best i could and made suggestions as to the improvement of health and hygiene which were received with varying degrees of grace at lallybroch itself i poked about the house and grounds making myself useful wherever i could mostly in the gardens besides the lovely little ornamental garden the manor had a small herb garden and an immense kitchen garden or kailyard that supplied turnips cabbages and vegetable marrows jamie was everywhere in the study with the account books in the fields with the tenants in the horse barn with ian making up for lost time there was something more than duty or interest in it too i thought we would have to leave soon he wanted to set things running in a path that would continue while he was gone until he until we could return for good i knew we would have to leave yet surrounded by the peaceful house and grounds of lallybroch and the cheerful company of jenny ian and small jamie i felt as though i had come home at last after breakfast one morning jamie rose from the table announcing that he thought he would go as far as the head of the valley to see a horse that martin mack had for sale jenny turned from the sideboard brows drawn together dye think it safe jamie theres been english patrols all through the district the last month or so he shrugged taking his coat from the chair where he had laid it ill be careful oh jamie said ian coming in with an armful of firewood for the hearth i meant to ask can ye gang up to the mill this morning jock was up yestereen to say somethings gone amiss wi the wheel i had a quick look but he and i together couldna shift it i think theres a bit o rubbish stuck in the works outside but its well under the water he stamped his wooden leg lightly smiling at me i can still walk thank god and ride as well but i canna swim i just thrash about and gang in circles like a doodlebug jamie laid the coat back on the chair with a smile at his brotherinlaws description none so bad ian if it keeps ye from havin to spend the morning in a freezing millpond aye ill go he turned to me care to walk up wi me sassenach its a fine morning and ye can bring your wee basket he cocked an ironic eye at the enormous withy basket i used for gathering ill go and change my sark be wi ye in a moment he headed for the staircase and bounded athletically up the steps three at a time ian and i exchanged smiles if there was any regret that such feats were now beyond him it was hidden beneath his pleasure in seeing jamies exuberance its good to have him back he said i only wish we could stay i said with regret the soft brown eyes filled with alarm yell no be going at once surely i shook my head no not at once but well need to leave well before the snow comes jamie had decided that our best course was to go to beauly seat of clan fraser perhaps his grandfather lord lovat could be of help if not he might at least arrange us passage to france ian nodded reassured oh aye but youve a few weeks yet it was a beautiful bright autumn day with air like cider and a sky so blue you could drown in it we walked slowly so that i could keep an eye out for lateblooming eglantine and teasel heads chatting casually its quarter day next week jamie remarked will your new gown be ready then i expect so why is it an occasion he smiled down at me taking the basket while i stooped to pull up a stalk of tansy oh in a way nothing like colums great affairs to be sure but all the lallybroch tenants will come to pay their rents and their respects to the new lady lallybroch i expect theyll be surprised youve married an englishwoman i reckon there are a few fathers might be disappointed at that id courted a lass or two hereabouts before i got arrested and taken to fort william sorry you didnt wed a local girl i asked coquettishly if ye think im going to say yes and you standin there holding a pruning knife he remarked youve less opinion of my good sense than i thought i dropped the pruning knife which id taken to dig with stretched my arms out and stood waiting when he released me at last i stooped to pick up the knife again saying teasingly i always wondered how it was you stayed a virgin so long are the girls in lallybroch all plain then no he said squinting up into the morning sun it was mostly my father was responsible for that wed stroll over the fields in the evenings sometimes he and i and talk about things and once i got old enough for such a thing to be a possibility he told me that a man must be responsible for any seed he sows for its his duty to take care of a woman and protect her and if i wasna prepared to do that then id no right to burden a woman with the consequences of my own actions he glanced behind us toward the house and toward the small family graveyard near the foot of the broch where his parents were buried he said the greatest thing in a mans life is to lie wi a woman he loves he said softly he smiled at me eyes blue as the sky overhead he was right i touched his face lightly tracing the broad sweep downward from cheek to jaw rather hard on you though if he expected you to wait so long to marry i said jamie grinned kilt flapping round his knees in the brisk autumn breeze well the church does teach that selfabuse is a sin but my father said he thought that if it came to a choice between abusin yourself or some poor woman a decent man might choose to make the sacrifice when i stopped laughing i shook my head and said no no i wont ask you did stay a virgin though strictly by the grace of god and my father sassenach i dinna think i thought much about anything but the lasses once i turned fourteen or so but that was when i was sent to foster wi dougal at beannachd no girls there i asked i thought dougal had daughters aye he has four the two younger are no much to look at but the eldest was a verra handsome lassie a year or two older than me molly was and not much flattered by my attention i dinna think i used to stare at her across the supper table and shed look down her nose at me and ask did i have the catarrh because if so i should go to bed and if not she would be much obliged if id close my mouth as she didna care to look at my tonsils while she was eating i begin to see how you stayed a virgin i said hiking my skirts to climb a stile but they cant all have been like that no he said reflectively giving me a hand over the stile no they werent mollys younger sister tabitha was a bit friendlier he smiled reminiscently tibby was the first girl i kissed or perhaps i should say the first girl who kissed me i was carrying two pails of milk for her from the barn to the dairy plotting all the way how id get her behind the door where there wasna room to get away and kiss her there but my hands were full and she had to open the door for me to go through so it was me ended up behind the door and tib who walked up to me took me by both ears and kissed me spilled the milk too he added sounds a memorable first experience i said laughing i doubt i was her first he said grinning she knew a lot more about it than i did but we didna get much practice a day or two later her mother caught us in the pantry she didna do more than give me a sharpish look and tell tibby to go and set the table for dinner but she must have told dougal about it if dougal mackenzie had been quick to resent an insult to his sisters honor i could only imagine what he might have done in defense of his daughters i shudder to think i said grinning so do i said jamie shuddering he shot me a sidelong glance looking shy youll know that young men in the morning sometimes they wake up with well with he was blushing yes i know i said so do old men of twentythree you think i dont notice youve brought it to my attention often enough mmmphm well the morning after tibs mother caught us i woke up just at dawn id been dreaming about her tib i mean not her mother and i wasna surprised to feel a hand on my cock what was surprising was that it wasnt mine surely it wasnt tibbys well no it wasna it was her fathers dougal whatever well i opened my eyes wide and he smiled down at me verra pleasant and then he sat on the bed and we had a nice little chat uncle and nephew fosterfather to fosterson he said how much he was enjoying my being there him not having a son of his own and all that and how his family was all so fond of me and all and how he would hate to think that there might be any advantage taken of such fine innocent feelings as his daughters might have toward me but how of course he was so pleased that he could trust me as he would his own son and all the time he was talking and me lying there he had his one hand on his dirk and the other resting on my fine young balls so i said yes uncle and no uncle and when he left i rolled myself up in the quilt and dreamed about pigs and i didna kiss a girl again until i was sixteen and went to leoch he looked over at me smiling his hair was laced back with a leather thong but the shorter ends were sticking up at the crown as usual glimmering red and gold in the brisk clear air his skin had darkened to a golden bronze during our journey from leoch and craigh na dun and he looked like an autumn leaf swirling joyfully windborne and what of you my bonny sassenach he asked grinning did ye have the wee laddies panting at your heels or were ye shy and maidenly a bit less than you i said circumspectly i was eight jezebel who was the lucky lad the dragomans son that was in egypt he was nine och well youre no to blame then led astray by an older man and a bloody heathen no less the mill came into sight below picturepretty with a deepred vine glowing up the side of the yellow plaster wall and shutters standing open to the daylight tidy in spite of the worn green paint the water gushed happily down the sluice under the idle waterwheel into the millpond there were even ducks on the pond teal and goldeneye paused for a rest on their southern flight look i said pausing at the top of the hill putting a hand on jamies arm to stop him isnt it lovely be a sight more lovely if the waterwheel were turnin he said practically then he glanced down at me and smiled aye sassenach its a bonny place i used to swim here when i was a lad theres a wide pool round the bend of the stream a little further down the hill the pool became visible through the screen of willows so did the boys there were four of them sporting and splashing and yelling all naked as jays brrr i said watching them the weather was fine for autumn but there was enough of a nip in the air to make me glad of the shawl id brought it makes my blood run cold just to see them och jamie said well let me warm it for ye then with a glance down at the boys in the stream he stepped back into the shade of a big horse chestnut tree he put his hands about my waist and drew me into the shadow after him ye werena the first lass i kissed he said softly but i swear youll be the last and he bent his head to my upturned face once the miller had emerged from his lair and hasty introductions were made i retired to the bank of the millpond while jamie spent several minutes listening to an explanation of the problem as the miller went back into the millhouse to try turning the stone from within jamie stood a moment staring into the dark weedy depths of the millpond finally with a shrug of resignation he began to strip off his clothes no help for it he remarked to me ians right theres something stuck in the wheel under the sluice ill have to go down and stopped by my gasp he turned around to where i sat on the bank with my basket and whats amiss wi you he demanded have ye no seen a man in his drawers before not not like that i managed to get out between sputters anticipating possible submergence he had donned beneath his kilt a short garment of incredible elderliness originally of red flannel now patched with a dazzling array of colors and textures obviously this pair of drawers had originally belonged to someone who measured several inches more around the middle than jamie they hung precariously from his hipbones the folds drooping in vs over his flat belly your grandfathers i guessed making a highly unsuccessful effort to suppress my giggling or your grandmothers my fathers he said coldly looking down his nose at me ye dinna expect me to be swimming bare as an egg before my wife and my tenants do ye with considerable dignity he gathered the excess material up in one hand and waded into the millpond treading water near the wheel he took his bearings then with a deep breath upended and submerged my last sight of him the ballooning bottom of the red flannel drawers the miller leaning out of the millhouse window shouted encouragement and directions whenever the sleek wet head broke the surface for air the edge of the pond bank was thick with water plants and i foraged with my digging stick for mallow root and the small fineleaved dropwort i had half the basket filled when i heard a polite cough behind me she was a very old lady indeed or at least she looked it she leaned on a hawthorn stick enveloped in garments she must have worn twenty years before now much too voluminous for the shrunken frame inside them good morn to ye she said nodding a head like a bobbin she wore a starched white kertch that hid most of her hair but a few wisps of irongrey peeped out beside cheeks like withered apples good morning i said and started to scramble up but she advanced a few steps and sank down beside me with surprising grace i hoped she could get up again im i started but had barely opened my mouth when she interrupted yell be the new lady o course im mrs macnab grannie macnab they call me along o my daughtersinlaw all bein mrs macnabs as weel she reached out a skinny hand and pulled my basket toward her peering into it mallow root ah thats good for cough but ye dinna want to use that one lassie she poked at a small brownish tuber looks like lily root but it isna that what is it i asked adderstongue eat that one lassie and yell be rollin round the room wi your heels behind yer head she plucked the tuber from the basket and threw it into the pond with a splash she pulled the basket onto her lap and pawed expertly through the remaining plants while i watched with a mixture of amusement and irritation at last satisfied she handed it back weel youre none sae foolish for a sassenach lassie she remarked ye ken betony from lambsquarters at least she cast a glance toward the pond where jamies head appeared briefly sleek as a seal before disappearing once again beneath the millhouse i see his lairdship didna wed ye for your face alone thank you i said choosing to construe this as a compliment the old ladys eyes sharp as needles were fastened on my midsection not wi child yet she demanded raspberry leaves thats the thing steep a handful wi rosehips and drink it when the moons waxing from the quarter to the full then when it wanes from the full to the half take a bit o barberry to purge your womb oh i said well id a bit of a favor to ask his lairdship the old lady went on but as i see hes a bit occupied at present ill tell you about it all right i agreed weakly not seeing how i could stop her anyway its my grandson she said fixing me with small grey eyes the size and shininess of marbles my grandson rabbie that is ive sixteen altogether and the three o them named robert but the ones bob and tother rob and the wee ones rabbie congratulations i said politely i want his lairdship to take the lad on as stable lad she went on well i cant say its his father ye ken she said leaning forward confidentially not as ill say theres aught wrong wi a bit o firmness spare the rod and spoil the child ive said often enough and the good lord kens weel enough that boys were meant to be smacked or hed not ha filled em sae full o the deil but when it comes to layin a child out on the hearth and a bruise on his face the size o my hand and for naught more than takin an extra bannock from the platter then rabbies father beats him you mean i interrupted the old lady nodded pleased with my ready intelligence to be sure is that no what ive been sayin she held up a hand now in the regular way o course id not interfere a mans sons his ain to do as he sees fit wi but weel rabbies a bit of a favorite o mine and its no the lads fault as his fathers a drunken sot shameful as tis for his own mither to say such a thing she raised an admonitory finger like a stick not but what ronalds father didna take a drop too much from time to time but lay a hand on me or the bairns he never did not after the first time at any rate she added thoughtfully she twinkled suddenly at me little cheeks round and firm as summer apples so i could see what a very lively and attractive girl she must have been he struck me the once she confided and i snatched the girdle off the fire and crowned him wi it she rocked back and forth laughing thought id kilt him for sure and me wailin and holdin of his heid in my lap thinkin what would i do a widow wi twa bairns to feed but he came round she said matteroffactly and neer laid a hand on me or the bairnies again i bore thirteen ye ken she said proudly and raised ten congratulations i said meaning it raspberry leaves she said laying a confiding hand on my knee mark me lassie raspberry leaves will do it and if not come to see me and ill make ye a bittie drink o coneflower and marrow seed wi a raw egg beaten up in it thatll draw yer mans seed straight up into the womb ye ken and youll be swellin like a pumpkin by easter i coughed growing a bit red in the face mmmphm and you want jamie er his lairdship i mean to take your grandson into his house as stable lad to get him away from his father aye thats it now hes a brankie wee worker is rabbie and his lairdship will no be the old ladys face froze in the midst of her animated conversation i turned to look over my shoulder and froze as well redcoats dragoons six of them on horseback making their way carefully down the hill toward the millhouse with admirable presence of mind mrs macnab stood up and sat down again on top of jamies discarded clothes her spreading skirts hiding everything there was a splash and an explosive gasp from the millpond behind me as jamie surfaced again i was afraid to call out or move for fear of attracting the dragoons attention to the pond but the sudden dead silence behind me told me he had seen them the silence was broken by a single word traveling across the water softly spoken but heartfelt in its sincerity merde he said the old lady and i sat unmoving stonefaced watching the soldiers come down the hill at the last moment as they made the final turn around the millhouse path she turned swiftly to me and laid a stickstraight finger across her withered lips i mustnt speak and let them hear that i was english i didnt have time even to nod in acknowledgment before the mudcaked hooves came to a halt a few feet away good morrow to you ladies said the leader he was a corporal but not i was pleased to see corporal hawkins a quick glance showed me that none of the men were among those i had seen at fort william and i relaxed my grip on the handle of my basket just a fraction we saw the mill from above the dragoon said and thought perhaps to purchase a sack of meal he divided a bow between us not sure who to address mrs macnab was frosty but polite good morrow she said inclining her head but if yeve come for meal i fear me yell be sair disappointit the mill wheels nae workin just now perhaps next time ye come this way oh whats amiss then the corporal a short young man with a fresh complexion seemed interested he walked down to the edge of the pond to peer at the wheel the miller popping up in the mill to report the latest progress with the millstone saw him and hastily popped back down out of sight the corporal called to one of his men climbing up the slope he gestured to the other soldier who obligingly stooped to let the corporal climb on his back reaching up he managed to catch the edge of the roof with both hands and squirmed up onto the thatch standing he could barely reach the edge of the great wheel he reached out and rocked it with both hands bending down he shouted through the window to the miller to try turning the millstone by hand i willed myself to keep my eyes away from the bottom of the sluice i wasnt sufficiently familiar with the workings of waterwheels to know for sure but i was afraid that if the wheel gave way suddenly anything near the underwater works might be crushed apparently this was no idle fear for mrs macnab spoke sharply to one of the soldiers near us ye should ca your master doon now laddie hell do no good tae the mill or himsel ye shouldna meddle wi things as ye dinna understand oh youve no cause for worry missus said the soldier casually corporal silverss father has a wheat mill in hampshire what the corporal doesnt know about waterwheels would fit in me shoe mrs macnab and i exchanged looks of alarm the corporal after a bit more clambering up and down and exploratory rockings and pokings came down to where we sat he was perspiring freely and wiped his red face with a large grubby handkerchief before addressing us i cant move it from above and that fool of a miller doesnt seem to speak any english at all he glanced at mrs macnabs sturdy stick and gnarled limbs then at me perhaps the young lady could come and talk to him for me mrs macnab stretched out a protective hand gripping me by the sleeve yell hae to pardon my daughterinlaw sorr shes gone sair saft in the heid ever syne her last babe was stillborn hasna spoke a word in ower a year puir lassie and i canna leave her for a minute for fear shell throw hersel intae the water in her grief i did my best to look softheaded no great effort in my present state of mind the corporal looked disconcerted oh he said well he wandered down to the edge of the pond and stood frowning into the water he looked just as jamie had an hour before and apparently for the same reason no help for it collins he said to the old trooper ill have to go under and see whats holding it he took off his scarlet coat and began to unfasten the cuffs of his shirt i exchanged looks of horror with mrs macnab while there might be sufficient air under the millhouse for survival certainly there was not room to hide very effectively i was considering not very optimistically the chances of throwing a convincing epileptic fit when the great wheel suddenly creaked overhead with a sound like a tree being murdered the big arc made a swooping halfturn stuck for a moment then rolled into a steady revolution scoops merrily pouring bright streamlets into the sluice the corporal paused in his undressing admiring the arc of the wheel look at that collins wonder what was stuck in it as though in answer something came into sight at the top of the wheel it hung from one of the scoops sodden red folds dripping the scoop hit the stream now churning down the sluice the object came loose and jamies fathers erstwhile drawers floated majestically out onto the waters of the millpond the elderly trooper fished them out with a stick presenting them gingerly to his commander who plucked them off the stick like a man obliged to pick up a dead fish hm he said holding up the garment critically wonder where on earth that came from must have been caught around the shaft curious that something like that could cause so much trouble isnt it collins yessir the trooper plainly did not consider the interior workings of a scottish mill wheel to be of absorbing interest but answered politely after turning the cloth over a time or two the corporal shrugged and used it to wipe the dirt from his hands decent bit of flannel he said wringing out the sopping cloth itll do to polish tack at least something of a souvenir eh collins and with a polite bow to mrs macnab and me he turned to his horse the dragoons had barely disappeared from sight over the brow of the hill when a splashing from the millpond heralded the rising from the depths of the resident water sprite he was the bloodless white bluetinged of carrara marble and his teeth chattered so hard that i could barely make out his first words which were in any case in gaelic mrs macnab had no trouble making them out and her ancient jaw dropped she snapped it shut though and made a low reverence toward the emergent laird seeing her he stopped his progress toward the shore the water still lapping modestly about his hips he took a deep breath clenching his teeth to stop the chattering and plucked a streamer of duckweed off his shoulder mrs macnab he said bowing to his elderly tenant sir she said bowing back once again a fine day is it no a bit bbrisk he said casting an eye at me i shrugged helplessly were pleased to see ye back in yer home sir and its our hope the lads and mysel as youll soon be back to stay mine too mrs macnab jamie said courteously he jerked his head at me glaring i smiled blandly the old lady ignoring this byplay folded her gnarled hands in her lap and settled back with dignity ive a wee favor i was wishin to ask of your lairdship she began havin tae do wi grannie macnab jamie interrupted advancing a menacing halfstep through the water whatever your wish is ill do it provided only that yell give me back my shirt before my parts fall off wi cold chapter more honesty in the evenings when supper was cleared away we generally sat in the drawing room with jenny and ian talking companionably of this and that or listening to jennys stories tonight though it was my turn and i held jenny and ian rapt as i told them about mrs macnab and the redcoats god kens well enough that boys need to be smacked or hed no fill them sae full o the deil my imitation of grannie macnab brought down the house jenny wiped tears of laughter from her eyes lord its true enough and shed know it too what has she got ian eight boys ian nodded aye at least i canna even remember all their names seemed like there was always a couple of macnabs about to hunt or fish or swim with when jamie and i were younger you grew up together i asked jamie and ian exchanged wide complicitous grins oh aye were familiar jamie said laughing ians father was the factor for lallybroch like ian is now on a number of occasions during my reckless youth ive found myself standing elbow to elbow with mr murray there explaining to one or other of our respective fathers how appearances can be deceiving or failing that why circumstances alter cases and failin that said ian ive found myself on the same number of occasions bent over a fence rail alongside mr fraser there listenin to him yell his heid off while waitin for my own turn never replied jamie indignantly i never yelled ye call it what ye like jamie his friend answered but ye were awful loud ye could hear the both of ye for miles jenny interjected and not only the yelling ye could hear jamie arguing all the time right up to the fence aye ye should ha been a lawyer jamie but i dinna ken why i always let you do the talking said ian shaking his head you always got us in worse trouble than we started jamie began to laugh again you mean the broch i do ian turned to me motioning toward the west where the ancient stone tower rose from the hill behind the house one of jamies better arguments that was he said rolling his eyes upward he told brian it was uncivilized to use physical force in order to make your point of view prevail corporal punishment was barbarous he said and oldfashioned to boot thrashing someone just because they had committed an act with whose ramramifications that was it with whose ramifications ye didnt agree was not at a a constructive form of punishment all of us were laughing by this time did brian listen to all of this i asked oh aye ian nodded i just stood there wi jamie nodding whenever hed stop for breath when jamie finally ran out of words his father sort of coughed a bit and said i see then he turned and looked out of the window for a little swinging the strap and nodding his head as though he were thinking we were standing there elbow to elbow like jamie said sweating at last brian turned about and told us to follow him to the stables he gave us each a broom a brush and a bucket and pointed us in the direction of the broch said jamie taking up the story said id convinced him of my point so hed decided on a more constructive form of punishment ians eyes rolled slowly up as though following the rough stones of the broch upward that tower rises sixty feet from the ground he told me and its thirty feet in diameter wi three floors he heaved a sigh we swept it from the top to the bottom he said and scrubbed it from the bottom to the top it took five days and i can taste rotted oatstraw when i cough even now and you tried to kill me on the third day said jamie for getting us into that he touched his head gingerly i had a wicked gash over my ear where ye hit me wi the broom oh weel ian said comfortably that was when ye broke my nose the second time so we were even trust a murray to keep score jamie said shaking his head lets see i said counting on my fingers according to you frasers are stubborn campbells are sneaky mackenzies are charming but sly and grahams are stupid whats the murrays distinguishing characteristic ye can count on them in a fight said jamie and ian together then laughed ye can too said jamie recovering you just hope theyre on your side and both men went off into fits again jenny shook her head disapprovingly at spouse and brother and we havena even had any wine yet she said she put down her sewing and heaved herself to her feet come wi me claire well see has mrs crook made any biscuits to have wi the port coming back down the hall a quarter of an hour later with trays of refreshments i heard ian say youll not mind then jamie mind what that we wed without your consent me and jenny i mean jenny walking ahead of me came to a sudden stop outside the drawing room door there was a brief snort from the love seat where jamie lay sprawled feet propped on a hassock since i didna tell ye where i was and ye had no notion when if ever id come back i can hardly blame ye for not waiting i could see ian in profile leaning over the log basket his long goodnatured face wore a slight frown weel i didna think it right especially wi me being crippled there was a louder snort jenny couldna have a better husband if youd lost both legs and your arms as well jamie said gruffly ians pale skin flushed slightly in embarrassment jamie coughed and swung his legs down from the hassock leaning over to pick up a scrap of kindling that had fallen from the basket how did ye come to wed anyway given your scruples he asked one side of his mouth curling up gracious man ian protested ye think i had any choice in the matter up against a fraser he shook his head grinning at his friend she came up to me out in the field one day while i was tryin to mend a wagon that sprang its wheel i crawled out all covered wi muck and found her standin there looking like a bush covered wi butterflies she looks me up and down and she says he paused and scratched his head weel i dont know exactly what she said but it ended with her kissing me muck notwithstanding and saying fine then well be married on st martins day he spread his hands in comic resignation i was still explaining why we couldna do any such thing when i found myself in front of a priest saying i take thee janet and swearing to a lot of verra improbable statements jamie rocked back in his seat laughing aye i ken the feeling he said makes ye feel a bit hollow no ian smiled embarrassment forgotten it does and all i still get that feeling ye know when i see jenny sudden standing against the sun on the hill or holding wee jamie not lookin at me i see her and i think god man she cant be yours not really he shook his head brown hair flopping over his brow and then she turns and smiles at me he looked up at his brotherinlaw grinning weel ye know yourself i can see its the same wi you and your claire shes something special no jamie nodded the smile didnt leave his face but altered somehow aye he said softly aye she is that over the port and biscuits jamie and ian reminisced further about their shared boyhood and their fathers ians father william had died just the past spring leaving ian to run the estate alone you remember when your father came on us down by the spring and made us go wi him to the smithy to see how to fix a wagontree aye and he couldna understand why we kept squirming and shifting about and he kept asking ye did ye need to go to the privy both men were laughing too hard to finish the story so i looked at jenny toads she said succinctly the two o them each had five or six toads inside his shirt oh lord said ian when the one crawled up your neck and hopped out of your shirt into the forge i thought id die i cannot imagine why my father didna wring my neck on several occasions said jamie shaking his head its a wonder i ever grew up ian looked consideringly at his own offspring industriously engaged in piling wooden blocks on top of each other by the hearth i dont quite know how im goin to manage it when the time comes i have to beat my own son i mean hes well hes so small he gestured helplessly at the sturdy little figure tender neck bent to his task jamie eyed his small namesake cynically aye hell be as much a devil as you or i give him time after all i suppose even i must ha looked small and innocent at one point you did said jenny unexpectedly coming to set a pewter cup of cider in her husbands hand she patted her brother on the head you were verra sweet as a baby jamie i remember standing over your cot ye canna ha been more than two asleep wi your thumb in your mouth and we agreed wed never seen a prettier lad you had fat round cheeks and the dearest red curls the pretty lad turned an interesting shade of rose and drained his cider at one gulp avoiding my glance didna last long though jenny said flashing white teeth in a mildly malicious smile at her brother how old were ye when ye got your first thrashing jamie seven no eight jamie said thrusting a new log into the smoldering pile of kindling christ that hurt twelve strokes full across the bum and he didna let up a bit beginning to end he never did he sat back on his heels rubbing his nose with the knuckles of one hand his cheeks were flushed and his eyes bright from the exertion once it was over father went off a bit and sat down on a rock while i settled myself then when id quit howling and got down to a sort of wet snuffle he called me over to him now that i think of it i can remember just what he said maybe you can use it on young jamie ian when the time comes jamie closed his eyes recalling he stood me between his knees and made me look him in the face and said thats the first time jamie ill have to do it again maybe a hundred times before youre grown to a man he laughed a bit then and said my father did it to me at least that often and youre as stubborn and cockleheaded as ever i was he said sometimes i daresay ill enjoy thrashing you depending on what youve done to deserve it mostly i wont but ill do it nonetheless so remember it lad if your head thinks up mischief your backsides going to pay for it then he gave me a hug and said youre a braw lad jamie go away to the house now and let your mother comfort ye i opened my mouth to say something to that and he said quicklike no i know you dont need it but she does get on wi ye so i came down and mother fed me bread with jam on it jenny suddenly started to laugh i just remembered she said da used to tell that story about you jamie about thrashing you and what he said to you he said when he sent ye back to the house after you came halfway down then all of a sudden stopped and waited for him when he came down to ye you looked up at him and said i just wanted to ask faither did ye enjoy it this time and when he said no you nodded and said good i didna like it much either we all laughed for a minute together then jenny looked up at her brother shaking her head he loved to tell that story da always said youd be the death of him jamie the merriment died out of jamies face and he looked down at the big hands resting on his knees aye he said quietly well and i was then wasnt i jenny and ian exchanged glances of dismay and i looked down at my own lap not knowing what to say there was no sound for a moment but the crackling of the fire then jenny with a quick look at ian set down her glass and touched her brother on the knee jamie she said it wasna your fault he looked up at her and smiled a little bleakly no who elses then she took a deep breath and said mine what he stared at her in blank astonishment she had gone a little paler even than usual but remained composed i said it was my fault as much as anyones for for what happened to you jamie and father he covered her hand with his own and rubbed it gently dinna talk daft lass he said ye did what ye did to try to save me youre right if yed not gone wi randall hed likely have killed me here she studied her brothers face a troubled frown wrinkling her rounded brow no i dinna regret taking randall to the house not even if hed well no but that wasnt it she drew a deep breath again steeling herself when i took him inside i brought him up to my room i i didna ken quite what to expect id not been wi a man he seemed verra nervous though all flushed and as though he were not certain himself which seemed strange to me he pushed me onto the bed and then he stood there rubbing himself i thought at first id really damaged him wi my knee though i knew i hadna struck him so hard really the color was creeping up her cheeks and she stole a sidelong glance at ian before looking hastily back at her lap i ken now that he was trying to to make himself ready i didna mean to let him know i was frightened so i sat up straight on the bed and stared at him that seemed to anger him and he ordered me to turn round i wouldna do it though and just kept looking at him her face was the color of one of the roses by the doorstep he unbuttoned himself and i well i laughed at him you did what jamie said incredulously i laughed i mean her eyes met her brothers with some defiance i kent well enough how a mans made id seen you naked often enough and willy and ian as well but he a tiny smile appeared on her lips despite her apparent efforts to suppress it he looked so funny all red in the face and rubbing himself so frantic and yet still only half there was a choked sound from ian and she bit her lip but went on bravely he didna like it when i laughed and i could see it so i laughed some more thats when he lunged at me and tore my dress half off me i smacked him in the face and he struck me across the jaw hard enough to make me see stars then he grunted a bit as though that pleased him and started to climb onto the bed wi me i had just about sense enough left to laugh again i struggled up onto my knees and i i taunted him i told him i kent he was no a real man and couldna manage wi a woman i she bent her head still further so the dark curls swung down past her flaming cheeks her words were very low almost a whisper i spread the pieces of my gown apart and i taunted him wi my breasts i told him i knew he was afraid o me because he wasna fit to touch a woman but only to sport wi beasts and young lads jenny said jamie shaking his head helplessly her head came up to look at him weel i did then she said it was all i could think of and i could see that he was fair off his head but it was plain too that he couldnt and i stared right at his breeches and i laughed again and then he got his hands round my throat throttling me and i cracked my head against the bedpost and and when i woke hed gone and you wi him there were tears standing in her lovely blue eyes as she grasped jamies hands jamie will ye forgive me i know if id not angered him that way he wouldna have treated you as he did and then faither oh jenny love mo cridh dont he was kneeling beside her pulling her face into his shoulder ian on her other side looked as though he had been turned to stone jamie rocked her gently as she sobbed hush little dove ye did right jenny it wasna your fault and maybe not mine either he stroked her back listen mo cridh he came here to do damage under orders and it would ha made no difference who hed found here or what you or i might have done he meant to cause trouble to rouse the countryside against the english for his own purposes and those of the man that hired him jenny stopped crying and sat up looking at him in amazement to rouse folk against the english but why jamie made an impatient gesture with one hand to find out the folk that might support prince charles should it come to another rising but i dinna ken yet which side randalls employer is on if he wants to know so those that follow the prince can be watched and maybe have their property seized or if its that he randalls employer means to go wi the prince himself and wants the highlands roused and ready for war when the time comes i dinna ken and it isna important now he touched his sisters hair smoothing it back from her brow all thats important is that youre not harmed and i am home soon ill come back to stay mo cridh i promise she raised his hand to her lips and kissed it her face glowing she fumbled in her pocket for a handkerchief and blew her nose then she looked at ian still frozen by her side a look of hurt anger in his eyes she touched him gently on the shoulder you think i should ha told you he didnt move but went on looking at her aye he said quietly i do she put the handkerchief down in her lap and took him by both hands ian man i didna tell ye because i didna wish to lose you too my brother was gone and my father i didna mean to lose my own hearts blood as well for you are dearer to me even than home and family love she cast a lopsided smile at jamie and thats saying quite a bit she looked into ians eyes pleading and i could see love and hurt pride struggling for mastery on his face jamie rose then and touched me on the shoulder we left the room quietly leaving them together before the dying fire it was a clear night and the moonlight fell in floods through the tall casements i could not fall asleep myself and i thought perhaps it was the light also that kept jamie awake he lay quite still but i could tell by his breathing that he was not asleep he turned onto his back and i heard him chuckle softly under his breath whats funny i asked quietly he turned his head toward me oh did i wake ye sassenach im sorry i was only remembering about things i wasnt asleep i scooted closer the bed had obviously been made for the days when a whole family slept together on one mattress the gigantic featherbed must have consumed the entire productivity of hundreds of geese and navigating through the drifts was like crossing the alps without a compass what were you remembering i asked once i had safely reached his side oh about my father mostly things he said he folded his arms behind his head staring musingly at the thick beams that crossed the low ceiling its strange he said when he was alive i didna pay him much heed but once he was dead the things hed told me had a good deal more influence he chuckled briefly again what i was thinking about was the last time he thrashed me funny was it i said anyone ever told you that you have a very peculiar sense of humor jamie i fumbled through the quilts for his hand then gave up and pushed them back he began to stroke my back and i snuggled next to him making small noises of pleasure didnt your uncle beat you then when you needed it he asked curiously i smothered a laugh at the thought lord no he would have been horrified at the thought uncle lamb didnt believe in beating children he thought they should be reasoned with like adults jamie made a scottish noise in his throat indicating derision at this ludicrous idea that accounts for the defects in your character no doubt he said patting my bottom insufficient discipline in your youth what defects in my character i demanded the moonlight was bright enough for me to see his grin ye want me to list them all no i dug an elbow into his ribs tell me about your father how old were you then i asked oh thirteen fourteen maybe tall and skinny with spots i canna remember why i was being thrashed at that point it was more often something id said than something id done all i remember is we were both of us boiling mad about it that was one of the times he enjoyed beating me he pulled me to him and settled me closer against his shoulder his arm around me i stroked his flat belly toying with his navel stop that it tickles dye want to hear or no oh i want to hear what are we going to do if we ever have children reason with them or beat them my heart raced a little at the thought though there was no sign that this would ever be more than an academic question his hand trapped mine holding it still over his belly thats simple you reason with them and when youre through ill take them out and thrash them i thought you liked children i do my father liked me when i wasna being an idiot and he loved me too enough to beat the daylights out of me when i was being an idiot i flopped onto my stomach all right then tell me about it jamie sat up and wadded the pillows more comfortably before lying back down folded arms behind his head again well he sent me up to the fence as usual he always made me go up first so i could experience the proper mixture of terror and remorse while i waited for him he said but he was so angry he was right behind me i was bent over and taking it then gritting my teeth and determined id make no noise about it damned if id let him know how much it hurt i was digging my fingers into the wood of the fence rail as hard as i could hard enough to leave splinters behind and i could feel my face turnin red from holding my breath he drew a deep breath as though making up for it and let it out slowly usually id know when it was going to be over but this time he didnt stop it was all i could do to keep my mouth shut i was grunting wi each stroke and i could feel the tears starting no matter how much i blinked but i held on for dear life he was uncovered to the waist almost glowing in the moonlight frosted with tiny silver hairs i could see the pulse beat just below his breastbone a steady throb just under my hand i dont know how long it went on he continued not that long likely but it seemed like a long time to me at last he stopped a moment and shouted at me he was beside himself wi fury and i was so furious myself i could barely make out what he said at first but then i could he roared damn you jamie can ye no cry out youre grown now and i dinna mean to beat you ever again but i want one good yelp out of ye lad before i quit just so ill think ive made some impression on ye at last jamie laughed disturbing the even movement of his pulsebeat i was so upset at that i straightened up and whirled round and yelled at him weel why did ye no say so in the first place ye auld fool ouch next thing i knew i was on the ground wi my ears ringing and a pain in my jaw where hed clouted me he was standing over me panting and wi his hair and his beard all on end he reached down and got my hand and hauled me up then he patted my jaw and said still breathing hard thats for calling your father a fool it may be true but its disrespectful come on well wash for supper and he never struck me again he still shouted at me but i shouted back and it was mostly man to man after that he laughed comfortably and i smiled into the warmth of his shoulder i wish id known your father i said or maybe its better not i said struck by a thought he might not have liked you marrying an englishwoman jamie hugged me closer and pulled the quilts up over my bare shoulders hed have thought id got some sense at last he stroked my hair hed have respected my choice whoever it was but you he turned his head and kissed my brow gently he would have liked you verra much my sassenach and i recognized it for the accolade it was chapter conversations by the hearth whatever rift jennys revelations had caused between her and ian it seemed to have healed we sat for a short time after dinner in the parlor next evening ian and jamie talking over the farms business in the corner accompanied by a decanter of elderberry wine while jenny relaxed at last with her swollen ankles propped on a hassock i tried to write down some of the receipts she had tossed over her shoulder at me as we whizzed through the days work consulting her for details as i scribbled to treat carbuncles i headed one sheet three iron nails to be soaked for one week in sour ale add one handful of cedarwood shavings allow to set when shavings have sunk to the bottom mixture is ready apply three times daily beginning on the first day of a quarter moon beeswax candles began another sheet drain honey from the comb remove dead bees so far as possible melt comb with a small amount of water in a large cauldron skin bees wings and other impurities from surface of water drain water replace stir frequently for half an hour then allow to settle drain water keep for use in sweetening purify with water twice more my hand was getting tired and i had not even gotten to the making of candle molds the twisting of wicks and the hanging of candles to dry jenny i called how long does it take to make candles counting everything she laid the small shirt she was stitching in her lap considering half a day to gather the combs two to drain the honey one if its hot one day to purify the wax unless theres a lot or its verra dirty then two half a day to make the wicks one or two to make the molds half a day to melt the wax pour the molds and hang them to dry say a week altogether the dim lamplight and the sputtering quill were too much to contend with after the days labors i sat down next to jenny and admired the tiny garment she was embroidering with nearly invisible stitches her rounded stomach suddenly heaved as the inhabitant shifted position i watched fascinated i had never been close to someone pregnant for a prolonged period and hadnt realized the amount of activity that went on inside would you like to feel it jenny offered seeing me staring at her middle well she took my hand and placed it firmly on her mound right there just wait a moment hell kick again soon they dont like ye lying back like this ye know it makes them restless and they start to squirm sure enough a surprisingly vigorous push raised my hand by several inches goodness hes strong i exclaimed aye jenny patted her stomach with a touch of pride hell be bonny like his brother and his da she smiled across at ian whose attention had momentarily wandered from the breeding records of horses to his wife and childtobe or even like his goodfornothing redheided uncle she added raising her voice slightly and nudging me hey jamie looked up distracted from his accounts were ye speaking to me i wonder was it the redheided or the goodfornothing that caught his attention jenny said to me sotto voce with another nudge to jamie she said sweetly nothing at all mo cridh we were just speculating on the possibility that the new one would have the misfortune to resemble its uncle the uncle in question grinned and came across to sit on the hassock jenny amiably moving her feet then replacing them in his lap rub them for me jamie she begged youre better at it than ian he obliged and jenny leaned back and closed her eyes in bliss she dropped the tiny shirt on her central mound which continued to heave as though in protest jamie stared entranced at the movements just as i had isnt it uncomfortable he asked havin someone turn somersaults in your belly jenny opened her eyes and grimaced as a long swell arced across her stomach mmm sometimes i feel my livers black and blue from bein kicked but mostly its a good feeling instead its like she hesitated then grinned at her brother its hard to describe to a man you not having the proper parts i dont suppose i could tell ye what carrying a child feels like no more than you could tell me what its like to be kicked in the ballocks oh i could tell ye that he promptly doubled up clasping himself and rolled his eyes back in his head with a hideous gurgling groan is that not right ian he asked turning his head toward the stool where ian sat laughing wooden leg propped on the hearth his sister put a delicate foot on his chest and pushed him upright all right then clown in that case im glad i havena got any jamie straightened up and brushed the hair out of his eyes no really he said interested is it just that the parts are different could you describe it to claire after all shes a woman though shes not borne a child yet jenny eyed my midriff appraisingly and i felt that small pang once more mmm perhaps she spoke slowly thinking you feel as though your skin is verra thin all over you feel everything that touches you even the rubbing of your clothes and not just on your belly but over your legs and flanks and breasts her hands went to them unconsciously curving the lawn under the swelling rounds they feel heavy and full and theyre verra sensitive just at the tips the small blunt thumbs slowly circled the breasts and i saw the nipples rise against the cloth and of course youre big and youre clumsy jenny smiled ruefully rubbing the spot on her hip where she had banged against the table earlier you take up more room than youre used to here though her hands rose protectively to the top of her stomach thats where you feel things most of course she caressed the rounded bulge as though it were her childs skin she stroked rather than her own ians eyes followed her hands as they moved from top to bottom of the curving hillock over and over smoothing the fabric again and again in the early days its a bit like bellygas she said laughing she poked a toe into her brothers midsection just there like little bubbles rippling through your belly but then later you feel the child move and its like a fish on your line and then gone like a quick tug but so soon past youre not sure you felt it as though in protest at this description her unseen companion heaved to and fro making her stomach bulge on one side then the other i imagine youre sure by this time jamie remarked following the movement with fascination oh aye she placed a hand on one bulge as though to quiet it they sleep ye know for hours at a time sometimes ye fear theyve died when theres no movement for a long time then you try to wake them her hand pushed in sharply at the side and was rewarded immediately by a strong push in the opposite direction and youre happy when they kick again but its not just the babe itself you feel swollen all over near the end not painful just so ripe you could burst its as though you need to be touched verra lightly all over jenny was no longer looking at me her eyes held her husbands and i knew she was no longer aware of me or her brother there was an air of intimacy between her and ian as though this were a story often told but one of which they never tired her voice was lower now and her hands rose again to her breasts heavy and compelling under the light bodice and in the last month or so the milk begins to come in you feel yourself filling just a wee bit at a time a little each time the child moves and then suddenly everything comes up hard and round she cupped her stomach again theres no pain then just a breathless feeling and then your breasts tingle as though theyll explode if theyre not suckled she closed her eyes and leaned back stroking her massive belly over and over with a rhythm like the invocation of a spell it came to me watching her that if ever there were such a thing as a witch then janet fraser was one the smoky air was filled with the trance over the room the feeling that lies at the root of lust the terrible yearning need to join and create i could have counted every hair on jamies body without looking at him and knew each one stood erect jenny opened her eyes dark in the shadows and smiled at her husband a slow rich curve of infinite promise and late in bearing when the child moves a lot sometimes theres a feeling like when youve your man inside ye when he comes to ye deep and pours himself into you then then when that throbbing starts deep inside ye along with him its like that but its much bigger it ripples all through the walls of your womb and fills all of you the childs quiet then and its as though its him youve taken inside you instead suddenly she turned to me and the spell was broken thats what they want sometimes ye know she said quietly smiling into my eyes they want to come back some time later jenny rose floating toward the door with a glance back that pulled ian after her like iron to true north she paused near the door for him looking back at her brother who sat still by the fire hearth youll see to the fire jamie she stretched arching her back and the curve of her spine echoed the strangely sinuous curve of her belly ians knuckles pressed hard along the length of her back and ground into the base of her spine making her groan and then they were gone i stretched too arms upward feeling the pleasant pull of tired muscles jamies hands ran down my sides and rested on the swell of my hips i leaned back into him drawing his hands forward imagining them cupping the gentle curve of an unborn child as i turned my head to kiss him i noticed the small form curled in the corner of the settle look theyve forgotten small jamie the little boy customarily slept on a trundle in his parents room tonight he had fallen asleep by the fire while we sat talking over the wine but no one had remembered to carry him up to his bed my own jamie turned me to face him smoothing my hair away from his nose jenny never forgets anything he said i expect she and ian do not care for company just now his hands went to the fastening at the back of my skirt hell do where he is for the present but what if he wakes up the roving hands came up under the nowloose edge of the bodice jamie cocked an eyebrow at the recumbent form of his small nephew aye well hell have to learn his job sometime wont he ye dont want him to be as ignorant as his uncle was he tossed several cushions to the floor before the fire and lowered himself carrying me with him the firelight gleamed on the silvery scars on his back as though he were in fact the iron man i had once accused him of being the metal core showing through rents in the fragile skin i traced the lashmarks one by one and he shivered under my touch do you think jennys right i asked later do men really want to come back inside is that why you make love to us a breath of laughter stirred the hair by my ear well its no usually the first thing in my mind when i take ye to bed sassenach far from it but then his hands cupped my breasts softly and his lips closed on one nipple id no just say she was completely wrong either sometimes aye sometimes it would be good to be inside again safe and one knowing we cannot i suppose is what makes us want to beget if we cannot go back ourselves the best we can do is to give that precious gift to our sons at least for a little while he shook himself suddenly like a dog flinging water from its coat pay me no mind sassenach he murmured i get verra maudlin drinking elderberry wine chapter quarter day there was a light knock on the door and jenny stepped in carrying a folded blue garment over her arm and a hat in one hand she looked her brother over critically then nodded aye the shirts well enough and ive let out your best coat for ye youve grown a bit through the shoulders since i saw ye last she cocked her head to one side considering yeve done a braw job of it today up to the neck at least sit ye down over there and ill tend to your hair she pointed to the stool by the window my hair whats wrong wi my hair jamie demanded putting a hand up to check grown nearly to shoulderlength he had as usual laced it back with a leather thong to keep it out of his face wasting no time on chat his sister pushed him down onto the stool yanked the thong loose and began to brush him vigorously with the tortoiseshell brushes whats wrong wi your hair she asked rhetorically weel now theres cockleburs in it for one thing she plucked a small brown object delicately from his head and dropped it on the dresser and bits of oak leaf where were ye yesterday rootling under the trees like a hog and more tangles than a skein of washed yarn ouch be still roy frowning with concentration she picked up a comb and teased out the tangles leaving a smooth shining mass of auburn copper cinnamon and gold all gleaming together in the morning sun from the window jenny spread it in her hands shaking her head over it i canna think why the good lord should waste hair like that on a man she remarked like a reddeers pelt in places it is wonderful isnt it i agreed look where the suns bleached it on top hes got those lovely blond streaks the object of our admiration glowered up at us if ye both dinna stop it i shall shave my head he stretched out a threatening hand toward the dresser where his razor rested his sister deft in spite of the enormous bulge of pregnancy reached out and smacked his wrist with the hairbrush he yelped then yelped again as she yanked the hair back into a fistful keep still she ordered she began to separate the hair into three thick strands ill make ye a proper cockernonny she declared with satisfaction ill no have ye goin down to your tenants looking like a savage jamie muttered something rebellious under his breath but subsided under his sisters ministrations dexterously tucking in stray bits here and there she plaited the hair into a thick formal queue tucking the ends under and binding them securely with thread then she reached into her pocket pulled out a blue silk ribbon and triumphantly tied it in a bow there she said bonny no she turned to me for confirmation and i had to admit it the closely bound hair set off the shape of his head and the bold modeling of his face clean and orderly in snowy linen and grey breeches he cut a wonderful figure especially the ribbon i said suppressing an urge to laugh the same color as his eyes jamie glared at his sister no he said shortly no ribbons this isna france nor yet king geordies court i dinna care if its the color of the virgins cloak no ribbons janet oh all right then fusspot there she pulled the ribbon loose and stood back aye yell do she said with satisfaction then she turned her penetrating blue eyes on me hm she said tapping her foot thoughtfully as i had arrived more or less in rags it had been necessary to make me two new gowns as quickly as possible one of homespun for daily use and one of silk for occasions of state such as this better at stitching wounds than cloth i had helped with the cutting and pinning but been obliged to leave the design and sewing to jenny and mrs crook they had done a beautiful job and the primrose yellow silk fitted my torso like a glove with deep folds rolling back over the shoulders and falling behind in panels that flowed into the luxuriant drape of the full skirt bowing reluctantly to my absolute refusal to wear corsets they had instead ingeniously reinforced the upper bodice with whalebone stays ruthlessly stripped from an old corset jennys eyes traveled slowly upward from my feet to my head where they lingered with a sigh she reached for the hairbrush you too she said i sat face burning avoiding jamies eyes as she carefully removed small twigs and bits of oak leaf from my curls depositing them on the dresser next to those seined from her brothers hair eventually my hair was combed out and pinned up and she reached into her pocket and pulled out a small lace cap there she said pinning it firmly to the top of my pile of curls kertch and all verra respectable ye look claire i assumed this was meant as a compliment and murmured something in reply have ye any jewelry though jenny asked i shook my head no im afraid not all i had were the pearls jamie gave me for our wedding and those under the circumstances of our departure from leoch pearls had been the last thing on my mind oh jamie exclaimed suddenly reminded he dug in the sporran resting on the dresser and triumphantly pulled out the string of pearls where on earth did you get those i asked in amazement murtagh brought them early this morning he answered he went back to leoch during the trial and got everything he could carry thinking that wed need it if we got away he looked for us on the road here but of course wed gone to to the hill first is he still here i asked jamie stood behind me to fasten the necklace oh aye hes downstairs eating everything in the kitchen and deviling mrs crook aside from his songs i had heard the wiry little man say less than three dozen words throughout the course of our acquaintanceship and the thought of his deviling anyone was incongruous he must feel remarkably at home at lallybroch i thought who is murtagh i asked i mean is he a relation of yours jamie and jenny both looked surprised oh aye the latter replied she turned to her brother hes what jamie fathers second cousins uncle nephew he corrected ye dinna remember old leo had the two boys and then i put my hands over my ears in a marked manner this seemed to remind jenny of something for she clapped her hands together earbobs she exclaimed i think ive some pearl ones that will just do with that necklace ill fetch them directly she vanished with her usual light speed why does your sister call you roy i asked curiously watching as he tied his stock before the looking glass he wore the customary expression of a man doing battle with a mortal enemy common to all men adjusting their neckwear but he unclamped his lips to grin at me och that it isna the english name roy its a pet name in gaelic the color of my hair the words ruadh means red he had to spell the word and say it over several times before i could catch any difference sounds the same to me roy i said shaking my head jamie picked up his sporran and began tucking in the loose bits of things that had come out when he pulled out the pearls finding a tangled length of fishing line he upended the bag over the bed dumping everything in a pile he began to sort through it painstakingly winding up the bits of line and string finding loose fish hooks and firmly reimbedding them in the piece of cork where they normally rested i moved over to the bed and inspected the array ive never seen so much rubbish in my life i observed youre a regular jackdaw jamie it isna rubbish he said stung ive uses for all these things well the fish lines and the hooks yes and the string for snares even stretching a point the pistol wadding and the balls you do carry a pistol now and again and the little snake willie gave you i understand that but the stones and a snail shell and a piece of glass and i bent closer to peer at a dark furry mass of something what is it isnt is it jamie why on earth are you carrying a dried moles foot in your sporran against rheumatism of course he snatched the object from under my nose and stuffed it back in the badger skin oh of course i agreed surveying him with interest his face was mildly flushed with embarrassment it must work you dont creak anywhere i picked a small bible out of the remaining rubble and thumbed through it while he stowed away the rest of his valuable equipment alexander william roderick macgregor i read aloud the name on the flyleaf you said there was a debt owing him jamie what did you mean by that oh that he sat down beside me on the bed took the small book from me and gently flipped the pages i told ye this belonged to a prisoner whod died at fort william no yes i didna know the lad myself he died a month before i came there but the doctor who gave it to me told me about him while he tended my back i think he needed to tell someone about it and he couldna speak to anyone in the garrison he closed the book holding it on his knee and stared out the window at the gay october sunshine alex macgregor a lad of eighteen or so had been arrested for the common offense of cattlelifting a fair quiet lad he had seemed likely to serve his sentence and be released without incident a week before his release though he had been found hanging in the horseshed there was no doubt hed done it himself the doctor said jamie caressed the leather cover of the small book drawing one large thumb along the binding and he did not exactly say what he thought himself but he did say that captain randall had had a private conversation with the lad a week before i swallowed suddenly cold despite the sunshine and you think no his voice was soft and certain i dinna think i know and so did the doctor and i imagine the sergeantmajor knew for certain and thats why he died he spread his hands flat on his knees looking down at the long joints of his fingers large strong and capable the hands of a farmer the hands of a warrior he picked up the small bible and put it into the sporran ill tell ye this mo duinne one day jack randall will die at my hands and when he is dead i shall send back that book to the mother of alex macgregor with word that her son is avenged the air of tension was broken by the sudden reappearance of jenny now resplendent in blue silk and her own lace kertch holding a large box of worn red morocco leather jamie the currans are come and willie murray and the jeffries youd best go down and have a second breakfast with them ive put out fresh bannocks and salt herring and mrs crooks doing fresh jam cakes oh aye claire come down when youre ready rising hastily he paused long enough to gather me up for a brief but thorough kiss and disappeared his footsteps clattered down the first flight of stairs slowing on the second to the more sedate pace suitable to a lairds entrance as he neared the ground floor jenny smiled after him then turned her attention to me placing the box on the bed she threw back the lid revealing a jumbled array of jewels and baubles i was surprised to see it it seemed unlike the neat orderly jenny murray whose iron hand kept the household running smoothly from dawn to dusk she stirred a finger through the bright clutter then as though picking up my thought looked up and smiled at me i keep thinking i must sort all these things one day but when i was small my mother would let me rummage in her box sometimes and it was like finding magic treasure i never knew what id pick up next i suppose i think if it were all orderly the magic would go somehow daft no no i said smiling back at her no it isnt we rummaged slowly through the box holding the cherished bits and pieces of four generations of women that was my grandmother frasers jenny said holding up a silver brooch it was in the shape of a fretworked crescent moon a small single diamond shining above the tip like a star and this she pulled out a slender gold band with a ruby surrounded by brilliants thats my wedding ring ian spent half a years salary on it though i told him he was foolish to do it the fond look on her face suggested that ian had been anything but foolish she polished the stone on the bosom of her dress and admired it once more before replacing it in the box ill be happy once the babe is born she said patting her bulge with a grimace my fingers are so swollen in the mornings i can scarcely do up my laces let alone wear my rings i caught a strange nonmetallic gleam in the depths of the box and pointed whats that oh those she said dipping into the box again ive never worn them they dont suit me but you could wear them youre tall and queenly like my mother was they were hers ye ken they were a pair of bracelets each made from the curving almostcircular tusk of a wild boar polished to a deep ivory glow the ends capped with silver tappets etched with flowered tracery lord theyre gorgeous ive never seen anything so so wonderfully barbaric jenny was amused aye that they are someone gave them to mother as a wedding gift but she never would say who my father used to tease her now and then about her admirer but she wouldna tell him either just smiled like a cat thats had cream to its supper here try them the ivory was cool and heavy on my arm i couldnt resist stroking the deep yellow surface grained with age aye they suit ye jenny declared and they go wi that yellow gown as well here are the earbobs put these on and well go down murtagh was seated at the kitchen table industriously eating ham off the end of his dirk passing behind him with a platter mrs crook dexterously bent and slid three fresh hot bannocks onto his plate hardly breaking her stride jenny was bustling to and fro preparing and overseeing pausing in her progress she peered over murtaghs shoulder at his rapidly emptying plate dont stint yourself man she remarked theres another hog in the pen after all begrudge a kinsman a bite do ye he asked not interrupting his chewing me jenny put both hands on her hips heavens no after all yeve only had the four helpings so far mrs crook she turned to call to the departing housekeeper when youve done wi the bannocks fix this starveling man a bowl of parritch to fill in the chinks with we dinna want him fainting on the doorstep ye ken when murtagh saw me standing in the doorway he promptly choked on a bite of ham mmmphm he said by way of greeting after jenny had pounded him helpfully on the back nice to see you too i replied sitting down opposite him thank you by the way mmphm the question was muffled by half a bannock spread with honey for fetching my things from the castle mmp he dismissed any notion of thanks with a wave that ended in a reach for the butter dish i brought your wee bits of plant and such as well he said with a jerk of the head at the window out in the yard in my saddlebags youve brought my medicine box thats wonderful i was delighted some of the medicinal plants were rare and had taken no little trouble to find and prepare properly but how did you manage i asked once i had recovered from the horror of the witchcraft trial i often wondered how the occupants of the castle had taken my sudden arrest and escape i hope you didnt have any difficulty och no he took another healthy bite but waited until it had made its leisurely way down his throat before replying further mrs fitz had them put away like packed up in a box already i went to her at the first ye ken for i wasna sure what reception id get very sensible i dont imagine mrs fitz would scream at sight of you i agreed the bannocks were steaming gently in the cool air and smelt heavenly i reached for one the heavy boarstooth bracelets clinking together on my wrist i saw murtaghs eyes on them and adjusted them so he could see the engraved silver end pieces arent they lovely i said jenny said they were her mothers murtaghs eyes dropped to the bowl of parritch that mrs crook had thrust unceremoniously under his nose they suit ye he mumbled then returning suddenly to the earlier subject he said no she wouldna summon help against me i was well acquent wi glenna fitzgibbons some time ago oh a longlost love of yours was she i teased enjoying the incongruous thought of him entwined in amorous embrace with the ample mrs fitz murtagh glanced up coldly from his parritch that she wasna and ill thank ye to keep a civil tongue when ye speak of the lady her husband was my mothers brother and she was sore grieved for ye ill ha ye to know i lowered my eyes abashed and reached for the honey to cover my embarrassment the stone jar had been set in a pot of boiling water to liquefy the contents and it was comfortingly warm to the touch im sorry i said drizzling the sweet golden fluid over the bannock watching carefully so as not to spill it i wondered you know what she felt like when when i they didna realize at the first ye were gone the little man said matteroffactly ignoring my apology when ye didna come in to dinner they thought maybe youd stayed late in the fields and gone up to your bed without eating your door was closed and the next day when there was all the outcry over the taking of mistress duncan no one thought to look for ye there was no mention of you only of her when the news came and in all the excitement no one thought to look for ye i nodded thoughtfully no one would have missed me save those seeking medical treatment i had spent most of my time in colums library while jamie was away what about colum i asked i was more than idly curious had he really planned it as geilie thought murtagh shrugged he scanned the table for further victuals apparently spotted nothing to his liking and leaned back folding his hands comfortably over his lean midriff when he had the news from the village he had the gates closed at once and forbade anyone from the castle to go down for fear of being caught up in the moil he leaned further back eyeing me speculatively mrs fitz thought to find ye the second day she said that she asked all the maids if theyd laid eyes on ye no one had but one of the girls said she thought perhaps yed gone to the village maybe youd taken shelter in a house there one of the girls i thought cynically the one that knew bloody well where i was he belched softly not bothering to stifle the sound i heard mrs fitz turned the castle upside down then and made colum send down a man to the village once she was sure ye werena to be found and when they learned what had happened a faint look of amusement lighted the dark face she didna tell me everything but i gathered she made himselfs life more of a misery to him than it usually is naggin at him to send down and free ye by force of arms and not the least bit of use him arguin that it had gone well beyond the point where he could do that and now it was in the hands o the examiners and one thing and another it must ha been something to see he said reflectively twa wills like that set one against the other and in the end it seemed neither had either triumphed nor given way ned gowan with his lawyers gift for compromise had found the way between them by offering to go himself to the trial not as representative of the laird but as an independent advocate did she think i might be a witch i asked curiously murtagh snorted briefly ive yet to see the auld woman believes in witches nor the young one neither its men think there must be illwishes and magic in women when its only the natural way of the creatures i begin to see why youve never married i said do ye then he pushed back his chair abruptly and rose pulling the plaid forward over his shoulders ill be off gie my respects to the laird he said to jenny who reappeared from the front hall where she had been greeting tenants hell be busy ive nae doubt jenny handed him a large cloth sack tied in a knot at the mouth and plainly holding enough provisions for a week a wee bite for the journey home she said dimpling at him might last ye at least out of sight o the house he tucked the knot of the sack snugly into his belt and nodded briefly turning toward the door aye he said and if not yell see the corbies gatherin just beyond the rise come to pick my bones a lot of good theyd get from it she answered cynically eyeing his scrawny frame ive seen more sound flesh on a broomstick murtaghs dour face remained unchanged but a faint gleam showed in his eye nonetheless oh aye he said weel ill tell ye lass the voices passed down the hall mingling in amiable insult and argument vanishing at last in the echoes of the front hall i sat at the table for a moment longer idly caressing the warm ivory of ellen mackenzies bracelets at the faroff slam of the door i shook myself and stood up to take my place as the lady of lallybroch usually a busy place on quarter day the manor house simply bristled with activity tenants came and went all day many came only long enough to pay their rents some stayed all day wandering about the estate visiting with friends taking refreshment in the parlor jenny blooming in blue silk and mrs crook starched in white linen flitted back and forth between kitchen and parlor overseeing the two maidservants who staggered to and fro under enormous platters of oatcake fruitcake crumbly and other sweets jamie having introduced me with ceremony to the tenants present in dining room and parlor then retired into his study with ian to receive the tenants singly to confer with them over the needs of the spring planting to consult over the sale of wool and grain to note the activities of the estate and to set things in order for the next quarter of the year i puttered cheerfully about the place visiting with tenants lending a hand with the refreshments when needed sometimes just drifting into the background to watch the comings and goings recalling jamies promise to the old woman by the millpond i waited with some curiosity for the arrival of ronald macnab he came shortly past noon riding a tall slipjointed mule with a small boy clinging to his belt behind i viewed them covertly from the parlor door wondering just how accurate his mothers assessment had been i decided that while drunken sot might be overstating things slightly grannie macnabs general perceptions were acute ronald macnabs hair was long and greasy carelessly tied back with twine and his collar and cuffs were grey with dirt while surely a year or two younger than jamie he looked at least fifteen years older the bones of his face submerged in bloat small grey eyes dulled and bloodshot as for the child he also was scruffy and dirty worse so far as i was concerned he slunk along behind his father keeping his eyes on the floor cringing when ronald turned and spoke sharply to him jamie who had come to the door of his study saw it too and i saw him exchange a sharp look with jenny bringing a fresh decanter in answer to his call she nodded imperceptibly and handed over the decanter then taking the child firmly by the hand she towed him toward the kitchen saying come along wi me now laddie i believe weve a crumbly or two going wantin or what about a slice of fruitcake jamie nodded formally to ronald macnab standing aside as the man went into the study reaching out to shut the door jamie caught my eye and nodded toward the kitchen i nodded back and turned to follow jenny and young rabbie i found them engaged in pleasant converse with mrs crook who was ladling punch from the big cauldron into a crystal bowl she tipped a bit into a wooden cup and offered it to the lad who hung back eyeing her suspiciously before finally accepting it jenny went on chatting casually to the lad as she loaded platters receiving little more than grunts in return still the halfwild little creature seemed to be relaxing a bit your sarks a bit grubby lad she observed leaning forward to turn back the collar take it off and ill give it a bit of a wash before ye go grubby was a gross understatement but the boy pulled back defensively i was behind him though and at a gesture from jenny grabbed him by the arms before he could dart away he kicked and yowled but jenny and mrs crook closed in on him as well and between the three of us we peeled the filthy shirt off his back ah jenny drew in her breath sharply she was holding the boys head firmly under one arm and the scrawny back was fully exposed welts and scabs scored the flesh on either side of the knobby backbone some freshly healed some so old as to be only faded shadows lapping the prominent ribs jenny took a good grip on the back of the boys neck speaking soothingly to him as she released his head she jerked her head in the direction of the hall looking at me youd better tell him i knocked tentatively at the study door holding a plate of honeyed oatcakes as excuse at jamies muffled bidding i opened the door and went in my face as i served macnab must have been sufficient for i didnt have to ask to speak privately with jamie he stared meditatively at me for a moment then turned back to his tenant well then ronnie that will do for the grain allotment theres the one other thing i meant to speak wi you about though youve a likely lad named rabbie i understand and im needing a boy of that size to help in the stables would ye be willing for him to come jamies long fingers played with a goosequill on the desk ian seated at a smaller table to one side propped his chin on his fists staring at macnab with frank interest macnab glowered belligerently i thought he had the irritable resentment of a man who isnt drunk but wishes he were no ive need of the lad he said curtly mm jamie lounged back in his chair hands folded across his middle id pay ye for his services of course the man grunted and shifted in his chair my mothers been at ye eh i said no and i meant no the lads my son and ill deal wi him as i see fit and i see fit to keep him to hame jamie eyed macnab thoughtfully but turned his attention back to the ledgers without further argument late in the afternoon as the tenants repaired to the warmer reaches of pantry and parlor for refreshment before departing i spotted jamie from the window strolling in leisurely fashion toward the pigshed arm slung about the scruffy macnab in comradely style the pair disappeared behind the shed presumably to inspect something of agricultural interest and reappeared within a minute or two coming toward the house jamies arm was still about the shorter mans shoulders but seemed now to be supporting him macnabs face was an unhealthy grey slicked with sweat and he walked very slowly seeming unable to straighten up all the way weel thats good then jamie remarked cheerfully as they came within earshot reckon your missus will be glad of the extra money eh ronald ah heres your animal for you finelooking beast is he no the motheaten mule that had brought the macnabs to the farm shambled out of the yard where it had been enjoying the hospitality of the estate a wisp of hay still protruded from the corners of its mouth jerking irregularly as the beast chewed jamie gave macnab a hand under the foot to assist him to his seat muchneeded help by the look of it macnab did not speak or wave in response to jamies voluble godspeeds and safe journeys but only nodded in a dazed way as he left the yard at a walk seemingly intent on some secret trouble that absorbed his attention jamie stood leaning on the fence exchanging pleasantries as other tenants wended their ways homeward until the untidy figure of macnab was out of sight over the crest of the hill he straightened gazing down the road then turned and gave a whistle a small figure in a torn but clean smock and stained kilt crept out from under the haywagon weel then young rabbie said jamie genially looks as though your fathers given his permission for ye to be a stable lad after all im sure as youll be a hard worker and a credit to him eh round bloodshot eyes stared up dumbly out of the dirty face and the boy made no response at all until jamie reached out and grasping him gently by the shoulder turned him toward the horse trough therell be some supper waiting ye in the kitchen laddie go and wash a bit first though mrs crooks a picky woman oh and rabbie he leaned down to whisper to the lad mind your ears or shell do em for ye she scrubbed mine for me this morning he put his hands behind his ears and flapped them solemnly at the boy who broke into a shy smile and fled toward the trough im glad you managed it i said taking jamies arm to go in to supper with little rabbie macnab i mean how did you do it though he shrugged took ronald back of the brewhouse and fisted him once or twice in the soft parts asked him did he want to part wi his son or his liver he glanced down at me frowning it wasna right but i couldnt think what else to do and i didna want the lad to go back wi him it wasnt only id promised his grannie either jenny told me about the lads back he hesitated ill tell ye sassenach my father whipped me as often as he thought i needed it and a lot oftener than i thought i did but i didna cower when he spoke to me and i dinna think young rabbie will lie in bed with his wife one day and laugh about it he hunched his shoulders with that odd halfshrug something i hadnt seen him do in months hes right the lads his own son he can do as he likes and im not god only the laird and thats a good bit lower down still he looked down at me with a crooked halfsmile its a damn thin line between justice and brutality sassenach i only hope ive come down on the right side of it i put an arm around his waist and hugged him you did right jamie ye think so yes we strolled back toward the house arms about each other the whitewashed farm buildings glowed amber in the setting sun instead of going into the house though jamie steered me up the slight rise behind the manor here sitting on the top rail of a fenced field we could see the whole of the home farm laid out before us i laid my head on jamies shoulder and sighed he squeezed me gently in response this is what you were born to do isnt it jamie perhaps sassenach he looked out over the fields and buildings the crofts and the roads then looked down a smile suddenly curving the wide mouth and you my sassenach what were you born for to be lady of a manor or to sleep in the fields like a gypsy to be a healer or a dons wife or an outlaws lady i was born for you i said simply and held out my arms to him ye know he observed letting go at last youve never said it neither have you i have the day after we came i said i wanted you more than anything and i said that loving and wanting werent necessarily the same thing i countered he laughed perhaps youre right sassenach he smoothed the hair from my face and kissed my brow i wanted ye from the first i saw ye but i loved ye when you wept in my arms and let me comfort you that first time at leoch the sun sank below the line of black pines and the first stars of the evening came out it was midnovember and the evening air was cold though the days still kept fine standing on the opposite side of the fence jamie bent his head putting his forehead against mine you first no you why im afraid of what my sassenach the darkness was rolling in over the fields filling the land and rising up to meet the night the light of the new crescent moon marked the ridges of brow and nose crossing his face with light im afraid if i start i shall never stop he cast a glance at the horizon where the sickle moon hung low and rising its nearly winter and the nights are long mo duinne he leaned across the fence reaching and i stepped into his arms feeling the heat of his body and the beat of his heart i love you chapter hard labor a few days later near sunset i was on the hill behind the house digging up the tubers of a small patch of corydalis i had found hearing the rustle of footsteps approaching through the grass i turned expecting to see jenny or mrs crook come to call me to supper instead it was jamie hair spiked with dampness from his predinner ablutions still in his shirt knotted together between his legs for working in the fields he came up behind me and put his arms around me resting his chin on my shoulder together we watched the sun sinking behind the pines robed in gold and purple glory the landscape faded quietly around us but we stayed where we were wrapped in contentment finally as it began to grow dark i could hear jenny calling from the house below wed better go in i said reluctantly stirring mmm jamie didnt move but merely tightened his hold still gazing into the deepening shadows as though trying to fix each stone and blade of grass in memory i turned to him and slipped my arms around his neck what is it i asked quietly must we leave soon my heart sank at the prospect of leaving lallybroch but i knew that it was dangerous for us to stay too much longer another visit from the redcoats could happen at any time with much more sinister results aye tomorrow or the day after at latest there are english at knockchoilum its twenty miles from here but thats only two days ride in fine weather i started to slither off the fence but jamie slid an arm under my knees and lifted me holding me against his chest i could feel the heat of the sun still in his skin and smell the warm dusty scent of sweat and oat grass he had been helping with the last of the harvesting and the smell reminded me of a supper the week before when i knew that jenny always friendly and polite had finally accepted me fully as a member of the family harvesting was grueling work and ian and jamie were often nodding by the end of supper on one occasion i had left the table to fetch a brose pudding for dessert and returned to find both of them sound asleep and jenny laughing quietly to herself amid the remains of supper ian lay slumped in his chair chin resting on his chest breathing heavily jamie had laid his cheek on his folded arms and sprawled forward across the table snoring peacefully between the platter and the peppermill jenny took the pudding from me and served us both shaking her head at the slumbering men they were yawning so much i wondered ye know she said what would happen if i stopped talking so i kept quiet and sure enough two minutes later they were out the both of them she smoothed ians hair tenderly off his forehead thats why therere so few babies born in july here she said with a wicked cock of the eyebrow at me the men cant keep awake long enough in november to start one it was true enough and i laughed jamie stirred and snorted next to me and i laid a hand on the back of his neck to soothe him his lips curved at once in a soft reflexive smile then relaxed into sleep once more jenny watching him said thats funny that is ive not seen him do that since he was quite small do what she nodded smile in his sleep he used always to do it if ye came by and petted him in his cradle or even later in his trundle sometimes mother and i would take it in turns to stroke his head and see could we make him smile he always would thats odd isnt it i experimented running a hand gently down the back of his head and neck sure enough i was rewarded at once by a singularly sweet smile that lingered for a moment before the lines of his face relaxed once more into the rather stern expression he presented when asleep i wonder why he does that i said watching him in fascination jenny shrugged and grinned at me i imagine it means hes happy in the event we did not leave next day in the middle of the night i was wakened by low conversation in the room rolling over i saw ian bending over the bed holding a candle the babes on its way said jamie seeing me awake he sat up yawning a bit early ian ye never know small jamie was late better early than late i reckon ians smile was quick and nervous sassenach can ye deliver a child or had i best go for the midwife jamie turned to me questioning i didnt hesitate in my answer i shook my head get the midwife i had seen only three births during my training all conducted in a sterile operating room the patient draped and anesthetized nothing visible save the grotesquely swelling perineum and the suddenly emergent head having seen jamie on his way to fetch the midwife mrs martins i followed ian up the stairs jenny was sitting in a chair near the window leaning comfortably back she had put on an old nightgown stripped the bed and spread an aged quilt over the feather mattress and was now just sitting waiting ian hovered nervously over her jenny smiled too but with a distracted inward look as though listening to something far off which only she could hear ian fully dressed fidgeted about the room picking things up and putting them down until jenny at last ordered him to leave go downstairs and rouse mrs crook ian she said smiling to ease the dismissal tell her to get things ready for mrs martins shell ken what to do she drew in her breath sharply then and put both hands on her distended abdomen i stared seeing her belly draw up suddenly tight and round she bit her lip and breathed heavily for a moment then relaxed her belly had resumed its normal shape a slightly pendant teardrop rounded at both ends ian put a hand hesitantly on her shoulder and she covered it with her own smiling up at him then tell her to feed ye man you and jamie will be needing a bit to eat they say the second babe comes faster than the first maybe by the time youre done wi breakfast ill be ready for a bite myself he squeezed her shoulder tightly and kissed her murmuring something in her ear before turning to go he hesitated in the doorway looking back but she waved him firmly away it seemed a very long time before jamie arrived with the midwife and i grew more nervous as the contractions grew stronger second babies were said to be faster as a rule what if this one decided to arrive before mrs martins at first jenny carried on light conversation with me only pausing to bend forward slightly holding her stomach as the contractions tightened their grip but she quickly lost the urge to talk and lay back resting quietly in between the increasingly powerful pains finally after one that almost bent her double in her chair she rose to her feet staggering help me walk a bit claire she said unsure what was the proper procedure i did as she said grasping her tightly under the arm to help her stand upright we made several slow circuits of the room pausing when a contraction struck going on when it eased shortly before the midwife arrived jenny made her way to the bed and lay down mrs martins was a reassuringlooking person tallish and thin she had wide shoulders and muscular forearms and the sort of kind downtoearth expression that invited confidence two vertical creases between her irongrey brows always visible deepened when she was concentrating they stayed shallow as she made her preliminary examination everything normal so far then mrs crook had produced a pile of clean ironed sheets for our use and mrs martins took one of these still folded and pushed it under jenny i was startled to see the dark stain of blood between her thighs as she raised herself slightly seeing my look mrs martins nodded reassuringly aye bloody show its called its all right its only when the blood is bright red and a terrible lot all at once that ye worry theres nothing wrong we all settled down to wait mrs martins talked quietly and comfortingly to jenny rubbing the small of her back pressing hard during the contractions as the pains became more frequent jenny began to clamp her lips together and snort heavily through her nose often there was a deep faint groan as the full force of the pain came on jennys hair was soaked with perspiration by this time and her face bright red with the strain watching her i realized fully why it was called labor giving birth was bloody hard work over the next two hours little progress appeared to be made except that the pains grew obviously stronger able at first to answer questions jenny quit responding lying panting at the end of each contraction face fading from red to white in a matter of seconds she clamped her lips through the next one beckoning me to her side as it eased if the child lives she said gasping for air and its a girl her name is margaret tell ian name her margaret ellen yes of course i soothed but youll be able to tell him yourself it wont be long now she only shook her head in determined negation and clenched her teeth as the next pain came mrs martins took me by the arm steering me away dinna mind it lassie she said matteroffactly they always think theyre goin to die about now oh i said mildly relieved mind ye she said in a lower voice sometimes they do even mrs martins seemed a trifle worried as the pains went on with no appreciable progress jenny was tiring badly as each pain eased her body went slack and she even dozed off as though seeking escape in small intervals of sleep then as the remorseless fist grasped her once again she would wake fighting and groaning with effort writhing to the side to curl protectively over the rigid lump of the unborn child could the child be backward i asked in a low voice shy about suggesting such a thing to an experienced midwife mrs martins seemed not at all offended by the suggestion though the lines between her brows merely deepened as she looked at the straining woman when the next pain eased mrs martins flung back the sheet and nightgown and went rapidly to work pressing here and there on the huge mound with quick skilled fingers it took several tries as the probing seemed to incite the pains and examination was impossible during the relentlessly powerful contractions at last she drew back thinking tapping one foot abstractedly as she watched jenny writhe through two more of the spinewrenching pains as she jerked on the sheets one of the strained linens parted suddenly with a rending tear as though this had been a signal mrs martins started forward with decision beckoning to me lean her back a bit lass mrs martins instructed me not at all disconcerted by jennys cries i supposed she had heard her share of screaming at the next relaxation mrs martins plunged into action grasping the child through the momentarily flaccid walls of the womb she heaved trying to turn it jenny screamed and jerked my arms as another contraction started mrs martins tried again and again and again unable to keep from pushing jenny was wearing herself far past the point of exhaustion her body struggling past the bounds of ordinary strength as it strove to force the child into the world then it worked there was a sudden strange fluid shifting and the amorphous bulk of the child turned under mrs martinss hands all at once the shape of jennys belly was altered and there was an immediate sense of getting down to business now push she did and mrs martins dropped to her knees beside the bed apparently she saw some sign of progress for she rose and hastily snatched a small bottle from the table where she had put it when she came in she poured a small amount of what looked like oil on her fingertips and began to rub it gently between jennys legs jenny made a deep and vicious sound of protest at being touched as the next pain came on and mrs martins took her hand away jenny sagged into inertness and the midwife resumed her gentle massage crooning to her patient telling her everything was well just to rest and now push during the next contraction mrs martins put her hand on top of jennys belly and pushed down strongly jenny shrieked but the midwife kept pushing until the contraction eased push with me on the next one the midwife said its almost here i put my hands above mrs martinss on jennys belly and at her signal all three of us pushed together there was a deep victorious grunt from jenny and a slimy blob swelled suddenly between her thighs she straightened her legs against the mattress and pushed once more and margaret ellen murray shot into the world like a greased pig a little later i straightened from wiping jennys smiling face with a damp rag and glanced out the window it was nearly sunset im all right jenny said quite all right the broad grin of delight with which she had greeted the delivery of her daughter had turned into a small permanent smile of deep contentment she reached up with an unsteady hand and touched my sleeve go tell ian she said hell be worrit to my cynical eyes it didnt look it the scene in the study where ian and jamie had taken refuge strongly resembled a premature celebratory debauch an empty decanter stood on the sideboard accompanied by several bottles and a strong alcoholic fume hung over the room like a cloud the proud father appeared to have passed out head resting on the lairds desk the laird himself was still conscious but blearyeyed leaning back against the paneling and blinking like an owl outraged i stamped over to the desk and gripped ian by the shoulder shaking him roughly and ignoring jamie who pushed himself upright saying sassenach wait ian was not quite unconscious his head came up reluctantly and he looked at me with a set rigid face eyes bleak and pleading holes i realized suddenly that he thought i had come to tell him that jenny was dead i relaxed my grip and patted him gently instead shes all right i said softly you have a daughter he laid his head down on his arms again and i left him his thin shoulders shaking as jamie patted his back the survivors now revived and cleaned up the murrayfraser families gathered in jennys room for a celebratory supper little margaret tidied for inspection and swaddled in a small blanket was given to her father who received his new offspring with an expression of beatific reverence hello wee maggie he whispered touching the tiny button of a nose with one fingertip his new daughter unimpressed by the introduction closed her eyes in concentration stiffened and urinated on her fathers shirt during the brief bustle of hilarity and repair occasioned by this lapse of good manners small jamie succeeded in escaping from the clutches of mrs crook and flung himself onto jennys bed she grunted slightly in discomfort but put out a hand and gathered him in waving at mrs crook to let him be my mama he declared burrowing into jennys side well who else she asked reasonably here laddie she hugged him and kissed the top of his head and he relaxed reassured and snuggled against her she gently pushed his head down stroking his hair lay your head then man she said past your bedtime lay your head comforted by her presence he put a thumb in his mouth and fell asleep given a turn to hold the baby jamie proved remarkably competent cupping the small fuzzy skull in the palm of one hand like a tennis ball he seemed reluctant to hand the child back to jenny who cuddled her against her breasts crooning soft endearments at last we made our way to our own room which seemed silent and empty in contrast to the warm family scene we had just left ian kneeling by his wifes bed hand resting on small jamie as jenny nursed the new baby i was conscious for the first time of just how tired i was it was nearly twentyfour hours since ian had roused me jamie closed the door quietly behind him without speaking he came behind me and undid the fastenings of my gown his hands reached around me and i lay back gratefully against his chest then he bent his head to kiss me and i turned putting my own arms around his neck i felt not only very tired but very tender and not a little sad perhaps its as well jamie said slowly as though to himself whats as well that youre barren he couldnt see my face buried in his chest but he must have felt me stiffen aye i knew that long ago geillis duncan told me soon after we wed he stroked my back gently i regretted it a bit at first but then i began to think it was as well living as we must it would be verra difficult if you were to get with child and now he shivered slightly now i think i am glad of it i wouldna want ye to suffer that way i wouldnt mind i said after a long while thinking of the rounded fuzzy head and tiny fingers i would he kissed the top of my head i saw ians face it was like his own flesh was being torn each time jenny screamed my arms were around him stroking the ridged scars on his back i can bear pain myself he said softly but i couldna bear yours that would take more strength than i have chapter the watch jenny recovered rapidly after margarets birth insisting on coming downstairs the day following the delivery at the combined insistence of ian and jamie she reluctantly refrained from doing any work only supervising from the sofa in the parlor where she reclined baby margaret sleeping in her cradle alongside not content to sit idle though within a day or two she had ventured as far as the kitchen and then the back garden sitting on the wall the wellwrapped baby in a carrying sling she was keeping me company as i simultaneously pulled dead vines and kept an eye on the enormous cauldron in which the households laundry was boiled mrs crook and the maids had already removed the clean wash to be hung and dried now i was waiting for the water to cool sufficiently to be dumped out small jamie was helping me yanking out plants with mad abandon and flinging bits of stick in all directions i called a warning as he ventured too near the cauldron then raced after him as he ignored me luckily the pot had cooled quickly the water was no more than warm warning him to keep back with his mother i grasped the pot and tilted it away from the iron contrivance that held it and kept it from falling i sprang back out of the way as the dirty water cascaded over the lip of the pot steaming in the chilly air young jamie squatting beside me on his heels splatted his hands joyfully in the warm mud and black droplets flew all over my skirts his mother slid down from the wall yanked him up by the collar and dealt him a smart clout on the backside have ye no sense gille look at ye theres your shirtll have to go and be washed again and look what yeve done to your aunties skirt ye wee heathen it doesnt matter i protested seeing the miscreants lower lip quiver weel it matters to me said jenny giving her offspring the benefit of a gimlet eye say sorry to your auntie laddie then get ye into the house and have mrs crook give ye a bit of a wash she patted his bottom gently this time and gave him a push in the direction of the house we were turning back to the mass of sodden clothes when the sound of hoofbeats came from the road thatll be jamie back i expect i said listening hes early though jenny shook her head peering intently toward the road not his horse the horse when it appeared at the crest of a hill was not one she knew to judge from her frown the man aboard though was no stranger she stiffened beside me then began to run toward the gate wrapping both arms around the baby to hold it steady its ian she called to me he was tattered and dusty and bruised about the face as he slid off his horse one bruise on his forehead was swollen with a nasty split that went through the eyebrow jenny caught him under the arm as he hit the ground and it was only then i saw that his wooden leg was gone jamie he gasped we met the watch near the mill waiting for us they knew we were coming my stomach lurched is he alive he nodded panting for breath aye not wounded either they took him to the west toward killin jennys fingers were exploring his face are ye bad hurt man he shook his head no they took my horse and my leg they didna need to kill me to stop me following jenny glanced at the horizon where the sun lay just above the trees maybe four oclock i estimated ian followed her gaze and anticipated her question we met them near midday it took me over two hours to get to a place that had a horse she stood still for a moment calculating then turned to me with decision claire help ian to the house will ye and if he needs aught in the way of doctoring do it as fast as ye can ill give the babe to mrs crook and fetch the horses she was gone before either of us could protest does she mean but she cant i exclaimed she cant mean to leave the baby ian was leaning heavily on my shoulder as we made our way slowly up the path to the house he shook his head maybe not but i dinna think she means to let the english hang her brother either it was growing dark by the time we reached the spot where jamie and ian had been ambushed jenny slid off her horse and cast about through the bushes like a small terrier pushing branches out of her way and muttering things under her breath that sounded suspiciously like some of her brothers better curses east she said finally coming out of the trees scratched and dirty she beat dead leaves from her skirt and took her horses reins from my numbed hands we canna follow in the dark but at least i know which way to go come the dawn we made a simple camp hobbling the horses and building a small fire i admired the efficiency with which jenny had done it and she smiled i used to make jamie and ian show me things when they were young how to build fires and climb trees even how to skin things and how to track she glanced again in the direction taken by the watch dinna worry claire she smiled at me and sat down by the fire twenty horses canna go far through the brush but two can the watch will be taking the road toward eskadale by the looks of it we can cut over the hills and meet them near midmains her nimble fingers were tugging at the bodice of her gown i stared in amazement as she spread the folds of cloth and pulled down the top of her underblouse to show her breasts they were very large and looked hard swollen with milk in my ignorance i had not thought to wonder what a nursing mother does if deprived of her nursling i canna leave the babe for long she said in answer to my thoughts grimacing as she cupped one breast from beneath ill burst in response to the touch milk had begun to drip from the engorged nipple thin and bluish pulling a large kerchief from her pocket jenny tucked it beneath her breast there was a small pewter cup on the ground beside her one she had taken from the saddlebag pressing the lip of the cup just below the nipple she gently stroked the breast between two fingers squeezing gently toward the nipple the milk dripped faster in response then suddenly the areole around the nipple contracted and the milk spurted out in a tiny jet of surprising force i didnt know it did that i blurted staring in fascination jenny moved the cup to catch the stream and nodded oh aye the babes sucking starts it but once the milk lets down all the child need do is swallow oh that feels better she closed her eyes briefly in relief she emptied the cup onto the ground remarking shame to waste it but there isna much to do wi it is there switching hands she placed the cup again and repeated the process with the other breast its a nuisance she said looking up to see me still watching everything to do wi bairns is a nuisance almost still yed never choose not to have them no i answered softly you wouldnt choose that she looked across the fire at me face kind and concerned it isna your time yet she said but youll have bairns of your own one day i laughed a little shakily first wed better find the father she emptied the second cup and began readjusting her dress oh well find them tomorrow we have to for i canna stay away from wee maggie much longer than that and once weve found them i asked what then she shrugged and reached for the blanket rolls that depends on jamie and on how much hes made them hurt him jenny was right we did find the watch the next day we left our campsite before full day pausing only long enough for her to express more milk she seemed to be able to find trails where none existed and i followed her without question into a heavily wooded area quick travel was impossible through the brushy undergrowth but she assured me that we were taking a much more direct route than the one the watch would have to follow bound as they were to roads by the size of their group we came on them near noon i heard the jingle of harness and the casual voices i had heard once before and put out a hand to stop jenny who was following me for the moment theres a ford in the stream below she whispered to me it sounds as though theyve stopped there to water the horses sliding down she took both sets of reins and tethered our own horses then beckoning to me to follow she slid into the undergrowth like a snake from the vantage point to which she led me on a small ledge overlooking the ford we could see almost all of the men of the watch mostly dismounted and talking in casual groups some sitting on the ground eating some leading the horses in groups of two and three to the water what we couldnt see was jamie do you suppose theyve killed him i whispered in panic i had counted every man twice to be sure i had missed no one there were twenty men and twentysix horses all in plain view so far as i could see but no hint of a prisoner and no telltale gleam of sun on red hair i doubt it jenny answered but theres only one way to find out she began to squirm backward from the ledge whats that ask the road narrowed as it left the ford becoming little more than a dusty trail through dense stands of pine and alder on either side the trail was not wide enough for the watch to ride two abreast each man would have to pass down it in single file as the last man in the line approached a bend in the trail jenny murray stepped suddenly out in the road ahead of him his horse shied and the man struggled to rein it in cursing as he opened his mouth to demand indignantly what she meant by this behavior i stepped out of the bush behind and whacked him solidly behind the ear with a fallen branch taken completely by surprise he lost his balance as the horse shied again and fell off into the roadway he wasnt stunned the blow had only knocked him over jenny remedied this deficiency with the assistance of a goodsized rock she grabbed the horses reins and gestured violently to me come on she whispered get him off the road before they notice hes gone so it was that when robert macdonald of the glen elrive watch recovered consciousness it was to find himself securely tied to a tree looking down the barrel of a pistol held by the steelyeyed sister of his erstwhile prisoner what have ye done wi jamie fraser she demanded macdonald shook his head dazedly obviously thinking her a figment of his imagination an attempt to move put paid to this notion and after an allowance for the statutory amount of cursing and threatening he at last reconciled himself to the idea that the only way to get loose was to tell us what we wanted to know hes dead macdonald said sullenly then as jennys finger tightened ominously on the trigger he added in sudden panic it wasna me it was his own fault jamie he said had been mounted double arms bound with a leather strap behind one of the watch riding between two other men he had seemed docile enough and they had taken no particular precautions when fording the river six miles from the mill damn fool threw himself off the horse and into the deep water said macdonald shrugging as well as he could with his hands tied behind him we fired at him must have hit him for he didna come up again but the streams swift just below the ford and its deep we searched a bit but no body must ha been carried downstream now for gods sake ladies will ye no untie me after repeated threats from jenny had elicited no further details or changes in his story we decided to accept it as true declining to free macdonald altogether jenny did at least loosen his bonds so that given time he might struggle out of them then we ran do you think hes dead i puffed as we reached the tethered horse i dont jamie swims like a fish and ive seen him hold his breath for three minutes at a time come on were going to search the river bank we cast up and down the banks of the river stumbling on rocks splashing in the shallows scratching our hands and faces on the willows that trawled their branches in the pools at last jenny gave a triumphant shout and i splashed my way across balancing precariously on the mossy rocks that lined the bottom of the burn shallow at this spot she was holding a leather strap still fastened in a circle a smear of blood discolored one side wiggled out of it here she said bending the circlet between her hands she looked back in the direction we had come down that jagged fall of tangled rocks deep pools and foaming rapids and shook her head however did ye manage jamie she said half to herself we found an area of flattened grass not far from the verge where he had evidently lain to rest i found a small brownish smudge on the bark of an aspen nearby hes hurt i said aye but hes moving jenny answered looking at the ground as she paced back and forth are you good at tracking i asked hopefully im no much of a hunter she replied setting off with me close behind but if i canna follow something the size of jamie fraser through dry bracken then im daft as well as blind sure enough a broad track of crushed brown fern led up the side of the hill and disappeared into a thick clump of heather circling around this point turned up no further evidence nor did calling produce any answer hell be gone jenny said sitting down on a log and fanning herself i thought she looked pale and realized that kidnapping and threatening armed men was no pursuit for a woman who had given birth less than a week before jenny i said you have to go back besides he might go back to lallybroch she shook her head no that he wouldna whatever macdonald told us theyre no likely to give up so easy not with a reward at hand if they havena hunted him down yet its because they couldnt but theyll have sent someone back to keep an eye on the farm just in case no thats the one place he wouldna go she pulled at the neck of her gown the day was cold but she was sweating slightly and i could see growing dark stains on the bosom of her dress from leaking milk she saw me looking and nodded aye ill have to go back soon mrs crooks nursing the lassie wi goats milk and sugar water but she canna do without me much longer nor me without her i hate to leave ye alone though i didnt much care for the thought of having to hunt alone through the scottish highlands for a man who might be anywhere either but i put a bold face on it ill manage i said it could be worse at least hes alive true she glanced at the sun low over the horizon ill stay wi ye through the night at least huddled around the fire at night we didnt talk much jenny was preoccupied with thoughts of her abandoned child me with thoughts of just how i was to proceed on my own alone with no real knowledge of geography or gaelic suddenly jennys head snapped up listening i sat up and listened myself but heard nothing i peered into the dark woods in the direction jenny was looking but saw no gleaming eyes in the depths thank god when i turned back to the fire murtagh was sitting on the other side calmly warming his hands at the blaze jenny snapped round at my exclamation and uttered a short laugh of surprise i could ha cut both your throats before ye ever looked in the right direction the little man observed oh could ye then jenny was sitting with her knees drawn up hands clasped near her ankles with a lightning dart her hand went under her skirt and the blade of a sgian dhu flashed in the firelight none sae bad murtagh agreed nodding sagely is the wee sassenach that good no said jenny restoring her blade to her stocking so its good youll be with her ian sent for ye i expect the little man nodded aye did ye find the watch yet we told him of our progress to date at the news that jamie had escaped i could have sworn that a muscle twitched near the corner of his mouth but it would have been stretching matters to call it a smile at length jenny rose folding her blanket where are you going i asked in surprise home she nodded at murtagh hell be wi ye now you dont need me and theres others that do murtagh looked up at the sky the waning moon was faintly visible behind a haze of cloud and a soft spatter of rain whispered in the pine boughs above us the morning will do the winds risin and no one will move far tonight jenny shook her head and went on tucking her hair beneath her kerchief i know my way and if none will move tonight theres none will hinder me on the road no murtagh sighed impatiently youre stubborn as your ox of a brother beggin your pardon little reason to hurry back so far as i can see i doubt your good man will ha taken a doxy to his bed in the time yeve been gone you see as far as the end o your nose duine and thats short enough jenny answered sharply and if yeve lived so long without knowing better than to stand between a nursing mother and a hungry child youve not sense enough to hunt hogs let alone find a man in the heather murtagh raised his hands in surrender oh aye yell take your own way i didna ken i was tryin to talk sense to a wild sow get a tush through the leg for my trouble i expect jenny laughed unexpectedly dimpling i expect ye might at that ye auld rogue she bent and heaved the heavy saddle up on her knee see that ye take care with my goodsister then and send word when yeve found jamie as she turned to saddle the horse murtagh added by the bye yell reckon to find a new kitchen maid when ye reach home she paused and eyed him then slowly set the saddle on the ground and who might that be she asked the widow macnab he replied with deliberation she was still for a moment nothing moving but the kerchief and cloak that stirred in the rising wind how she asked at last murtagh bent to pick up the saddle he heaved it up and secured the girth with what seemed like one effortless motion fire he said giving a final tug to the stirrup leather watch your way as ye pass the high field the ashes will still be warm he cupped his hands to give her a foot up but she shook her head and took the reins instead beckoning to me walk wi me to the top of the hill claire if ye will the air was cold and heavy away from the fire my skirts were damp from sitting on the ground and clung to my legs as i walked jennys head was bent against the wind but i could see her profile lips pale and set with chill it was macnab that gave jamie to the watch i asked at last she nodded slowly aye ian will have found out or one of the other men it doesna matter which it was late november well past guy fawkes day but i had a sudden vision of a bonfire flames leaping up timbered walls and sprouting in the thatch like the tongues of the holy ghost while the fire within roared its prayers for the damned and inside the guy an effigy crouched in ash on his own hearthstone ready to fall into black dust at the next blast of cold wind to sweep through the shell of his home there is a fine line sometimes between justice and brutality i realized jenny was looking full at me questioning and i returned her gaze with a nod we stood together in this case at least on the same side of that grim and arbitrary line we paused at the top of the hill murtagh a dark speck by the fire below jenny rummaged for a moment in the side pocket of her skirt then pressed a small wash leather bag into my hand the rents from quarter day she said ye might need it i tried to give the money back insisting that jamie would not want to take money that was needed for the running of the estate but she would have none of it and while janet fraser was half her brothers size she more than matched his stubbornness outclassed i gave up at last and tucked the money safely away in the recesses of my own costume at jennys insistence i took also the small sgian dhu she pressed upon me its ians but he has another she said put it into your stocking top and hold it with your garter dont leave it off even when ye sleep she paused a moment as though there were something else she meant to say apparently there was jamie said she said carefully that ye might tell me things sometimes and he said that if ye did i was to do as ye said is there anything ye wish to tell me jamie and i had discussed the necessity for preparing lallybroch and its inhabitants against the coming disasters of the rising but we had thought then that there was time now i had no time or most a few minutes in which to give this new sister i held dear enough information to guard lallybroch against the coming storm being a prophet was a very uncomfortable occupation i thought not for the first time i felt considerable sympathy with jeremiah and his lamentations i also realized exactly why cassandra was so unpopular still there was no help for it on the crest of a scottish hill the night wind of an autumn storm whipping my hair and skirts like the sheets of a banshee i turned my face to the shadowed skies and prepared to prophesy plant potatoes i said jennys mouth dropped slightly open then she firmed her jaw and nodded briskly potatoes aye theres none closer than edinburgh but ill send for them how many as many as you can theyre not planted in the highlands now but they will be theyre a root crop that will keep for a long time and the yield is better than wheat put as much ground as you can into crops that can be stored theres going to be a famine a bad one in two years if theres land or property thats not productive now sell it for gold theres going to be war and slaughter men will be hunted here and everywhere through the highlands i thought for a moment is there a priesthole in the house no it was built well after the protectors time make one then or some safe place to hide i hope jamie wont need it i swallowed hard at the thought but someone may all right is that all her face was serious and intent in the halflight i blessed jamie for his forethought in warning her and her for her trust in her brother she didnt ask me how or why but only took careful note of what i said and i knew my hasty instructions would be followed thats all all i can think of just now anyway i tried to smile but the effort seemed unconvincing even to me hers was better she touched my cheek briefly in farewell god go wi ye claire well meet again when ye bring my brother home part six the search chapter dougals story whatever the disadvantages of civilization i reflected grimly the benefits were undeniable take telephones for example for that matter take newspapers which were popular in such metropolitan centers as edinburgh or even perth but completely unknown in the wilderness of the scottish highlands with no such methods of mass communication news spread from one person to the next at the speed of a mans stride people generally found out what they needed to know but with a delay of several weeks consequently faced with the problem of finding exactly where jamie was there was little to rely on except the possibility of someone encountering him and sending word back to lallybroch that was a process that might take weeks and the winter would set in shortly making travel to beauly impossible i sat feeding sticks to the fire pondering the possibilities which way would jamie have gone from the point of his escape not back to lallybroch to be sure and almost certainly not north into the mackenzie lands south to the border lands where he might meet again with hugh munro or some of his earlier rough companions no most likely northeast toward beauly but if i could figure that out so could the men of the watch murtagh returned from his gathering dumping an armload of sticks on the ground he sat down crosslegged on a fold of his plaid wrapping the rest around himself to keep out the chill he cast an eye toward the sky where the moon glowed behind racing clouds it wilna snow just yet he said frowning another week maybe two we might reach beauly before then well nice to have confirmation of my deductions i supposed you think hell be there the little clansman shrugged hunching his plaid higher around his shoulders no tellin the travel will no be as easy for him lyin hid during the day and staying off the roads and he hasna got a horse he scratched his stubbled chin thoughtfully we canna find him wed best let him find us how send up flares i suggested sarcastically one thing about murtagh no matter what incongruous thing i said he could be counted on to behave as though i hadnt spoken ive brought your wee packet of medicines he said nodding toward the saddlebags on the ground and youve enough of a reputation near lallybroch youll be known as a healer through most of the countryside near he nodded to himself aye thatll do well enough and without further explanations he lay down rolled up in his plaid and went calmly to sleep ignoring the wind in the trees the light patter of rain and me i found out soon enough what he meant traveling openly and slowly along the main roads we stopped at every croft and village and hamlet we came to there he would make a quick survey of the local populace round up anyone suffering from illness or injury and bring them to me for treatment physicians being few and far between in these parts there was always someone ailing to attend to while i was occupied with my tonics and salves he would chat idly with the friends and relatives of the afflicted taking care to describe the path of our journey toward beauly if by chance there were no patients to be seen in a place we would pause nonetheless for the night seeking shelter at a cottage or tavern in these places murtagh would sing to entertain our hosts and earn our supper stubbornly insisting that i preserve all the money i had with me in case it should be needed when we found jamie not naturally inclined toward conversation he taught me some of his songs to pass the time as we plodded on from place to place yeve a decent voice he observed one day after a moderately successful attempt at the dowie dens of yarrow not welltrained but strong and true enough try it once more and yell sing it wi me tonight theres a wee tavern at limraigh do you really think this will work i asked what were doing i mean he shifted about in the saddle before answering no natural horseman he always looked like a monkey trained to ride a horse but still managed to dismount fresh as a daisy at days end while i could barely manage to hobble my horse before staggering off to collapse oh aye he said at last sooner or later youre seein more sick folk these days no this was true and i admitted as much well then he said proving his point that means word o your skill is spreading and thats what we want but we could maybe do better thats why youll sing tonight and perhaps he hesitated as though reluctant to suggest something perhaps what know anything about fortunetelling do ye he asked warily i understood the reason for his hesitancy he had seen the frenzy of the witchhunt at cranesmuir i smiled a bit you want me to try it aye the more we can offer the more folk will come to see us and go back to tell others and word will spread about us til the lad hears of us and thats when well find him game to try are ye i shrugged if it will help why not i made my debut as singer and fortuneteller that night at limraigh with considerable success i found that mrs graham had been right in what she had told me it was the faces not the hands that gave you the necessary clues our fame spread little by little until by the next week people were running out of their cottages to greet us as we rode into a village and showering us with pennies and small gifts as we rode away you know we could really make something of this i remarked one evening stowing the nights takings away too bad theres no theater anywhere near we could do a proper musichall turn magical murtagh and his glamorous assistant gladys murtagh treated this remark with his usual taciturn indifference but it was true we really did quite well together perhaps it was because we were united in our quest despite our very basic personality differences the weather grew increasingly bad and our pace even slower but there was as yet no word from jamie outside belladrum one night in a driving rain we met with a band of real gypsies i blinked disbelievingly at the tiny cluster of painted caravans in the clearing near the road it looked exactly like a camp of the gypsy bands that came to hampstead down every year the people looked the same too swarthy cheerful loud and welcoming hearing the jingle of our harness a womans head poked out of the window of one caravan she looked us over for a moment then gave a shout and the ground under the trees was suddenly alive with grinning brown faces gie me your purse for safekeeping said murtagh unsmiling watching the young man swaggering toward us with a gay disregard of the rain soaking his colorful shirt and dinna turn your back on anyone i was cautious but we were welcomed with expansive motions and invited to share the gypsies dinner it smelt delicious some sort of stew and i eagerly accepted the invitation ignoring murtaghs dour speculations as to the basic nature of the beast that had provided the stewmeat they spoke little english and less gaelic we conversed largely in gestures and a sort of bastard tongue that owed its parentage largely to french it was warm and companionable in the caravan where we ate men and women and children all ate casually from bowls sitting wherever they could find space dipping the succulent stew up with chunks of bread it was the best food i had had in weeks and i ate until my sides creaked i could barely muster breath to sing but did my best humming along in the difficult spots and leaving murtagh to carry the tunes our performance was greeted with rapturous applause and the gypsies reciprocated a young man singing some sort of wailing lament to the accompaniment of an ancient fiddle his performance was punctuated by the crashing of a tambourine wielded with some gravity by a little girl of about eight while murtagh had been circumspect in his inquiries in the villages and crofts we visited with the gypsies he was entirely open to my surprise he told them bluntly who we sought a big man with hair like fire and eyes like the summer skies the gypsies exchanged glances up and down the aisle of the caravan but there was a unanimous shaking of regretful heads no they had not seen him but and here the leader the purpleshirted young man who had welcomed us pantomimed the sending of a messenger should they happen across the man we sought i bowed smiling and murtagh in turn pantomimed the handing across of money for information received this bit of business was greeted with smiles but also with gazes of speculation i was glad when murtagh declared that we could not stay the night but must be on our way thank ye just the same he shook out a few coins from his sporran taking care to exhibit the fact that it held only a small handful of coppers distributing these by way of thanks for the supper we made our exit followed by voluble protestations of farewell gratitude and good wishes at least thats what i assumed they were they might actually have been promising to follow us and cut our throats and murtagh behaved rather as though this had been the case leading the horses at a gallop to the crossroads two miles distant then ducking aside into the vegetation for a substantial detour before reemerging onto the road again murtagh glanced up and down the road empty in the fading rainsoaked dusk do you really think they followed us i asked curiously i dinna ken but since theres twelve o them and no but the twa o us i thought wed best act as though they did this seemed sound reasoning and i followed him without question through several more evasive maneuvers arriving at last in rossmoor where we found shelter in a barn snow fell the next day only a light fall enough to dust the ground with a white like the flour on the millhouse floor but it worried me i didnt like to think of jamie alone and unsheltered in the heather braving winters storms in nothing but the shirt and plaid he had been wearing at his capture by the watch two days later the messenger came the sun was still above the horizon but it was evening already in the rockwalled glens the shadows lay so deep under the leafless trees that the path what there was of one was nearly invisible fearful of losing the messenger in the gathering dark i walked so closely behind him that once or twice i actually trod on the trailing hem of his cloak at last with an impatient grunt he turned and thrust me ahead of him steering me through the dusk with a heavy hand on my shoulder it felt as though we had been walking for a long time i had long since lost track of our turnings amid the towering boulders and thick dead undergrowth i could only hope that murtagh was somewhere behind keeping within earshot if not within sight the man who had come to the tavern to fetch me a middleaged gypsy with no english had flatly refused to have anyone but me accompany him pointing emphatically first at murtagh and then the ground to indicate that he must stay put the night chill came on fast at this time of year and my heavy cloak was barely enough protection against the sudden gusts of icy wind that met us in the open spaces of the clearings i was torn between dismay at the thought of jamie lying through the cold wet nights of autumn without shelter and excitement at the thought of seeing him again a shiver ran up my spine that had nothing to do with the cold at last my guide pulled me to a halt and with a precautionary squeeze of my shoulder stepped off the path and disappeared i stood as patiently as could be managed hands folded under my arms for warmth i was sure my guide or someone would return i hadnt paid him for one thing still the wind rattled through the dead brambles like the passing of a deers ghost still in panicstricken flight from the hunter and the damp was seeping through the seams of my boots the otterfat waterproofing had worn away and id had no chance to reapply it my guide reappeared as suddenly as he had left making me bite my tongue as i stifled a squeak of surprise with a jerk of his head he bade me follow him and pressed aside a screen of dead alders for me to pass the cave entrance was narrow there was a lantern burning on a ledge silhouetting the tall figure that turned toward the entrance to meet me i flung myself forward realizing even before i touched him that it was not jamie disappointment struck me like a blow in the stomach and i had to step back and swallow several times to choke back the heavy bile that rose in my throat i clenched my hands at my sides digging my fists into my thighs until i felt calm enough to speak rather out of your territory arent you i said in a voice that surprised me by its coolness dougal mackenzie had watched my struggle for control not without some sympathy on his dark face now he took my elbow and led me farther into the cave there were a number of bundles piled against the far side many more than a single horse could carry he wasnt alone then and whatever he and his men carried it was something he preferred not to expose to the curious gaze of innkeepers and hostlers smuggling i suppose i said with a nod toward the bundle then i thought better and answered my own question no not exactly smuggling goods for prince charles hm he didnt bother to answer me but sat down on a boulder opposite me hands on his knees ive news he said abruptly i took a deep breath bracing myself news and not good news from the expression on his face i took another breath swallowed hard and nodded tell me hes alive he said and the largest of the ice lumps in my stomach dissolved dougal cocked his head to one side watching intently to see whether i were going to faint i wondered dimly it didnt matter i wasnt he was taken near kiltorlity two weeks ago dougal said still watching me not his fault poor luck he met six dragoons facetoface round a turn in the path and one recognized him was he hurt my voice was still calm but my hands were beginning to shake i pressed them flat against my legs to still them dougal shook his head not as i heard he paused a moment hes in wentworth prison he said reluctantly wentworth i repeated mechanically wentworth prison originally one of the mighty border fortresses it had been built sometime in the late sixteenth century and added to at intervals over the next hundred and fifty years the sprawling pile of rock now covered nearly two acres of ground sealed behind threefoot walls of weathered granite but even granite walls have gates i thought i looked up to ask a question and saw the reluctance still stamped on dougals features what else i demanded the hazel eyes met mine unflinching he stood his trial three days ago dougal said and was condemned to hang the ice lump was back with company i closed my eyes how long i asked my voice seemed rather faroff to my own ears and i opened my eyes again blinking to refocus them in the flickering lantern light dougal was shaking his head i dinna ken not long though my breath was coming a little easier now and i was able to unclench my fists wed better hurry then i said still calmly how many men are with you instead of answering dougal rose and came over to me reaching down he took my hands and pulled me to my feet the look of sympathy was back and a deep grief lurking in his eyes frightened me more than anything hed said so far he shook his head slowly nay lass he said gently theres nothing we can do panicked i tore my hands away from him there is i said there must be you said he was still alive and i said not long he retorted sharply the lads in wentworth prison not the thieves hole at cranesmuir they may hang him today or tomorrow or not til next week for all i know o the matter but there is no way on earth that ten men can force a way into wentworth prison oh no i was trembling again but with rage this time you dont know that you dont know what might be done youre just not willing to risk your skin or your miserable profit i flung an arm accusingly at the piled bundles dougal grappled with me seizing my flailing arms i hammered his chest in a frenzy of grief and rage he ignored the blows and put his arms around me pulling me tight against him and holding me until i ceased struggling claire it was the first time he had ever used my first name and it frightened me still further claire he said again loosening his grip so that i could look up at him do ye not think id do all i could to free the lad did i think there was the slightest chance damn it hes my own fosterson but there is no chance none he shook me slightly to emphasize his words jamie wouldna have me throw away good mens lives in a vain venture ye know that as well as i do i could keep back the tears no longer they burned down my icy cheeks as i pushed against him seeking to free myself he held me tighter though trying to force my head against his shoulder claire my dear he said voice gentler my hearts sore for the lad and for you dye come away wi me ill take ye safe to my own house he added hastily feeling me stiffen not to leoch to your house i said slowly a horrible suspicion was beginning to form in my mind aye he said ye dinna think id take ye back to cranesmuir surely he smiled briefly before the stern features relaxed back into seriousness nay ill take ye to beannachd youll be safe there safe i said or helpless his arms dropped away at the tone of my voice what dye mean the pleasant voice was suddenly cold i felt rather cold myself and pulled my cloak together as i moved away from him you kept jamie away from his home by telling him his sister had borne a child to randall i said so that you and that precious brother of yours would have a chance to lure him into your camp but now the english have him youve lost any chance of controlling the property through jamie i backed up another step swallowing you were party to your sisters marriage contract it was by your insistence yours and colums that broch tuarach might be held by a woman you think that if jamie dies broch tuarach will belong to me or to you if you can seduce or force me into marrying you what his voice was incredulous ye think ye think this is all some plot saint agnes do ye think im lying to ye i shook my head keeping my distance i didnt trust him an inch no i believe you if jamie werent in prison youd never dare to tell me he was its too easy to check that nor do i think you betrayed him to the english not even you could do something like that to your own blood besides if you had and word of it ever reached your men theyd turn on you in a second theyd tolerate a lot in you but not treachery against your own kinsman as i spoke i was reminded of something was it you who attacked jamie near the border last year the heavy brows rose with surprise me no i found the lad near death and saved him does that sound as though i meant him harm under cover of my cloak i ran my hand down my thigh feeling for the comforting bulk of my dagger if it wasnt you who was it i dinna ken the handsome face was wary but not hiding anything twas one of three men broken men outlaws that hunted wi jamie then all of them accused each other and there was no way of findin out the truth o the matter not then he shrugged the traveling cloak falling back from one broad shoulder it doesna matter much now twa of the men are dead and the third in prison over another matter but it makes little difference do ye think no i dont suppose so it was in a way a relief to find that he wasnt a murderer whatever else he might be he had no reason to lie to me now so far as he knew i was completely helpless alone he could compel me to do whatever he wished or at least he likely thought so i took a grip on the handle of my dirk the light was poor in the cave but i was watching carefully and i could see indecision flicker momentarily across his face as he chose his next move he stepped toward me hand out but stopped when he saw me flinch away claire my sweet claire the voice was soft now and he ran an insinuating hand lightly down my arm so he had decided to try seduction rather than compulsion i know why ye talk so cold to me and why ye think ill of me you know that i burn for ye claire and its true ive wanted ye since the night of the gathering when i kissed your sweet lips he had two fingers resting lightly on my shoulder inching toward my neck if id been a free man when randall threatened ye id ha wed ye myself on the spot and sent the man to the devil for ye he was moving his body gradually closer crowding me against the stone wall of the cavern his fingertips moved to my throat tracing the line of my cloakfastening he must have seen my face then for he stopped his advance though he left his hand where it was resting lightly above the rapid pulse that beat in my throat even so he said even feeling as i do for ill hide it from ye no longer even so ye couldna imagine id abandon jamie if there were any hope of saving him jamie fraser is the closest thing ive got to a son not quite i said theres your real son or perhaps two by now the fingers on my throat increased their pressure just for a second then dropped away what dye mean and this time all pretense all games were dispensed with the hazel eyes were intent and the full lips a grim line in the russet beard he was very large and very close to me but i had gone too far already for caution it means i know who hamishs father really is i said he had been halfexpecting it and had his face well under control but the last month spent telling fortunes had not been in vain i saw the tiny flicker of shock that widened his eyes and the sudden panic swiftly quelled that tightened the corners of his mouth bullseye in spite of the danger i knew a moments fierce exultation i had been right then and the knowledge might just possibly be the weapon i needed do ye then he said softly yes i said and i imagine colum knows as well that stopped him for a moment the hazel eyes narrowed and i wondered for an instant whether he was armed he thought it was jamie for a time i think i said staring directly into his eyes because of the rumors you must have started those feeding them to geillis duncan why because colum got suspicious of jamie and started to question letitia she couldnt hold out for long against him or was it that geilie thought you were letitias lover and you told her it was jamie to quiet her suspicions shes a jealous woman but she cant have any reason to protect you now dougal smiled cruelly the ice never left his eyes no she cant he agreed still speaking softly the witch is dead dead the shock must have shown as plainly on my face as in my voice his smile broadened oh aye he said burnt stuck feet first in a barrel of pitch and heaped about with dry peats bound to a stake and lit like a torch sent to the devil in a pillar of flame under the branches of a rowan tree i thought at first this merciless recitation of detail was meant to impress me but i was wrong i shifted to one side and as the light shone fresh on his face i could see the lines of grief etched around his eyes it wasnt a catalog of horror then but a lashing of himself i felt no pity for him under the circumstances so you were fond of her i said coldly much good it did her or the child what did you do with that he shrugged saw it placed in a good home a son and a healthy babe for all its mother was a witch and an adulteress and its father an adulterer and a betrayer i snapped your wife your mistress your nephew your brother is there anyone you havent betrayed and deceived you you i choked on the words quite sick with loathing i dont know why im surprised i said trying to speak calmly if youve no loyalty to your king i suppose theres no reason to think youd feel it for your nephew or your brother either his head snapped round and he glared at me he raised his thick dark brows the same shape as colums as jamies as hamishs the deepset eyes the broad cheekbones the beautifully shaped skull old jacob mackenzies legacy was a strong one a big hand clamped hard on my shoulder my brother you think id betray my brother for some reason that had stung him his face was dark with anger youve just admitted that you did and then i realized the both of you i said slowly you did it together you and colum together as youve always done things i pulled his hand off my shoulder and flung it back at him colum couldnt be chieftain unless you would go to war for him he couldnt hold the clan together without you to travel for him to collect the rents and settle the claims he couldnt ride he couldnt travel and he couldnt father a son to pass the chieftainship on to and you had no son by maura you swore to be his arms and legs i was beginning to feel a little hysterical by this time why shouldnt you be his cock as well dougal had lost his anger he stood watching me speculatively for a moment deciding that i was going nowhere he sat down on one of the bales of goods and waited for me to finish so you did it with colums knowledge was letitia willing knowing by now just what sort of ruthlessness they possessed i wouldnt put it past the brothers mackenzie to have forced her dougal nodded his anger had evaporated oh aye willing enough she didna fancy me particularly but she wanted a child enough to take me to her bed for the three months it took to start hamish a boring damn job it was too dougal added reflectively scraping a bit of mud from his boot heel id as soon swive a warm bowl of milk pudding and did you tell colum that i asked hearing the edge in my voice he looked up he regarded me levelly for a moment then a faint smile lightened his face no he said quietly no i didna tell him that he looked down at his hands turning them over as though looking for some secret hidden in the lines of his palms i told him he said softly not looking at me that she was tender and sweet as a ripe peach and all that a man could want in a woman he closed his hands abruptly and looked up at me that momentary glimpse of colums brother submerged once more in the sardonic eyes of dougal mackenzie tender and sweet is not precisely what id say of you he observed but all that a man could want the deepset hazel eyes traveled slowly downward over my body lingering on the roundness of breast and hip that showed through my open cloak one hand moved unconsciously back and forth stroking lightly across the muscles of his thigh as he watched me who knows he said as though to himself i might have yet another son legitimate this time true he tilted his head appraisingly looking at my midsection it hasna happened yet wi jamie you may be barren but ill take the chance the property is worth it at any rate he stood suddenly and took a step toward me who knows he said again very softly if i were to plow that pretty brownhaired furrow and seed it deep each day the shadows on the cavern wall shifted suddenly as he took another step toward me well you took your bloody time about it i said crossly a look of incredulous shock spread across his features before he realized that i was looking beyond him toward the cave mouth it didna seem mannerly to interrupt said murtagh advancing into the cave behind a loaded pair of flintlock pistols he held one trained on dougal using the other to gesture with unless ye mean to accept that last proposal here and now id suggest ye leave and if ye do mean to accept it then ill leave nobodys leaving yet i said shortly sit down i said to dougal he was still standing staring at murtagh as though at an apparition wheres rupert he demanded finding his voice oh rupert murtagh scratched his chin thoughtfully with the muzzle of one pistol hes likely made it to belladrum by now should be back before dawn he added helpfully wi the keg of rum he thinks ye sent him to fetch the rest o your men are still asleep in quinbrough dougal had the grace to laugh if a little grudgingly he sat down again hands on his knees and glanced from me to murtagh and back again there was a momentary silence well dougal inquired now what that i realized was rather a good question surprised at finding dougal instead of jamie shocked by his revelations and infuriated at his consequent proposals i had had no time to think of what ought to be done luckily murtagh was better prepared well after all he hadnt been occupied in fighting off lecherous advances well need money he said promptly and men he cast an eye appraisingly over the bundles stacked against the wall nay he said thoughtfully thatll be for king james but well take what yeve got on your person the small black eyes swiveled back to dougal and the muzzle of one pistol gestured gently in the vicinity of his sporran one thing to be said for life in the highlands was that it apparently gave one a certain fatalistic attitude with a sigh dougal reached into the sporran and tossed a small purse at my feet twenty gold pieces and thirtyodd shillings he said lifting one brow in my direction take it and welcome seeing my look of skepticism he shook his head nay i mean it think what ye like of me jamies my sisters son and if ye can free him then god be wi ye but ye cant his tone was final he looked at murtagh still holding his pistols steady as to the men no if you and the lass mean to commit suicide i canna stop ye ill even offer to bury ye one on either side of jamie but youll not take my men to hell with ye pistols or no he crossed his arms and leaned back against the cavern wall calmly watching us murtaghs hands didnt waver from his aim his eyes flickered toward me though did i wish him to shoot ill make you a bargain i said dougal raised one brow youre in a bit better position to bargain than i am at present he said whats your offer let me talk to your men i said and if theyll come with me of their own accord then let them if not well go as we came and well hand back your purse as well one side of his mouth came up in a lopsided smile he looked me over carefully as though assessing my persuasiveness and my skills as an orator then he sat back hands on his knees he nodded once done he said in the event we left the glen of the cave with dougals purse and five men in addition to murtagh and myself rupert john whitlow willie macmurtry and the twin brothers rufus and geordie coulter it was ruperts decision that swayed the others i could still see with a feeling of grim satisfaction the look on dougals face when his squat blackbearded lieutenant eyed me speculatively then patted the dags at his belt and said aye lass why not wentworth prison was thirtyfive miles away a halfhours ride in a fast car over good roads two days hard slog over halffrozen mud by horseback not long dougals words echoed in my ears and kept me in my saddle long past the point where i might have dropped from fatigue my body was pushed to its limits to keep to the saddle through the long weary miles but my mind was free to worry to keep it from thoughts of jamie i spent the time remembering my interview in the cave with dougal and the last thing he had said to me standing outside the small cave waiting as rupert and his companions brought their horses down from a hiding place higher up the glen dougal had turned to me abruptly ive a message for ye he had said from the witch from geilie to say i was startled was the least of it i couldnt make out his face in the dark but i saw his head tilt in affirmation i saw her the once he said softly when i came to take the child under other circumstances i might have felt some sympathy for him parting for the last time from his mistress who was condemned to the stake holding the child they had made together a son whom he could never acknowledge as it was my voice was icy what did she say he paused i wasnt sure if it was merely the disinclination to reveal information or if he was trying to make sure of his words apparently it was the latter for he spoke carefully she said if ever i saw you again i was to tell you two things just as she told them to me the first was i think it is possible but i do not know and the second the second was just numbers she made me say them over to be sure i had them right for i was to tell them to you in a certain order the numbers were one nine six and seven the tall figure turned toward me in the dark inquiring mean anything to ye no i said and turned away to my horse but it did of course mean something to me i think it is possible there was only one thing she could mean by that she thought though she did not know that it was possible to go back through the circle of stone to my proper place clearly she hadnt tried it herself but had chosen to her cost to stay likely she had had her own reasons dougal perhaps as for the numbers i thought i knew what those meant too she had told them to him separately for the sake of a secrecy which must have gone bonedeep in her by that time but they were all part of one number really one nine six seven nineteensixtyseven the year of her disappearance into the past i felt a small thrill of curiosity and deep regret what a pity that i had not seen the vaccination mark on her arm until it was too late and yet had i seen it sooner would i have gone back to the circle of stone perhaps with her help and left jamie jamie the thought of him was a leaden weight in my mind a pendulum swinging slowly at the end of a rope not long the road stretched endless and dreary before us sometimes petering out altogether into frozen marshes or open sheets of water that had once been meadows and moors in a freezing drizzle that would soon turn to snow we reached our goal near evening of the second day the building loomed up black against the overcast sky built in the shape of a gigantic cube four hundred feet on a side with a tower on each corner it could house three hundred prisoners plus the forty soldiers of the garrison and their commander the civilian governor and his staff and the four dozen cooks orderlies grooms and other menials necessary for the running of the establishment wentworth prison i looked up at the menacing walls of greenish argyll granite two feet thick at the base tiny windows pierced the walls here and there a few were beginning to wink with light others serving what i assumed were the prisoners cells stayed dark i swallowed seeing the massive edifice with its impenetrable walls its monumental gate and its redcoated guards i began to have doubts what if my mouth was dry and i had to stop and lick my lips what if we cant do it murtaghs expression was the same as always grimmouthed and dour narrow chin receding into the grimy neck of his shirt it didnt alter as he turned to me then dougal will bury us wi him one on either side he answered come on theres work to be done part seven sanctuary chapter wentworth prison sir fletcher gordon was a short and portly man whose striped silk waistcoat fitted him like a second skin slopeshouldered and paunchbellied he looked rather like a large ham seated in the governors wheelbacked chair the bald head and rich pinkish color of his complexion did little to dispel this impression though few hams boasted such bright blue eyes he turned over the sheaf of papers on his desk with a slow deliberate forefinger yes here it is he said after an interminable pause to read a page fraser james convicted of murder sentenced to hang now wheres the warrant of execution he paused again shuffling nearsightedly through the papers i dug my fingers deep into the satin of my reticule willing my face to remain expressionless oh yes date of execution december yes we still have him i swallowed relaxing my hold on my bag torn between exultation and panic he was still alive then for another two days and he was nearby somewhere in the same building with me the knowledge surged through my veins with a rush of adrenaline and my hands trembled i sat forward in the visitors chair trying to look winsomely appealing may i see him sir fletcher just for a moment in case he he might wish me to convey a message to his family in the guise of an english friend of the fraser family i had found it reasonably easy to gain admittance to wentworth and to the office of sir fletcher civilian governor of the prison it was dangerous to ask to see jamie not knowing my cover story he might well give me away if he saw me suddenly without warning for that matter i might give myself away i was not at all sure that i could maintain my precarious selfcontrol if i saw him but the next step was clearly to find out where he was in this huge stone rabbit warren the chances of finding him without direction were almost nil sir fletcher frowned considering plainly he considered this request from a mere family acquaintance a nuisance but he was not an unfeeling man finally he shook his head reluctantly no my dear no im afraid i really cannot allow that we are rather crowded at present and havent sufficient facilities to permit private interviews and the man is presently in he consulted his pile of papers again in one of the large cells in the west block with several other condemned felons it would be extremely perilous for you to visit him there or at all the man is a dangerous prisoner you understand i see here that we have been keeping him in chains since his arrival i gripped my bag again this time to keep from striking him he shook his head again plump chest rising and falling with his labored breathing no if you were an immediate member of his family perhaps he looked up blinking i clamped my jaw tightly determined to give nothing away surely a slight show of agitation was reasonable under the circumstances but perhaps my dear he seemed struck by sudden inspiration he got ponderously to his feet and went to an inner door where a uniformed soldier stood on guard he murmured to the man who nodded once and vanished sir fletcher came back to his desk pausing on the way to retrieve a decanter and glasses from the top of a cabinet i accepted his offer of claret i needed it we were both halfway through the second glass by the time the guard returned he marched in without invitation placed a wooden box on the desk at sir fletchers elbow and turned to march out again i caught his eye lingering on me and modestly lowered my own gaze i was wearing a gown borrowed from a lady of ruperts acquaintance in the nearby town and from the scent that saturated the dress and its matching reticule i had a reasonably good idea just what this particular ladys profession was i hoped the guard didnt recognize the gown draining his cup sir fletcher set it down and pulled the box toward him it was a plain square box of unfinished wood with a sliding lid there were letters chalked on the lid i could read them even upside down frayser they read sir fletcher slid back the lid peered inside for a moment then closed the box and pushed it toward me the prisoners personal effects he explained customarily we send them to whomever the prisoner designates as next of kin after execution this man though he shook his head has refused altogether to say anything about his family some estrangement no doubt not unusual of course but regrettable under the circumstances i hesitate to make the request mrs beauchamp but i thought that perhaps since you are acquainted with the family you would consider taking it upon yourself to convey his effects to the appropriate person i didnt trust myself to speak but nodded and buried my nose in my cup of claret sir fletcher seemed relieved whether at disposing of the box or at the thought of my imminent departure he sat back wheezing slightly and smiled expansively at me that is very kind of you mrs beauchamp i know such a thing cannot but be a painful duty to a young woman of feeling and i am most sensible of your kindness in undertaking it i do assure you nnot at all i stammered i managed to stand up and to gather up the box it measured about eight inches by six and was four or five inches deep a small light box to hold the remains of a mans life i knew the things it held three fishing lines neatly coiled a cork stuck with fishhooks a flint and steel a small piece of broken glass edges blunt with wear various small stones that looked interesting or had a good feel between the fingers a dried moles foot carried as a charm against rheumatism a bible or perhaps they had let him keep that i hoped so a ruby ring if it hadnt been stolen and a small wooden snake carved of cherry wood with the name sawny scratched on its underside i paused at the door gripping the frame with my fingers to steady myself sir fletcher following courteously to see me out was at my side in a moment mrs beauchamp are you feeling faint my dear guard a chair i could feel the prickles of a cold sweat breaking out along the sides of my face but i managed to smile and wave away the proffered chair i wanted more than anything to get out of there i needed fresh air in large quantities and i needed to be alone to cry no im quite all right i said trying to sound convincing its only a bit close in here perhaps no i shall be perfectly all right my groom is waiting outside in any case forcing myself to stand up straight and smile i had a thought it might not help but it couldnt hurt oh sir fletcher still worried by my appearance he was all gallantry and attention yes my dear it occurred to me how sad for a young man in this situation to be estranged from his family i thought perhaps if he wished to write to them a letter of reconciliation perhaps i would be pleased to deliver it to to his mother you are thoughtfulness itself my dear sir fletcher was jovial now that it seemed i was not going to collapse on his carpet after all of course i will inquire where are you staying my dear if there is a letter i shall have it sent to you well i was doing better with the smile though it felt pasted on my face that is rather uncertain at the moment i have several relatives and close acquaintances in the town with whom i fear i shall be obliged to stay in turn in order to avoid offending anyone you see i managed a small laugh so if it does not disturb you too much perhaps my groom could call to inquire for the letter of course of course that will do excellently my dear excellently and with a quick glance back at his decanter he took my arm to escort me to the gate better lassie rupert pushed back the curtain of my hair to peer at my face ye look like an illcured pork belly here better have a bit more i shook my head at the proffered whisky flask and sat up wiping the damp rag he had brought across my face no im all right now escorted by murtagh who was disguised as my groom i had barely made it out of sight of the prison before sliding off my horse and being sick in the snow there i remained weeping with jamies box clutched to my bosom until murtagh had gathered me up bodily forced me to mount and led me to the small inn in wentworth town where rupert had found lodgings we were in an upper room from which the bulk of the prison was barely visible in the gathering dusk is the lad dead then ruperts broad face halfobscured by his beard was grave and kind lacking any of its usual clowning i shook my head and took a deep breath not yet after hearing my story rupert paced slowly around the room pushing his lips in and out as he thought murtagh sat still as usual no sign of agitation on his features he would have made a wonderful poker player i thought rupert returned sinking down on the bed beside me with a sigh weel hes alive still and thats the most important thing damned if i see what to do next though weve no way to get into the place aye we have murtagh said suddenly thanks to the wee lassies thought about the letter mmmphm one man though and only so far as the governors office but aye its a start rupert drew his dirk and idly scratched his thick beard with the point its a damn big place to search i know where he is i said feeling better with the planning and the knowledge that my companions werent giving up no matter how hopeless our enterprise seemed at least i know which wing hes in do ye then hmm he replaced the dirk and resumed his pacing stopping to demand how much money have ye lass i fumbled in the pocket of my gown i had dougals purse the money jenny had forced me to take and my string of pearls rupert rejected the pearls but took the purse pouring a stream of coins into the palm of one capacious hand thatll do he said jingling them experimentally he cocked an eye at the coulter twins you twa laddies and willie come wi me john and murtagh can stay here wi the lassie where are you going i asked he poured the coins into his sporran keeping back one which he tossed meditatively in the air och he said vaguely happen theres another inn the other side of the town the guards from the prison go there when theyre off duty for its closer and the drinks a penny cheaper he flipped the coin with his thumb and turning his hand caught it between two knuckles i watched it with a growing idea of what he intended is that so i said i wouldnt suppose they play cards there too would you i wouldna ken lassie wouldna ken he answered he tossed the coin once more and clapped his hands together trapping it then spread his hands apart to show nothing but thin air he smiled teeth white in the black beard but we might go and see no he snapped his fingers and the coin appeared once more between them shortly past one oclock on the following afternoon i passed again beneath the spiked portcullis that had guarded the gate of wentworth since its construction in the late sixteenth century it had lost very little of its forbidding aspect in the succeeding two hundred years and i touched the dagger in my pocket for courage sir fletcher should now be well dug in at his midday repast according to the information rupert and his assistant spies had extracted from the prison guards during their foray the evening before they had staggered in redeyed and reeking of ale just before dawn all rupert would say in response to my questions was och lassie all it takes to win is luck it takes skill to lose he curled up in the corner then and went soundly to sleep leaving me to pace the floor in frustration as i had been doing all night he woke an hour later though cleareyed and clearheaded and laid out the rudiments of the plan i was about to put into execution sir fletcher doesna allow anyone or anything to disturb his meals he said anyone wantin him then must just go on wantin until hes done wi his food and drink and after the midday meal its his habit to retire to his quarters for a wee sleep murtagh in the character of my groom had arrived a quarter of an hour previously and been admitted without difficulty presumably he would be shown to sir fletchers office and asked to wait while there he was to search the office first for a plan of the west wing and then on the offchance for keys that might open the cells i hung back a bit glancing at the sky to judge the time if i arrived before he had sat down i might be invited to join sir fletcher for luncheon which would be highly inconvenient but ruperts cardplaying acquaintances among the guards had assured him that the governors habits were invariable the bell for dinner was rung promptly at one and the soup served five minutes later the guard on duty at the entrance was the same as the day before he looked surprised but greeted me courteously so vexing i said i had meant my groom to bring a small present for sir fletcher as some return for his kindness to me yesterday but i found that the silly man had ridden off without it and so i was obliged to follow with it myself hoping to catch him up has he arrived already i displayed the small package i carried and smiled thinking that it would help if i had dimples since i hadnt i settled for a brilliant display of teeth it seemed to be sufficient i was admitted and led through the corridors of the prison toward the governors office though this part of the castle was decently furnished there was little mistaking the place for anything other than a prison there was a smell about the place which i imagined as the smell of misery and fear though i supposed it was no more than the niff of ancient squalor and an absence of drains the guard allowed me to precede him down the hall following discreetly so as not to step on my cloak and a damn good thing he did for i rounded the corner toward sir fletchers office a few feet ahead of him just in time to see murtagh through the open door dragging the unconscious form of the office guard behind the enormous desk i took one step back and dropped my package onto the stone floor there was a shattering of glass and the air was filled with the smothering aroma of peach brandy oh dear i said what have i done while the guard was calling for a prisoner to clear up the mess i tactfully murmured something about waiting for sir fletcher in his private office slipped in and hastily shut the door behind me what the bloody hell have you done i snapped at murtagh he looked up from his rummaging of the body unconcerned at my tone sir fletcher doesna keep keys in his office he informed me in a low voice but this wee laddie has a set he pulled the huge ring free of the mans coat careful to keep the keys from jingling i dropped to my knees behind him oh good show i said i cast an eye over the prostrate soldier still breathing at least what about a plan of the prison he shook his head not that either but my friend here told me a bit while we waited the condemned cells are on the same floor as this in the middle of the west corridor therere three cells though and i couldna ask more than that he was a bit suspicious as it was its enough i hope all right give me the keys and get out me its you should leave lassie and right smart too he glanced at the door but there was no sound on the other side no it has to be me i said reaching again for the keys listen i said impatiently if they find you wandering round the prison with a bunch of keys and the guard here laid out like a mackerel were both done for because why didnt i cry out for help i snatched the keys and crammed them in my pocket with some difficulty murtagh was still skeptical but had risen to his feet and if youre caught he demanded i swoon i said crisply and when i recover eventually i say that i saw you apparently murdering the guard and fled in terror with no idea where i was going i lost my way looking for help he nodded slowly aye all right he moved toward the door then stopped but why did i oh he crossed swiftly to the desk and pulled out one drawer after another stirring the contents with one hand and tossing items onto the floor with the other theft he explained coming back to the door he opened it a crack looking out if its theft shouldnt you take something i suggested looking about for something small and portable i picked up an enameled snuffbox this perhaps he made an impatient gesture to me to put it down still peering through the crack nay lass if im found wi sir fletchers property thats a hanging offense attempted theft is only flogging or mutilation oh i put the snuffbox down hastily and stood behind him peering over his shoulder the hall seemed empty i go first he said if i meet anyone ill draw em off wait to the count of thirty then follow well meet ye in the small wood to the north he opened the door then paused and turned back if youre caught mind ye throw the keys awa before i could speak he was through the door like an eel and down the corridor moving silently as a shadow it seemed to take an eternity to find the west wing dodging through the corridors of the old castle peering around corners and hiding behind columns i saw only one guard on my way though and managed to avoid him by diving back around a corner pressing myself to the wall with hammering heart until he passed once i found the west wing though i had little doubt that i was in the right place there were three large doors in the corridor each with a tiny barred window from which i could catch no more than a frustrating glimpse of the room behind it eenie meenie minie mo i muttered to myself and headed for the center cell the keys on the ring were unlabeled but of different sizes clearly only one of three big ones would fit the lock before me naturally it was the third one i took a deep breath as the lock clicked then wiped my sweating hands on my skirt and shoved the door open i sorted frantically through the stinking mass of men in the cell stepping over outstretched feet and legs pushing past heavy bodies that moved with maddening sluggishness out of my way the stir occasioned by my abrupt entrance had spread those who had been asleep amid the filth on the floor began to sit up roused by the rippling murmur of astonishment some were manacled to the walls the chains grated and clanked in the halflight as they moved i grabbed one of the standing men a brownbearded clansman in ragged yellowandgreen tartan the bones of his arm under my hand were frighteningly near the skin the english wasted little extra food on their prisoners james fraser a big redheaded man is he in this cell where is he he was already moving toward the door with the others who were not chained but paused a moment to glance down at me the prisoners by now had seized the idea and were pouring through the open door in a shuffling flood peering and murmuring to each other who fraser och they took him awa this mornin the man shrugged and pushed at my hands trying to shake me off i took hold of his belt with a grip that halted him in his tracks where did they take him who took him i dinna ken where was yon captain randall took im a pinchfaced snark he is with an impatient wrench he freed himself and headed for the door with a step born of longnourished purpose randall i stood stunned for a moment jostled by the escaping men deaf to the shouts of the chained finally i shook myself from my stupor and tried to think geordie had watched the castle since dawn no one had left in the morning save a small kitchen party going to fetch supplies so they were still here somewhere randall was a captain likely no one ranked higher in a prison garrison save sir fletcher himself presumably randall could thus command the castles resources so as to provide him with some suitable spot in which to torture a prisoner at his leisure and torture it surely was even if it was meant to end in hanging the man i had seen at fort william was a cat by nature he could no more resist the chance to play with this particular mouse than he could alter his height or the color of his eyes i took a deep breath resolutely shoving aside thoughts of what might have happened since morning and charged out the door myself colliding full force with an english redcoat rushing in the man reeled backward staggering with tiny running steps to keep his balance thrown off balance myself i crashed heavily into the doorjamb numbing my left side and banging my head i clutched the doorpost for support the ringing in my ears chiming with the echoes of ruperts voice ye have a moment of surprise lass use it it was open to question i thought dizzily who was more surprised i groped madly for the pocket that held my dagger cursing my stupidity for not having entered the cell with it already drawn the english soldier balance recovered was staring at me with his mouth agape but i could feel my precious moment of surprise already slipping away abandoning the elusive pocket i stooped and drew the dagger from my stocking in a move that continued upward with all the force i could muster the knifepoint took the advancing soldier just under the chin as he reached for his belt his hands rose halfway to his throat then with a look of surprise he staggered back against the wall and slid down it in slow motion as the life drained away from him like me he had come to investigate without bothering to draw his weapon first and that small oversight had just cost him his life the grace of god had saved me from this mistake i could afford no more feeling very cold i stepped over the twitching body careful not to look i dashed back the way i had come as far as the turning by the stairs there was a spot here by the wall where i would be sheltered from view from both directions i leaned against the wall and indulged myself in a moment of trembling nausea wiping my sweaty hands on my skirt i dredged the dirk from its hidden pocket it was now my only weapon i had neither time nor stomach enough to retrieve my sockknife perhaps that was as well i thought rubbing my fingers on my bodice there had been surprisingly little blood and i shrank from the thought of the gush that would follow if i pulled the knife free dagger now safely in hand i peered cautiously out into the corridor the prisoners i had inadvertently released had gone to the left i had no idea what they were set on doing but they would likely occupy the english while they were doing it with no reason to pick one direction over another for my search it made sense to move away from whatever commotion they caused the light from the high slit windows fell aslant behind me this was the west side of the castle then i must keep my bearings as i moved since rupert would be waiting for me near the south gate stairs i forced my numbed mind to think trying to reason my way to the spot i was looking for if you wanted to torture someone presumably you wanted both privacy and soundproofing both considerations pointed to an isolated dungeon as the most likely spot and the dungeons in castles such as this were customarily underground where tons of earth muffled any cries and darkness hid all cruelty from the eyes of those responsible the wall rounded into a curve at the end of the corridor i had reached one of the four corner towers and the towers had stairs the spiral stair opened around another curve the wedgeshaped steps plunging down in dizzying flights that deceived the eye and twisted the ankles the plunge from the relative light of the corridor into the gloom of the stairwell made it even harder to judge the distance from one stair to the next and i slipped several times barking my knuckles and skinning my palms on the stone walls as i caught myself the stairway yielded one benefit from a narrow window let in to save the stairwell from total darkness i could see the main courtyard at least i could now orient myself a small group of soldiers was drawn up in neat red lines for inspection but not apparently to witness the summary punishment of a scottish rebel there was a gibbet in the courtyard black and foreboding but unoccupied the sight of it was like a blow in the stomach tomorrow morning i clattered down the stairs heedless of scraped elbows and stubbed toes hitting the bottom in a swish of skirts i stopped to listen dead silence all around but at least this part of the castle was in use there were torches in the wall sconces dyeing the granite blocks in pools of flickering red each pool ebbing into darkness at its edges before the pool of the next torch leached into light again smoke from the torches hung in grey swirls along the vaulted roof of the corridor there was only one way to go from this point i went dagger still gripped at the ready it was eerie to be pacing softly down this corridor i had seen similar dungeons before as a daytripper visiting historic castles with frank but then the massive granite blocks had been stripped of their menace by the glare of fluorescent tubes hung from the arches of the cavernous ceiling i remembered recoiling from the small dank chambers even in those days when they had been in disuse for over a century seeing the remnants of old and horrible ways the thick doors and the rusting manacles on the wall i had been able i thought to imagine the torments of those imprisoned in these forbidding cells i would have laughed now at my naivete there were some things as dougal said that the imagination was simply not equal to i tiptoed past bolted doors three inches thick thick enough to smother any sound from inside bending close to the floor i checked for a strip of light at the base of each door prisoners might be left to rot in darkness but randall would need to see what he was doing the floor here was gummy with ancient dirt covered with a thick layer of loose dust apparently this part of the prison was not in current use but the torches showed that someone was down here the fourth door in the corridor showed the light i was looking for i listened kneeling on the floor with my ear pressed against the crack but heard nothing more than the thin crackle of a fire the door was unlocked i pushed it open a small crack and peered cautiously within jamie was there sitting on the floor against one wall curled into himself with his head between his knees he was alone the room was small but well lit with a rather homely looking brazier in which burned a cheery fire for a dungeon it was remarkably cozy the stone flags were halfway clean and a small camp bed leaned against one wall the room was further furnished with two chairs and a table on which sat a number of objects including a large pewter flask and horn cups it was an astonishing sight after my visions of dripping walls and scuttling rats it occurred to me that perhaps the garrison officers had furnished this snuggery as a refuge in which to entertain such female companionship as they could induce to visit them within the prison clearly it had the advantage of privacy over the barracks jamie i called softly he didnt raise his head or answer me and i felt a thrill of fear pausing only long enough to shut the door behind me i crossed rapidly to him and touched his shoulder jamie he looked up then his face was deadwhite unshaven and sheened with a cold sweat that had soaked his hair and shirt the room stank of fear and vomit claire he said speaking hoarsely through lips cracked with dryness how did you ye must get out of here at once hell be back soon dont be ridiculous i was assessing the situation as rapidly as i could hoping that concentration on the job at hand would ease the choking sensation and help melt the large ball of ice in the pit of my stomach he was chained by the ankle to a bolt in the wall but otherwise unfettered a coil of rope among the rubble of objects on the table had plainly been used though there were raw marks on his wrists and elbows i was puzzled by his condition he was clearly dazed and every line of his body was eloquent with pain but i could see no obvious damage there was no blood and no wound visible i dropped to my knees and began methodically to try the keys of my ring on the manacle around his ankle what has he done to you i asked keeping my voice low for fear of randalls return jamie swayed where he sat eyes closed the sweat beading in hundreds of tiny pearls on his skin plainly he was near to fainting but opened his eyes for a moment at my voice moving with exquisite care he used his left hand to lift the object he had been cradling in his lap it was his right hand almost unrecognizable as a human appendage grotesquely swollen it was now a bloated bag blotched with red and purple the fingers dangling at crazy angles a white shard of bone poked through the torn skin of the middle finger and a trickle of blood stained the knuckles puffed into shapeless dimples the human hand is a delicate marvel of engineering an intricate system of joints and pulleys served and controlled by a network of millions of tiny nerves exquisitely sensitive to touch a single broken finger is enough to sink a strong man to his knees with nauseated pain payment jamie said for his nose with interest i stared at the sight for a moment then said in a voice that i didnt recognize as mine im going to kill him for this jamies mouth twitched slightly as a flicker of humor forced its way through the mask of pain and dizziness ill hold your cloak sassenach he whispered his eyes closed again and he sagged against the wall too far gone to protest my presence further i went back to work on the lock glad to see that my hands were no longer shaking the fear was gone replaced by a glorious rage i had gone through the complete ring of keys twice and still found none that would turn the lock my hands were growing sweaty and the keys slid through my fingers like minnows as i began to try the most likely ones again my muttered cursing roused jamie from his stupor and he leaned down slowly to look at what i was doing ye neednt find a key will turn it he said bracing a shoulder on the wall to keep upright if one will fit to the length of the barrel you can spring the lock wi a good bash on the head of it youve seen this kind of lock before i wanted to keep him awake and talking he was going to have to walk if we were to leave here ive been in one when they brought me here they chained me in a big cell with a lot of others a lad named reilly was chained next to me a leinsterman said hed been in most of the jails in ireland and decided to try scotland for a change o scenery jamie was struggling to talk he realized as well as i that he must rouse himself he managed a feeble smile he told me a good bit about locks and such and showed me how we could break the ones we were wearing if wed had a spare bit of straight metal which we didnt tell me then the effort of talking was making him sweat freely but he seemed more alert concentrating on the problem of the lock seemed to help following his directions i found a suitable key and thrust it in as far as it would go according to reilly a solid blow straight in on the end of the key would force the other end hard against the tumblers and spring them loose i looked around for a suitable instrument for bashing use the mallet on the table sassenach said jamie caught by a grim note in his voice i glanced from his face to the table where a mediumsized wooden mallet lay the handle wrapped with tarred twine is that what i began aghast aye brace the manacle against the wall lass before ye hit it grasping the handle gingerly i picked up the mallet it was awkward to get the iron manacle correctly positioned so that one side was braced by the wall as this required that jamie cross the manacled leg under the other and press his knee to the wall on the far side my first two blows were too weak and timorous gathering determination about me like a cloak i smashed the rounded end of the key as hard as i could the mallet slipped off the key and caught jamie a glancing but hard blow on the ankle recoiling he lost his precarious balance and fell instinctively reaching out his right hand to save himself he let out an unearthly moan as his right arm crumpled beneath him and his shoulder hit the floor oh damn i said wearily jamie had fainted not that i could blame him taking advantage of his momentary immobility i turned his ankle so that the manacle was well braced and banged doggedly on the embedded key with little apparent effect i was thinking grim thoughts about irish locksmiths when the door beside me swung suddenly open randalls face like franks seldom showed what he was thinking presenting instead a bland and impenetrable facade at the moment though the captains customary poise had deserted him and he stood in the doorway with his jaw agape looking not unlike the man who accompanied him a very large man in a stained and ragged uniform this assistant had the sloping brow flat nose and loose prominent lips characteristic of some types of mental retardation his expression did not change as he peered over randalls shoulder showing no particular interest either in me or the unconscious man on the floor recovering randall walked into the room and reached down to prod the manacle around jamies ankle been damaging the crowns property i see my girl thats an offense punishable by law you know to say nothing of attempting to aid a dangerous prisoner in escaping his pale grey eyes held a spark of amusement well have to arrange something suitable for you in the meantime he jerked me to my feet and pulled my arms behind me twisting his stock around my wrists struggle was plainly fruitless but i stamped on his toes as hard as i could purely to vent some of my own frustration ouch he turned me and gave me a hard shove so that my legs hit the bed and i fell halflying on the rough blankets randall surveyed me with grim satisfaction rubbing the scuffed toe of his boot with a linen handkerchief i glared back at him and he gave a short laugh youre no coward ill give you that in fact youre a fit match for him he nodded at jamie who was beginning to stir a bit and i cant give you a better compliment than that he tenderly fingered his throat where a darkening bruise showed in the open neck of his shirt he tried to kill me onehanded when i untied him and damned near managed it too pity i didnt realize he was lefthanded how unreasonable of him i said quite said randall with a nod i dont suppose youd be so impolite do you still on the offchance he turned to the large servant who was simply standing in the doorframe shoulders sloped waiting for orders marley said randall come here and search this woman for weapons he watched with some amusement as the man groped clumsily about my person eventually coming upon and extracting my dirk you dont care for marley asked the captain watching me try to avoid the thick fingers that prodded me all too intimately rather a pity im sure hes quite taken with you poor marley hasnt much luck with women the captain went on a malicious gleam in his eye have you marley even the whores wont have him he fixed me with a designing sort of look smiling wolfishly too big they say he raised one eyebrow which is quite a judgment coming from a whore is it not he raised the other brow making his meaning quite clear marley who had begun to pant rather heavily during the search stopped and wiped a thread of saliva from the side of his mouth i moved as far away as i could manage disgusted randall watching me said i imagine marley would like to entertain you privately in his quarters once weve finished our conversation of course he might decide later on to share his good fortune with his friends but thats up to him oh you dont want to watch i asked sarcastically randall laughed truly amused i may have what are called unnatural tastes myself as i imagine you know by this time but give me credit for some aesthetic principles he glanced at the immense orderly slouched in his filthy clothes paunch straining over his belt the loose blubbery lips chewed and mumbled constantly as though seeking some fragment of food and the short thick fingers worked nervously against the crotch of the stained breeches randall shuddered delicately no he said youre a very lovely woman shrewish tongue notwithstanding to see you with marley no i dont believe i want to watch that appearance aside marleys personal habits leave quite a lot to be desired so do yours i said thats as may be at any rate theyll not concern you much longer he paused looking down at me i would still like to know who you are you know a jacobite plainly but whose marischals seaforths lovats most likely since youre with the frasers randall nudged jamie gently with a polished boottoe but he still lay inert i could see his chest rising and falling regularly perhaps he had merely slipped from unconsciousness into sleep the smudges under his eyes gave evidence that he had had little rest of late ive even heard from some that youre a witch the captain went on his tone was light but he watched me closely as though i might suddenly turn myself into an owl and flap away there was some kind of trouble at cranesmuir wasnt there a death of some kind but no doubt thats all superstitious nonsense randall eyed me speculatively i might be persuaded to make a bargain with you he said abruptly he leaned back halfsitting on the table inviting me i laughed bitterly i cant say im in either a position or a mood to bargain at the moment what can you offer me randall glanced at marley the idiots eyes were fixed on me and he was mumbling under his breath a choice at least tell me and convince me who you are and who sent you to scotland what youre doing and what information youve sent to whom tell me that and ill take you to sir fletcher instead of giving you to marley i kept my eyes firmly away from marley i had seen the rotting stumps of teeth embedded in pustulant gums and the thought of him kissing me let alone i choked the thought off randall was right i wasnt a coward but neither was i a fool you cant take me to sir fletcher i said and i know it as well as you do take me to him and risk my telling him about this my nod took in the snug little room the cozy fire the bed i sat on and jamie lying at my feet whatever his own shortcomings i dont imagine sir fletcher would stand officially for his officers torturing prisoners even the english army must have some standards randall raised both eyebrows torture oh that he waved negligently at jamies hand an accident he fell in his cell and was trampled by the other prisoners its rather crowded in those cells you know he smiled derisively i was silent while sir fletcher might or might not believe the damage to jamies hand was an accident he was most unlikely to believe anything i said once i was unmasked as an english spy randall was watching me eyes alert for any signs of weakening well the choice is yours i sighed and closed my eyes tired of looking at him the choice wasnt mine but i could hardly tell him why not it doesnt matter i said wearily i cant tell you anything think it over for a moment he stood up and stepped carefully over jamies unconscious form taking a key from his pocket i may need marleys help for a bit but then ill send him back to his quarters and you with him if you dont mean to cooperate he stooped unlocked the manacle and heaved the inert body up with an impressive display of strength for one so slightly built the muscles of his forearms ridged the cloth of his snowy shirt as he carried jamie head lolling to a stool in the corner he nodded at the bucket standing nearby rouse him he directed the silent hulk curtly cold water splashed from the stones in the corner and puddled on the floor making a filthy pool underneath once more randall said inspecting jamie who was moaning slightly head stirring against the stones of the wall he flinched and coughed under the second drenching shower randall strode forward and took him by the hair yanking his head back shaking it like a drowned animal so that drops of fetid water spattered the walls jamies eyes were dull slits randall threw jamies head back in disgust wiping his hand down the side of his trousers as he turned away his eye must have caught the flicker of movement because he began to turn back but not in time to brace himself against the big scots sudden lunge jamies arms went around randalls neck lacking the use of his right hand he gripped his right wrist with the able left and pulled forearm braced on the englishmans windpipe as randall turned purple and began to sag he let go his left hand long enough to drive it into the captains kidney even weakened as jamie was the blow was enough to make randall give at the knees dropping the limp captain jamie whirled to face the hulking orderly who had been watching events so far without the slightest flicker of interest on his slackjawed face although his expression remained rather inert he did move picking up the mallet from the table as jamie came toward him holding the stool by one leg in his good left hand a certain dull wariness came into the orderlys face as the two men circled each other slowly looking for an opening betterarmed marley tried first swinging the mallet at jamies ribs jamie whirled away and feinted with the stool forcing the orderly back toward the door the next attempt a murderous blow downward would have split jamies skull had it landed on target as it was the stool split instead one leg and the seat sheared away impatiently jamie smashed the stool against the wall with his next swing reducing it to a smaller but more manageable club a twofoot length of wood with a ragged splintered end the air in the cell made stifling with smoke from the torches was still except for the gasping breath of the two men and the occasional bruising thud of wood on flesh afraid to speak for fear of disturbing jamies precarious concentration i pulled my feet up onto the bed and shrank back against the wall trying to stay out of the way it was plain to me and by his faint smile of anticipation to the orderly also that jamie was tiring rapidly amazing enough that he was on his feet at all let alone fighting it was clear to all three of us that the fight couldnt last much longer if he was to have any chance at all he must move soon with short hard jabs of the stoolleg he advanced cautiously on marley forcing the bigger man into the corner where the arc of his swing would be restricted realizing this by some instinct the orderly came out with a vicious horizontal swing expecting to force jamie back instead of stepping back jamie stepped forward into the swing taking the full brunt of the blow in the left side as he brought his club down fullforce on marleys temple intent on the scene before me i had paid no attention to randalls prone body on the floor near the door but as the orderly tottered eyes glazing i heard the scraping sounds of boots on stone and a labored breathing rasped in my ear nicely fought fraser randalls voice was hoarse from the choking but as composed as ever cost you a few ribs though didnt it jamie leaned against the wall breathing in sobbing gasps still holding the club elbow pressed hard to his side his eyes dropped to the floor measuring the distance dont try it fraser the light voice was bland shell be dead before you get two steps the thin cool knife blade slid past my ear i could feel the point gently pricking the corner of my jaw jamie surveyed the scene with dispassionate eyes for a moment still braced by the wall with a sudden effort he straightened painfully and stood swaying the club clanked hollowly on the stone floor the knifepoint pricked infinitesimally harder but otherwise randall stood motionless as jamie slowly crossed the few feet to the table stooping carefully on the way to pick up the twinewrapped mallet he held it dangling in two fingers in front of him his nonoffensive intent apparent the mallet clattered on the table in front of me the handle spinning hard enough to carry the weighty head nearly to the edge it lay dark and heavy on the oak a homely solid tool a reed basket of hapenny nails to go with it lay in the jumble of objects at the far end of the table something perhaps left behind by the carpenters who had furnished the room jamies good hand the fine straight fingers rimmed with gold in the light gripped the tableedge hard with an effort i could only guess at he lowered himself slowly into a chair and deliberately spread both hands flat before him on the scarred wood surface the mallet within easy reach his gaze had been locked with randalls during the painful trip across the room and did not waver now he nodded briefly in my direction without looking at me and said let her go the knifehand seemed to relax a trifle randalls voice was amused and curious why should i jamie seemed now in complete command of himself despite his white face and the sweat that ran unregarded down his face like tears you cannot hold a knife on two people at once kill the woman or leave her side and ill kill you he spoke softly a steely thread beneath the quiet scots accent and whats to stop me killing both of you one at a time i would have called the expression on jamies face a smile only because his teeth were showing what and cheat the hangsman bit hard to explain come morning no he nodded briefly at the unconscious hulk on the floor youll recall that ye had to have your wee helper bind me wi rope before ye broke my hand so the knife stayed steady at my ear your helper is no going to be much good to ye awhile yet this was undeniably true the monstrous orderly was lying on his face in the corner breathing in ragged stertorous snores severe concussion i thought mechanically possible cerebral hemorrhage i couldnt care less if he died before my eyes you cant take me alone onehanded or no jamie shook his head slowly appraising randalls size and strength no im bigger and far the better fighter hand to hand did ye not have the woman there i would take that wee knife from ye and cram it down your throat and you know it which is why youve not harmed her but i do have her you could leave yourself of course theres a way out quite near that would leave your wife you did say shes your wife to die of course jamie shrugged and myself as well id not get far with the whole garrison hunting me to be shot in the open might be preferable to being hanged in here but not enough to make a difference a brief grimace of pain crossed his face and he held his breath for a moment when he breathed again it was in shallow panting gulps whatever shock had been protecting him from the worst of the pain it was apparently wearing off so we seem to be at an impasse randalls wellbred english tones were casual unless you have a suggestion i have you want me the cool scottish voice was matteroffact let the woman go and ye can have me the knifepoint moved slightly nicking my ear i felt a sting and the warm ooze of blood do what ye wish to me ill not struggle though ill allow you to bind me if ye think it needful and ill not speak of it come tomorrow but first youll see the woman safe from the prison my eyes were on jamies ruined hand a small pool of blood under the middle finger was growing and i realized with a shock that he was deliberately pressing the finger into the table using the pain as a spur to stay conscious he was bargaining for my life using the only thing he had left himself if he fainted now that single chance was gone randall had relaxed completely the knife lay carelessly on my right shoulder as he thought it through i was there before him jamie was meant to hang in the morning sooner or later he would be missed and the castle would be searched while a certain amount of brutality might be tolerated among officers and gentlemen i was sure it would extend to a broken hand or a flayed back randalls other inclinations were not so likely to be overlooked no matter what jamies status as a condemned prisoner if he stood at the foot of the gallows come morning and claimed abuse at the hands of randall his claims would be investigated and if physical examination proved them true randalls career was at an end and possibly his life as well but with jamie sworn to silence youll give me your word jamies eyes were like blue matchflames in the parchment of his face after a moment he nodded slowly in return for yours the attraction of a victim at once completely unwilling and completely compliant was irresistible done the knife left my shoulder and i heard the susurrus of sheathed metal randall walked slowly past me around the table picking up the mallet as he went he held it up ironically questioning youll allow me a brief test of your sincerity aye jamies voice was as steady as his hands flat and motionless on the table i tried to speak to utter some protest but my throat had dried to a sticky silence moving without haste randall leaned past jamie to pluck a hapenny nail delicately from the reed basket he positioned the point with care and brought the mallet down driving the nail through jamies right hand into the table with four solid blows the broken fingers twitched and sprang straight like the legs of a spider pinned to a collection board jamie groaned his eyes wide and blank with shock randall set the mallet down with care he took jamies chin in his hand and turned his face up now kiss me he said softly and lowered his head to jamies unresisting mouth randalls face when he rose was dreamy eyes gentle and faraway long mouth quirked in a smile once upon a time i had loved a smile like that and that dreamy look had roused me in anticipation now it sickened me tears ran into the corner of my mouth though i didnt remember starting to cry randall stood a moment in his trance gazing down at jamie then he stirred remembering and drew the knife once more from its sheath the blade slashed carelessly through the binding around my wrists grazing the skin i hardly had time to rub the circulation back into my hands before he was urging me up with a hand beneath my elbow pushing me toward the door wait jamie spoke behind us and randall turned impatiently youll allow me to say goodbye it was a statement more than a question and randall hesitated only briefly before nodding and giving me a shove back toward the motionless figure at the table jamies good arm was tight around my shoulders and my wet face was buried in his neck you cant i whispered you cant i wont let you his mouth was warm against my ear claire im to hang in the morning what happens to me between now and then doesna matter to anyone i drew back and stared at him it matters to me the strained lips quivered in what was almost a smile and he raised his free hand and laid it against my wet cheek i know it does mo duinne and thats why youll go now so ill know there is someone still who minds for me he drew me close again kissed me gently and whispered in gaelic he will let you go because he thinks you are helpless i know you are not releasing me he said in english i love you go now randall paused as he ushered me out the door ill be back very shortly it was the voice of a man taking reluctant leave of his lover and my stomach heaved silhouetted in red by the torch behind him jamie inclined his head gracefully toward the pinioned hand i expect youll find me here black jack a common name for rogues and scoundrels in the eighteenth century a staple of romantic fiction the name conjured up charming highwaymen dashing blades in plumed hats the reality walked at my side one never stops to think what underlies romance tragedy and terror transmuted by time add a little art in the telling and voila a stirring romance to make the blood run fast and maidens sigh my blood was running fast all right and never maiden sighed like jamie cradling his mangled hand this way it was the first time randall had spoken since we had left the cell he indicated a narrow alcove in the wall unlighted by torches the way out of which he had spoken to jamie by now i had sufficient command of myself to speak and i did so i stepped back a pace so that the torchlight fell full on me for i wanted him to remember my face you asked me captain if i were a witch i said my voice low and steady ill answer you now witch i am witch and i curse you you will marry captain and your wife will bear a child but you shall not live to see your firstborn i curse you with knowledge jack randall i give you the hour of your death his face was in shadow but the gleam of his eyes told me he believed me and why should he not for i spoke the truth and i knew it i could see the lines of franks genealogical chart as though they were drawn on the mortar lines between the stones of the wall and the names listed by them jonathan wolverton randall i said softly reading it from the stones born september the rd died he made a convulsive movement toward me but not fast enough to prevent me from speaking a narrow door at the back of the alcove crashed open with a squeal of hinges expecting further darkness my eyes were dazzled by a blinding flash of light on snow a quick shove from behind sent me staggering headlong into the drifts and the door slammed to behind me i was lying in a ditch of sorts behind the prison the drifts around me covered heaps of something the prisons refuse most likely there was something hard beneath the drift i had fallen into wood perhaps looking up at the sheering wall above me i could see streaks and runnels down the stone marking the path of garbage tipped from a sliding door forty feet above that must be the kitchen quarters i rolled over bracing myself to rise and found myself looking into a pair of wide blue eyes the face was nearly as blue as the eyes and hard as the log of wood i had mistaken him for i stumbled to my feet choking and staggered back against the prison wall head down breathe deep i told myself firmly you are not going to faint you have seen dead men before lots of them you are not going to faint god he has blue eyes like you are not going to faint damn it my breathing slowed at last and with it my racing pulse as the panic receded i forced myself back to that pathetic figure wiping my hands convulsively on my skirt i dont know whether it was pity curiosity or simple shock that made me look again seen without the suddenness of surprise there was nothing frightening about the dead man there never is no matter how ugly the manner in which a man dies its only the presence of a suffering human soul that is horrifying once gone what is left is only an object the blueeyed stranger had been hanged he was not the only inhabitant of the ditch i didnt bother to excavate the drift but now that i knew what it contained i could plainly see the outline of frozen limbs and the softly rounded heads under the snow at least a dozen men lay here waiting either for a thaw that would make their burial easier or for a cruder disposal by the beasts of the nearby forest the thought startled me out of my pensive immobility i had no time to waste in graveside meditation or one more pair of blue eyes would stare sightless up into falling snow i had to find murtagh and rupert that hidden postern door could be used perhaps clearly it was not fortified or guarded like the main gates and other entrances to the prison but i needed help and i needed it quickly i glanced up at the rim of the ditch the sun was quite low burning through a haze of cloud just above the treetops the air felt heavy with moisture likely it would snow again by nightfall the haze was thick across the sky in the east there was perhaps an hour of light left i began to follow the ditch not wanting to climb the steep rocky sides until i had to the ravine curved away from the prison quite soon and looked as though it would lead down toward the river presumably the runoff of melting snow carried the prisons refuse away i was nearly to the corner of the soaring wall when i heard a faint sound behind me i whirled the sound had been made by a rock falling from the lip of the ditch dislodged by the foot of a large grey wolf as an alternative to the items under the snow i had certain desirable characteristics from a wolfs point of view on the one hand i was mobile harder to catch and posed the possibility of resistance on the other i was slow clumsy and above all not frozen stiff thus offering no danger of broken teeth i also smelled of fresh blood temptingly warm in this frozen waste were i a wolf i thought i wouldnt hesitate the animal made up its mind at the same time i came to my own decision regarding our future relations there had been a yank at pembroke hospital name of charlie marshall he was a pleasant chap friendly as all the yanks were and most entertaining on his pet subject his pet subject was dogs charlie was a sergeant in the k corps he had been blown up along with two of his dogs by an antipersonnel mine outside a small village near arles he grieved for his dogs and often told me stories about them when i would sit with him during the odd slack moments in my shift more to the immediate point he had also once told me what to do and not do should i ever be attacked by a dog i felt it was stretching a point to call the eerie creature picking its delicate way down the rocks a dog but hoped that it might yet share a few basic character traits with its tame descendants bad dog i said firmly staring it in one yellow eyeball in fact i said backing very slowly toward the prison wall you are a perfectly horrible dog speak firmly and loudly i heard charlie saying probably the worst ive ever seen i said firmly and loudly i continued to back up one hand feeling behind me for the stones of the wall and once there i sidled toward the corner some ten yards away i pulled the ties at my throat and began to fumble at the brooch fastening my cloak still telling the wolf firmly and loudly what i thought of him his ancestors and his immediate family the beast seemed interested in the diatribe tongue lolling in a doggy grin he was in no hurry he limped slightly i could see as he drew nearer and was thin and mangy perhaps he had trouble hunting and infirmity was what drew him to the prison midden to scavenge i certainly hoped so the more infirm the better i found my leather gloves in the pocket of my cloak and put them on then i wrapped the heavy cloak several times around my right forearm blessing the weight of the velvet theyll go for the throat charlie had instructed me unless their trainer tells them otherwise keep looking him in the eye youll see it when he makes up his mind to jump thats your moment i could see a number of things in that wicked yellow orb including hunger curiosity and speculation but not yet a decision to leap you disgusting creature i told it dont you dare leap at my throat i had other ideas i had wrapped the cloak in several loose folds about my right arm leaving the bulk of it dangling but providing enough padding i hoped to keep the beasts teeth from sinking through the wolf was thin but not emaciated i judged it to weigh perhaps eighty or ninety pounds less than me but not enough to give me any great advantage the leverage was definitely in the animals favor four legs against two gave better balance on the slippery crust of snow i hoped bracing my back against the wall would help a certain feeling of emptiness at my back told me i had reached the corner the wolf was some twenty feet away this was it i scraped enough snow from under my feet to give good footing and waited i didnt even see the wolf leave the ground i could swear i had been watching its eyes but if the decision to leap had registered there it had been followed by action too swiftly to note it was instinct not thought that raised my arm as a whitishgrey blur hurtled toward me the teeth sank into the padding with a force that bruised my arm it was heavier than i thought i was unprepared for the weight and my arm sagged i had planned to try to throw the beast against the wall perhaps stunning it instead i heaved myself at the wall squashing the wolf between the stone blocks and my hip i struggled to wrap the loose cloak around it claws shredded my skirt and scraped my thigh i drove a knee viciously into its chest eliciting a strangled yelp only then did i realize that the odd growling whimpers were coming from me and not the wolf strangely enough i was not at all frightened now though i had been terrified watching the wolf stalk me there was room in my mind for only one thought i would kill this animal or it would kill me therefore i was going to kill it there comes a turning point in intense physical struggle where one abandons oneself to a profligate usage of strength and bodily resource ignoring the costs until the struggle is over women find this point in childbirth men in battle past that certain point you lose all fear of pain or injury life becomes very simple at that point you will do what you are trying to do or die in the attempt and it does not really matter much which i had seen this sort of struggle during my training on the wards but never had i experienced it before now all my concentration was focused on the jaws locked around my forearm and the writhing demon tearing at my body i managed to bang the beasts head against the wall but not hard enough to do much good i was growing tired rapidly had the wolf been in good condition i would have had no chance i hadnt much now but took what there was i fell on the animal pinning it under me and knocking the wind from it in a gust of carrion breath it recovered almost immediately and began squirming beneath me but the seconds relaxation enabled me to get it off my arm one hand clamped under its wet muzzle by forcing my fingers back into the corners of its mouth i managed to keep them out from between the scissoring carnassial teeth saliva drizzled down my arm i was lying flat on top of the wolf the corner of the prison wall was perhaps eighteen inches ahead of me somehow i must get there without releasing the fury that heaved and squirmed under me scrabbling with my feet pressing down with all my might i pushed myself forward inch by inch constantly straining to keep the fangs from my throat it cannot have taken more than a few minutes to move those eighteen inches but it seemed i had lain there most of my life locked in battle with this beast whose hind claws raked my legs seeking a good ripping purchase in my belly at last i could see around the corner the blunt angle of stone was directly in front of my face now was the tricky part i must maneuver the wolfs body to allow me to get both hands under the muzzle i would never be able to exert the necessary force with one i rolled abruptly away and the wolf slithered at once into the small clear space between my body and the wall before it could rise to its feet i brought my knee up as hard as i could the wolf grunted as my knee drove into its side pinning it however fleetingly against the wall i had both hands beneath its jaw now the fingers of one hand were actually in its mouth i could feel a crushing sting across my gloved knuckles but ignored it as i forced the hairy head back and back and back again using the angle of the wall as a fulcrum for the lever of the beasts body i thought my arms would break but this was the only chance there was no audible noise but i felt the reverberation through the whole body as the neck snapped the straining limbs and the bladder at once relaxed the intolerable strain on my arms now released i dropped as limp as the dying wolf i could feel the beasts heart fibrillating beneath my cheek the only part still capable of a death struggle the stringy fur stank of ammonia and soggy hair i wanted to move away but could not i think i must have slept for a moment odd as that sounds cheek pillowed on the corpse i opened my eyes to see the greenish stone of the prison a few inches in front of my nose only the thought of what was transpiring on the other side of that wall got me to my feet i stumbled down the ditch cloak dragged over one shoulder tripping on stones hidden in the snow banging my shins painfully on halfburied tree branches subconsciously i must have been aware that wolves usually run in packs because i do not recall being surprised by the howl that wavered out of the forest above and behind me if i felt anything it was black rage at what seemed a conspiracy to thwart and delay me wearily i turned to see where the sound had come from i was in the open away from the prison by this time no wall to brace my back against and no weapon to hand it had been luck as much as anything that helped me with the first wolf there was not a chance in a thousand that i could kill another animal barehanded and how many more might there be the pack i had seen feeding in the moonlight in the summer had had at least ten wolves i could hear in memory the sounds of their teeth scraping and the crack of breaking bones the only question now was whether i bothered to fight at all or whether i would rather just lie down in the snow and give up that option seemed remarkably attractive all things considered still jamie had given up his life and considerably more than that to get me out of the prison i owed it to him at least to try once more i backed slowly away moving farther down the ditch the light was fading soon the ravine would be filled with shadow i doubted that that would help me the wolves undoubtedly had better nightsight than i did the first of the hunters appeared on the rim of the ditch as the other had a shaggy figure standing motionless and alert it was with something of a shock that i realized two more were already in the ravine with me trotting slowly almost in step with each other they were almost the same color as the snow in the twilight dirty grey and almost invisible though they moved with no attempt at concealment i stopped moving flight was clearly useless bending i freed a dead pine branch from the snow the bark was black with the wet and rough even through my gloves i waved the branch around my head and shouted the animals stopped moving toward me but did not retreat the closest one flattened its ears as though objecting to the noise dont like it i screeched too bloody bad back off you fucking sod scooping up a halfburied rock i hurled it at the wolf it missed but the beast scooted to one side encouraged i began to fling missiles wildly rocks twigs handfuls of snow anything i could grab onehanded i shrieked until my throat was raw with cold air howling like the wolves themselves at first i thought one of my missiles had scored a hit the nearest wolf yelped and seemed to convulse the second arrow passed within a foot of me and i caught the tiny blur of motion before it thudded home in the chest of the second wolf that animal died where it stood the first struck less vitally kicked and struggled in the snow no more than a heaving lump in the growing dusk i stood stupidly staring at it for some time then looked up by instinct to the lip of the ravine the third wolf wisely choosing discretion had vanished back into the trees from whence a shivering howl went up i was still looking up at the dark trees when a hand clutched my elbow i whirled with a gasp to find myself looking up into the face of a stranger narrowjawed and with a weak chin illdisguised by a scabby beard he was a stranger indeed but his plaid and his dirk marked him a scot help i said and fell forward into his arms chapter macrannoch it was dark in the cottage and there was a bear in the corner of the room in panic i recoiled against my escort wanting nothing more to do with wild beasts he shoved me strongly forward into the cottage as i staggered toward the fire the hulking shape turned toward me and i realized belatedly that it was merely a large man in a bearskin a bearskin cloak to be exact fastened at the neck with a silvergilt brooch as large as the palm of my hand it was made in the shape of two leaping stags backs arched and heads meeting to form a circle the locking pin was a short tapered fan the head of it shaped like the tail of a fleeing deer i noticed the brooch in detail because it was directly in front of my nose looking up i briefly considered the possibility that i had been wrong perhaps it really was a bear still bears presumably did not wear brooches or have eyes like blueberries small round and a dark shiny blue they were sunk in heavy cheeks whose lower slopes were forested with silvershot black hair similar hair cascaded over thickset shoulders to mingle with the hair of the cloak which in spite of its new use was still pungently redolent of its former owner the shrewd little eyes flickered over me evaluating both the bedraggled state of my attire and the good basic quality of it including the two wedding rings gold and silver the bears address was formulated accordingly you seem to have had some difficulty mistress he said formally inclining a massive head still spangled with melting snow perhaps we might assist ye i hesitated over what to say i desperately needed this mans help yet i would be suspect immediately my speech revealed me to be english the archer who had brought me here forestalled me found her near wentworth he said laconically fightin wolves an english lassie he added with an emphasis that made my hosts blueberry eyes fix on me with a rather unpleasant speculation in their depths i pulled myself up to my full height and summoned as much of the matron attitude as i could english by birth scots by marriage i said firmly my name is claire fraser my husband is a prisoner in wentworth i see said the bear slowly weel my own name is macrannoch and yere presently on my land i can see by your dress as youre a woman of some family how come ye to be alone in eldridge wood on a winter night i caught at the opening here was some chance to establish my bona fides as well as to find murtagh and rupert i came to wentworth with some clansmen of my husbands as i was english we thought i could gain entrance to the prison and perhaps find some way of er removing him however i i left the prison by another way i was looking for my friends when i was set upon by wolves from which this gentleman kindly rescued me i tried a grateful smile on the rawboned archer who received it in stony silence yeve certainly met something wi teeth macrannoch agreed eyeing the gaping rents in my skirt suspicion yielded temporarily to the demands of hospitality are ye hurt then just a bit scratched weel youre cold nae doubt and a wee bit shaken i imagine sit here by the fire hector will fetch ye a sup of something and then ye can tell me a bit more about these friends of yours he pulled a rough threelegged stool up with one foot and sat me firmly on it with a massive hand on my shoulder peat fires give little light but are comfortingly hot i shuddered involuntarily as the blood started to flow back into my frozen hands a couple of gulps from the leather flask grudgingly provided by hector started the blood flowing internally again as well i explained my situation as well as i could which was not particularly well my brief description of my exit from the prison and subsequent handtohand encounter with the wolf was received with particular skepticism given that ye did manage to get into wentworth it doesna seem likely that sir fletcher would allow ye to wander about the place nor if this captain randall had found ye in the dungeons he would merely ha shown ye the back door he he had reasons for letting me go which were the blueberry eyes were implacable i gave up and put the matter baldly i was much too tired for delicacy or circumlocutions macrannoch appeared semiconvinced but still reluctant to take any action aye i see your concern he argued still that may not be so bad not so bad i sprang to my feet in outrage he shook his head as though plagued by deerflies what i mean he explained is that if its the lads arse hes after hes none so likely to hurt him badly and savin your presence maam he cocked a bushy eyebrow in my direction bein buggered has seldom killed anyone he held up placating hands the size of soup plates now im no sayin hell enjoy it mind but i do say its not worth a major setto with sir fletcher gordon just to save the lad a sore arse ive a precarious position here ye know verra precarious and he puffed out his cheeks and beetled his brows at me not for the first time i regretted the fact that there were no real witches had i been one i would have turned him into a toad on the spot a big fat one with warts i choked down my rage and tried reason yet again i rather think his arse is beyond saving by this time its his neck im concerned with the english mean to hang him in the morning macrannoch was muttering to himself twisting back and forth like a bear in a toosmall cage he stopped abruptly in front of me and thrust his nose to within an inch of my own i would have recoiled had i not been so exhausted as it was i merely blinked and if i said id help ye what good would that do he roared he resumed his turning and pacing two steps to one wall hurling around in a fling of fur and two steps to the other he spoke as he paced words keeping time to the steps pausing to puff as he turned if i were to go to sir fletcher myself what would i say yeve a captain on your staff whos engaged in torturin the prisoners in his spare time and when he asks how i know that i tell him a stray sassenach wench my men found wanderin in the dark told me this mans been makin indecent advances to her husband whos an outlaw wi a price on his head and a condemned murderer to boot macrannoch stopped and thumped one paw on the flimsy table and as for takin men into the place if and mind ye i say if we could get in you could get in i interrupted i can show you the way mmmphm thats as may be if we could get in what happens when sir fletcher finds my men wanderin about his fortress he sends captain randall round next mornin with a brace of cannon and levels eldridge hall to the ground thats what he shook his head again making the black locks fly nay lass i canna see he was interrupted by the sudden flinging open of the cottage door to admit another bowman this one pushing murtagh in front of him at knifepoint macrannoch stopped and stared in amazement what is this he demanded yed think twas may day and the lads and lassies all out gatherin flowers in the wood not the dead o winter and snow comin on this is my husbands clansman i said as i told you murtagh undisturbed by the less than cordial greeting was eyeing the bearclad figure closely as though mentally stripping hair and years away macrannoch is it no he said in a tone almost accusing yell have been at a gathering i think some time ago at castle leoch macrannoch was more than startled some time ago i should say why that must ha been near on thirty year ago how dye know that man murtagh nodded satisfied och i thought so i was there and i remember that gathering likely for the same reason ye do yourself macrannoch was studying the wizened little man trying to subtract thirty years from the seamed countenance aye i know ye he said at last or not the name but you ye killed a wounded boar singlehanded with a dagger during the tynchal a gallant beast too thats right the mackenzie gave ye the tushes a bonny set almost a complete double curve lovely work that man a look perilously close to gratification creased murtaghs pitted cheek momentarily i started remembering the magnificent barbaric bracelets i had seen at lallybroch my mothers jenny had said given to her by an admirer i stared at murtagh in disbelief even allowing for the passage of thirty years he did not seem a likely candidate for the tender passion thinking of ellen mackenzie i remembered her pearls which i was still carrying sewn into the seam of my pocket i groped for the free end pulling them out into the firelight i can pay you i said i wouldnt expect your men to risk themselves for nothing moving a good deal faster than i would have thought possible he snatched the pearls from my hand he stared at them disbelievingly where did ye get these woman he demanded fraser did ye say your name is yes tired as i was i drew myself up straight and the pearls are mine my husband gave them to me on our wedding day did he then the hoarse voice was suddenly hushed he turned to murtagh still holding the pearls ellens son is this lasss husband ellens son aye murtagh said unemphatic as ever as yed ken at once if ye saw him hes the spit of her mindful at last of the pearls he was clutching macrannoch unfolded his hand and gently stroked the shining gems i gave these to ellen mackenzie he said for a wedding gift i would ha given them to her as my wife but as shed chosen elsewhere well id thought of them so often around her bonny throat i told her i couldna see them elsewhere so i bade her keep them and only think of me when she wore them hm he snorted briefly at some memory then handed the pearls carefully back to me so theyre yours now well wear them in good health lassie ill stand a much better chance of doing so i said trying to control my impatience at these sentimental displays if youll help me to get my husband back the small rosy mouth which had been smiling slightly at its owners thought tightened suddenly ah said sir marcus pulling at his beard i see but ive told ye lassie i canna see how it can be done ive a wife and three weans at home aye id do a bit for ellens lad but its a bit much yere askin suddenly my legs gave way altogether and i sat down with a thump letting my shoulders sag and my head droop despair dragged at me like an anchor pulling me down i closed my eyes and retreated to some dim place within where there was nothing but an aching grey blankness and where the sound of murtaghs voice still arguing was no more than a faint yapping it was the bawling of cattle that roused me from my stupor i looked up to see macrannoch swirl out of the cottage as he opened the door a blast of winter air came in thick with the lowing of cattle and yelling of men the door thumped shut behind the vast hairy figure and i turned to ask murtagh what he thought we should do next the look on his face stopped me wordless i had seldom seen him with anything more than a sort of patient dourness showing on his features but now he positively glowed with suppressed excitement i caught at his arm what is it tell me quickly he had time only to say the kine theyre macrannochs before macrannoch himself plunged back into the cottage pushing a lanky young man before him with a last shove he brought the young man flat up against the plastered wall of the cottage apparently macrannoch found confrontation effective he tried the same nosetonose technique he had used on me earlier less poised or less tired than i the young man hunched nervously back against the wall as far as he could go macrannoch started out being sweetly reasonable absalom man i sent ye out three hours ago to bring in forty head of cattle i told ye it was important to find them because theres about to be a damn awfu snowstorm the nicely modulated voice was rising and when i heard the sound of kine bellowin outside i said to meself ah marcus theres absalom gone and found all the cattle what a good lad now we can all go home and thaw ourselves by the fire with the kine safe in their barns one hamfist had fastened itself onto absaloms jacket the material gathered between those stubby fingers began to twist and then i go out to congratulate you on a good job done and begin to count the beasts and how many do i count absalom me bonny wee lad the voice had risen to a fullpowered roar while not possessed of a particularly deep voice marcus macrannoch had enough lungpower for three ordinarysized men fifteen he shouted jerking the unfortunate absalom to his tiptoes fifteen beasts he finds out of forty and where are the rest o them where out loose in the snow to freeze to death murtagh had faded quietly back into the shadows in the corner while all this was going on i was watching his face though and saw the sudden gleam of amusement in his eyes at these words suddenly i realized what he had started to tell me and i knew where rupert was now or if not precisely where he was at least what he was doing and i began to hope a little it was full dark the prisons lights below shone weakly through the snow like the lamps of a drowned ship waiting under the trees with my two companions i mentally reviewed for the thousandth time everything that could go wrong would macrannoch carry out his part of the bargain hed have to if he expected to get his prized purebred highland cattle back would sir fletcher believe macrannoch and order a search of the basement dungeons at once likely the baronet wasnt a man to be taken lightly i had seen the cattle disappear one shaggy beast at a time down the ditch that led to the hidden postern door under the expert driving of rupert and his men but would they be able to force the cattle through that door singly or not and if so what would they do once inside halfwild cattle trapped suddenly in a stone corridor lit with glaring torchlight well perhaps it would work the corridor itself would be not unlike their stonefloored barn including torches and the scent of humans if they got so far the plan might succeed randall himself was unlikely to call for help in the face of the invasion for fear of having his own little games uncovered the handlers were to get away from the prison as fast as possible once the beasts were well and truly launched on their chaotic path and then to ride hellforleather for the mackenzie lands randall didnt matter what could he do alone in the circumstances but what if the noise attracted the rest of the prison garrison too soon if dougal had been reluctant to try to break his nephew out of wentworth i could imagine his choler if several mackenzies were arrested for breaking into the place i didnt want to be responsible for that either though rupert had been more than willing to take the risk i bit my thumb and tried to comfort myself thinking of the tons of solid soundmuffling granite that separated the dungeons from the prison quarters above most worrying of all of course was the fear that everything might work and might be still too late waiting hangsman or no randall might go too far i knew too well from stories told by returning soldiers from pow camps that nothing is easier than for a prisoner to die by accident and the body be conveniently disposed of before embarrassing official questions can be asked even if questions were asked and randall found out it would be small comfort to me and to jamie i had been resolutely keeping myself from imagining the possible uses of the homely objects on the table of that room but i could not keep from seeing over and over the boneends of that shattered finger pressing into the table i rubbed my own knuckles hard against the saddle leather trying to erase the image i felt a slight burning and pulled off the glove to examine the grazes left across my hand by the wolfs teeth not bad no more than a few scratches with one small puncture where a cusp had penetrated the leather i licked the wound absently it was little use telling myself that i had done my best i had done the only possible thing but knowing it didnt make the waiting easier at last we heard a faint confused shouting from the direction of the prison one of the macrannoch men put a hand on the bridle of my horse and motioned toward the shelter of the trees the snow was much lighter on the ground and the flurries diminished under the interlaced branches of the grove thin lines of snow stark and sudden on the rocky leafstrewn ground while the snow fell less thickly in here visibility was still so poor that tree trunks a few feet away loomed surprisingly as i walked my horse restlessly around the small clearing trunks springing up black in the pinkish light muffled by the heavy snow the approaching hoofbeats were almost upon us before we heard them the two macrannoch men drew their pistols and reined their horses up close to the trees waiting but i had picked up the dull lowing of cattle and spurred my horse forward out of the grove sir marcus macrannoch distinguishable by his piebald mount and his bearskin cloak was leading the way up the slope snow spurting in small explosions from under the hooves of his horse he was followed by several men all in high good humor from the sound of it more of his men rode further back chivvying the milling herd of cattle from behind driving the band of bewildered beasts around the base of the hill toward their wellearned shelter in the macrannoch barns macrannoch reined up beside me laughing heartily ive to thank ye mistress fraser he shouted through the snow for a most entertaining evening his earlier suspicion had vanished and he greeted me with the utmost geniality his eyebrows and mustache coated with snow he looked like father christmas on a spree taking my bridle he led my horse back into the quieter air of the grove he waved my two companions down the hill to help with the cattle then dismounted and swung me down from my saddle still laughing to himself ye should ha seen it he chortled hugging himself in ecstasy sir fletcher went red as a robins breast when i pushed in in the midst of his dinner shouting that he was concealing stolen property on his premises and then when we got belowstairs and he heard the beasts bellowin like thunder i thought hed dirtied his breeches he i shook his arm impatiently never mind sir fletchers breeches did you find my husband macrannoch sobered a bit wiping his eyes with his sleeve oh aye we found him is he all right i spoke calmly though i wanted to scream macrannoch nodded toward the trees behind me and i whirled to see a rider making his way carefully through the branches a bulky clothcovered shape draped across the saddlebow in front of him i dashed forward followed by macrannoch explaining helpfully hes no deid or at least he wasnt when we found him been mistreated a good bit though poor laddie i had pushed aside the cloth over jamies head and was anxiously examining him as best i could with the horse fidgeting from the excitement of the cold ride and the extra burden i could see dark bruises and feel stiff patches of blood in the rumpled hair but could tell little more in the dim light i thought i could feel a pulse in the icy neck but wasnt sure macrannoch caught my elbow and pulled me away well do best to get him inside quick lass come with me hector will bring him along to the house in the main drawing room of eldridge manor macrannochs home hector humped his burden onto the rug before the fire seizing one corner of the blanket he unrolled it carefully and a limp naked figure flopped out onto the pink and yellow flowers of lady annabelle macrannochs pride and joy to do the lady annabelle credit she didnt seem to notice the blood soaking into her expensive aubusson rug a birdlike woman in her early forties arrayed like a goldfinch in a sunburst of yellow silk dressing gown she had servants bustling in all directions with a brisk clap of her hands and blankets linen hot water and whisky appeared at my elbow almost before i had got my cloak off best turn him on his belly advised sir marcus pouring out two large whiskies hes had his back flayed and it must feel fierce to lie on it not that he looks like he feels anything much he added peering closely at jamies ashen face and sealed bluish eyelids youre sure hes still alive yes i answered shortly hoping i was right i struggled to pull jamie over unconsciousness seemed to have tripled his weight macrannoch lent a hand and we got him positioned on a blanket back to the fire a rapid triage having established that he was in fact alive missing no body parts and not in immediate danger of bleeding to death i could afford to make a less hurried inventory of the damage i can send for a physician said lady annabelle looking dubiously at the corpselike figure on her hearth but i doubt he can get here under an hour its snowing something fierce out the reluctance in her tone was only partly on account of the snow i thought a physician would make one more dangerous witness to the presence of an escaped criminal in her home dont bother i said absently i am a physician disregarding the looks of surprise from both macrannochs i knelt beside what was left of my husband covered him with blankets and began to apply cloths soaked in hot water to the outlying parts my chief concern was to get him warm the blood from his back was a slow ooze which could be dealt with later lady annabelle faded into the distance her high goldfinchs voice summoning beckoning and arranging her spouse sank down on his haunches beside me and began to rub jamies frozen feet in a businesslike way between large bluntfingered hands pausing occasionally to sip his whisky turning back the blankets in bits i surveyed the damage he had been finely striped from nape to knees with something like a coachwhip the weals crisscrossing neatly like hemstitching the sheer orderliness of the damage speaking as it did of a deliberation that reveled in each punishing stroke made me feel sick with rage something heavier perhaps a cane had been used with less restraint across his shoulders cutting so deeply in spots that a gleam of bone showed over one shoulderblade i pressed a thick pad of lint gently over the worst of the mess and went on with the examination the spot on his left side where the mallet had struck was an ugly contused swelling a black and purple patch bigger than sir marcuss hand broken ribs there for sure but those too could wait my attention was caught by the livid patches on neck and breast where the skin was puckered reddened and blistered the edges of one such patch were charred rimmed with white ash what in hell did that sir marcus had completed his ministrations and was looking over my shoulder with deep interest a hot poker the voice was weak and indistinct it was a moment before i realized that it was jamie who had spoken he raised his head with an effort showing the reason for his difficult speech the lower lip was badly bitten on one side and puffed like a beesting with considerable presence of mind sir marcus put a hand behind jamies neck and pressed the beaker of whisky to his lips jamie winced as the spirit stung his torn mouth but drained the beaker before laying his head down again his eyes slanted up at me slightly filmed with pain and whisky but alight with amusement nonetheless cows he asked was it really cows or was i dreaming well it was all i could manage in the time i said beaming in my relief at seeing him alive and conscious i placed a hand on his head turning it to inspect a large bruise over the cheekbone you look bloody awful how do you feel i asked from force of longheld habit alive he struggled up onto one elbow to accept with a nod a second beaker of whisky from sir marcus do you think you should drink so much all at once i asked trying to examine his pupils for signs of concussion he foiled me by closing his eyes and tilting his head back yes he said handing back the empty beaker to sir marcus who bore it back in the direction of the decanter now thatll be enough for the present marcus lady annabelle reappearing like the sun in the east stopped her husband with a commanding chirp the lad needs hot strong tea not more whisky the tea followed her processionally in a silver pot borne by a maidservant whose air of natural superiority was unimpaired by the fact that she was still attired in her nightdress hot strong tea with plenty of sugar in it i amended and perhaps a wee tot of whisky as well said sir marcus neatly removing the lid of the teapot as it passed and adding a generous dollop from his decanter accepting the steaming cup gratefully jamie raised it in mute tribute to sir marcus before cautiously bringing the hot liquid to his mouth his hand shook badly and i wrapped my own around his fingers to guide the cup more servants were bringing in a portable camp bed a mattress more blankets more bandages and hot water and a large wooden chest containing the households medical supplies i thought we had best work here before the fire lady annabelle explained in her charming birdvoice theres more light and its far the warmest place in the house at her direction two of the larger menservants each seized an end of the blanket under jamie and transferred it smoothly contents and all to the camp bed now set up before the fire where another servant was industriously poking the nightbanked coals and feeding the growing blaze the maid who had brought in the tea was efficiently lighting the wax tapers in the branched candelabra on the sideboard despite her songbird appearance the lady annabelle plainly had the soul of a mastersergeant yes now that hes awake the sooner the better i said have you a flat board about two feet long i asked a stout strap and perhaps some small straight flat sticks about so long i held my fingers apart measuring a length of four inches or so one of the servants disappeared into the shadows flicking out of sight like a djinn to do my bidding the whole house seemed magical perhaps because of the contrast between the howling cold outside and the luxurious warmth within or maybe only because of the relief of seeing jamie safe after so many hours of fear and worry heavy dark furniture gleamed with polish in the lamplight silver shone on the sideboard and a collection of delicate glass and china ornamented the mantelpiece in bizarre contrast to the bloody bedraggled figure before it no questions were asked we were sir marcuss guests and lady annabelle behaved as though it were an everyday occurrence to have people come and bleed on the carpet at midnight it occurred to me for the first time that such a visit might have happened before verra nasty said sir marcus examining the smashed hand with an expertise born of the battlefield and wretched painful too i expect still its no going to kill ye is it he straightened up and addressed me in confidential tones i thought it might be worse than this given what ye told me except the ribs and hand theres no bones broken and the rest will heal fine id say maybe ye were lucky lad there was a faint snort from the recumbent figure on the bed i suppose ye could call it luck they meant to be hanging me in the morning he moved his head restlessly on the pillow trying to look up at sir marcus did ye know that sir he added catching sight of sir marcuss embroidered waistcoat with its coat of arms worked in silver stitchery among the pigeons and roses macrannoch waved a hand dismissing this minor detail weel if he meant to be keepin ye presentable for the hangsman he went a bit far on your back then sir marcus remarked removing the soaked lint and replacing it with a fresh pad aye he lost his head a bit when when he jamie struggled to get the words out then gave it up as a bad job and turned his face to the fire eyes closed god im tired he said we let him rest until the manservant materialized by my elbow with the splints i had requested then i carefully picked up the smashed right hand bringing it into the candlelight for examination it would have to be set and as soon as possible the injured muscles were already clawing the fingers inward i felt hopeless as i saw the full extent of the damage but if he was ever to have any use of the hand again it would have to be attempted lady annabelle had hung back during my examination watching interestedly when i set the hand down she stepped forward and opened the small chest of medical supplies i suppose youll be wanting the boneset and perhaps the cherry bark i dont know she eyed jamie doubtfully leeches do you think her wellkept hand hovered over a small lidded jar filled with murky liquid i shuddered and shook my head no i dont think so not just now what i could really use do you by chance have any sort of opiate i sank to my knees beside her to pore over the contents of the box oh yes her hand went unerringly to a small green flask flowers of laudanum she read from the label will that do perfect i accepted the flask gratefully all right then i said briskly to jamie pouring a small amount of the odorous liquid into a glass youll need to sit up just long enough to swallow this then youll go to sleep and stay that way for a good long time in fact i had some doubts as to the advisability of administering laudanum on top of such a quantity of whisky but the alternative reconstructing that hand while he was conscious was unthinkable i tipped the bottle to pour a bit more jamies good hand on my arm stopped me i dont want drugs he said firmly just perhaps a wee drop more of whisky he hesitated tongue touching the bitten lip and maybe something to bite down on sir marcus hearing this crossed to the lovely glowing sheraton desk in the corner and began to rummage he returned in a moment with a small piece of wellworn leather looking more closely i could see the dozens of overlapping semicircular indentations in the thick leather toothmarks i realized with a shock here sir marcus said helpfully i used this myself at st simone got me through it while i had a musket ball dug out of my leg i looked on openmouthed as jamie took the leather with a nod of thanks smoothing his thumb over the marks i spoke slowly stunned you actually expect me to set nine broken bones while youre awake yes he said briefly placing the leather between his teeth and biting down experimentally he shifted it back and forth seeking a comfortable grip overcome by the sheer theatricality of it the precarious control i had been hoarding suddenly snapped will you stop being such a goddamned frigging hero i blazed at jamie we all know what youve done you dont have to prove how much you can stand or do you think well all fall apart if youre not in charge telling everyone what to do every minute who in bloody hell do you think you are frigging john wayne there was an awkward silence jamie looked at me openmouthed finally he spoke claire he said softly were perhaps two miles from wentworth prison im meant to hang in the morning no matter whats happened to randall the english are going to notice im gone soon i bit my lip what he said was true my inadvertent release of the other prisoners might confuse the issue for a time but eventually a tally would be made and a search begun and thanks to the flamboyant method of escape i had chosen attention was bound to be focused on eldridge manor in short order if were lucky the quiet voice continued the snow will delay a search til weve gone if not he shrugged staring into the flames claire ill not let them take me back and to be drugged to lie here helpless if they come and maybe wake up chained in a cell again claire i couldna bear it there were tears blurring on my lower lashes i stared wideeyed at him not wanting to blink and let them run down my cheeks he closed his eyes against the fires heat the glow lent a spurious look of ruddy health to the white cheeks i could see the long muscles in his throat work as he swallowed dont cry sassenach he said so softly i could hardly hear him he reached out and patted my leg with his good hand trying to be reassuring i imagine were safe enough lass if i thought likely wed be captured id certainly no waste one of my last hours having you mend a hand id not be going to need go and fetch murtagh for me then bring me a drink and well get on wi it busy at the table with the medical preparations i couldnt hear what he said to murtagh but i saw the two heads close together for a moment then murtaghs sinewy hand gently touch the younger mans ear one of the few uninjured spots available with a brief nod of farewell murtagh sidled toward the door like a rat i thought darting along the wainscoting not to be noticed i was behind him as he went out into the hall and grabbed him by the plaid just before he escaped altogether through the front door what did he tell you i demanded fiercely where are you going the dark stringy little man hesitated for a moment but answered evenly im to go wi young absalom toward wentworth and keep watch in that direction if any redcoats are headin this way im to beat them here and if theres time im to see you and him both hidden then ride off with three horses to draw followers away from the manor theres a cellar it might do for hiding if the search isna too thorough and if there isnt time to hide i eyed him narrowly daring him not to answer then im to kill him and take you wi me he answered promptly willing or no he added with an evil grin and turned to go just a minute i spoke sharply and he stopped do you have an extra dirk his scruffy brows shot upward but his hand went to his belt without hesitation do ye need one here his glance took in the opulence and serenity of the entrance hall with its painted adam ceiling and linenfold paneling my daggerpocket was shredded beyond use i took the proffered dagger and slid it between kirtle and bodice in the back as i had seen the gypsy women do one never knows does one i said evenly preparations complete i probed as gently as possible assessing harm deciding what must be done jamie drew in his breath sharply when i touched an especially bad spot but kept his eyes closed as i felt my way slowly along each separate bone and joint noting the position of each fracture and dislocation sorry i murmured i took his good hand as well and felt carefully down each finger of both the good hand and the injured making comparisons with neither x rays nor experience to guide me i would have to depend on my own sensitivity to find and realign the smashed bones the first joint was all right but the second phalange was cracked i thought i pressed harder to determine the length and direction of the crack the damaged hand stayed motionless in my fingers but the good one made a small involuntary clenching gesture im sorry i murmured once more the good hand pulled suddenly out of my grasp as jamie raised himself on one elbow spitting out the leather gag he regarded me with an expression between amusement and exasperation sassenach he said if you apologize each time ye hurt me its going to be a verra long night and its lasted some time already i must have looked stricken because he started to reach toward me then stopped wincing at the movement he controlled the pain though and spoke firmly i know you dinna wish to hurt me but youve no more choice about it than i have and theres no need for more than one of us to suffer for it you do whats needed and ill scream if i have to replacing the leather strip he bared his clenched teeth ferociously at me then slowly and deliberately crossed his eyes this made him look so like an addlepated tiger that i burst into halfhysterical laughter before i could stop myself i clapped my hands over my mouth cheeks flaming as i saw the astonished looks on the faces of lady annabelle and the servants who standing behind jamie naturally could see nothing of his face sir marcus who had caught a brief glimpse from his seat at the bedside grinned in his spadeshaped beard besides said jamie spitting out the leather once more if the english turn up after this i expect ill beg them to take me back i picked up the leather put it between his teeth and pushed his head down again clown i said knowall sodding hero but he had relieved me of a burden and i worked more calmly if i still noticed every twitch and grimace at least i no longer felt it as badly i began to lose myself in the concentration of the job directing all my awareness to my fingertips assessing each point of damage and deciding how best to draw the smashed bones back into alignment luckily the thumb had suffered least only a simple fracture of the first joint that would heal clean the second knuckle on the fourth finger was completely gone i felt only a pulpy grating of bone chips when i rolled it gently between my own thumb and forefinger making jamie groan nothing could be done about that save splint the joint and hope for the best the compound fracture of the middle finger was the worst to contemplate the finger would have to be pulled straight drawing the protruding bone back through the torn flesh i had seen this done before under general anesthesia with the guidance of x rays to this point it had been more a mechanical problem than a real one deciding how to reconstruct a smashed disembodied hand i was now smack up against the reason that physicians seldom treat members of their own families some jobs in medicine require a certain ruthlessness to complete successfully detachment is necessary to inflict pain in the process of effecting a healing quietly sir marcus had brought up a stool by the side of the bed he settled his bulk comfortably as i finished the strapping and gripped jamies good hand with his own squeeze all ye like lad he said divested of the bearskin and with his grizzled locks neatly clubbed and laced back macrannoch was no longer the intimidating wildman of the forest but appeared as a soberly clad man of late middle age with a neatly trimmed spadebeard and a military bearing nervous at what i was about to attempt i found his solid presence comforting i drew a deep breath and prayed for detachment it was a long horrible nervewracking job though not without its fascination some parts such as the splinting of the two fingers with simple fractures went quite easily others did not jamie did scream loudly when i set his middle finger exerting the considerable force necessary to draw the ends of splintered bone back through the skin i hesitated for an instant unnerved but go on lass sir marcus said with quiet urgency i remembered suddenly what jamie had said to me the night jennys baby was born i can bear pain myself but i could not bear yours that would take more strength than i have he was right it did take strength i hoped that each of us had enough jamies face was turned away from me but i could see the jaw muscles bunch as he clenched his teeth harder on the leather strip i clenched my own teeth and did go on the sharp bone end slowly disappeared back through the skin and the finger straightened with agonizing reluctance leaving us both trembling as i worked i began to lose consciousness of anything outside the job i was doing jamie groaned occasionally and we had to stop twice briefly in order for him to be sick retching up mostly whisky as he had taken little food in prison for the most part though he kept up a low constant muttering in gaelic forehead pressed hard against sir marcuss knees i couldnt tell through the leather gag whether he was cursing or praying all five fingers eventually lay straight as new pins stiff as sticks in their bandaged splints i was afraid of infection particularly from the torn middle finger but otherwise was fairly sure they would heal well by good luck only the one joint had been badly damaged it would likely leave him with a stiff ring finger but the others might function normally in time there was nothing i could do about the cracked metacarpal bones or the puncture wound except apply an antiseptic wash and a poultice and pray against a tetanus infection i stepped back shaking in every limb from the strain of the night my bodice soaked with sweat from the fires heat at my back lady annabelle was at my side at once guiding me to a chair and pressing a cup of tea laced with whisky into my shaking hands sir marcus as good an operatingroom assistant as any physician could have was unfastening jamies captive arm and rubbing the marks where the strap had bitten deep into straining flesh the older mans hand was red i saw where jamie had gripped it i was not aware of having nodded off but suddenly jerked my head snapping on my neck lady annabelle was urging me upward soft hand under my elbow come along my dear youre all in you must have your own hurts seen to and sleep a bit i shook her off as politely as possible no i cant i must finish my words trailed off into the fuzziness of my mind as sir marcus smoothly took the vinegar bottle and rag from my hand ill take care of the rest he said ive some experience wi field dressing ye understand flipping back the blankets he began to swab the blood from the whip cuts moving with a brisk gentleness that was impressive catching my eye he grinned beard tilted jauntily ive cleansed a good many stripes in my time he said and applied a few too these are naught lass theyll heal in a few days knowing he was right i walked up to the head of the cot jamie was awake grimacing slightly at the sting of the antiseptic solution on the raw cuts but his eyelids were heavy and the blue eyes darkened with pain and weariness go and sleep sassenach ill do whether he would or not i didnt know it was clear however that i wouldnt do or not for much longer i was swaying with exhaustion and the scratches on my legs were beginning to burn and ache absalom had cleansed them for me at the cottage but they needed salving i nodded numbly and turned in response to lady annabelles gently insistent pressure on my elbow halfway up the stairs i remembered that i had forgotten to tell sir marcus how to bandage the cuts the deep wounds over the shoulders would have to be bound and padded to allow for wearing a shirt over them when we made our escape but the lighter lashmarks should be left in the open air to scab over i took a quick look at the guestroom lady annabelle showed me then excused myself with a word and stumbled back down the stairs toward the drawing room i paused in the shadowed doorway lady annabelle behind me jamies eyes were closed apparently he had fallen into a doze brought on by whisky and fatigue the blankets were thrown back rendered unnecessary by the heat of the fire sir marcus casually rested a hand on jamies bare rump as he reached across the bed for a rag the effect was electric jamies back arched sharply the muscles of his buttocks clenched tightly and he let out an involuntary sound of protest flinging himself backward in spite of the shattered ribs to glare up at sir marcus with startled dazed eyes startled himself sir marcus stood stockstill for a second then leaned forward and took jamie by the arm gently settling him facedown once more thoughtfully he drew a finger very gingerly across jamies flesh he rubbed his fingers together leaving an oily sheen visible in the firelight oh he said matteroffactly the old soldier drew the blanket up to jamies waist and i saw the tense shoulders relax slightly under their dressing sir marcus seated himself companionably near jamies head and poured another pair of whiskies at least he had the consideration to grease ye a bit beforehand he observed handing one beaker to jamie who heaved himself laboriously up on his elbows to accept it aye well i dinna think it was so much for my convenience he said dryly sir marcus took a gulp of his drink and smacked his lips meditatively there was no sound for a moment save the crackle of flames but neither lady annabelle nor i made any motion to enter the room if its any comfort to ye sir marcus said suddenly eyes fixed on the decanter hes dead youre sure jamies tone was unreadable i dinna see how anybody could live after bein trampled flat by thirty halfton beasts he peeked out into the corridor to see what was causin the noise then tried to go back when he saw a horn caught him by the sleeve and pulled him out and i saw him go down next to the wall sir fletcher an i were on the stair keepin out o the way o course sir fletcher was rare excited and sent some men after im but they couldna get anywhere near with all the horns pokin and beasts shovin and the torches shook down from the wall wi the ruckus christ man ye should ha seen it sir marcus hooted at the memory clutching the decanter by the neck your wifes a rare lass and no mistake lad snorting he poured out another glass and gulped choking a bit as the laugh interfered with the swallow anyway he resumed pounding himself on the chest by the time wed cleared the cattle out there was no much left but a rag doll rolled in blood sir fletchers men carried him awa but if he was still livin then he didna last long a bit more lad aye thanks there was a short silence broken by jamie no i canna say its much comfort to me but thank ye for tellin me sir marcus looked at him shrewdly mmphm yere no goin to forget it he said abruptly dont bother to try if ye can let it heal like the rest o your wounds dont pick at it and itll mend clean the old warrior held up a knotted forearm from which the sleeve had been pushed back during his ministrations to show the scar of a jagged tear running from elbow to wrist scars are nothin to trouble ye aye well some scars maybe apparently reminded of something jamie struggled to turn onto his side sir marcus set down his glass with an exclamation here lad be careful yell get a ribend through the lung next thing he helped jamie balance on his right elbow wadding a blanket behind to prop him there i need a wee knife said jamie breathing heavily a sharp one if its handy without question sir marcus lumbered to the gleaming french walnut sideboard and rummaged through the drawers with a prodigious clatter emerging at last with a pearlhandled fruit knife he thrust it into jamies sound left hand and sat down again with a grunt resuming his glass ye dont think ye have enough scars he inquired going to add a few more just one jamie balanced precariously on one elbow chin pressed on his chest as he awkwardly aimed the razorsharp knife under his left breast sir marcuss hand shot out a bit unsteadily and gripped jamies wrist best let me help ye man yell fall on it in a moment after a moments pause jamie reluctantly surrendered the knife and lay back against the wadded blanket he touched his chest an inch or two below the nipple there sir marcus reached to the sideboard and snagged a lamp setting it on the stool he had vacated at this distance i couldnt see what he was peering at it looked like a small red burn roughly circular in shape he took another deliberate pull at his whisky glass then set it down next to the lamp and pressed the tip of the knife against jamies chest i must have made an involuntary movement because the lady annabelle clutched my sleeve with a murmured caution the knife point pressed in and twisted suddenly flicking away in the motion one uses to cut a bad spot out of a ripe peach jamie grunted once and a thin stream of red ran down the slope of his belly to stain the blanket he rolled onto his stomach stanching the wound against the mattress sir marcus laid down the fruit knife as soon as yere able man he advised take your wife to bed and let her comfort ye women like to do that he said grinning toward the shadowed doorway god knows why lady annabelle said softly come away now dear hes better alone for a bit i decided that sir marcus could manage the bandaging by himself and stumbled after her up the narrow stair to my room i woke with a start from a dream of endless winding stairs with horror lurking at the bottom tiredness dragged at my back and my legs ached but i sat up in my borrowed nightdress and groped for the candle and flintbox i felt uneasy so far from jamie what if he needed me worse what if the english did come while he was alone below unarmed i pressed my face against the cold casement reassured by the steady hiss of snow against the panes while the storm continued we were likely safe i pulled on a bedgown and picking up candle and dirk made my way to the stair the house was quiet save for the fires crackle jamie was asleep or at least had his eyes closed face turned to the fire i sat down on the hearthrug quietly so as not to wake him this was the first time we had been alone together since those few desperate minutes in the dungeon of wentworth prison it felt as though that were many years ago i studied jamie carefully as though inspecting a stranger he seemed not too bad physically all things considered but i worried nonetheless he had had enough whisky during the surgery to fell a draft horse and a good bit of it was plainly still inside him despite the retching jamie was not my first hero the men moved too quickly through the field hospital as a rule for the nurses to become well acquainted with them but now and again you would see a man who talked too little or joked too much who held himself more stiffly than pain and loneliness would account for and i knew roughly what could be done for them if there was time and if they were the kind who talked to keep the dark at bay you sat with them and listened if they were silent you touched them often in passing and watched for the unguarded moment when you might draw them outside of themselves and hold them while they exorcised their demons if there was time and if there wasnt then you jabbed them with morphine and hoped they would manage to find someone else to listen while you passed on to a man whose wounds were visible jamie would talk to someone sooner or later there was time but i hoped it wouldnt be me he was uncovered to the waist and i leaned forward to examine his back it was a remarkable sight barely a hands thickness separated the welted cuts inflicted with a regularity that boggled the mind he must have stood like a guardsman while it was done i stole a quick glance at his wrists unmarked he had kept his word then not to struggle and had stood unmoving through the ordeal paying the ransom agreed on for my life i rubbed my eyes on my sleeve he wouldnt thank me i thought for blubbering over his prostrate form i shifted my weight with a soft rustle of skirts he opened his eyes at the sound but did not seem particularly haunted he gave me a smile faint and tired but a real one i opened my mouth and suddenly realized i had no idea what to say to him thanks were impossible how do you feel was ridiculous obviously he felt like hell while i considered he spoke first claire are you all right love am i all right my god jamie tears stung my eyelids and i blinked hard sniffing he raised his good hand slowly as though it were weighted with chains and stroked my hair he drew me toward him but i pulled away conscious for the first time what i must look like face scratched and covered with tree sap hair stiff with blotches of various unmentionable substances come here he said i want to hold ye a moment but im covered with blood and vomit i protested making a vain effort to tidy my hair he wheezed the faint exhalation that was all his broken ribs would permit in the way of laughter mother of god sassenach its my blood and my vomit come here his arm was comforting around my shoulders i rested my head on the pillow next to his and we sat in silence by the fire drawing strength and peace from one another his fingers gently touched the small wound under my jaw i did not think ever to see ye again sassenach his voice was low and a bit hoarse from whisky and screaming im glad youre here i sat up not see me again why did you think i wouldnt get you out he smiled onesided weel no i didnt expect ye would i thought if i said so though ye might get stubborn and refuse to go me get stubborn i said indignantly look whos talking there was a pause which grew slightly awkward there were things i should ask necessary from the medical point of view but rather touchy from the personal aspect finally i settled for how do you feel his eyes were closed shadowed and sunken in the candlelight but the lines of the broad back were tense under the bandages the wide bruised mouth twitched somewhere between a smile and a grimace i dont know sassenach ive never felt like this i seem to want to do a number of things all at once but my minds at war wi me and my bodys turned traitor i want to get out of here at once and run as fast and as far as i can i want to hit someone god i want to hit someone i want to burn wentworth prison to the ground i want to sleep stone doesnt burn i said practically maybe youd better sleep instead his good hand groped for mine and found it and the mouth relaxed somewhat though his eyes stayed closed i want to hold you hard to me and kiss you and never let you go i want to take you to my bed and use you like a whore til i forget that i exist and i want to put my head in your lap and weep like a child the mouth turned up at one corner and a blue eye opened slitwise unfortunately he said i cant do any but the last of those without fainting or being sick again well then i suppose youll just have to settle for that and put the rest under the heading of future business i said laughing a little it took a bit of shifting and he nearly was sick again but at last i was seated on his cot my back against the wall and his head resting on my thigh what was it sir marcus cut from your breast i asked a brand i said softly as he gave me no reply the bright head moved slightly in affirmation a signet with his initials jamie laughed shortly its enough ill carry his marks for the rest of my life without letting him sign me like a bloody painting his head lay heavy on my thigh and his breathing eased at last in drowsy exhalations the white bandages on his hand were ghostly against the dark blanket i gently traced a burn mark on his shoulder gleaming faintly with sweet oil jamie mmm are you badly hurt awake he glanced from his bandaged hand to my face his eyes closed and he began to shake alarmed i thought i had triggered some unbearable memory until i realized that he was laughing hard enough to force tears from the corners of his eyes sassenach he said at length gasping ive maybe six square inches of skin left that are not bruised burned or cut am i hurt and he shook again making the felted mattress rustle and squeak somewhat crossly i said i meant but he stopped me by putting his good hand over mine and bringing it to his lips i know what ye meant sassenach he said turning his head to look up at me never worry the six inches that are left are all between my legs i appreciated the effort it took to make the joke feeble as it was i slapped his mouth lightly youre drunk james fraser i said i paused a moment six eh aye well maybe seven then oh god sassenach dinna make me laugh again my ribs wont stand it i wiped his eyes with a fold of my skirt and fed him a sip of water holding his head up with my knee that isnt what i meant anyway i said serious then he reached for my hand again and squeezed it i know he said ye needna be delicate about it he drew a cautious breath and winced at the results i was right it did hurt less than flogging he closed his eyes but it was much less enjoyable a quick flash of bitter humor stirred one corner of his mouth at least ill not be costive for a bit i flinched and he gritted his teeth breathing in short reedy gasps im sorry sassenach i didna think id mind it so much what you mean that its all right im not damaged i made an effort to keep my own voice steady and matteroffact you dont have to tell me about it if you dont want to if it might ease you though my voice trailed off in embarrassed silence i dont want to his voice was suddenly bitter and emphatic i dont want ever to think about it again but short of cutting my throat i think i have not got a choice about it nay lass i dinna want to tell ye about it any more than ye want to hear it but i think i am going to have to drag it all out before it chokes me the words came out now in a burst of bitterness he wanted me to crawl and beg and by christ i did so i told ye once sassenach ye can break anyone if youre willing to hurt them enough well he was willing he made me crawl and he made me beg he made me do worse things than that and before the end he made me want verra badly to be dead he was silent for a long moment looking into the fire then heaved a deep sigh grimacing at the pain i wish ye could ease me sassenach i do wish it most fervently for ive little of ease in me now but its not like a poisoned thorn where if ye found the right grip ye could draw it clean out his good hand rested on my knee he flexed the fingers and spread them flat ruddy in the firelight its not even like a brokenness anywhere if ye could mend it bit by bit like ye did my hand id stand the pain gladly he bunched the fingers into a fist and rested it on my leg frowning at it its difficult to explain its its like i think its as though everyone has a small place inside themselves maybe a private bit that they keep to themselves its like a little fortress where the most private part of you lives maybe its your soul maybe just that bit that makes you yourself and not anyone else his tongue probed his swollen lip unconsciously as he thought you dont show that bit of yourself to anyone usually unless sometimes to someone that ye love greatly the hand relaxed curling around my knee jamies eyes were closed again lids sealed against the light now its like like my own fortress has been blown up with gunpowder theres nothing left of it but ashes and a smoking rooftree and the little naked thing that lived there once is out in the open squeaking and whimpering in fear tryin to hide itself under a blade of grass or a bit o leaf but but not makin mmuch of a job of it his voice broke and he turned his head so that his face was hidden in my skirt helpless i could do nothing but stroke his hair he suddenly raised his head face strained as though it would break apart along the seams of the bones ive been close to death a few times claire but ive never really wanted to die this time i did i his voice cracked and he stopped speaking clutching my knee hard when he spoke again his voice was high and oddly breathless as though he had been running a long way claire will you i just claire hold on to me if i start to shake again now i canna stop it claire hold me he was in fact beginning to tremble violently the shivering making him moan as it caught the splintered ribs i was afraid to hurt him but more afraid to let the shaking go on i crouched over him wrapped my arms around his shoulders and held on as tightly as i could rocking to and fro as though the comforting rhythm might break the racking spasms i got one hand on the back of his neck and dug my fingers deep into the pillared muscles willing the clenching to relax as i massaged the deep groove at the base of the skull finally the trembling eased and his head fell forward onto my thigh exhausted im sorry he said a minute later in his normal voice i didna mean to go on so the truth is i do hurt verra bad and i am most awfully damn drunk im no in much control of mysel for a scot to admit even privately to being drunk was some indication i thought of just how badly he did hurt you need sleep i said softly still rubbing the back of his neck you need it badly i used my fingers as best i could gentling and pressing as old alec had showed me and managed to ease him back into drowsiness im cold he murmured there was a good fire and several blankets on the bed but his fingers were chilly to the touch youre in shock i said practically youve lost the hell of a lot of blood i looked around but macrannochs and servants alike had all disappeared to their own beds murtagh i assumed was still out in the snow keeping an eye out in the direction of wentworth in case of pursuit with a mental shrug for anyones opinion of the proprieties i stood up stripped off the nightdress and crawled under the blankets as gently as possible i eased against him giving him my warmth he turned his face into my shoulder like a small boy i stroked his hair gentling him rubbing the ridged columns of muscle at the back of his neck avoiding the raw places lay your head then man i said remembering jenny and her boy jamie gave a small grunt of amusement thats what my mother used to say to me he murmured when i was a bairn sassenach he said against my shoulder a moment later mm who in gods name is john wayne you are i said go to sleep chapter escape his color was better in the morning though the bruises had darkened through the night and now mottled a good part of his face he sighed deeply then stiffened with a groan and let his breath out much more cautiously how do you feel i laid a hand on his head cool and damp no fever thank god he grimaced eyes still closed sassenach if ive got one it hurts he extended his good hand groping help me up im stiff as pudding the snow stopped at midmorning the sky was still grey as wool threatening further flurries but the threat of search from wentworth was greater yet so we set out from eldridge manor just before noon heavily cloaked against the weather murtagh and jamie bristled with arms beneath their cloaks i carried nothing but my dagger and that well hidden much against my own will i was to pose as a kidnapped english hostage should the worst happen but theyve seen me at the prison i had argued sir fletcher already knows who i am aye murtagh was carefully loading the pistols an array of balls wadding powder patches rods and pouches neatly spread on lady annabelles polished table but looked up to nail me with a black glance thats just the point lass we must keep ye out o wentworth no matter what do no one any good to have ye in there along wi us he rammed a short rod down the mouth of a scrollbutted dag punching the wad into place with hard economical strokes sir fletcher willna be doin his own huntin not on a day like this any redcoats we meet will likely not know ye if were found out ye mun say we forced ye along wi us unwillin and convince the redcoats yeve nothin to do wi a pair o scottish scalawags like me an yon ragtag he nodded at jamie balancing gingerly on a stool with a bowl of warm bread and milk sir marcus and i had padded jamies hips and thighs as thickly as we could with linen bandages under a pair of worn breeches and hose dark in color to hide any telltale blood spots that might seep through lady annabelle had split one of her husbands shirts down the back to accommodate the breadth of jamies shoulders and the thickness of the bandage across them even so the shirt would not meet across the front and the ends of the strapping around his chest peeked through he had refused to comb his hair on grounds that even his scalp was sore and he looked a wild and woolly sight red spikes sticking up above a swollen purple face with one eye squeezed disreputably shut if yere taken sir marcus chipped in tell them yere a guest of mine kidnapped while riding near the estate make them bring ye to eldridge for me to identify that should convince em well tell em youre a friend of annabelles from london and then get you safely out of here before sir fletcher comes round to offer his regards annabelle added practically sir marcus had offered us hector and absalom as escorts but murtagh pointed out that this would certainly implicate eldridge should we meet any english soldiers so there were only the three of us bundled against the cold on the road toward dingwall i carried a fat purse and a note from the master of eldridge one or both of which should insure our passage across the channel it was hard going through the snow less than a foot deep the treacherous white stuff hid rocks holes and other obstacles making footing for the horses slippery and dangerous clods of snow and mud flew up with each step spattering bellies and hocks and clouds of horsebreath vanished steaming into the frozen air murtagh led the way following the faint depression that marked the road i rode beside jamie to help if he should lose consciousness though he was at his own insistence tied to his horse only his left hand was free resting on the pistol looped to the saddle bow concealed under his cloak we passed a few scattered bothies smoke rising from the thatched roofs but the inhabitants and their beasts seemed all within secured against the cold here and there a lone man passed from cot to shed carrying buckets or hay but the road was deserted for the most part two miles from eldridge we passed under the shadow of wentworth castle a grim bulk set in the hillside the road was trampled here traffic in and out did not cease even in the worst of weathers our passage had been timed to coincide with the midday meal in hopes that the sentries would be immersed in their pasties and ale we plodded slowly past the short road that led to the gate just a party of travelers with the illluck to be abroad on such a miserable day once past the prison we paused to rest the horses for a moment in the shelter of a small pine grove murtagh bent to peer under the slouch hat that masked jamies telltale hair all right lad yere quiet jamie lifted his head his face was pale and trickles of sweat ran down his neck despite the icy wind but he managed a halfhearted grin ill do how do you feel i asked anxious he sat slumped in the saddle without much sign of his usual erect grace i got the other half of the grin ive been trying to decide which hurts worst my ribs my hand or my arse tryin to choose among them keeps my mind off my back he took a deep pull from the flask which sir marcus had thoughtfully provided shuddered and passed it to me it was a good deal better than the raw spirit i had drunk on the road to leoch but every bit as potent we rode on a small cheerful fire burning in my stomach the horses were laboring up a modest slope snow spurting from their hooves when i saw murtaghs head jerk up following the direction of his gaze i saw the redcoat soldiers four of them mounted at the top of the slope there was no help for it we had been seen and a shouted challenge echoed down the hill there was no place to run we were going to have to try to bluff it out without a backward glance murtagh spurred forward to meet them the corporal with the group was a middleaged career soldier erect in his winter greatcoat he bowed politely to me then turned his attention to jamie your pardon sir madame we have orders to stop all parties traveling this road to inquire for details of prisoners lately escaped from wentworth prison prisoners so i had managed to release more than jamie yesterday i was glad of it on various grounds for one they would dilute the search somewhat four against three was better odds than we might have expected jamie didnt reply but slouched farther forward letting his head loll i could see the gleam of his eyes beneath the hat brim he wasnt unconscious these must be men he knew his voice would be recognized murtagh was edging his horse forward between me and the soldiers aye the masters a bit the worse for illness sir as ye can see he said obsequiously tugging his forelock perhaps ye could point out the road toward ballagh to me im no convinced that were headed right i wondered what on earth he was up to until i caught his eye his glance flickered back and down then back to the soldier so fast that the soldier would assume him to have been listening with rapt attention all the time was jamie in danger of falling from the saddle pretending to adjust my bonnet i glanced casually over my shoulder in the direction he had indicated and nearly froze with shock jamie was sitting upright head bent to shadow his face but blood was dripping gently from the tip of the stirrup under his foot pocking the snow with gently steaming red pits murtagh pretending vast stupidity had succeeded in drawing the soldiers ahead to the crest of the hill so that they could point out that the road to dingwall was the only road in sight which ran down the other side of the hill it ran through ballagh and straight toward the coast still three miles away i slid hastily to the ground yanking feverishly at my horses girth strap floundering through the drifts i kicked enough snow under the belly of jamies horse to obliterate the telltale drops a quick look showed the soldiers apparently still engaged in argument with murtagh though one of them glanced down the hill at us as though to insure that we had not wandered off i gave a cheery wave then as soon as the soldier turned his head stooped and ripped off one of the three petticoats i was wearing i whipped jamies cloak aside and stuffed the wadded petticoat under his thigh ignoring his exclamation of pain the cloak flipped back in place just in time for me to dash back to my own horse and be discovered fiddling with the girth when murtagh and the englishmen arrived it seems to have worked its way loose i explained guilelessly batting my eyes at the nearest redcoat oh and why are you not helping the lady he said to jamie my husbands not well i said i can manage it myself thank you the corporal seemed interested sick eh whats the matter with you then he urged his beast forward staring closely under the slouch hat at jamies pale face dont look well ill say that much take your hat off fellow whats the matter with your face jamie shot him through the folds of his cloak the redcoat was no more than six feet away and he toppled sideways out of the saddle before the stain on his chest grew bigger than my hand murtagh had a pistol in each hand before the corporal hit the ground one bullet went wild as his horse shied away from the sudden noise and movement the second found its mark ripping through a soldiers upper arm leaving a tuft of shredded fabric flapping from a rapidly reddening sleeve the man kept his saddle though and was tugging at his saber onehanded as murtagh plunged beneath his cloak for fresh weapons one of the two remaining soldiers turned his horse slipping in the snow and spurred away back toward the prison presumably in search of help claire the shout came from above i looked up startled to see jamie waving after the fleeing figure stop him he had time to toss me a second pistol then turned back drawing his sword to meet the charge of the fourth soldier my horse was battletrained his ears were laid flat against his head and he stamped and pawed at the noise but he hadnt run at the sound of gunshots and he stood his ground as i groped for the saddle iron glad to be leaving the fight behind he dug in as soon as i was mounted and we made off at good speed after the fleeing figure the snow hampered our going nearly as much as his but mine was the better horse and we had the advantage of the rough path the soldiers flight had plowed through the fresh snow we gained slowly on him but i could see that it wouldnt be enough he had a rise ahead of him though if i cut to the right perhaps i could make better time on the flat and meet him coming down the other side i jerked the rein and leaned hard to keep my seat as the horse slithered into a messy turn found his feet and plunged ahead i didnt quite catch him up but i had cut the distance between us to no more than ten yards given unlimited distance i could likely catch him but i didnt have that luxury the prison wall loomed less than a mile ahead much closer and we would be seen from the walls i pulled up and slid off battletrained or not i didnt know what the horse would do if i fired a pistol from his back even if he stood like a statue i didnt think my own aim was up to it i knelt in the snow bracing my elbow on my knee the gun across my forearm as jamie had shown me brace it here aim there fire it here he had said i did much to my amazement i hit the fleeing horse it went into a skid went to one knee and rolled in a flurry of snow and legs my arm was numb from the pistols recoil i stood rubbing it watching the fallen soldier he was injured he struggled to rise then fell back in the snow his horse bleeding from the shoulder stumbled away reins dangling i didnt realize until later what i had been thinking but i knew when i approached him that i could not let him live near as we were to the prison and with other patrols out seeking escaped prisoners he was sure to be found before too long and if he were found alive he could not only describe us so much for our hostage story in that case but tell which way we were traveling we had still three miles to go to the coast two hours travel in the heavy snow and a boat to find once there i simply could not take the chance of allowing him to tell anyone about us he struggled to his elbows as i approached his eyes widened in surprise as he saw me then relaxed i was a woman he wasnt afraid of me a more experienced man might have been apprehensive my sex notwithstanding but this was a boy no more than sixteen i thought with a sense of sick shock his spotty cheeks still held the last round curves of childhood though his upper lip sported the fuzz of a hopeful mustache he opened his mouth but only groaned in pain he pressed his hand to his side and i could see blood soaking through his tunic and coat internal injuries then the horse must have rolled on him it was possible i thought that he would die in any case but that wasnt something i could count on the dirk in my right hand was hidden under my cloak i laid my left hand on his head just so i had touched the heads of hundreds of men comforting examining steadying them for whatever lay ahead and they had looked up at me much as this boy did with hope and trust i couldnt cut his throat i sank to my knees beside him and turned his head gently away from me ruperts techniques for swift killing had all assumed resistance there was no resistance as i bent his head forward as far as i could and plunged the dirk into his neck at the base of his skull i left him lying facedown in the snow and went to join the others our unwieldy cargo stowed under blankets on a bench below murtagh and i met on the cristabels deck to survey the stormtossed skies looks like a fair steady wind i said hopefully holding a wet finger aloft murtagh gloomily scanned the clouds hanging blackbellied over the harbor their freight of snow wastefully melting into the frigid waves aye well well hope for a smooth crossing if not well likely get there wi a corpse on our hands half an hour later launched on the choppy waters of the english channel i discovered what he had meant by this remark seasick i said incredulously scotsmen arent seasick murtagh was testy then mayhap hes a redheided hottentot all i know is hes green as a rotten fish and pukin his guts out are ye goin to come down and help me stop him puttin his ribs out through his chest damn it i said to murtagh as we hung over the rail for fresh air during a brief hiatus in the unpleasantness belowdecks if he knows hes seasick why in the name of god did he insist on a boat the basilisk stare was unwinking because he knows bluidy well wed never make it overland wi him in the state hes in and hed no stay at eldridge for fear o bringin the english down on macrannoch so hes going to kill himself quietly at sea instead i said bitterly aye he figures this way hell only kill himself and no take anyone else along wi him unselfish see nothin quiet about it though added murtagh heading for the companionway in response to unmistakable sounds from below congratulations i said to jamie an hour or two later pushing dank wisps away from my cheeks and forehead i believe youre going to make medical history by being the only documented person ever actually to die of seasickness oh good he mumbled into the wreck of pillows and blankets id hate to think it was all a waste he heaved himself suddenly to one side god here it comes again murtagh and i sprang once more to our stations the job of holding a large man immobile while he succumbs to merciless spasms of retching is not one for the weak afterward i took his pulse yet again and rested a hand briefly on the clammy forehead murtagh read my face and followed me unspeaking up the gangway to the top deck hes no doin verra weel is he he said quietly i dont know i said helplessly shaking out my sweatdrenched hair in the sharp wind ive honestly never heard of anyone dying of seasickness but hes bringing up blood now the little mans hands tightened on the rail knuckles knifing through the sunspeckled skin i dont know if hes damaged himself internally with the sharp rib ends or if its just that his stomach is raw with the vomiting either way its not a good sign and his pulse is much weaker and irregular its a strain on his heart you know hes a heart like a lion it was quietly said and i wasnt sure id heard it at first it might only have been the salt wind making the tears stand in his eyes he turned abruptly to me and a heid like an ox have ye any o that laudanum left that lady annabelle gave ye yes all of it he wouldnt take it doesnt want to sleep he said aye well for most folk what they want and what they get are no the same thing i dinna see why he should be any different come on i followed him anxiously back belowdecks i dont think he can keep it down leave that to me get the bottle and help me sit him up jamie was halfunconscious as it was an unwieldy burden who protested being manhandled upright against the bulkhead im going to die he said weakly but precisely and the sooner the better go away and let me do it in peace taking firm hold of jamies blazing hair murtagh forced his head up and applied the flask to his lips swallow this me bonny wee dormouse or ill break yer neck and forbye yell keep it down too im goin to hold shut yer nose and yer mouth if ye bring it up it comes out yer ears by the concerted force of our wills we transferred the contents of the flask slowly but inexorably into the young laird of lallybroch choking and gagging jamie manfully drank as much as he could manage before subsiding greenfaced and gasping against the bulkhead murtagh forestalled each threatened explosion of nausea by vicious nosepinching an expedient not uniformly successful but one which allowed a gradual accumulation of the opiate in the patients bloodstream at length we laid him slack on the bed the vivid flames of hair brows and lashes the only color on the pillow murtagh came up beside me on deck a bit later look i said pointing the dim light of sunset shining in fugitive rays beneath the clouds gilded the rocks of the french coast ahead the master says well be ashore in three or four hours and not before time said my companion wiping lank brown hair out of his eyes he turned to me and gave me the closest thing i had ever seen to a smile on his dour countenance and so at length following the prostrate body of our charge laid on a board between two stout monks we passed through the looming gates of the abbey of ste anne de beaupré chapter the abbey the abbey was an enormous twelfthcentury edifice walled to resist both the smashing of sea storms and the onslaughts of landbased invaders now in more peaceful times its gates stood open to allow easy traffic with the nearby village and the small stone cells of its guest wing had been softened by the addition of tapestries and comfortable furniture i rose from the padded chair in my own chamber not sure exactly how one greeted an abbot did one kneel and kiss his ring or was that only for popes i settled for a respectful curtsy jamies slanted cateyes did come from the fraser side likewise the solid jaw though the one facing me was somewhat obscured by black beard abbot alexander had his nephews wide mouth as well though he looked as though he smiled somewhat less with it the slanted blue eyes remained cool and speculative as he greeted me with a pleasant warm smile he was a good deal shorter than jamie about my height and stocky he wore the robe of a priest but walked with a warriors stride i thought it likely he had been both in his time you are welcome ma nièce he said inclining his head i was a little startled at the greeting but bowed back im grateful for your hospitality i said meaning it have have you seen jamie the monks had taken jamie away to be bathed a process in which i thought i had better not assist the abbot nodded oh aye he said a faint scots accent showing through the cultured english ive seen him ive set brother ambrose to tend his wounds i must have looked dubious at this for he said a bit dryly do not worry madame brother ambrose is most competent he looked me over with an air of frank appraisal disturbingly like that of his nephew murtagh said that you are an accomplished physician yourself i am i said bluntly this provoked a real smile i see that you do not suffer from the sin of false modesty he observed i have others i said smiling back so do we all he said brother ambrose will be eager to converse with you im sure has murtagh told you what happened i asked hesitantly the wide mouth tightened he has so far as he knows what happened he waited as though expecting further contributions from me but i stayed silent it was clear that he would have liked to ask questions but he was kind enough not to press me instead he raised his hand in a gesture of benediction and dismissal you are welcome he said once more i will send a serving brother to bring you some food he looked me over once more and some facilities for washing he made the sign of the cross over me in farewell or possibly as an exorcism of filth and left in a swirl of brown skirts suddenly realizing how tired i was i sank down on the bed wondering whether i could stay awake long enough to both eat and wash i was still wondering when my head hit the pillow i was having a dreadful nightmare jamie was on the other side of a solid stone wall without a door i could hear him screaming over and over but couldnt reach him i pounded desperately on the wall only to see my hands sink into the stone as if it were water ouch i sat up in the narrow cot clutching the hand i had smashed against the unyielding wall next to my bed i rocked back and forth squeezing the throbbing hand between my thighs then realized that the screaming was still going on it stopped abruptly as i ran into the hall the door to jamies room was open flickering lamplight flooding the corridor a monk i had not seen before was with jamie holding him tightly a seepage of fresh blood stained the bandages on jamies back and his shoulders shook as though with chill a nightmare the monk said in explanation seeing me in the doorway he relinquished jamie into my arms and went to the table for a cloth and the water jug jamie was still trembling and his face was glossy with sweat his eyes were closed and he breathed heavily with a hoarse gasping sound the monk sat down beside me and began to swab his face with a gentle hand smoothing the heavy wet hair away from his temples you would be his wife of course he said to me i think hell be better presently the trembling did begin to ease within a minute or two and jamie opened his eyes with a sigh im all right he said claire im all right now but for gods sake get rid of that stink it was only then that i consciously noticed the scent in the room a light spicy floral smell so common a perfume that i had thought nothing of it lavender a scent for soaps and toilet waters i had last smelled it in the dungeons of wentworth prison where it anointed the linen or the person of captain jonathan randall the source of the scent was a small metal cup filled with herbscented oil suspended from a heavy rosebossed iron base and hung over a candle flame meant to soothe the mind its effects were plainly not as intended jamie was breathing more easily sitting up by himself and holding the cup of water the monk had given him but his face was still white and the corner of his mouth twitched uneasily i nodded at the franciscan to do as he said and the monk quickly muffled the hot cup of oil in a folded towel then carried it away down the hall jamie heaved a long sigh of relief then winced ribs hurting youve opened up your back a bit i said turning him slightly to get at the bandages not bad though i know i must have rolled onto my back in my sleep the thick wedge of folded blanket meant to keep him propped on one side had slipped to the floor i retrieved it and laid it on the bed beside him thats what made me dream i think i dreamt of being flogged he shuddered took a sip of the water then handed me the cup i need something a bit stronger if its handy as though on cue our helpful visitor came through the door with a jug of wine in one hand and a small flask of poppy syrup in the other alcohol or opium he asked jamie with a smile holding up the two flasks you may have your choice of oblivions ill have the wine if ye please ive had enough of dreams for one night jamie said with a lopsided answering smile he drank the wine slowly as the franciscan helped me to change the stained bandages smoothing fresh marigold ointment over the wounds not until i had resettled jamie for sleep back firmly propped and coverlet drawn up did the visitor turn to go passing the bed he bent over jamie and sketched the sign of the cross above his head rest well he said thank ye father jamie answered drowsily clearly halfasleep already seeing that jamie would likely not need me now until morning i touched him on the shoulder in farewell and followed the visitor out into the corridor thank you i said im most grateful for your help the monk waved a graceful hand dismissing my thanks i was pleased to be able to assist you he said and i noticed that he spoke excellent english though with a faint french accent i was passing through the guest wing on my way to the chapel of st giles when i heard the screaming i winced at the memory of that screaming hoarse and dreadful and hoped i would not hear it again glancing at the window at the end of the corridor i saw no sign of dawn behind the shutter to the chapel i said surprised but i thought matins were sung in the main church and its surely a bit early in any case the franciscan smiled he was fairly young perhaps in his early thirties but his silky brown hair was threaded with grey it was short and neatly tonsured and he had a brown beard finely trimmed to a point that just skimmed the deep rolled collar of his habit very early for matins he agreed i was on my way to the chapel because it is my turn for the perpetual adoration of the blessed sacrament at this hour he glanced back into jamies room where a clock candle marked the time as half past two im very late he said brother bartolome will be wanting his bed raising his hand he quickly blessed me turned on a sandaled heel and was through the swinging door at the end of the corridor before i could muster wits enough to ask his name i stepped into the room and bent to check jamie he was asleep again breathing lightly with a slight frown creasing his brow experimentally i ran my hand lightly over his hair the frown eased a bit and then resumed i sighed and tucked the blankets more securely around him i felt much better in the morning but jamie was holloweyed and queasy after the broken night he emphatically rejected any suggestion of caudle or broth for breakfast and snapped irritably at me when i tried to check the dressings on his hand for christs sake claire will ye no leave me alone i dinna want to be poked at any more he yanked his hand away scowling i turned away without speaking and went to busy myself with tidying the small pots and packets of medicines on the side table i arranged them into small groups sorted by function marigold ointment and poplar balm for soothing willowbark cherry bark and chamomile for teas st johns wort garlic and yarrow for disinfection claire i turned back to find him sitting on the bed looking at me with a shamefaced smile im sorry sassenach my bowels are griping and ive a damn evil temper this morning but ive no call to snarl at ye dye forgive me i crossed to him swiftly and hugged him lightly you know theres nothing to forgive but what do you mean your bowels are griping not for the first time i reflected that intimacy and romance are not synonymous he grimaced bending forward slightly and folding his arms over his abdomen it means he said that id like ye to leave me to myself for a bit if ye dinna mind i hastily complied with his request and went to find my own breakfast returning from the refectory a bit later i spotted a trim figure in the black robes of a franciscan crossing the courtyard toward the cloister i hurried to catch up with him father i called and he turned smiling when he saw me good morning he said madame fraser is that the name and how is your husband this morning better i said hoping it was true i wanted to thank you again for last night you left before i could even ask your name clear hazel eyes sparkled as he bowed to me hand over his heart françois anselm mericoeur darmagnac madame he said or so i was born known now only as father anselm anselm of the merry heart i asked smiling he shrugged a completely gallic gesture unchanged for centuries one tries he said with an ironic twist of the mouth i dont wish to keep you i said glancing toward the cloister i only wanted to thank you for your help you do not detain me in the least madame i was delaying going to my work in fact indulging most sinfully in idleness what is your work i asked intrigued plainly this man was a visitor to the monastery his black franciscan robes conspicuous as an inkblot among the brown of the benedictines there were several such visitors or so brother polydore one of the serving brothers had told me most of them were scholars here to consult the works stored in the abbeys renowned library anselm it seemed was one of these he was as he had been for several months engaged in the translation of several works by herodotus have you seen the library he asked come then he said seeing me shake my head it is really most impressive and i am sure the abbot your uncle would have no objection i was both curious to see the library and reluctant to go back at once to the isolation of the guest wing so i followed him without hesitation the library was beautiful highroofed with soaring gothic columns that joined in ogives in the multichambered roof fulllength windows filled the spaces between columns letting an abundance of light into the library most were of clear glass but some had deceptively simplelooking stainedglass parables tiptoeing past the bent forms of studying monks i paused to admire one of the flight into egypt some of the bookshelves looked like those i was used to the books nestling side by side other shelves held the books laid flat to protect the ancient covers there was even one glassfronted bookshelf holding a number of rolled parchments overall the library held a hushed exultation as though the cherished volumes were all singing soundlessly within their covers i left the library feeling soothed and strolled slowly across the main courtyard with father anselm i tried again to thank him for his help the night before but he shrugged off my thanks think nothing of it my child i hope that your husband is better today so do i i said not wanting to dwell on that subject i asked what exactly is perpetual adoration you said that was where you were going last night you are not a catholic he asked in surprise ah but i forgot you are english so of course i suppose you would be protestant im not sure that im either one in terms of belief i said but technically at least i suppose i am a catholic technically the smooth eyebrows shot up in astonishment i hesitated cautious after my experiences with father bain but this man did not seem the sort to start waving crucifixes in my face well i said bending to pull a small weed from between the paving stones i was baptized as a catholic but my parents died when i was five and i went to live with an uncle uncle lambert was i paused recalling uncle lamberts voracious appetite for knowledge and that cheerfully objective cynicism that regarded all religion merely as one of the earmarks by which a culture could be cataloged well he was everything and nothing i suppose in terms of faith i concluded knew them all believed in none so nothing further was ever done about my religious training and my first husband was catholic but not very observant im afraid so i suppose im really rather a heathen i eyed him warily but rather than being shocked by this revelation he laughed heartily everything and nothing he said savoring the phrase i like that very much but as for you i am afraid not once a member of holy mother church you are eternally marked as her child however little you know about your faith you are as much a catholic as our holy father the pope he glanced at the sky it was cloudy but the leaves of the alder bushes near the church hung still the wind has dropped i was going for a short stroll to clear my brain in the fresh air why do you not accompany me you need air and exercise and i can perhaps make the occasion spiritually beneficial as well by enlightening you as to the ritual of perpetual adoration as we go three birds with one stone eh i said dryly but the prospect of air if not light was enticing and i went to fetch my cloak without demur with a glance at the form within head bent in prayer anselm led me past the quiet darkness of the chapel entrance and down the cloister out to the edge of the garden beyond the possibility of disturbing the monks within the chapel he said its a very simple idea you recall the bible and the story of gethsemane where our lord waited out the hours before his trial and crucifixion and his friends who should have borne him company all fell fast asleep oh i said understanding all at once and he said can you not watch with me one hour so thats what youre doing watching with him for that hour to make up for it i liked the idea and the darkness of the chapel suddenly seemed inhabited and comforting oui madame he agreed very simple we take it in turns to watch and the blessed sacrament on the altar here is never left alone isnt it difficult staying awake i asked curiously or do you always watch at night he nodded a light breeze lifting the silky brown hair the patch of his tonsure needed shaving short bristly hairs covered it like moss each watcher chooses the time that suits him best for me that is two oclock in the morning he glanced at me hesitating as though wondering how i would take what he was about to say for me in that moment he paused its as though time has stopped all the humors of the body all the blood and bile and vapors that make a man its as though just at once all of them are working in perfect harmony he smiled his teeth were slightly crooked the only defect in his otherwise perfect appearance or as though theyve stopped altogether i often wonder whether that moment is the same as the moment of birth or of death i know that its timing is different for each man or woman i suppose he added with a courteous nod to me but just then for that fraction of time it seems as though all things are possible you can look across the limitations of your own life and see that they are really nothing in that moment when time stops it is as though you know you could undertake any venture complete it and come back to yourself to find the world unchanged and everything just as you left it a moment before and its as though he hesitated for a moment carefully choosing words as though knowing that everything is possible suddenly nothing is necessary but do you actually do anything i asked er pray i mean i well he said slowly i sit and i look at him a wide smile stretched the finedrawn lips and he looks at me jamie was sitting up when i returned to the room and essayed a short trip up and down the hall leaning on my shoulder but the effort left him pale and sweating and he lay down without protest when i turned back the coverlet for him i offered him a little broth and milk but he shook his head wearily ive no appetite sassenach if i take anything i think i shall be sick again i didnt press the matter but took the broth away in silence at dinner i was more insistent and succeeded in persuading him to try a few spoonsful of soup he managed quite a bit of it but didnt manage to keep it down im sorry sassenach he said afterward im disgusting it doesnt matter jamie and you are not disgusting i set the basin outside the door and sat down beside him smoothing back the tumbled hair from his brow dont worry its only that your stomach is still irritated from the seasickness perhaps ive pushed you too fast to eat let it rest and heal he closed his eyes sighing under my hand ill be all right he said without interest what did ye do today sassenach he was obviously restless and uncomfortable but eased a bit as i told him about my explorations of the day the library the chapel the winepress and finally the herb garden where i had at last met the famous brother ambrose hes amazing i said enthusiastically oh but i forgot youve met him brother ambrose was tall even taller than jamie and cadaverous with the long drooping face of a basset hound and ten long skinny fingers every one of them bright green he seems to be able to make anything grow i said hes got all the normal herbs there and a greenhouse so tiny that he cant even stand up straight inside it with things that shouldnt grow at this season or shouldnt grow in this part of the world or just shouldnt grow not to mention the imported spices and drugs the mention of drugs reminded me of the night before and i glanced out the window the winter twilight set in early and it was already full dark outside the lanterns of the monks who tended the stables and outdoor work bobbing to and fro as they passed on their rounds its getting dark do you think you can sleep by yourself brother ambrose has a few things that might help his eyes were smudged with tiredness but he shook his head no sassenach i dinna want anything if i fall asleep no i think ill read for a bit anselm had brought him a selection of philosophical and historical works from the library and he stretched out a hand for a copy of tacitus that lay on the table you need sleep jamie i said gently watching him he opened the book before him propped on the pillow but continued to stare at the wall above it i didna tell ye what i dreamed he said suddenly you said you dreamed of being flogged i didnt like the look on his face already pale under the bruises it was lightly sheened with dampness thats right i could look up and see the ropes cutting into my wrists my hands had gone almost black and the rope scraped bone when i moved i had my face pressed against the post then i could feel the lead plummets at the ends of the lashes cutting through the flesh of my shoulders the lashes kept coming long past when they should have stopped and i realized that he didnt mean to stop the tips of the cords were biting out small chunks of my flesh the blood my blood was running down my sides and my back soaking into my kilt i was very cold then i looked up again and i could see that the flesh had begun to fall away from my hands and the bones of my fingers were scrabbling at the wood leaving long raw scratches behind the bones of my arms were bare and only the ropes were holding them together i think thats when i began to scream i could hear a strange rattling noise when he hit me and after a time i realized what it was hed stripped all the flesh off my bones and the plummets of the whip were rattling on my dry rib bones and i knew that i was dead but it didnt matter he would go on and on and it would never stop he would go on until i began to fall to pieces and crumble away from the post and it would never stop and i moved to take hold of him and make him hush but he had already stopped himself gripping the edge of the book with his good hand his teeth were set hard in the torn flesh of his lower lip jamie ill stay with you tonight i said i can lay a pallet on the floor no weak as he was there was no mistaking the basic stubbornness ill do best alone and im not sleepy now do ye go and find your own supper sassenach ill just read for a bit he bent his head over the page after a minute of helplessly watching him i did as he said and left i was becoming more and more worried by jamies condition the nausea lingered he ate almost nothing and what he did eat seldom stayed with him he grew paler and more listless showing little interest in anything he slept a great deal in the daytime because of sleeping so little at night still whatever his fears of dreaming he would not allow me to share his chamber so that his wakefulness need not impair my own rest not wishing to hover over him even if he would have allowed it i spent much of my time in the herbarium or the drying shed with brother ambrose or wandering idly through the abbeys grounds engaged in conversation with father anselm he took the opportunity to engage in a gentle catechism trying to instruct me in the basics of catholicism though i had assured him over and over of my basic agnosticism ma chère he said at last do you recall the conditions necessary for the commission of sin that i told you yesterday there was nothing wrong with my memory whatever my moral shortcomings might be first that it be wrong and secondly that you give full consent to it i parroted that you give full consent to it he repeated and that ma chère is the condition for grace to occur as well we were leaning on the fence of the abbey pigsty watching several large brown hogs huddling together in the weak winter sun he turned his head resting his face on his forearms folded on the fence rail i dont see how i can i protested surely grace is something you have or you dont i mean i hesitated not wishing to seem rude to you the thing on the altar in the chapel is god to me its a bit of bread no matter how lovely the holder its in he sighed with impatience and straightened up stretching his back i have observed on my way to my nightly watch that your husband does not sleep well he said and consequently neither do you since you are not asleep in any case i invite you to come with me tonight join me in the chapel for an hour i eyed him narrowly why he shrugged why not i had no difficulty in waking up for my appointment with anselm largely because i had not been asleep neither had jamie whenever i poked my head out into the corridor i could see the flicker of candlelight from the halfopen door of his room and hear the flip of pages and the occasional grunt of discomfort as he shifted his position unable to rest i had not bothered to undress and so was ready when a tap at my door announced anselms presence the monastery was quiet in the way that all large institutions grow quiet at night the rapid pulse of the days activities has dropped but the heartbeat goes on slower softer but unending there is always someone awake moving quietly through the halls keeping watch keeping things alive and now it was my turn to join the watch the chapel was dark except for the burning of the red sanctuary lamp and a few of the clear white votive candles flames rising straight in still air before the shadowed shrines of saints i followed anselm down the short center aisle genuflecting in his wake the slight figure of brother bartolome knelt toward the front head bowed he didnt turn at the faint noise of our entrance but stayed motionless bent in adoration the sacrament itself was almost obscured by the magnificence of its container the huge monstrance a sunburst of gold more than a foot across sat serenely on the altar guarding the humble bit of bread at its center feeling somewhat awkward i took the seat anselm indicated near the front of the chapel the seats ornately carved with angels flowers and demons folded up against the wooden panels of the backing to allow easy passage in and out i heard the faint creak of a lowered seat behind me as anselm found his place but what shall i do i had asked him voice lowered in respect of night and silence as we had approached the chapel nothing ma chère he had replied simply only be so i sat listening to my own breathing and the tiny sounds of a silent place the inaudible things normally hidden in other sounds the settling of stone the creak of wood the hissing of the tiny unquenchable flames a faint skitter of some small creature wandered from its place into the home of majesty it was a peaceful place i would grant anselm that in spite of my own fatigue and my worry over jamie i gradually felt myself relaxing the tightness of my mind gently unwinding like the relaxation of a clock spring strangely i didnt feel at all sleepy despite the lateness of the hour and the strains of the last few days and weeks after all i thought what were days and weeks in the presence of eternity and thats what this was to anselm and bartolome to ambrose to all the monks up to and including the formidable abbot alexander it was in a way a comforting idea if there was all the time in the world then the happenings of a given moment became less important i could see perhaps how one could draw back a little seek some respite in the contemplation of an endless being whatever one conceived its nature to be the red of the sanctuary lamp burned steadily reflected in the smooth gold the flames of the white candles before the statues of st giles and the blessed mother flickered and jumped occasionally as the burning wicks yielded an occasional imperfection a momentary sputter of wax or moisture but the red lamp burned serene with no unseemly waver to betray its light and if there was eternity or even the idea of it then perhaps anselm was right all things were possible and all love i wondered i had loved frank i still did and i loved jamie more than my own life but bound in the limits of time and flesh i could not keep them both beyond perhaps was there a place where time no longer existed or where it stopped anselm thought so a place where all things were possible and none were necessary and was there love there beyond the limits of flesh and time was all love possible was it necessary the voice of my thoughts seemed to be uncle lambs my family and all i knew of love as a child a man who had never spoken love to me who had never needed to for i knew he loved me as surely as i knew i lived for where all love is the speaking is unnecessary it is all it is undying and it is enough time passed without my awareness of it and i was startled by the sudden appearance of anselm before me coming through the small door near the altar surely he had been sitting behind me i glanced behind to see one of the young monks whose name i didnt know genuflecting near the rear entrance anselm bowed low before the altar then motioned to me with a nod toward the door you left i said once outside the chapel but i thought you werent supposed to leave the er the sacrament alone he smiled tranquilly i didnt ma chère you were there i repressed the urge to argue that i didnt count after all i supposed there was no such thing as a qualified official adorer you only had to be human and i imagined i was still that though i barely felt it at times jamies candle still burned as i passed his door and i caught the rustle of turning pages i would have stopped but anselm went on to leave me at the door of my own chamber i paused there to bid him good night and to thank him for taking me to the chapel it was restful i said struggling to find the right word he nodded watching me oui madame it is as i turned to go he said i told you that the blessed sacrament was not alone for you were there but what of you ma chère were you alone i stopped and looked at him for a moment before answering no i said i wasnt chapter to ransom a mans soul in the morning i went as usual to check jamie hoping that he had managed some breakfast just short of his room murtagh slid out of a wall alcove barring my way what is it i said abruptly whats wrong my heart began to beat faster and my palms were suddenly wet my panic must have been obvious for murtagh shook his head in reassurance nay hes all right he shrugged or as much all right as hes been he turned me with a light hand under the elbow and began to walk me back down the corridor i thought with a moments shock that this was the first time murtagh had ever deliberately touched me his hand on my arm was light and strong as a pelicans wing whats the matter with him i demanded the little mans seamed face was as expressionless as usual but the crinkled eyelids twitched at the corners he doesna want to see ye just yet he said i stopped dead and pulled my arm from his grasp why not i demanded murtagh hesitated as though choosing his words carefully weel its just hes decided as it would be best for ye to leave him here and go back to scotland he the rest of what he was saying was lost as i pushed my way rudely past him the heavy door swung shut with a soft thump behind me jamie was dozing facedown on the bed he was uncovered clad only in a novices short gown the charcoal brazier in the corner made the room comfortably warm if smoky he started violently when i touched him his eyes still glazed with sleep were sunk deep and his face was haunted by dreams i took his hand between both of mine but he wrenched it away with a look of neardespair he shut his eyes and buried his face in the pillow trying not to exhibit any outward sign of disturbance i quietly pulled up a stool and sat down near his head i wont touch you i said but you must talk to me i waited for several minutes while he lay unmoving shoulders hunched defensively at last he sighed and sat up moving slowly and painfully swinging his legs over the edge of the cot aye he said flatly not looking at me aye i suppose i must i should have done so before but i was coward enough to hope i need not his voice was bitter and he kept his head bowed hands clasped loosely around his knees i didna used to think myself a coward but i am i should have made randall kill me but i did not i had no reason to live but i was not brave enough to die his voice dropped and he spoke so softly i could hardly hear him and i knew i would have to see you one last time to tell you but claire my love oh my love he picked up the pillow from the bed and hugged it to him as though for protection a substitute for the comfort he could not seek from me he rested his forehead on it for a moment gathering strength when ye left me there at wentworth claire he said quietly head still bowed i listened to your footsteps going away on the flags outside and i said to myself ill think of her now ill remember her the feel of her skin and the scent of her hair and the touch of her mouth on mine ill think of her until that door opens again and ill think of her tomorrow when i stand on the gallows to give me courage at the last between the time the door opens and the time i leave this place to die the big hands clenched briefly and relaxed i will not think at all he finished softly in the small dungeon room he had closed his eyes and sat waiting the pain was not bad so long as he sat still but he knew it would grow worse soon fearing pain still he had dealt with it often before he knew it and his own response to it well enough that he was resigned to endurance hoping only that it would not exceed his strength too soon the prospect of physical violation too was only a matter of mild revulsion now despair was in its own way an anesthetic there was no window in the room by which to judge the time it had been late afternoon when he was brought to the dungeon but his sense of time was unreliable how many hours could it be until dawn six eight ten until the end of everything he thought with grim humor that randall at least had done him the favor of rendering death welcome when the door opened he had looked up expecting what there was only a man slightly built handsome and a little disheveled linen shirt torn and hair disarranged leaning against the wood of the door watching him after a moment randall had crossed the room unspeaking and stood beside him he rested a hand briefly on jamies neck then bent and freed the trapped hand with a jerk of the nail that brought jamie to the edge of fainting a glass of brandy was set before him and a firm hand raised his head and helped him to drink it he lifted my face then between his hands and he licked the drops of brandy from my lips i wanted to pull back from him but id given my word so i just sat still randall had held jamies head for a moment looking searchingly into his eyes then released him and sat down on the table next to him he sat there for quite a time not saying anything just swinging one leg back and forth i had no idea what he wanted and wasnt disposed to guess i was tired and feeling a bit sick from the pain in my hand so after a time i just laid my head down on my arms and turned my face away he sighed heavily after a moment i could feel a hand on my head but i didnt move he began to stroke my hair very gently over and over there wasnt any sound but the big fellows hoarse breathing and the crackle of the fire in the brazier and i think i think i went to sleep for a few moments when he woke randall was standing in front of him are you feeling a bit better randall had asked in a remote courteous tone wordless jamie had nodded and stood up randall had stripped him careful of the wounded hand and led him to the bed id given my word not to struggle but i did not mean to help either so i just stood as though i were made of wood i thought i would let him do as he liked but id take no part in it i would keep a distance from him in my mind at least randall had smiled then and gripped jamies right hand hard enough to make him sink onto the bed sick and dizzy with the sudden stab of pain randall had knelt then on the floor before him and taught him in a few shattering minutes that distance is an illusion when he rose up he took the knife and drew it across my chest from one side to the other it was not a deep cut but it bled a bit he watched my face a moment then reached out a finger and dipped it in the blood jamies voice was unsteady tripping and stammering from time to time he licked my blood off his finger with little flicks of his tongue like a ccat washing itself he smiled a bit then very kind like and bent his head to my chest i was not bound at all but i could not have moved i just sat there while he used his tongue to it did not hurt precisely but it felt verra queer after a time he stood up and cleaned himself careful with a towel i watched jamies hand with his face turned away it was the best indicator of his feelings it clenched convulsively on the edge of the cot as he went on he he told me that i was delicious the cut had almost stopped bleeding but he took the towel and scrubbed it hard over my chest to open the wound again the knuckles of the clenched hand were knobs of bloodless bone he unbuttoned his breeches then and smeared the fresh blood on himself and said it was my turn now afterward randall held his head and helped him to be sick wiped his face gently with a wet cloth and gave him brandy to cleanse his mouth of foulness and so by turns vicious and tender bit by bit using pain as his weapon he had destroyed all barriers of mind and body i wanted to stop jamie to tell him that he didnt need to go on must not go on but i bit my lip hard to keep from speaking and clasped my own hands tight together to keep from touching him he told me the rest of it then the slow and deliberate whipstrokes interspersed with kisses the shocking pain of burns administered to drag him from the brink of a desperately sought unconsciousness to face further degradations he told me everything with hesitations sometimes with tears much more than i could bear to hear but i heard him out silent as a confessor he glanced quickly up at me then away i could have stood being hurt no matter how bad it was i expected to be used and i thought i could stand that too but i couldnt i he i dug my nails fiercely into my palms in the struggle to keep quiet he shook soundlessly for a time then his voice came again thick but desperately steady he did not just hurt me or use me he made love to me claire he hurt me hurt me badly while he did it but it was an act of love to him and he made me answer him damn his soul he made me rouse to him the hand bunched into a fist and struck the bedframe with an impotent rage that made the whole bed tremble the first time he was verra careful with me he used oil and took a long time rubbing it all over me touchin me gentle in all my parts i could no more stop myself rising to his touch than i could stop myself bleeding when he cut me jamies voice was weary and wretched with despair he paused and looked directly at me for the first time since i had come in claire i did not want to think of you i couldna bear to be there naked and like that and to remember loving you it was blasphemy i meant to wipe you from my mind and only to exist so long as i must but he would not allow it wetness shone on his cheeks but he was not crying now he talked all during it he talked to me partly it was threats and partly it was love talk but often it was you me my voice unused for so long came out of my strained throat as little more than a croak he nodded looking down at the pillow again aye he was most terribly jealous of you you know no no i didnt know he nodded again oh yes he would ask me while he touched me he would ask does she do this for you can your woman rrouse you like this his voice trembled i wouldna answer him i couldnt and then hed ask how i thought you would feel to see me to see me he bit his lip hard unable to go on for a moment hed hurt me a bit then stop and love me til i began to rouse and then hed hurt me fierce and take me in the midst of the hurting and all the time he would talk of you and keep you before my eyes i fought in my mind i tried to keep myself from him to keep my mind apart from my body but the pain broke through again and again past every barrier i could put up i tried claire god i tried so hard but he sank his head in his hands fingers digging hard into his temples he spoke abruptly i know why young alex macgregor hanged himself id do the same did i not know it to be mortal sin if hes damned me in life hell not do so in heaven there was a moments silence while he struggled to control himself i noticed automatically that the pillow on his knees was blotched with dampness and wanted to get up and change it for him he shook his head slowly still gazing down at his feet the its all linked for me now i canna think of you claire even of kissing you or touching your hand without feeling the fear and the pain and the sickness come back i lie here feeling that i will die without your touch but when you touch me i feel as though i will vomit with shame and loathing of myself i canna even see you now without his forehead rested on knotted fists knuckles dug hard into his eyesockets the tendons of his neck were sharply etched with strain and his voice came halfmuffled claire i want you to leave me go back to scotland to craigh na dun go back to your place to your husband murtagh will take you safe ive told him he was silent for a moment and i did not move he looked up again with desperate bravery and spoke very simply i will love you as long as i live but i cannot be your husband any longer and i will not be less to you his face began to break apart claire i want you so badly that my bones shake in my body but god help me i am afraid to touch you i started up to go to him but he stopped me with a sudden motion of his hand he was half doubled up face contorted with internal struggle and his voice was strangled and breathless claire please please go im going to be verra sick and i dont want you to see it please i heard the pleading in his voice and knew i must spare him this one indignity at least i rose and for the first time in my professional life left a sick man to his own devices helpless and alone i left his chamber numbed and leaned against the white stone wall outside cooling my flushed cheek against the unyielding blocks ignoring the stares of murtagh and brother william god help me he had said god help me i am afraid to touch you i straightened and stood alone well why not surely there was no one else at the hour when time began to slow i genuflected in the aisle of the chapel of st giles anselm was there elegant shoulders straight beneath his habit but no other he neither moved nor looked around but the living silence of the chapel embraced me i remained on my knees for a moment reaching out to the quiet darkness staying my mind from its hurry only when i felt my heart slow to the rhythms of the night did i slide into a seat near the back i sat rigid lacking the form and ritual the liturgical courtesies that eased the brothers into the depths of their sacred conversation i did not know how to begin finally i said silently bluntly i need help please and then i let the silence fall back in waves around me lapping me like the folds of a cloak comforting against the cold and i waited as anselm had told me and the minutes passed by uncounted there was a small table at the back of the chapel covered with a linen cloth bearing the stoup of holy water and beside it a bible and two or three other inspirational works for use by adorers for whom the silence was too much i supposed it was becoming too much for me and i rose and got the bible bringing it back to the priedieu with me i was hardly the first person to have recourse to the sortes virgilianae in time of confusion or trouble there was sufficient light from the candles for me to read turning the flimsy pages carefully and squinting over the lines of fine black type and he smote them with emerods and they were very sore no doubt they were i thought what in hell were emerods try psalms instead but i am a worm and no man i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels well yes a competent diagnosis i thought with some impatience but was there some treatment but be not thou far from me o lord o my strength haste thee to help me deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the dog hmm i turned to the book of job jamies favorite surely if anyone was in a position to offer helpful advice but his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him shall mourn mmm yes i thought and turned the page he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude of his bones with strong pain his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick out spot on i thought what next yea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to the destroyers not so good but the next bit was more heartening if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to shew unto man his uprightness then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom his flesh shall be fresher than a childs he shall return to the days of his youth and what was the ransom then that would buy a mans soul and deliver my darling from the power of the dog i closed the book and my eyes the words muddled together blurring with my urgent need an overriding misery struck me when i spoke jamies name and yet there was some small peace there a lessening of tension when i said as i did over and over again o lord into thy hands i commend the soul of your servant james the thought came to me that perhaps jamie would be better off dead he had said he wanted to die i was morally sure that if i left him as he wished he would be dead soon whether from the aftereffects of torture and illness from hanging or in some battle and i was in no doubt that he knew it as well ought i to do as he said damned if i will i said to myself damned if i will i said fiercely to the sunburst on the altar and opened the book again it was some time before i became aware that my thread of petition was no longer a monologue in fact i knew it only when i realized that i had just answered a question i had no memory of asking in my trance of sleepless misery something had been asked of me i wasnt sure just what and i had answered without thinking yes i will i stopped all thought abruptly listening to the ringing silence and then more cautiously repeated voiceless yes yes i will and thought fleetingly the conditions of sin are these first you must give your full consent to it and the conditions of grace as well came an echo of anselms quiet voice there was a feeling not sudden but complete as though i had been given a small object to hold unseen in my hands precious as opal smooth as jade weighty as a river stone more fragile than a birds egg infinitely still live as the root of creation not a gift but a trust fiercely to cherish softly to guard the words spoke themselves and disappeared into the groined shadows of the roof i genuflected to the presence then and left the chapel never doubting in the eternity of the moment when time stops that i had an answer but having no idea what that answer was i knew only that what i held was a human soul my own or anothers i could not tell it did not appear to be an answer to prayer when i woke to the resumption of ordinary time in the morning to find a lay brother standing over me telling me that jamie was burning with fever how long has he been like this i asked laying a practiced hand on brow and back armpit and groin no trace of relieving sweat only the dry stretched skin of persistent parching fiery with heat he was awake but heavyeyed and groggy the source of the fever was plain the shattered right hand was puffy with a foulsmelling ooze soaking the bandages ominous red streaks ran up the wrist a bloody infection i thought to myself a filthy suppurating blood poisoning lifethreatening infection i found him so when i came to look in on him after matins replied the serving brother who had come to fetch me i gave him water but he began to vomit just after dawn you should have fetched me at once i said still never mind bring me hot water raspberry leaves and brother polydore as quickly as possible he left with the assurance that he would see some breakfast was brought for me as well but i waved such amenities aside reaching for the pewter jug of water by the time brother polydore appeared i had tried the internal application of water only to have it violently rejected and was applying it externally instead soaking the sheets and wrapping them loosely over the hot skin simultaneously i set the infected hand to soak in freshboiled water as hot as could be stood without burning the skin lacking sulfa drugs or modern antibiotics heat was the only defense against a bacterial infection the patients body was doing its best to supply that heat by means of high fever but the fever itself posed a serious danger wasting muscle and damaging brain cells the trick was to apply sufficient local heat to destroy the infection while keeping the rest of the body cool enough to prevent damage and sufficiently hydrated to maintain its normal functions a bloody threetier balancing act i thought bleakly neither jamies state of mind nor his physical discomfort were relevant any longer it was a straightforward struggle to keep him alive until the infection and the fever ran their course nothing else mattered in the afternoon of the second day he began to hallucinate we tied him to the bed with soft rags to prevent his hurling himself to the floor finally as a desperate measure to break the fever i sent one of the lay brothers out to bring in a bushel basket of snow which we packed around him this resulted in a violent shivering fit that left him drained and exhausted but did briefly bring his temperature down unfortunately the treatment had to be repeated at hourly intervals by sunset the room looked like a swamp with puddles of melted snow standing on the floor tussocks of sodden sheeting mounded among them and steam like marsh gas rising from the brazier in the corner brother polydore and myself were sodden too soaked with sweat chilled with snow water and near to exhaustion in spite of the helpful assistance of anselm and the lay brothers febrifuges such as coneflower goldenseal catnip and hyssop had been tried without effect willowbark tea which might have helped with its content of salicylic acid could not be consumed in amounts large enough to matter in one of his increasingly rare lucid intervals jamie asked me to let him die i answered curtly as i had the night before damned if i will and went on with what i was doing as the sun went down there was a stir of approaching men in the corridor the door opened and the abbot jamies uncle alex came in accompanied by brother anselm and three other monks one carrying a small cedarwood box the abbot came over to me and blessed me briefly then took one of my hands in his we are going to anoint the lad he said his deep voice kind do not be frightened he turned toward the bed and i looked wildly to anselm for explanation the sacrament of extreme unction he explained moving close so that his low tones would not disturb the monks gathered around the bed the last anointing last anointing thats for people who are dying ssh he drew me farther away from the bed it might more properly be called anointing of the sick though in fact it is usually reserved for those in danger of death the monks had turned jamie gently onto his back arranging him tenderly so that he might lie with the least hurt to his raw shoulders the purpose of the sacrament is twofold anselm went on murmuring in my ear as the preparations went on first it is intended as a sacrament of healing we pray that the sufferer may be restored to health if that be gods will for him the chrism the consecrated oil is used as a symbol of life and healing and the second purpose i asked already knowing anselm nodded if it is not gods will that he should recover then he is given absolution of sins and we commend him to god that his soul may depart in peace he saw me tighten in protest and laid a warning hand on my arm these are the last rites of the church he is entitled to them and to whatever peace they may bring him the preparations were complete jamie lay on his back a cloth modestly draped across his loins with lighted candles at the head and the foot of the bed that reminded me most unpleasantly of grave lights abbot alexander sat at the bedside accompanied by a monk who held a tray with a covered ciborium two small silver bottles containing holy water and chrism and a white cloth draped across both forearms like a bloody wine steward i thought crossly the whole procedure unnerved me the rites were conducted in latin the soft antiphonal murmuring soothing to the ear though i did not understand the meaning anselm whispered softly to me the meaning of some parts of the service others were selfexplanatory at one point the abbot motioned to polydore who stepped forward and held a small vial under jamies nose it must have contained spirits of ammonia or some other stimulant because he jerked and turned his head away sharply eyes still closed why are they trying to wake him i whispered if possible the person should be conscious in order to give assent to the statement that he is sorry for any sins committed during his life also if he is capable of receiving it the abbot will give him the blessed sacrament the abbot stroked jamies cheek softly turning his head back to the vial speaking quietly to him he had dropped from latin into the broad scots of their family and his voice was gentle jamie jamie lad its alex lad im here wi ye ye must wake a bit now only for a bit i shall be givin ye the absolution now and then the blessed sacrament of our lord take a wee sup now so ye can answer me when ye must the monk called polydore held the cup against jamies lips carefully pouring the water a drop at a time until the parched tongue and throat could take more his eyes were open still heavy with fever but alert enough the abbot went on then the questions in english but pitched so low that i could scarcely catch them do ye renounce satan and all his works do ye believe in the resurrection of our lord jesus christ and so on to each one jamie answered aye in a scratchy whisper once the sacrament had been given jamie lay back with a sigh closing his eyes once more i could see his ribs as the deepsprung chest moved with his breathing he had wasted dreadfully between the sickness and the fever the abbot taking the vials of holy water and chrism in turn made the sign of the cross on his body anointing forehead lips nose ears and eyelids then in turn he made the sign of the cross with the holy oil in the hollow of the chest over the heart on the palm of each hand and the arch of each foot he lifted the injured hand with infinite care brushing the oil across the wound lightly and laying the hand back on jamies chest where it lay below the livid slash of the knife scar the anointing was quick and immeasurably gentle a feather touch by the abbots rapidly moving thumb superstitious magic said the rational side of my brain but i was deeply moved by the love on the faces of the monks as they prayed jamies eyes were open once more but very calm and his face was peaceful for the first time since we had left lallybroch the ceremony concluded with a brief prayer in latin laying his hand on jamies head the abbot said in english lord into thy hands we commend the soul of your servant james heal him we pray if that be thy will and strengthen his soul that he may be filled with grace and know thy peace throughout eternity amen replied the other monks and so did i by dark the patient had lapsed into semiconsciousness again as jamies strength waned it was all we could do to rouse him for the sips of water that were keeping him alive his lips were cracked and peeling and he could no longer talk though he would still open glazed eyes when shaken roughly he no longer recognized us his eyes stared fixedly then gradually closed as he turned his head away moaning i stood by the bed looking down at him so exhausted from the rigors of the day that i felt no more than a sort of dull despair brother polydore touched me gently bringing me out of my daze you cannot do any more for him now he said leading me firmly away you must go and rest but i began then stopped he was right i realized we had done everything possible either the fever would break soon of itself or jamie would die even the strongest body could not endure the consuming ravages of high fever for more than a day or two and jamie had little strength left to see him through such a siege i will stay with him polydore said go to your bed ill summon you if he didnt finish the sentence but waved me gently in the direction of my own chamber i lay sleepless on my cot staring at the beamed ceiling my eyes were dry and hot and my throat ached as though i were coming down with a fever as well was this the answer to my prayer that we would die here together at last i rose and took up the jug and basin from the table by the door i set the heavy pottery dish in the center of the floor and filled it carefully letting the water swell up over the thickened rim into a trembling bubble i had made a short detour to brother ambroses stillroom on the way to my chamber i undid the small packets of herbs and scattered the contents into my brazier where the myrrh leaves gave off a fragrant smoke and the crumbs of camphor flamed with tiny blue tongues between the red glow of the charcoal sticks i set the candlestick behind my reflecting pool took my place before it and sat down to summon a ghost the stone corridor was cold and dark lit at intervals by dimly flickering oil lamps hung from the ceiling my shadow stretched forward under my feet as i passed beneath each one lengthening until it seemed to dive headfirst and disappear into the dark ahead in spite of the cold i was barefoot and wearing only a coarse white cotton nightrobe a small envelope of warmth moved with me under the robe but the chill from the stones crept up my feet and legs i knocked once softly and pushed open the heavy door without waiting for an answer brother roger was with him sitting by the bed telling beads with bowed head the wooden rosary rattled as he looked up but his lips continued to move silently for a few seconds finishing the ave maria before acknowledging my presence he met me near the door speaking quietly though it was clear that he could have shouted without disturbing the motionless figure on the bed no change ive just put fresh water in the hand bath a few drops gleamed on the sides of the small pewter kettle on the brazier freshly filled i nodded and put a hand on his arm in thanks it was startlingly solid and warm after the imaginations of the last hour and somehow comforting id like to stay with him alone if you dont mind of course ill go to the chapel or should i stay near in case his voice trailed off hesitant no i tried to smile reassuringly go to the chapel or better yet go to bed i cant sleep ill stay here til morning if i need help ill send for you still dubious he glanced back at the bed but it was very late and he was tired there were shadows under the kind brown eyes the heavy door squeaked on its hinges and i was alone with jamie alone and afraid and very very doubtful about what i proposed to do i stood at the foot of the bed watching him for a moment the room was dimly lit by the glow of the brazier and by two enormous candlesticks each nearly three feet tall that stood on the table at the side of the room he was naked and the faint light seemed to accentuate the hollows left by the wasting fever the multicolored bruise over the ribs stained the skin like a spreading fungus a dying man takes on a faint greenish tinge at first just a touch at the edge of the jaw this pallor spreads gradually over the face and down the chest as the force of life begins to ebb i had seen it many times a few times i had seen that deadly progress arrested and reversed the skin flush with blood once more and the man live more often i shook myself vigorously and turned away i brought my hand out of the folds of my robe and laid on the table the objects i had collected in a surreptitious visit to brother ambroses darkened workshop a vial of spirits of ammonia a packet of dried lavender another of valerian a small metal incense burner shaped like an open blossom two pellets of opium sweet scented and sticky with resin and a knife the room was close and stuffy with smoke from the brazier the only window was covered with a heavy tapestry one showing the execution of saint sebastian i eyed the saints upturned face and arrowpunctured torso wondering afresh at the mentality of the person who had chosen this particular decoration for a sickroom indifferently rendered as it was the tapestry was of heavy silk and wool and excluded all but the strongest drafts i lifted the lower edge and flapped it urging the charcoal smoke out through the stone arch the cold damp air that streamed in was refreshing and did something to calm the throbbing that had started in my temples as i stared into the reflecting water remembering there was a faint moan behind me and jamie stirred in the draft good he was not deeply unconscious then letting the tapestry fall back over the window i next took up the incense burner i fixed one of the opium pellets on the spike and lighted it with one of the wax tapers for the candlesticks i placed it on the small table near jamies head careful not to inhale the sickly fumes myself there was not much time i must finish my preparations quickly before the opium smoke drove him too far under to be roused i unlaced the front of my robe and rubbed my body quickly with handfuls of the lavender and valerian it was a pleasant spicy smell distinctive and richly evocative a smell that to me conjured the shade of the man who wore its perfume and the shade of the man behind him shades that evoked confusing images of present terror and lost love a smell that to jamie must recall the hours of pain and rage spent wrapped in its waves i rubbed the last of it vigorously between my palms and dropped the fragrant shreds on the floor with a deep breath for courage i picked up the vial of ammoniacal spirits i stood by the bed a moment holding it looking down at the gaunt stubbled face at most he might last a day at the least only a few more hours all right you bloody scottish bastard i said softly lets see how stubborn you really are i lifted the injured hand dripping from the water and set the soaking dish aside i opened the vial and waved it closely under his nose he snorted and tried to turn his head away but didnt open his eyes i dug my fingers into the hair on the back of his head to prevent his turning away and brought the vial back to his face he shook his head slowly swinging it from side to side like an ox roused from slumber and his eyes came open just a crack not done yet fraser i whispered in his ear trying as best i could to catch the rhythm of randalls clipped consonants jamie moaned and hunched his shoulders i grasped him by both shoulders and shook him roughly his skin was so hot i nearly let go wake up you scottish bastard im not done with you yet he began to struggle up onto his elbows with a pitiful effort at obedience that nearly broke my heart his head was still shaking back and forth and the cracked lips were muttering something that sounded like please not yet over and over again strength failing he rolled to one side and collapsed facedown on the pillow again the room was beginning to fill with opium smoke and i felt mildly dizzy i gritted my teeth and plunged my hand between his buttocks gripping one curving round he screamed a high breathy sound and rolled painfully sideways curling into a ball with his hands clasped between his legs i had spent the hour in my chamber hovering over my pool of reflection conjuring memories of black jack randall and of frank his sixtimesgreatgrandson such very different men but with such startling physical similarities it tore me to think of frank to recall his face and voice his mannerisms his style of lovemaking i had tried to obliterate him from my mind once my choice was made in the circle of stone but he was always there a shadowy figure in the recesses of my mind i felt sick with betrayal of him but in the extremity i had forced my mind to clear as geilie had shown me concentrating on the flame of the candle breathing the astringency of the herbs calming myself until i could bring him from the shadows see the lines of his face feel once more the touch of his hand without weeping there was another man in the shadows with the same hands the same face eyes filled with the candle flame i had brought him forward too listening watching seeing the likenesses and the differences building a a what a simulacrum a persona an impression a masquerade a shaded face a whispered voice and a loving touch that i might bring to deceive a mind adrift in delirium and i left my chamber at last with a prayer for the soul of the witch geillis duncan jamie was on his back now writhing slightly against the pain of his wounds his eyes were fixed and staring with no sign of recognition i caressed him in the way i knew so well tracing the line of his ribs from breastbone to back lightly as frank would have done pressing hard on the aching bruise as i was sure the other would have i leaned forward and ran my tongue slowly around his ear tasting and probing and whispered fight me fight back you filthy scut his muscles tightened and his jaw clenched but he continued to stare upward no choice then i would have to use the knife after all i knew the risk i was taking in this but better to kill him myself i thought than to sit quietly by and let him die i took the knife from the table and drew it firmly across his chest along the path of the freshly healed scar he gasped with the shock of it and arched his back seizing a towel i scrubbed it briskly over the wound before i could falter i forced myself to run my fingers over his chest scooping up a gout of blood which i rubbed savagely over his lips there was one phrase that i didnt have to invent having heard it myself bending low over him i whispered now kiss me i was not at all prepared for it he hurled me half across the room as he came up off the bed i staggered and fell against the table making the giant candlesticks sway the shadows darted and swung as the wicks flared and went out the edge of the table had struck me hard across the back but i recovered in time to dodge away as he lunged for me with an inarticulate growl he came after me hands outstretched he was both faster and stronger than i expected though he staggered awkwardly bumping into things he cornered me for a moment between the brazier and the table and i could hear his breath rasping harshly in his throat as he grabbed for me he smashed his left hand toward my face had his strength and reflexes been anything like normal the blow would have killed me instead i jerked to one side and his fist glanced off my forehead knocking me to the floor mildly stunned i crawled under the table reaching for me he lost his balance and fell against the brazier glowing coals scattered across the stone floor of the chamber he howled as his knee crunched heavily into a patch of hot coal i seized a pillow from the bed and beat out a smoldering nest of sparks in the trailing bedcover preoccupied with this i didnt notice his approach until a solid clout across the head knocked me sprawling the cot overturned as i tried to pull myself up with a hand on the frame i lay sheltering behind it for a moment trying to get my senses back i could hear jamie hunting me in the semidarkness breath rasping between incoherent phrases of gaelic cursing suddenly he caught sight of me and flung himself over the bed eyes mad in the dim light it is difficult to describe in detail what happened next if only because everything happened a number of times and the times all overlap in my memory it seems as though jamies burning hands closed on my neck only once but that once went on forever in fact it happened dozens of times each time i managed to break his grip and throw him off to retreat once more dodging and ducking around the wrecked furniture and once again he would follow a man pulled by rage from the edge of death swearing and sobbing staggering and flailing wildly deprived of the sheltering brazier the coals died quickly leaving the room black as pitch and peopled with demons in the last flickers of light i saw him crouched against the wall maned in fire and mantled in blood penis stiff against the matted hair of his belly eyes blue murder in a skullwhite face a viking berserker like the northern devils who burst from their dragonships into the mists of the ancient scottish coast to kill and plunder and burn men who would kill with the last ounce of their strength who would use that last strength to rape and sow their violent seed in the bellies of the conquered the tiny incense burner gave no light but the sickly smell of opium clogged my lungs though the coals were out i saw lights in the darkness colored lights that floated at the edge of my vision movement was becoming harder i felt as though i were wading through water thighdeep pursued by monstrous fish i lifted my knees high running in slow motion feeling the water splash against my face i shook off the dream to realize that there was in fact wetness on my face and hands not tears but blood and the sweat of the nightmare creature i grappled with in the dark sweat there was something i should remember about sweat but i couldnt recall it a hand tightened on my upper arm and i pulled away a slick film left on my skin around and around the mulberry bush the monkey chased the weasel but something was wrong it was the weasel chasing me a weasel with sharp white teeth that pierced my forearm i hit out at it and the teeth let go but the claws around and around the mulberry bush the demon had me up against the wall i could feel stone behind my head and stone beneath my grasping fingers and a stonehard body pressing hard against me bony knee between my own stone and bone between my own legs more stony hardness ah a softness amidst the hardness of life pleasant coolness in the heat comfort in the midst of woe we fell locked together to the floor rolling over and over tangled in the folds of the fallen tapestry washed in the drafts of cold air from the window the mists of madness began to recede we bashed into some piece of furniture and both lay still jamies hands were locked on my breasts fingers digging bruisingly into the flesh i felt the plop of dampness on my face sweat or tears i couldnt tell but opened my eyes to see jamie was looking down at me face blank in the moony light eyes wide unfocused his hands relaxed one finger gently traced the outline of my breast from slope to tip over and over his hand moved to cup the breast fingers spread like a starfish soft as the grip of a nursing child mmother he said the hair stood up on the back of my neck it was the high pure voice of a young boy mother the cold air laved us whirling the unhealthy smoke away in a drift of snowflakes i reached up and laid the palm of my hand along his cold cheek jamie love i said whispering through a bruised throat come then come lay your head man the mask trembled then and broke and i held the big body hard against me the two of us shaking with the force of his sobbing it was by considerable good luck the unflappable brother william who found us in the morning i woke groggily to the sound of the door opening and snapped to full consciousness when i heard him clear his throat emphatically before saying good morning to ye in his soft yorkshire drawl the heavy weight on my chest was jamie his hair had dried in bronze streaks and whorled over my breasts like the petals of a chinese chrysanthemum the cheek pressed against my sternum was warm and slightly sticky with sweat but the back and arms i could touch were as cold as my thighs chilled by the winter air gusting in on us daylight streaming through the uncurtained window revealed the full extent of the wreckage i had only dimly realized the night before smashed furniture and crockery littered the room and the massive paired candlesticks lay like fallen logs in the midst of a tangle of torn hangings and scattered bedclothes from the pattern of indentations impressing itself painfully into my back i thought i must be lying on the indifferently executed tapestry of st sebastian the human pincushion no great loss to the monastery if so brother william stood motionless in the doorway jug and basin in hand with great precision he fixed his eyes on jamies left eyebrow and inquired and how do you feel this morning there was a rather long pause during which jamie considerately remained in place blanketing most of me from view at last in the hoarse tones of one to whom a revelation has been vouchsafed he replied hungry oh good said brother william still staring hard at the eyebrow ill go and tell brother josef the door closed soundlessly behind him nice of you not to move i remarked i shouldnt like us to be responsible for giving brother william impure thoughts dense blue eyes stared down at me aye well he said judiciously a view of my arse is no going to corrupt anyones holy orders not in its present condition yours though he paused to clear his throat what about mine i demanded the bright head lowered slowly to plant a kiss on my shoulder yours he said would compromise a bishop mmmphm i was i felt getting rather good at scottish noises myself be that as it may perhaps you should move now i dont suppose even brother williams tact is infinite jamie lowered his head next to mine with some care laying it on a fold of tapestry from which he peered sideways at me i dinna know how much of last night i dreamed and how much was real his hand unconsciously strayed to the scratch across his chest but if half what i thought happened really happened i should be dead now youre not i looked with some hesitation i asked do you want to be he smiled slowly eyes halfclosing no sassenach i dont his face was gaunt and shadowed with illness and fatigue but peaceful the lines around his mouth smoothed out and the blue eyes clear but im damned close to it want to or not the only reason i think im not dying now is that im hungry i wouldna be hungry if i were about to die do ye think seems a waste one eye closed altogether but the other stayed halfopen fixed on my face with a quizzical expression you cant stand up he considered carefully if my life depended on it i might possibly lift my head again but stand up no with a sigh i wriggled out from under him and righted the bed before trying to lever him into a vertical position he managed to stand for only a few seconds before his eyes rolled back and he fell across the bed i groped frantically for the pulse in his neck and found it slow and strong just below the threecornered scar at the base of his throat simple exhaustion after a month of imprisonment and a week of intense physical and mental stress starvation injury sickness and high fever even that vigorous frame had finally come to the end of its resources the heart of a lion i said shaking my head and the head of an ox too bad you havent also got the hide of a rhinoceros i touched a freshly bloodied weal on his shoulder he opened one eye whats a rhinoceros i thought you were unconscious i was i am my heads spinning like a top i drew a blanket up over him what you need now are food and rest what you need now he said are clothes and shutting the eye again he fell promptly asleep chapter absolution i had no memory of finding my way to bed but i must have done so because i woke up there anselm was sitting by the window reading i sat bolt upright in bed jamie i croaked asleep he said putting the book aside he glanced at the hourcandle on the table like you you have been with the angels for the last thirtysix hours ma belle he filled a cup from the earthenware jug and held it to my lips at one time i would have considered drinking wine in bed before brushing ones teeth to be the last word in decadence performed in a monastery in company with a robed franciscan the act seemed somewhat less degenerate and the wine did cut through the mossy feeling in my mouth i swung my feet over the side of the bed and sat swaying anselm caught me by the arm and eased me back onto the pillow he seemed suddenly to have four eyes and altogether more noses and mouths than strictly necessary im a bit dizzy i said closing my eyes i opened one somewhat better at least there was only one of him if a trifle blurry around the edges anselm bent over me concerned shall i fetch brother ambrose or brother polydore madame i have little skill in medicine unfortunately no i dont need anything i just sat up too suddenly i tried again more slowly this time the room and its contents stayed relatively still i became aware of numerous bruises and sore spots earlier submerged in the dizziness i tried to clear my throat and discovered that it hurt i grimaced really ma chère i think perhaps anselm was poised by the door ready to fetch assistance he looked quite alarmed i reached for the looking glass on the table and then changed my mind i really wasnt ready for that i grasped the wine jug instead anselm came slowly back into the room and stood watching me once convinced that i wasnt going to collapse after all he sat down again i sipped the wine slowly as my head cleared trying to shake off the aftereffects of opiuminduced dreams so we were alive after all both of us my dreams had been chaotic filled with violence and blood i had dreamed over and over that jamie was dead or dying and somewhere in the fog had been the image of the boy in the snow his surprised round face overlying the image of jamies bruised and battered one sometimes the pathetic fuzzy mustache seemed to appear on franks face i distinctly remembered killing all three of them i felt as though i had spent the night in stabbing and butchery and i ached in every muscle with a sort of dull depression anselm was still there patiently watching me hands on his knees there is something you could do for me father i said he rose at once eager to help reaching for the jug of course more wine i smiled wanly yes but later right now i want you to hear my confession he was startled but quickly gathered his professional selfpossession around him like his robes but of course chère madame if you wish it but really would it not be better to fetch father gerard he is well known as a confessor while i he gave a gallic shrug i am allowed to hear confessions of course but in truth i seldom do so being only a poor scholar i want you i said firmly and i want to do it now he sighed in resignation and went to fetch his stola arranging it about his neck so that the purple silk lay straight and shimmering down the black front of his habit he took a seat on the stool blessed me briefly and sat back waiting and i told him everything who i was and how i came there about frank and about jamie and about the young english dragoon with the pale spotty face dying against the snow he showed no change of expression while i spoke except that the round brown eyes grew rounder still when i finished he blinked once or twice opened his mouth as though to speak closed it again and shook his head as though to clear it no i said patiently i cleared my throat again i croaked like a bullfrog you havent been hearing things and youre not imagining it either now you see why i wanted you to hear it under the seal of confession he nodded a bit abstractedly yes yes to be sure if but yes of course you wished me to tell no one and also since you tell it to me under the seal of the sacrament then you expect that i must believe it but he scratched his head then looked up at me a wide smile spread slowly across his countenance but how marvelous he exclaimed softly how extraordinary and how wonderful wonderful isnt precisely the word i would have chosen i said dryly but extraordinary is all right i coughed and reached for more wine but it is a miracle he said as though to himself if you insist i said sighing but what i want to know what ought i to do am i guilty of murder or adultery for that matter not that theres much to be done about it in either case but id like to know and since i am here how ought i to act can i should i i mean use what i know to change things i dont even know if such a thing is possible but if it is have i the right he rocked back on his stool considering slowly he raised both index fingers placed them tip to tip and stared at them for a long time finally he shook his head and smiled at me i dont know ma bonne amie it is not you will appreciate a situation one is prepared to encounter in the confessional i will have to think and to pray yes assuredly to pray tonight i will contemplate your situation when i hold my watch before the blessed sacrament and tomorrow perhaps i can advise you he motioned me gently to kneel but for now my child i will absolve you whatever your sins might be have faith that they will be forgiven he lifted one hand in blessing placing the other on my head te absolvo in nomine patri et filii rising he lifted me to my feet thank you father i said unbeliever that i was i had used confession only to force him to take me seriously and was somewhat surprised to feel a lightening of the burden on my spirits perhaps it was only the relief of telling someone the truth he waved a hand in dismissal i will see you tomorrow chère madame for now you should rest more if you can he headed for the door winding his stola up neatly into a square at the doorway he paused for a moment turning to smile at me a childlike excitement lighted his eyes and perhaps tomorrow he said perhaps you could tell me what it is like i smiled back yes father ill tell you after he left i staggered down the hall to see jamie i had seen any number of corpses in much better condition but his chest rose and fell regularly and the sinister green tinge had faded from his skin ive been waking him every few hours just long enough to swallow a few spoonfuls of broth brother roger was at my elbow speaking softly he moved his gaze from the patient to me and recoiled noticeably at my appearance i should probably have combed my hair er perhaps you would like some no thank you i think i think perhaps i will sleep a bit more after all i no longer felt weighed down by guilt and depression but a drowsy contented heaviness was spreading through my limbs whether it was due to the effects of confession or of wine i found to my surprise that i was looking forward to bed and to oblivion i leaned forward to touch jamie he was warm but with no trace of fever i gently stroked his head smoothing the tumbled red hair the corner of his mouth stirred briefly and fell back into place but it had turned up i was sure of it the sky was cold and damp filling the horizon with a grey blankness that blended into the grey mist of the hills and the grimy cover of last weeks snow so that the abbey seemed wrapped inside a ball of dirty cotton even inside the cloister the winters silence weighed on the inhabitants the chanting from the hours of praise in the chapel was muted and the thick stone walls seemed to absorb all sound swaddling the bustle of daily activity jamie slept for nearly two days waking only to take a little broth or wine once awake he began to heal in the usual fashion of a normally healthy young man suddenly deprived of the strength and independence usually taken for granted in other words he enjoyed the cosseting for approximately twentyfour hours and then became in turn restive restless testy irritable cranky fractious and extremely bad tempered the cuts on his shoulders ached the scars on his legs itched he was sick of lying on his belly the room was too hot his hand hurt the smoke from the brazier made his eyes burn so that he could not read he was sick of broth posset and milk he wanted meat i recognized the symptoms of returning health and was glad of them but was prepared to put up with only so much of this i opened the window changed his sheets applied marigold salve to his back and rubbed his legs with aloe juice then i summoned a serving brother and ordered more broth i dont want any more of this slop i need food he pushed the tray irritably away making the broth splash onto the napkin cradling the bowl i folded my arms and stared down at him imperious blue eyes stared right back he was thin as a rail the lines of jaw and cheekbone bold against the skin though he was mending well the raw nerves of his stomach would take a little longer to heal he still could not always keep down the broth and milk youll get food when i say you can have it i informed him and not before ill have it now dye think you can tell me what im to eat yes i bloody well do im the doctor here if youve forgotten he swung his feet over the edge of the bed clearly intending to take steps i put a hand on his chest and shoved him back your job is to stay in that bed and do as youre told for once in your life i snapped youre not fit to be up and youre not fit for solid foot yet brother roger said you vomited again this morning brother roger can mind his own business and so can you he said through his teeth struggling back up he reached out and got a hold on the table edge with considerable effort he made it to his feet and stood there swaying get back in bed youre going to fall down he was alarmingly pale and even the small effort of standing had made him break out in a cold sweat ill not he said and if i do its my own concern i was really angry by this time oh is it and who do you think saved your miserable life for you anyway did it all by yourself did you i grabbed his arm to steer him back to bed but he jerked it away i didna ask ye to did i i told ye to leave me no and i canna see why ye bothered to save my life anyway if its only to starve me to death unless ye enjoy watching it this was altogether too much bloody ingrate shrew i drew myself to my full height and pointed menacingly at the cot with all the authority learned in years of nursing i said get back in that bed this instant you stubborn mulish idiotic scot he finished for me succinctly he took a step toward the door and would have fallen had he not caught hold of a stool he plumped heavily down on it and sat swaying his eyes a little unfocused with dizziness i clenched my fists and glared at him fine i said bloody fine ill order bread and meat for you and after you vomit on the floor you can just get down on your hands and knees and clean it up yourself i wont do it and if brother roger does ill skin him alive i stormed into the hall and slammed the door behind me just before the porcelain washbasin crashed into it from the other side i turned to find an interested audience no doubt attracted by the racket standing in the hall brother roger and murtagh stood side by side staring at my flushed face and heaving bosom roger looked disconcerted but a slow smile spread over murtaghs craggy countenance as he listened to the string of gaelic obscenities going on behind the door hes feeling better then he said contentedly i leaned against the corridor wall and felt an answering smile spread slowly across my own face well yes i said he is on my way back to the main building from a morning spent in the herbary i met anselm coming from the cloister near the library his face lighted when he saw me and he hurried to join me in the courtyard we walked together through the abbey grounds talking yours is an interesting problem to be sure he said breaking a stick from a bush near the wall he examined the wintertight buds critically then tossed it aside and glanced up at the sky where a feeble sun poked its way through the light cloud layer warmer but a good way to go until the spring he observed still the carp should be lively today let us go down to the fish pools far from being the delicate ornamental structures i had imagined them to be the fish pools were little more than utilitarian rocklined troughs placed conveniently near to the kitchens stocked with carp they provided the necessary food for fridays and fast days when the weather was too rough to permit ocean fishing for the more customary haddock herring and flounder true to anselms word the fish were lively the fat fusiform bodies gliding past each other white scales reflecting the clouds overhead the vigor of their movements occasionally stirring up small waves that sloshed against the sides of their rocky prison as our shadows fell on the water the carp turned toward us like compass needles surging toward the north they expect to be fed when they see people anselm explained it would be a shame to disappoint them one moment chère madame he darted into the kitchens returning shortly with two loaves of stale bread we stood on the lip of the pool tearing crumbs from the loaves and tossing them to the endlessly hungry mouths below you know there are two aspects to this curious situation of yours anselm said absorbed in tearing bread he glanced aside at me a sudden smile lighting his face he shook his head in wonderment i can scarcely believe it still you know such a marvel truly god has been good to show me such things well thats nice i said a bit dryly i dont know whether hes been quite so obliging to me really i think so anselm sank down on his haunches crumbling bread between his fingers true he said the situation has caused you no little personal inconvenience thats one way of putting it i muttered but it may also be regarded as a signal mark of gods favor he went on disregarding my interruption the bright brown eyes regarded me speculatively i prayed for guidance kneeling before the blessed sacrament he went on and as i sat in the silence of the chapel i seemed to see you as a shipwrecked traveler and it seems to me that that is a good parallel to your present situation is it not imagine such a soul madame suddenly cast away in a strange land bereft of friends and familiarity without resources save what the new land can provide such a happening is disaster truly and yet may be the opening for great opportunity and blessings what if the new land shall be rich new friends may be made and a new life begun yes but i began so he said authoritatively holding up a finger to hush me if you have been deprived of your earlier life perhaps it is only that god has seen fit to bless you with another that may be richer and fuller oh its full all right i agreed but now from the standpoint of canon law he said frowning there is no difficulty regarding your marriages both were valid marriages consecrated by the church and strictly speaking your marriage to the young chevalier in there antedates your marriage to monsieur randall yes strictly speaking i agreed getting to finish a sentence for once but not in my time i dont believe canon law was constructed with such contingencies in mind anselm laughed the pointed end of his beard quivering in the slight breeze more than true ma chère more than true all that i meant was that considered from a strictly legal standpoint you have committed neither sin nor crime in what you have done regarding these two men those were the two aspects of your situation of which i spoke earlier what you have done and what you will do he reached up a hand and took mine tugging me down to sit beside him so our eyes were on a level that is what you asked me when i heard your confession is it not what have i done and what shall i do yes thats it and youre telling me that i havent done anything wrong but ive he was i thought nearly as bad as dougal mackenzie for interrupting no you have not he said firmly it is possible to act in strict accordance with gods law and with ones conscience you comprehend and still to encounter difficulties and tragedy it is the painful truth that we still do not know why le bon dieu allows evil to exist but we have his word for it that this is true i created good he says in the bible and i created evil consequently even good people sometimes i think especially good people he added meditatively may encounter great confusion and difficulties in their lives for example take the young boy you were obliged to kill no he said raising a hand against my interruption make no mistake you were obliged to kill him given the exigencies of your situation even holy mother church which teaches the sanctity of life recognizes the need for defense of oneself and of ones family and having seen the earlier condition of your husband he cast a look back at the guests wing i have no doubt that you were obliged to take the path of violence that being so you have nothing with which to reproach yourself you do of course feel pity and regret for the action for you are madame a person of great sympathy and feeling he gently patted the hand that rested on my drawnup knees sometimes our best actions result in things that are most regrettable and yet you could not have acted otherwise we do not know what gods plan for the young man was perhaps it was his will that the boy should join him in heaven at that time but you are not god and there are limits to what you can expect of yourself i shivered briefly as a cold wind came round the corner and drew my shawl closer anselm saw it and motioned toward the pool the water is warm madame perhaps you would care to soak your feet warm i gaped incredulously at the water i hadnt noticed before but there were no broken sheets of ice in the corners of the trough as there were on the holy water fonts outside the church and small green plants floated in the water sprouting from the cracks between the rocks that lined the pool in illustration anselm slipped off his own leather sandals cultured as his face and voice were he had the square sturdy hands and feet of a normandy peasant hiking the skirt of his habit to his knees he dipped his feet into the pool the carp dashed away turning almost at once to nose curiously at this new intrusion they dont bite do they i asked viewing the myriad voracious mouths suspiciously not flesh no he assured me they have no teeth to speak of i shed my own sandals and gingerly inserted my feet into the water to my surprise it was pleasantly warm not hot but a delightful contrast to the damp chilly air oh thats nice i wiggled my toes with pleasure causing considerable consternation among the carp there are several mineral springs near the abbey anselm explained they bubble hot from the earth and the waters hold great healing powers he pointed to the far end of the trough were i could see a small opening in the rocks half obscured by the drifting water plants a small amount of the hot mineral water is piped here from the nearest spring that is what enables the cook to maintain live fish for the table at all seasons normally the winter weather would be too bitter for them we paddled our feet in congenial silence for a time the heavy bodies of the fish flicking past occasionally bumping into our legs with a surprisingly weighty impact the sun came out again bathing us in a weak but perceptible warmth anselm closed his eyes letting the light wash over his face he spoke again without opening them your first husband frank was his name he too i think must be commended to god as one of the regrettable things that you can do nothing about but i could have done something i argued i could have gone back perhaps he opened one eye and regarded me skeptically yes perhaps he agreed and perhaps not you need not reproach yourself for hesitating to risk your life it wasnt the risk i said flicking my toes at a big blackandwhite splotched carp or not entirely it was well it was partly fear but mostly it was that i i couldnt leave jamie i shrugged helplessly i simply couldnt anselm smiled opening both eyes a good marriage is one of the most precious gifts from god he observed if you had the good sense to recognize and accept the gift it is no reproach to you and consider he tilted his head to one side like a brown sparrow you have been gone from your place for nearly a year your first husband will have begun to reconcile himself to your loss much as he may have loved you loss is common to all men and we are given means of overcoming it for our good he will have started perhaps to build a new life would it do good for you to desert the man who needs you so deeply and whom you love to whom you are united in the bonds of holy matrimony to return and disrupt this new life and in particular if you were to go back from a sense of duty but feeling that your heart is given elsewhere no he shook his head decisively no man can serve two masters and no more can a woman now if that were your only valid marriage and this he nodded again toward the guest wing merely an irregular attachment then your duty might lie elsewhere but you were bound by god and i think you may honor your duty to the chevalier now as to the other aspect what you shall do that may require some discussion he pulled his feet from the water and dried them on the skirt of his habit let us adjourn this meeting to the abbey kitchens where perhaps brother eulogius may be persuaded to provide us with a warming drink finding a stray bit of bread on the ground i tossed it to the carp and stooped to put my sandals on i cant tell you what a relief it is to talk to someone about it i said and i still cant get over the fact that you really do believe me he shrugged gallantly offering me an arm to hold while i slipped the rough straps of the sandal over my instep ma chère i serve a man who multiplied the loaves and fishes he smiled nodding at the pool where the swirls of the carps feeding were still subsiding who healed the sick and raised the dead shall i be astonished that the master of eternity has brought a young woman through the stones of the earth to do his will well i reflected it was better than being denounced as the whore of babylon the kitchens of the abbey were warm and cavelike the arching roof blackened with centuries of greasefilled smoke brother eulogius up to his elbows in a vat of dough nodded a greeting to anselm and called in french to one of the lay brothers to come and serve us we found a seat out of the bustle and sat down with two cups of ale and a plate containing a hot pastry of some kind i pushed the plate toward anselm too preoccupied to be interested in food let me put it this way i said choosing my words carefully if i knew that some harm was going to occur to a group of people should i feel obliged to try to avert it anselm rubbed his nose reflectively on his sleeve the heat of the kitchen was beginning to make it run in principle yes he agreed but it would depend also upon a number of other things what is the risk to yourself and what are your other obligations also what is the chance of your success i havent the faintest idea of any of those things except obligation of course i mean theres jamie but hes one of the group who might be hurt he broke off a piece of pastry and passed it to me steaming i ignored it studying the surface of my ale the two men i killed i said either of them might have had children if i hadnt killed them they might have done i made a helpless gesture with the cup who knows what they might have done i may have affected the future no i have affected the future and i dont know how and thats what frightens me so much um anselm grunted thoughtfully and motioned to a passing lay brother who hastened over with a fresh pasty and more ale he refilled both cups before speaking if you have taken life you have also preserved it how many of the sick you have treated would have died without your intervention they also will affect the future what if a person you have saved should commit an act of great evil is that your fault should you on that account have let that person die of course not he rapped his pewter mug on the table for emphasis you say that you are afraid to take any actions here for fear of affecting the future this is illogical madame everyones actions affect the future had you remained in your own place your actions would still have affected what was to happen no less than they will now you have still the same responsibilities that you would have had then that any man has at any time the only difference is that you may be in a position to see more exactly what effects your actions have and then again you may not he shook his head looking steadily across the table the ways of the lord are hidden to us and no doubt for good reason you are right ma chère the laws of the church were not formulated with situations such as yours in mind and therefore you have little guidance other than your own conscience and the hand of god i cannot tell you what you should do or not do you have free choice so have all the others in this world and history i believe is the cumulation of all those actions some individuals are chosen by god to affect the destinies of many perhaps you are one of those perhaps not i do not know why you are here you do not know it is likely that neither of us will ever know he rolled his eyes comically sometimes i dont even know why i am here i laughed and he smiled in return he leaned toward me across the rough planks of the table intense your knowledge of the future is a tool given to you as a shipwrecked castaway might find himself in possession of a knife or a fishing line it is not immoral to use it so long as you do so in accordance with the dictates of gods law to the best of your ability he paused drew a deep breath and blew it out in an explosive sigh that ruffled his silky mustache he smiled and that ma chère madame is all i can tell you no more than i can tell any troubled soul who comes to me for advice put your trust in god and pray for guidance he shoved the fresh pastry toward me but whatever you are to do you will require strength for it so take one last bit of advice when in doubt eat when i came into jamies room in the evening he was asleep head pillowed on his forearms the empty broth bowl sat virtuously on the tray the untouched platter of bread and meat beside it i looked from the innocent dreaming face to the platter and back i touched the bread my finger left a slight depression in the moist surface fresh i left him asleep and went in search of brother roger who i found in the buttery did he eat the bread and meat i demanded without preliminaries brother roger smiled in his fluffy beard yes did he keep it down no i eyed him narrowly you didnt clean up after him i hope he was amused the round cheeks pink above his beard would i dare no he took the precaution of having a basin ready in case damn wily scot i said laughing despite myself i returned to his chamber and kissed him lightly on the forehead he stirred but didnt wake heeding father anselms advice i took the platter of fresh bread and meat back to my chamber for my own supper thinking i would give jamie time to recover both from pique and indigestion i stayed in my own room most of the next day reading an herbal brother ambrose had provided me after lunch i went to check on my recalcitrant patient instead of jamie though i found murtagh sitting on a stool tilted back against the wall wearing a bemused expression where is he i said looking blankly around the room murtagh jerked a thumb toward the window it was a cold dark day and the lamps were lit the window was uncovered and the chilly draft set the little flame fluttering in its dish he went out i asked incredulously where why and what on earth is he wearing jamie had remained largely naked over the last several days since the room was warm and any pressure on his healing wounds was painful he had worn a monks outer robe when leaving his room on necessary short excursions with the support of brother roger but the robe was still present neatly folded at the foot of the bed murtagh rocked his stool forward and regarded me owlishly how many questions is that four he held up one hand index finger pointing up one aye he went out the middle finger rose two where damned if i know the fourth finger joined its companions three why he said he was tired of bein cooped up indoors the little finger waggled briefly four also damned if i know he wasna wearin anything at all last time i saw him murtagh folded all four fingers and stuck out his thumb ye didna ask me but hes been gone an hour or so i fumed at a loss as to what to do since the offender wasnt available i snapped at murtagh instead dont you know its near freezing out there and snow coming on why didnt you stop him and what do you mean he isnt wearing anything the diminutive clansman was tranquil aye i know it reckon he does too not bein blind as for stoppin him i tried he nodded at the robe on the bed when he said he was goin out i said he wasna fit for it and youd have my head did i let him go i snatched up his gown and set my back against the door and told him he wasna leavin unless he was prepared to go through me murtagh paused then said irrelevantly ellen mackenzie had the sweetest smile i ever saw would warm a man to the backbone just to see it so you let her fatheaded son go out and freeze to death i said impatiently whats his mothers smile to do with it murtagh rubbed his nose meditatively weel when i said i wouldna let him pass young jamie just looked at me for a moment then he gave me a smile looked just like his mas and stepped out of the window in naught but his skin by the time i got to the window he was gone i rolled my eyes heavenward reckoned i should let ye know where hed gone murtagh continued so yed no be worrit for him so id no be worrit for him i muttered under my breath as i strode toward the stables hed better be worrit when i catch up to him there was only the one main road heading inland i rode along it at a good pace keeping an eye on the fields as i passed this part of france was a rich farming area and luckily most of the forest had been cleared wolves and bears would not be as much a danger as they might be further inland as it happened i found him barely a mile beyond the gates of the monastery sitting on one of the ancient roman milemarkers that dotted the roads he was barefoot but otherwise clad in a short jerkin and thin breeches the property of one of the stable lads to judge from the stains on them i reined up and stared at him for a moment leaning on the pommel your nose is blue i remarked conversationally i glanced downward and so are your feet he grinned and wiped his nose on the back of his hand so are my balls want to warm them for me cold or not he was plainly in good spirits i slid off the horse and stood in front of him shaking my head its no use at all is it i asked what isnt he rubbed his hand on the ragged breeches being angry with you you dont care a bit whether you give yourself pneumonia or get eaten by bears or worry me half to death do you well im no much worrit about the bears they sleep in the winter ye know i lost my temper and swung my hand at him intending to slap his ear through the side of his head he caught my wrist and held it without difficulty laughing at me after a moments fruitless struggle i gave up and laughed too are you coming back now i asked or have you got anything else to prove he gestured back along the road with his chin take the horse back to that big oak tree and wait for me there ill walk that far alone i bit my tongue to repress the several remarks i felt bubbling to the surface and mounted at the oak tree i got off and looked down the road after a moment though i found i couldnt bear to watch his labored progress when he fell the first time i clutched the reins tight in my gloved hands then resolutely turned my back and waited we barely made it back to the guests wing but managed staggering through the corridor his arm looped over my shoulder for support i spotted brother roger anxiously lurking in the hall and sent him scampering for a warming pan while i steered my awkward burden into the chamber and dumped him onto the bed he grunted at the impact but lay still eyes closed as i proceeded to strip the filthy rags off him all right in you get he rolled obediently under the covers i held back for him i thrust the warming pan hastily between the sheets at the foot of the bed and shoved it back and forth when i removed it he stretched his long legs down and relaxed with a blissful sigh as his feet reached the pocket of warmth i went quietly about the room picking up the discarded clothes straightening the trifling disorder on the table putting fresh charcoal in the brazier adding a pinch of elecampane to sweeten the smoke i thought he was asleep and was startled when he spoke behind me claire yes i love you oh i was mildly surprised but undeniably pleased i love you too he sighed and opened his eyes halfway randall he said toward the end thats what he wanted i was even more startled by this and replied cautiously oh aye his eyes were fixed on the open window where the snow clouds filled the space with a deep even grey i was lying on the floor and he was lying next to me he was naked by then too and both of us were smeared with blood and other things i remember trying to lift my head and feeling my cheek stuck to the stone of the floor with dried blood he frowned a distant look in his eyes as he conjured the memory i was far gone by then so far that i didna even feel much pain i was just terribly tired and everything seemed far away and not very real just as well i said with some asperity and he smiled briefly aye just as well i was drifting a bit halffainted i expect so i dont know how long we both lay there but i came awake to find him holding me and pressing himself against me he hesitated as though the next part were difficult to say id not fought him til then but i was so tired and i thought i couldna bear it again anyway i started to squirm away from him not really fighting just pulling back he had his arms round my neck and he pulled on me and buried his face in my shoulder and i could feel he was crying i couldna tell what he was saying for a bit and then i could he was saying i love you i love you over and over with his tears and his spittle running down my chest jamie shuddered briefly from cold or memory he blew out a long breath disturbing the cloud of fragrant smoke that swirled near the ceiling i canna think why i did it but i put my arms about him and we just lay still for a bit he stopped crying finally and kissed me and stroked me then he whispered to me tell me that you love me he paused in the recital smiling faintly i would not do it i dinna know why by then i would ha licked his boots and called him the king of scotland if hed wanted it but i wouldna tell him that i dont even remember thinking about it i just wouldnt he sighed and his good hand twitched gripping the coverlet he used me again hard and he kept on saying it tell me that you love me alex say that you love me he called you alex i interrupted not able to hold back aye i remember i wondered how he knew my second name did not occur to me to wonder why hed use it even if he knew he shrugged anyway i didna move or say a word and when hed finished he jumped up as though hed gone mad and started to beat me with something i could not see what cursing and shouting at me saying you know you love me tell me so i know its true i got my arms up over my head to protect it and after a bit i must have fainted again because the pain in my shoulders was the last i remember except for sort of a dream about bellowing kine then i woke jouncing along bellydown on a horse for a few moments and then nothing again til i came round on the hearthside at eldridge with you looking down on me he closed his eyes again his tone was dreamy almost unconcerned i think if i had told him that he would have killed me some people have nightmares peopled by monsters i dreamed of genealogical charts thin black branches bearing clusters of dates on every stem the lines like snakes with death between the brackets of their jaws once again i heard franks voice saying he became a soldier a good choice for a second son there was a third brother who became a curate but i dont know much about him i didnt know much about him either only his name there were the three sons listed on that chart the sons of joseph and mary randall i had seen it many times the oldest william and the second jonathan and the third alexander jamie spoke again summoning me from my thoughts sassenach yes ye know the fortress i told ye of the one inside me i remember he smiled without opening his eyes and reached out a hand for me well ive a leanto built at least and a roof to keep out the rain i went to bed tired but peaceful and wondering jamie would recover when that had been in doubt i had looked no further than the next hour the next meal the next administration of medicine but now i needed to look further the abbey was a sanctuary but only a temporary one we could not stay here indefinitely no matter how hospitable the monks scotland and england were too dangerous by far unless lord lovat could help a remote contingency under the circumstances our future must lie on this side of the channel knowing what i now knew about jamies seasickness i understood his reluctance to consider emigration to america three months of nausea was a daunting prospect to anyone so what was left france was the most likely we both spoke french fluently while jamie could do as well in spanish german or italian i was not so linguistically blessed also the fraser family was rich in connections here perhaps we could find a place on an estate owned by a relative or friend and live peacefully in the country the idea held considerable attractions but there remained as always the question of time it was the beginning of the new year was but two weeks past and in bonnie prince charlie would take ship from france to scotland the young pretender come to claim his fathers throne with him would come disaster war and slaughter the crushing of the highland clans and with them the butchery of all that jamie and i held dear and between now and then there lay one year one year when things might happen when steps might be taken to prevent disaster how and by what means i had no idea but neither had i any doubts about the consequences of inaction could events be changed perhaps my fingers stole to my left hand and idly caressed the gold ring on my fourth finger i thought of what i had said to jonathan randall burning with rage and horror in the dungeons under wentworth prison i curse you i had said with the hour of your death and i had told him when he would die had told him the date written on the genealogical chart in franks fine black calligraphic script april jonathan randall was to die at the battle of culloden caught up in the slaughter that the english would create but he didnt he had died instead a few hours later trampled beneath the hooves of my revenge and he had died a childless bachelor or at least i thought so the chart that cursed chart had given the date of his marriage sometime in and the birth of his son franks fivetimesgreatgrandfather soon after if jack randall was dead and childless how would frank be born and yet his ring was still upon my hand he had existed would exist i comforted myself with the thought rubbing the ring in the darkness as though it contained a jinni that could advise me i woke out of a sound sleep sometime later with a halfscream ssh tis only me the large hand lifted from my mouth with the candle out the room was pitchblack i groped blindly until my hand struck something solid you shouldnt be out of bed i exclaimed still groggy with sleep my fingers slid over smooth cold flesh youre freezing well of course i am he said somewhat crossly i havena got any clothes on and its perishing in the corridor will ye let me in bed i wriggled as far over as i could in the narrow cot and he slid in naked beside me clutching me for warmth his breathing was uneven and i thought his trembling was from weakness as much as from cold god youre warm he snuggled closer sighing it feels good to hold ye sassenach i didnt bother asking what he was doing there that was becoming quite plain nor did i ask whether he was sure i had my own doubts but would not voice them for fear of making selffulfilling prophecies i rolled to face him mindful of the injured hand there was that sudden startling moment of joining that quick gliding strangeness that at once becomes familiar jamie sighed deeply with satisfaction and perhaps relief we lay still for a moment as though afraid to disturb our fragile link by moving jamies good hand caressed me slowly feeling its way in the dark fingers spread like a cats whiskers sensitive to vibration he moved against me once as though asking a question and i answered him in the same language we began a delicate game of slow movements a balancing act between his desire and his weakness between pain and the growing pleasure of the body somewhere in the dark i thought to myself that i must tell anselm that there was another way to make time stop but then thought perhaps not as it was not a way open to a priest i held jamie steady with a light hand on his scarred back he set our rhythm but let me carry the force of our movement we were both silent save our breathing until the end feeling him tiring i grasped him firmly and pulled him to me rocking my hips to take him deeper forcing him toward the climax now i said softly come to me now he put his forehead hard against mine and yielded himself to me with a quivering sigh the victorians called it the little death and with good reason he lay so limp and heavy that i would have thought him dead if not for the slow thump of his heart against my ribs it seemed a long time before he stirred and mumbled something against my shoulder what did you say he turned his head so his mouth was just below my ear i felt warm breath on my neck i said he answered softly my hand doesna hurt at all just now the good hand gently explored my face smoothing away the wetness on my cheeks were ye afraid for me he asked yes i said i thought it was too soon he laughed softly in the dark it was i almost killed myself aye i was afraid too but i woke with my hand painin me and couldna go back to sleep i was tossing about feeling lonely for ye the more i thought about ye the more i wanted ye and i was halfway down the corridor before i thought to worry about what i was going to do when i got here and once i thought he paused stroking my cheek well im no verra good sassenach but im maybe not a coward after all i turned my head to meet his kiss his stomach rumbled loudly dont laugh you he grumbled its your fault starving me its a wonder i could manage at all on nothing but beef broth and ale all right i said still laughing you win you can have an egg for your breakfast tomorrow ha he said in tones of deep satisfaction i knew yed feed me if i offered ye a suitable inducement we fell asleep face to face locked in each others arms chapter from the womb of the earth over the next two weeks jamie continued to heal and i continued to wonder some days i would feel that we must go to rome where the pretenders court held sway and do what other times i wanted with all my heart only to find a safe and isolated spot to live our lives in peace it was a warm bright day and the icicles hanging from the gargoyles noses dripped incessantly leaving deep ragged pits in the snow beneath the eaves the door of jamies room had been left ajar and the window uncovered to clear out some of the lingering vapors of smoke and illness i poked my head cautiously around the jamb not wishing to wake him if he was asleep but the narrow cot was empty he was seated by the open window turned half away from the door so that his face was mostly hidden he was desperately thin still but the shoulders were broad and straight beneath the rough fabric of the novices habit and the grace of his strength was returning he sat solidly without a tremor back straight and legs curled back beneath the stool the lines of his body firm and harmonious he was holding his right wrist with his sound left hand slowly turning the right hand in the sunlight there was a small pile of cloth strips on the table he had removed the bandages from the injured hand and was examining it closely i stood in the doorway not moving from here i could see the hand clearly as he turned it back and forth probing gingerly the stigma of the nail wound in the palm of the hand was quite small and well healed i was glad to see no more than a small pink knot of scar tissue that would gradually fade on the back of the hand the situation was not so favorable eroded by infection the wound there covered an area the size of sixpence still patched with scabs and the rawness of a new scar the middle finger too showed a jagged ridge of pink scar tissue running from just below the first joint almost to the knuckle released from their splints the thumb and index finger were straight but the little finger was badly twisted that one had had three separate fractures i remembered and apparently i had not been able to set them all properly the ring finger was set oddly so that it protruded slightly upward when he laid the hand flat on the table as he did now turning the hand palm upward he began to manipulate the fingers gently none would bend more than an inch or two the ring finger not at all as i had feared the second joint was likely permanently frozen he turned the hand to and fro holding it before his face watching the stiff twisted fingers and the ugly scars mercilessly vivid in the sunlight then he suddenly bent his head clutching the injured hand to his chest covering it protectively with the sound one he made no sound but the wide shoulders trembled briefly jamie i crossed the room swiftly and knelt beside him putting my hand softly on his knee jamie im sorry i said i did the best i could he looked down at me in astonishment the thick auburn lashes sparkled with tears in the sunlight and he dashed them hastily away with the back of his hand what he said gulping clearly taken aback by my sudden appearance sorry for what sassenach your hand i reached out and took it lightly tracing the crooked lines of the fingers touching the sunken scar on the back it will get better i assured him anxiously really it will i know it seems stiff and useless right now but thats only because its been splinted so long and the bones havent fully knitted yet i can show you how to exercise and massage youll get back a good deal of the use of it honestly he stopped me by laying his good hand along my cheek did you mean he started then stopped shaking his head in disbelief you thought he stopped once more and started over sassenach he said ye didna think that i was grieving for a stiff finger and a few more scars he smiled a little crookedly im a vain man maybe but it doesna go that deep i hope but you i began he took both my hands in both of his and stood up drawing me to my feet i reached up and smoothed away the single tear that had rolled down his cheek the tiny smear of moisture was warm on my thumb i was crying for joy my sassenach he said softly he reached out slowly and took my face between his hands and thanking god that i have two hands that i have two hands to hold you with to serve you with to love you with thanking god that i am a whole man still because of you i put my own hands up cupping his but why wouldnt you be i asked and then i remembered the butcherous assortment of saws and knives i seen among beatons implements at leoch and i knew knew what i had forgotten when i had been faced with the emergency that in the days before antibiotics the usual the only cure for an infected extremity was amputation of the limb oh jamie i said i was weakkneed at the thought and sat down on the stool rather abruptly i never thought of it i said still stunned i honestly never thought of it i looked up at him jamie if id thought of it i probably would have done it to save your life its not how they dont do it that way then in your time i shook my head no there are drugs to stop infections so i didnt even think of it i marveled i looked up suddenly did you he nodded i was expecting it its why i asked you to let me die that once i was thinking of it in between the bouts of muzzyheadedness and just for that one moment i didna think i could bear to live like that its what happened to ian ye know no really i was shocked he told me hed lost it by grape shot but i didnt think to ask about the details aye a grapeshot wound in the leg went bad the surgeons took it off to keep it from poisoning his blood he paused ian does verra well all things considered but he hesitated pulling on the stiff ring finger i knew him before hes as good as he is only because of jenny she keeps him whole he smiled sheepishly at me as ye did for me i canna think why women bother well i said softly women like to do that he laughed quietly and drew me close aye god knows why we stood entwined for a bit not moving my forehead rested on his chest my arms around his back and i could feel his heart beating slow and strong finally he stirred and released me ive something to show ye he said he turned and opened the small drawer of the table removing a folded letter which he handed to me it was a letter of introduction from abbot alexander commending his nephew james fraser to the attention of the chevalierst george otherwise known as his majesty king james of scotland as a most proficient linguist and translator its a place jamie said watching as i folded the letter and well need a place to go soon but what ye told me on the hill at craigh na dun that was true no i took a deep breath and nodded its true he took the letter from me and tapped it thoughtfully on his knee then this he waved the letter is not without a bit of danger it could be he tossed the parchment into the drawer and sat staring after it for a moment then he looked up and the dark blue eyes held mine he laid a hand along my cheek i meant it claire he said quietly my life is yours and its yours to decide what we shall do where we go next to france to italy even back to scotland my heart has been yours since first i saw ye and youve held my soul and body between your two hands here and kept them safe we shall go as ye say there was a light knock at the door and we sprang apart like guilty lovers i dabbed hastily at my hair thinking that a monastery while an excellent convalescent home lacked something as a romantic retreat a lay brother came in at jamies bidding and dumped a large leather saddlebag on the table from macrannoch of eldridge manor he said with a grin for my lady broch tuarach he bowed then and left leaving a faint breath of seawater and cold air behind i unbuckled the leather straps curious to see what macrannoch might have sent inside were three things a note unaddressed and unsigned a small package addressed to jamie and the cured skin of a wolf smelling strongly of the tanners arts the note read for a virtuous woman is a pearl of great price and her value is greater than rubies jamie had opened the other parcel he held something small and glimmering in one hand and was quizzically regarding the wolf pelt a bit odd that sir marcus has sent ye a wolf pelt sassenach and me a pearl bracelet perhaps hes got his labels mixed the bracelet was a lovely thing a single row of large baroque pearls set between twisted gold chains no i said admiring it hes got it right the bracelet goes with the necklace you gave me when we wed he gave that to your mother did you know no i didnt he answered softly touching the pearls father gave them to me for my wife whoever she was to be and a quick smile tugged at his mouth but he didna tell me where they came from i remembered sir marcuss help on the night we had burst so unceremoniously into his house and the look on his face when we had left him next day i could see from jamies face that he also was remembering the baronet who might have been his father he reached out and took my hand fastening the bracelet about my wrist but its not for me i protested aye it is he said firmly it isna suitable for a man to send jewelry to a respectable married woman so he gave it to me but clearly its for you he looked at me and grinned for one thing it wont go round my wrist even scrawny as i am he turned to the bundled wolfskin and shook it out whyever did macrannoch send ye this though he draped the shaggy wolfhide about his shoulders and i recoiled with a sharp cry the head had been carefully skinned and cured as well and equipped with a pair of yellow glass eyes it was glaring nastily at me from jamies left shoulder ugh i said it looks just like it did when it was alive jamie following the direction of my glance turned his head and found himself suddenly facetoface with the snarling countenance with a startled exclamation he jerked the skin off and flung it across the room jesus god he said and crossed himself the skin lay on the floor glowering balefully in the candlelight what dye mean when it was alive sassenach a personal friend was it jamie asked eyeing it narrowly i told him then the things i had had no chance to tell him about the wolf and the other wolves and hector and the snow and the cottage with the bear and the argument with sir marcus and the appearance of murtagh and the cattle and the long wait on the hillside in the pink mist of the snowswept night waiting to see whether he was dead or alive thin or not his chest was broad and his arms warm and strong he pressed my face into his shoulder and rocked me while i sobbed i tried for a bit to control myself but he only hugged me harder and said small and gentle things into the cloud of my hair and i finally gave up and cried with the complete abandon of a child until i was worn to utter limpness and hiccupping exhaustion come to think of it ive a wee giftie for ye myself sassenach he said smoothing my hair i sniffed and wiped my nose on my skirt having nothing else handy im sorry i havent got anything to give you i said watching as he stood up and began to dig through the tumbled bedclothes probably looking for a handkerchief i thought sniffing some more aside from such minor gifts as my life my manhood and my right hand he asked dryly theyll do nicely mo duinne he straightened up with a novices robe in one hand undress my mouth fell open what undress sassenach and put this on he handed me the robe grinning or do ye want me to turn my back first clutching the rough homespun around me i followed jamie down yet another flight of dark stairs this was the third and the narrowest yet the lantern he held lit the stone blocks of walls no more than eighteen inches apart it felt rather like being swallowed up into the earth as we went further and further down the narrow black shaft are you sure you know where youre going i asked my voice echoed in the stairwell but with a curiously muffled sound as though i were speaking underwater well theres no much chance of taking the wrong turning now is there we had reached another landing but true enough the way ahead lay in only one direction down at the bottom of this flight of steps though we came to a door there was a small landing carved out of the solid side of a mountain from the looks of it and a wide low door made of oak planks and brass hinging the planks were grey with age but still solid and the landing swept clean plainly this part of the monastery was still in use then the wine cellar perhaps there was a sconce near the door that held a torch halfburnt from previous use jamie paused to light it with a paper spill from the pile that lay ready nearby then pushed open the unlocked door and ducked beneath the lintel leaving me to follow at first i could see nothing at all inside but the glow of jamies lantern everything was black the lantern bobbed along moving away from me i stood still following the blob of light with my eyes every few feet he would stop then continue and a slow flame would rise up in his wake to burn in a small red glow as my eyes slowly accustomed themselves the flames became a row of lanterns situated on rock pillars shining into the black like beacons it was a cave at first i thought it was a cave of crystals because of the odd black shimmer beyond the lanterns but i stepped forward to the first pillar and looked beyond and then i saw it a clear black lake transparent water shimmering like glass over fine black volcanic sand giving off red reflections in the lantern light the air was damp and warm humid with the steam that condensed on the cool cavern walls running down the ribbed columns of rock a hot spring the faint scent of sulfur bit at my nostrils a hot mineral spring then i remembered anselms mentioning the springs that bubbled up from the ground near the abbey renowned for their healing powers jamie stood behind me looking out over the gently steaming expanse of jet and rubies a hot bath he said proudly do ye like it jesus h roosevelt christ i said oh ye do he said grinning at the success of his surprise come in then he dropped his own robe and stood glowing dimly in the darkness patched with red in the glimmering reflections off the water the arched ceiling of the cave seemed to swallow the light of the lanterns so that the glow reached only a few feet before being engulfed a little hesitantly i let the novices robe drop from my arms how hot is it i asked hot enough he answered dinna worry it wont burn ye but stay over an hour or so and it might cook the flesh off your bones like soupmeat what an appealing idea i said discarding the robe following his straight slender figure i stepped cautiously into the water there were steps cut in the stone leading down underwater with a knotted rope fastened along the wall to provide handholds the water flowed up over my hips and the flesh of my belly shivered in delight as the heat swirled through me at the bottom of the steps i stood on clean black sand the water just below the level of my shoulders my breasts floating like glass fisherfloats my skin was flushed with the heat and small prickles of perspiration were starting on the back of my neck under the heavy hair it was pure bliss the surface of the spring was smooth and waveless but the water wasnt still i could feel small stirrings currents running through the body of the pool like nerve impulses it was that i suppose added to the incredible soothing heat that gave me the momentary illusion that the spring was alive a warm welcoming entity that reached out to soothe and embrace anselm had said that the springs had healing powers and i wasnt disposed to doubt it jamie came up behind me tiny wavelets marking his passage through the water he reached around me to cup my breasts softly smoothing the hot water over the upper slopes do ye like it mo duinne he bent forward and planted a kiss on my shoulder i let my feet float out from under me resting against him its wonderful its the first time ive been warm all the way through since august he began to tow me backing slowly through the water my legs streamed out in the wake of our passage the amazing warmth passing down my limbs like caressing hands he stopped swung me around and lowered me gently onto hard wood halfvisible in the shadowy underwater light i could see planks set into a rocky niche he sat down on the bench beside me stretching his arms out on the rocky ledge behind us brother ambrose brought me down here the other day to soak he said to soften the scars a bit it does feel good doesnt it more than good the water was so buoyant that i felt i might float away if i loosed my hold on the bench i looked upward into the black shadows of the roof does anything live in this cave bats i mean or fish he shook his head nothing but the spirit of the spring sassenach the water bubbles up from the earth through a narrow crack back there he nodded toward the stygian blackness at the back of the cave and trickles out through a dozen tiny openings in the rock but theres no real opening to the outside save the door into the monastery spirit of the spring i said amused sounds rather pagan to be hiding under a monastery he stretched luxuriously long legs wavering under the glassy surface like the stems of water plants well whatever ye wish to call it its been here a good deal longer than the monastery yes i can see that the walls of the cave were of smooth dark volcanic rock almost like black glass slick with the moisture of the spring the whole chamber looked like a gigantic bubble halffilled with that curiously alive but sterile water i felt as though we were cradled in the womblike center of the earth and that if i pressed my ear to the rock i would hear the infinitely slow beat of a great heart nearby we were very quiet for a long time then halffloating halfdreaming brushing now and then against each other as we drifted in the unseen currents of the cave when i spoke at last my voice seemed slow and drugged ive decided ah will it be rome then jamies voice seemed to come from a long way away yes i dont know once there it doesna matter we shall do what we can his hand reached for me moving so slowly i thought it would never touch me he drew me close until the sensitive tips of my breasts rubbed across his chest the water was not only warm but heavy almost oily to the touch and his hands floated down my back to cup my buttocks and lift me the intrusion was startling hot and slippery as our skins were we drifted over each other with barely a sensation of touching or pressure but his presence within me was solid and intimate a fixed point in a watery world like an umbilical cord in the random driftings of the womb i made a brief sound of surprise at the small inrush of hot water that accompanied his entrance then settled firmly onto my fixed point of reference with a little sigh of pleasure oh i like that one he said appreciatively like what i asked that sound that ye made the little squeak it wasnt possible to blush my skin was already as flushed as it could get i let my hair swing forward to cover my face the curls relaxing as they dragged the surface of the water im sorry i didnt mean to be noisy he laughed the deep sound echoing softly in the columns of the roof i said i like it and i do its one of the things i like the best about bedding ye sassenach the small noises that ye make he pulled me closer so my forehead rested against his neck moisture sprang up at once between us slick as the sulfurladen water he made a slight movement with his hips and i drew in my breath in a halfstifled gasp yes like that he said softly or like that urk i said he laughed again but kept doing it thats what i thought most about he said drawing his hands slowly up and down my back cupping curving tracing the swell of my hips in prison at night chained in a room with a dozen other men listening to the snoring and farting and groaning i thought of those small tender sounds that ye make when i love you and i could feel ye there next to me in the dark breathing soft and then faster and the little grunt that ye give when i first take you as though ye were settling yourself to your job my breathing was definitely coming faster supported by the dense mineralsaturated water i was buoyant as an oiled feather kept from floating away only by my grip on the curved muscles of his shoulders and the snug firm clasp i kept of him lower down even better his voice was a hot murmur in my ear when i come to ye fierce and wanting and ye whimper under me and struggle as though you wanted to get away and i know its only that youre struggling to come closer and im fighting the same fight his hands were exploring gently slowly as tickling a trout sliding deep into the rift of my buttocks gliding lower groping caressing the stretched and yearning point of our joining i quivered and the breath went from me in an unwilled gasp or when i come to you needing and ye take me into you with a sigh and that quiet hum like a hive of bees in the sun and ye carry me wi you into peace with a little moaning sound jamie i said hoarsely my voice echoing off the water jamie please not yet mo duinne his hands came hard around my waist settling and slowing me pressing me down until i did groan not yet weve time and i mean to hear ye groan like that again and to moan and sob even though you dinna wish to for ye canna help it i mean to make you sigh as though your heart would break and scream with the wanting and at last to cry out in my arms and i shall know that ive served ye well the rush began between my thighs shooting like a dart into the depths of my belly loosening my joints so that my hands slipped limp and helpless off his shoulders my back arched and the slippery firm roundness of my breasts pressed flat against his chest i shuddered in hot darkness jamies steadying hands all that kept me from drowning resting against him i felt boneless as a jellyfish i didnt know or care what sort of sounds i had been making but i felt incapable of coherent speech until he began to move again strong as a shark under the dark water no i said jamie no i cant bear it like that again the blood was still pounding in my fingertips and his movement within me was an exquisite torture you can for i love ye his voice was halfmuffled in my soaking hair and you will for i want ye but this time i go wi you he held my hips firm against him carrying me beyond myself with the force of an undertow i crashed formless against him like breakers on a rock and he met me with the brutal force of granite my anchor in the pounding chaos boneless and liquid as the water around us contained only by the frame of his hands i cried out the soft bubbling halfchoked cry of a sailor sucked beneath the waves and heard his own cry helpless in return and knew i had served him well we struggled upward out of the womb of the world damp and steaming rubberlimbed with wine and heat i fell to my knees at the first landing and jamie trying to help me fell down next to me in an untidy heap of robes and bare legs giggling helplessly drunk more with love than with wine we made our way side by side on hands and knees up the second flight of steps hindering each other more than helping jostling and caroming softly off each other in the narrow space until we collapsed at last in each others arms on the second landing here an ancient oriel window opened glassless to the sky and the light of the hunters moon washed us in silver we lay clasped together damp skins cooling in the winter air waiting for our racing hearts to slow and breath to return to our heaving bodies the moon above was a christmas moon so large as almost to fill the empty window it seemed no wonder that the tides of sea and woman should be subject to the pull of that stately orb so close and so commanding but my own tides moved no longer to that chaste and sterile summons and the knowledge of my freedom raced like danger through my blood i have a gift for you too i said suddenly to jamie he turned toward me and his hand slid large and sure over the plane of my stillflat stomach have you now he said and the world was all around us new with
