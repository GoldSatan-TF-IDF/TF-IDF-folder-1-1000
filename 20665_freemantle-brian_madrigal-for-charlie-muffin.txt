madrigal for charlie muffin brian freemantle prologue it was an assassination method the russians had perfected the bullet softnosed and lightly packed from an adapted tokarev automatic there had been no exit wound just an instantaneous explosion of the heart the photograph showed no distortion of the features the dead man looked as if he might awaken at any moment just like the others had done sir alistair wilson was surprised at that he would have expected an expression of pain the intelligence director pushed the latest file away knowing there was nothing he could learn from it delhi ankara and now bangkok and he was no closer to the traitor now than he had been six months ago when the killings of embassy intelligence residents started wilson felt impotent having to rely so completely upon alexander hotovy the mans defection from the czech embassy in london had been agreed when the assassinations began and was immediately postponed for hotovy a major in the statni tajna bezpecnost the czech intelligence service to earn his asylum by discovering how the british operatives were being pinpointed the initial response had been encouraging perhaps too much so within a week hotovy confirmed that all eastern bloc embassies were receiving via moscow details of british cabinet guidance to overseas ambassadors together with personnel details from which it was easy to isolate intelligence officers in the field then came the stalemate by the time the guidance arrived from russia all indication of original source had been removed which meant wilson knew he had a spy in a british embassy somewhere in the world but not which one the trap had seemed feasible even clever when he devised it that had been six months before and since then two more people had died the irritation of his own ineffectiveness was showing on wilsons face when he looked up at his deputys entry its worked declared peter harkness for a moment wilson didnt speak then he said sure positive thank god for that how long would it take he wondered general valery kalenins car was an official zil authorized to use the exclusive centre lane of moscow roads but the traffic at night was light so the privilege reserved for members of the soviet hierarchy was unnecessary kalenins driver still used it he enjoyed the advantage of power more than the kgb chief the zil swept past kutuzovsky prospect and the kremlin towards dzerzhinsky square that days overseas files and reports were waiting for him neatly arranged in order of their lateafternoon transmission kalenin unfastened his jacket lit a tubefiltered cigarette and settled down to work he read steadily and carefully annotating margin notes from which his deputies could initiate action the following day for years kalenin had maintained an office cleaner at the british embassy in cairo usually the information was of lowlevel interest little more than the occasional indiscretion from a wastepaper basket from which they had to make a surmise but sometimes there was something worthwhile like tonight kalenin had a retentive memory and saw the significance at once a meticulously cautious man he went to the filing cabinet where the intelligence from his top agents was kept and located at once what he wanted turning the shade of his angled light upon an identical message he had received a month earlier identical but for one thing the source of the first message was listed as cape town the origin of the second which he had upon his desk was given as lagos from the advice docket attached to the initial information he saw that it had been transmitted a week before to the warsaw pact capitals for guidance to their embassies kalenin returned to his desk and for a long time stared sightlessly at the wall a trap had been set and he had fallen into it and it could hardly have happened at a worse time the qualification came almost at once if he were clever it could be worse for others british and soviet intelligence operations began within twentyfour hours of each other one to uncover the other to conceal the russians had the advantage kalenin had anticipated the possibility and had the framework of a protection operation ready he went again to the filing cabinets for the dossier on charlie muffin charlie muffin jarred stiffkneed along cheyne walk head bent to concentrate upon the pavement cracks easy to make a straight line always had been just fix on the pavement joins and left right foot either side like the policestation tests in the old days before the breathalyzer done it a dozen times pissed as a monkey never pulled department weight until it became absolutely necessary rarely had been always able to make the straight walk enunciate the trick phrases from the card without denting the words sherrys a difficult one when youre brahms and liszt always clever to use that just a sherry officer maybe two national service reunion get together with the boys you know the sort of thing should have remembered the pills of course trying a new treatment for the migraine nasty business malaya nasty wound too not much to talk about really lucky to have made it so the doctors say should have warned me about the pills though silly buggers terribly sorry guarantee it wont happen again that a korea ribbon north africa christ now that must have been a war course it wont happen again officer solemn promise bit different now couldnt defeat the progress of science blow into the bag pee in the bottle blood smear under the microscope and there you were fucked without a kiss charlie looked up neck aching from the effort to his right the bridge illuminations necklaced the thames chokers of ambers and yellows and whites and reds charlie blinked trying to sharpen the blur too bright to be battersea bridge the albert then shit hed done it again he peered across the road for confirmation and got it from the road sign oakley street second time it had happened recently or was it the third he couldnt remember didnt matter anyway missing battersea bridge did probably easier to go back why bother he wasnt going anywhere not tonight or any other night charlie reached out for the support of the metalwork swinging himself into position to cross the bridge for the roundabout route to his battersea flat the footpath ribboned away ahead of him and charlie paused for a moment breathing deeply like an olympic athlete preparing himself for the run that would win the gold the pavement cracks thats all he needed a line of pavement cracks he started out head forward again left right left right the impact against the concrete hard beneath his heels used this bridge a lot in the early days vauxhall and lambeth too mattered then to vary the route not just on foot either underground during the rush hour when there were people among whom he could get lost buses too and a taxi when hed thought there was something suspicious and needed care a cautious circuitous route tensed for any backstreet dodging never suspicious any more no one was chasing charlie muffin quite safe to have a few drinks no worry about surveillance he jerked up suddenly grimacing in halfremembered awareness confined space easy to spot so theyd be running parallel observation maybe triangular one behind one in front and the other making the third point on the opposite side of the road charlie turned awkwardly stumbling as his foot edge missed the kerb he snatched sideways grabbing for the wall far behind on the further side of the road a couple meandered entangled in groping love in front a girl was approaching hobbled by a short thighhugging skirt a man strode past him bowler purposefully slanted over his forehead tightly furled umbrella striking the ground in time to his marched progress like a parade sergeants staff too dark and too quick to see the regimental tie but thered be one just like the pricks who took over the department and tried to get him killed screwed them though sucked them up and blew them out in bubbles he frowned trying to remember why he was standing in the middle of the bridge with his back protectively against the parapet surveillance trying to observe the observers he sniggered conscious of the whisky fumes at the back of his throat still good enough to spot them if theyd been there quite safe he decided positively he pulled upright to continue across the river confronting the girl approaching him the skirt was tighter than hed first thought and shorter wasnt wearing a bra either he saw conscious of the bouncing turmoil under the clinging sweater a professional judged charlie with a vague stir of interest he tried quickly to guess how much money he had in his pocket feeling the coin edges and attempting to count the notes holding them unseen separately between his fingers difficult to tell maybe ten pounds more likely five or six where hed counted twice should be sufficient for a short time charlie squared himself ready for the approach the girl detected the interest slowing her walk then quickly checking the traffic in both directions she crossed the roadway heading for chelsea and a better class of client on the opposite side of the river fuck me said charlie inappropriately once more he sniggered no one wanted charlie muffin not even whores or rupert willoughby the thought broke through the drunkenness and he stopped sniggering the call to the lloyds underwriter had been a gesture of desperation the thing hed tried to avoid after what had happened with clarissa in america unavailable the secretary had said bit different from his wife the booze washed through him flooding the reflection charlie resumed his stilted progress left right left right guiding himself by the kerb rim when there werent any paving stones turning westwards at the far side of the bridge and retracing his path through the streets until he got to the tower block in which he hid an ant among other ants there were two bicycles fixed to the stair railings by a security chain and beneath the stairwell an abandoned pushchair robbed of its wheels and squatting on its axle like the mother ant there was a sour odour of dust and cabbage and paraffin someone had written its me against the world with an aerosol can across the far wall hope you win muttered charlie he hadnt the lift was broken which was usual so he stumped up the stairs pausing at each floor breath wheezing from him his legs ached with the effort and by the time he reached the fourteenth storey he felt ill and sick he reached out supporting himself against the wall it was several minutes before he could go through the linking door into his corridor he stumbled on to the doorway initially missing the lock with his key eventually inside he slumped down without taking off the plastic raincoat which hadnt been necessary anyway because the forecast had been wrong and it hadnt even drizzled buggered he told himself youre completely buggered charlie it hadnt been so difficult when hed first gone on the run often climbed the stairs then to check if anyone was following ducking in and out of landings ears strained for the sound of pursuit hed done other things too in the surveillance detection manual like leaving miniscule fabric placings around the door to detect entry and examining the lock for minute scratches and arranging books and shirts and pocket flaps in certain ways so he would know if thered been a search and always leaving the window open to the fire escape for immediate flight then there had been a reason for it edith had been alive sharing the existence and the fear ageing visibly and trying to hide it i didnt know it was going to be like this edith but trust me well beat the bastards and so shed trusted him like she always had but he hadnt beaten them at the moment when it had mattered when he thought the vengeance hunt had been abandoned hed relaxed and the bullet meant for him had taken away half her spine charlie shook his head an angry physical gesture the recollections of edith were in the closed noentry part of his mind the place of the deepest guilt always came out when he drank too much charlie struggled up moving through the potcluttered kitchen opening cupboards and then the refrigerator staring disappointedly at the agewrinkled tomato and some forgotten celery limp like he would probably have been if the whore hadnt crossed the road hed meant to bring something back from the pub but hed forgotten he seemed to forget a lot of things lately charlie groped back into the main room staring around as if seeing it for the first time the home of the nobody man there were no mementoes or souvenirs or photographs not even of edith it was like a dolls house setting which real people never occupied a small settee and two matching chairs and a cabinet with some books he could never maintain the concentration to read and a television which bored him with its inanities a place to come to out of the rain when the forecasters got it right directly inside the bedroom charlie halted in near fright at the sudden sagshouldered reflection in the wardrobe mirror he still wore the unnecessary raincoat and looked like a bundle that someone had been embarrassed about and tied in polythene before leaving on a rubbish dump about right he thought he undressed letting the clothes puddle about him on the floor but ignored the bed charlie knew it would rise and fall on the sea of booze if he lay down until he had to dash for the bathroom anyway he filled the basin with water and sank his face deeply into it he kept coming up for breath then down again finally panting to a halt and gazing at his dripping poucheyed image broken veins showed bright in his nose and cheeks bloody fool he said the whiskybuoyed bravado was ebbing away they wouldnt have forgotten just one mistake and the hunt would start all over again and he didnt want to get caught any life even one as empty as that he now lived was better than what would happen if they ever found him charlie dried his face and was reentering the bedroom when the telephone which never rang jarred through the tiny apartment his immediate reaction was one of fear he watched it for several moments and then reached out hesitantly hello there was still a vague fog of alcohol in his voice charlie said the voice ive been calling you for hours its rupert willoughby charlie had rehearsed the approach but when the time came he couldnt think of the prepared words instead he said id like to see you good idea said the underwriter ive got a bit of a problem it was a measure of how careless charlie had become that he talked unaware of the listening device that had been implanted in his receiver in the early days he had dismantled it regularly but as with everything else he hadnt bothered for months sure of the man and his movements they recrossed the river after the surveillance ended because the pubs were better in chelsea and pimlico they should not have gathered in a group at all just as they shouldnt have left charlies apartment block until the arrival of the relief team but they had been doing it for so long on monthly rotating shifts that most of the usual rules were being ignored tonight it was the pub on the corner of bessborough place the supposed whore was first the ridiculous shoes had made her feet hurt and she had managed to get a taxi the two who had pretended to be lovers arrived as she was ordering the drinks they went straight to a vacant table waiting for her to carry the glasses across good health said the man lifting the beer mug his fingernails were bitten and he had chipped teeth his breath smelled and the girl in the exaggerated high heels was glad she hadnt been selected to be his partner cheers she said beneath the table she slipped off the shoes and began kneading her feet i actually thought he was going to approach me tonight what would you have done asked the man knowing the answer would upset him she said gone with him of course its been a year protested the other woman its stupid crossing the bridge her partner had touched her breast twice pretending it was an accident but she knew it hadnt been she knew there was no objection she could make either dirty bastard difficult to imagine that he was once so good isnt it said the man reflectively i dont think he ever was said the girl in the prostitutes disguise i think its some typical bureaucratic mistake in moscow the sort of thing they do all the time the man shook his head positively not this one charlie muffin is important for some reason he looked at his watch wed better get back to the embassy the two women looked at each other irritated it was the third night in succession hed avoided buying any drinks and they were sure he was charging more on his expenses than they were this is a shitty job complained the girl who had been fondled really shitty by the time they got back the telephone conversation between charlie and rupert willoughby had already been reported to moscow and kalenin knew the protection he had evolved was possible the priority cables were already arriving from dzerzhinsky square im bored rupert willoughby didnt bother to look up from his book at clarissas protest as usual he said amuse me then im your husband not your jester and fuck all good at either you really shouldnt swear said willoughby you always sound as if youre reading the words from a prompt card fuck she said defiantly still not right said willoughby knowing the condescension would irritate her even more he lowered the book to look at her she was moving listlessly around the apartment lifting and replacing ornaments and running her hand along the top of the furniture jocelyn and arabella have taken the yacht to menton she said i know theyve invited me down they usually do i thought id go why not intent on her reaction he said im seeing charlie muffin tomorrow charlie she stopped the brightness was immediate id love to see him again shed tried hard enough after new york which is what had planted the idea in willoughbys mind after the mans telephone call and the yacht invitation ill ask him to dinner he promised the office of the intelligence director was on the waterloo side of the thames sir alistair wilson asked the driver for the crossover route through parliament square purposely early for the meeting with the permanent under secretary responsible for liaison between the department and the government hed heard the displays were particularly good this year and he wanted to see for himself the rose beds in st jamess park were by the lake bursts of ophelia and pascali and rose gaujard he leaned forward studying with an experts eye the colour lustre and feeling the texture of the leaves growing roses was wilsons hobby and he liked to see a naturalness about their arrangement not this patterned rigidity as if they were sections of some jigsaw puzzle but overarranged or not the blooms were better than his it had to be the soil in hampshire full of chalk when he got the chance hed talk to the gardener about increasing the compost to balance wilson smiled at the thought he was going to do so much when he got the chance distantly somewhere in the direction of the mall a clock bell chimed and he set off towards whitehall for a man who until five years before had commanded a gurkha regiment and been seconded to intelligence with a reputation for efficient discipline wilsons appearance was a personal contradiction careless of the obvious amusement it caused within his working circle he wore a deerstalker because it had flaps he could bring down over his ears in the winter and after so much time in india he suffered from the cold the suit was good but neglected thick tweed again for the cold but the trousers were absolutely without crease although there were lots of the wrong sort crimped tiredly behind the knees and elbows the overcoat of forgotten fashion was too long and overpadded at the shoulders and cuffs and again at the elbows the wear was obvious in another six months it would be threadbare he was bonily thin and the face was hawkish bignosed with sharp attentive eyes greying hair escaped from beneath the hat like a plume heightening the birdlike appearance he moved awkwardly limping where the left knee refused to bend wilson had come unscathed through europe korea and aden but almost lost his leg when a polo pony fell and rolled on him in calcutta for years it had irritated him because of the physical hindrance but now he was only aware of it in the coldest weather when the ache settled deep in his calf after the confetti of memoranda and demands for speed sir alistair knew that the location of the leak coupled with the timing would increase rather than diminish the pressure it was like sailing out of the fog and seeing the rocks only yards away sir berkeley nairehamilton hurried fussily across the office to meet him hand outstretched good to see you my dear fellow good to see you and you said wilson ive tea earl grey im afraid all right youll take it with lemon of course the man bustled around a side table where the tea things were set asking the questions automatically without any wish or expectation of a reply wilson accepted his tea and instead of returning to his ornate overpowering desk nairehamilton seated himself opposite the director on a matching wingbacked chair delighted to hear theres a breakthrough he said im not sure you will be warned wilson what do you mean demanded the permanent civil servant nairehamilton was a floridfaced balding man a rim of tightly clipped white hair hedged around his face there was the hint of a minor stroke or some facial paralysis which had caused the lefthand side to collapse slightly making one eye more pronounced than the other nairehamilton had a tendency to the flamboyant with broadly striped suits and pastel shirts with matching ties it went with the vague foppishness of the office it was traditional whitehall like bowlers and striped trousers with black jackets and vintage dow with stilton the furniture was predominantly georgian bulbouscalved with a lot of leather and there were ceilingtofloor bookcases with volumes that couldnt easily be removed because theyd remained unread for so long that the covers were stuck edge to edge the walls were panelled and hung with portraits of bewigged chancellors and diplomats and there was a large and heavily decorated grandfather clock it ticked with a constantly sticky hesitating tick demanding to be listened to in case it didnt reach the next second wilson found the clock irritating he wasnt sure about nairehamilton either rome announced wilson you cant be serious nairehamilton brought his hand up over his sagging eye a habit of embarrassment i wish i werent thats its nairehamiltons hand moved from his eye in a snatching gesture as if he could pick the proper expression from the air where the traitor is said wilson nairehamilton carefully replaced his teacup on a wine table beside his chair and said tell me why youre so sure four months ago we started transmitting in monitored batches through normal foreign office channels an apparently genuine advisory document recommending the manner of british response to russian efforts to increase its influence throughout africa why africa because we had a lot of embassies to cover and the size of the continent gave us sufficient number of towns and cities i dont understand the document was identical but each message listed a different african city or town from which the intelligence prompting the cable was supposed to have come and each receiving embassy was accorded an identifiable capital the effect was to make each cable individual jolly good said nairehamilton it sounded as if he were applauding the winning six during the annual etonwinchester cricket match three days ago the document was relayed from moscow to all the warsaw pact embassies our source checked back with prague for clarification as we instructed and got the reply that the message emanated from cape town nairehamilton frowned but before the question came wilson said cape town was the code allocation we gave rome there cant be any mistake that couldnt be worse i thought it might be bad the permanent under secretary splayed his fingers to tick off the points in three weeks time italy is hosting a common market summit every european president prime minister foreign minister and god knows how many other ministers will be there the first finger came down chief item on the agenda is an attack mounted by us against italy for using market regulations to avoid their full budgetary contribution he lowered the second finger we intend announcing our intention to lessen our financial commitment to nato unless italy gets into line down went the third finger this year britain has the presidency of the council he threw up his hands in despair and now were going to be shown up as the country to have right in the middle of everything a traitor leaking it all back to moscow i understand the difficulty said the intelligence director nairehamilton seemed to have overlooked that there had been three assassinations perhaps he didnt have enough fingers discretion announced the civil servant what its to be handled with discretion absolute and utter discretion no scandal whatsoever we havent got him yet said wilson there cant be any embarrassment insisted nairehamilton conservative parties labour parties and even social democratic parties might fight elections and dream of power but people like nairehamilton regarded the changes like a bus driver allocated a temporary inspector there might be occasional changes of route but they were always in the driving seat wilson straightened in his chair and the leather elbow patches squeaked against the seat are you telling me you dont want a trial nairehamilton sucked at his breath noisily just giving general guidance my dear fellow more tea perhaps wilson wished the other man wouldnt keep calling him a dear fellow he shook his head against the offer if there were an accident you wouldnt regret not being able formally to endorse the file closed admirably put congratulated the other man and another thing what i think it would be best if you remained in personal charge confusions always arise if things as important as this get delegated i hadnt any intention of delegating anything said wilson glad to hear it dear fellow said nairehamilton he raised his evermoving hands against his forehead in a measuring gesture up to here with traitors and superspies he said for some inexplicable reason the ministry of works which was responsible for government decoration considered buildings south of the river to be modern for which wilson was grateful there was the obligatory bookcase with its stucktogether tomes but otherwise he was spared nairehamiltons working conditions there were even two dora carrington pictures on the wall the window view of the river included st pauls and the furniture was sufficiently contemporary not to make the television set on which wilson sometimes watched afternoon horse racing appear obtrusive since the calcutta accident racing was the nearest he got to horses once theyd been a hobby like roses peter harkness was waiting when wilson returned from his whitehall meeting the deputy intelligence director was an undemonstrative man whose initial training had been as an accountant and who still worried about money he lived separately but beneath the same bayswater roof with a wife to whom he had been married for twenty years and wouldnt consider divorcing because both were practising catholics apart from church on sundays when he carried her missal they were never seen together she went to oldtime dancing wednesdays and fridays and at weekends apart from church harkness sailed his radiocontrolled model of the cutty sark on the round pond in kensington gardens even then he wore a hardcollared shirt and a waistcoat what was the reaction asked harkness what i expected said wilson the instruction is absolute discretion i thought that went with the job no arrest or trial oh said harkness heavily it makes good political sense what about moral sense nairehamiltons morals are political harkness appeared about to challenge the assertion but swallowed it back weve still got a lot of phoney messages to go shall i withdraw them no said wilson at once people had to be involved at the foreign office if we stop theyll know weve got a lead they might even identify it by a process of elimination im not risking another philby situation a protector back here at base all the rome personnel files will be processed by tomorrow promised harkness we might get a lead said wilson doubtfully what about the embassy itself completely isolated from anything sensitive wilson leaned back reflectively in his chair again the leather patches squeaked rudely weve got an advantage there he said what the summit said the director we can move a squad into the embassy as supposed security for the meeting any specific instructions not yet its isolated as you say so theres no danger any more the only risk is that our man might get nervous and run a defection could create the sort of embarrassment nairehamilton is frightened of wilson swivelled his chair towards the window outside a stacked jet waiting for heathrow landing permission appeared to hover over the houses of parliament what about hotovy said the director suddenly his two boys are here in london but his wife is undergoing some sort of medical treatment in brno he wont cross without her no damn hes been as exposed as hell for six months how long before she gets back a week he thinks there wasnt another way i know if his wifes back within the week hes still got a chance just a chance agreed harkness charlie muffin took the better of his two suits from the cleaners bag and laid it on the bed for comparison with the new shirt and tie the trousers were still a bit shiny at the seat and there was a small fray at the turnup on the left leg but overall it was good enough poncy bugger he thought selfcritically conscious of the effort to impress there hadnt been many times when hed bothered marks and spencer he supposed trainee manager a week subsidized canteen two weeks holiday a year and a guaranteed pension his mother had a thing about pensions just like she had about wearing clean underpants every day in case he was ever knocked down in the street and the wedding to edith except that he hadnt managed it then hed meant to like hed meant all the promises hed made to her just slipped his mind in the pub so hed arrived at the registry office with the jacket of the new suit still damp from sponging away the spilled vindaloo of the previous nights stag party curry a hangover that would have felled a bear and had had to excuse himself halfway through the register signing to throw up in the vestry lavatory hadnt done that successfully either so hed reappeared with fresh sponge marks on the suit edith hadnt been lucky from the very beginning charlie took the new suede brush and carried into the kitchen the hush puppies that age had moulded into some sort of comfort for his feet buffing hard to bring up a better nap hed worn new shoes for the job interview and the wedding but he couldnt now charlie muffin had problem feet some days were worse than others today was bad they were not misshapen or deformed or calloused they just ached most of the time hed placed them cautiously into the hands of chiropodists and specialists who recommended supports arches builtup heels shavedaway soles and finished up where hed started with aching feet charlie thought he should have received a pension they were awarded for hernias and other army disabilities and he was bloody sure thats what he had a provable disability from stamping around national service parade grounds in boots weighing a ton and over which theyd made him crouch day after day burning out the toecap lumps with a hot spoon and then polishing and spitting and polishing and spitting to get a shine it was to escape from the parade ground that hed sat the examination for the intelligence corps competing with the sandhurst failures who gargled their words and had mg sports cars to take advantage of the weekend passes they always seemed able to get and beaten the bloody lot with a per cent pass mark straight into a warm office and a comfortable chair which was all initially hed considered it a place to rest his feet and escape the stupidity of scrubbing coal bunkers with toothbrushes and soaping the inside of his trouser creases to keep them in shape for colonels inspection it had come as a surprise to find that he liked it and was good at it where two other investigations had failed hed managed the arrest in vienna of a cipher clerk dealing directly with the russians and been promoted sergeant but even then it hadnt occurred to him that it might become permanent after demob there was still marks and spencer and the guarantee of pension rights three months before demob hed been told without explanation to present himself to whitehall so hed polished the boots and soaped the creases and gone anticipating some escort duty and instead found himself in a highvaulted cavernous room confronting a committee of men who moved and spoke quietly because things echoed and they seemed frightened of the noise disturbing the people next door theyd known everything about him not just what hed done in the army which would have been easy enough from records but before they had the headmasters reference and the marks and spencer personnel file they actually knew what his mother had earned charring to keep him at grammar school in manchester he supposed they knew about the other thing too the blank space on the birth certificate where his fathers name should have been recorded cheeky buggers hed thought so at the time but said nothing what they were offering appealed more than being a trainee manager and the pension terms had been better so his mother was happy enough life would have been a damned sight easier if hed remained a disciple of st michael thought charlie going into the bathroom charlie shaved delicately to avoid cutting himself not wanting to meet rupert willoughby with tiny flags of toilet paper all over his face he wetted his hair to keep it in place but used too much water and knew that when it dried it would stick up it usually did so there wasnt much he could do about it ready long before it was time to leave he surveyed the completed impression standing sideways and holding in his breath and stomach to hide the bulge dissatisfied he turned full frontal squaring his shoulders and stiffening his neck as he had on the longago parade grounds christ he said willoughbys office was close to the main lloyds building in lime street it was the sort of place that never changed there was the same rickety stubborn lift models of boats in glass cases scrolls of honour commemorating past chairmen and employees who had died in both wars lots of dark wood everywhere and the smell of polish rich and enduring thought charlie a million miles from a battersea tenement where the kids thought aerosol sprays had been invented to write fuck on the walls if they had to do it at all it was better than nigger he supposed charlie made his way along the familiar corridors to the receptionist who smiled and said he was expected charlie tightened his stomach secured the buttons of his crisply cleaned suit and pressed his hands over the straying hair it was sticking up like hed feared it would good to see you again charlie said willoughby the underwriter who was a tall man and uncomfortable because of it unfolded rather than stood from behind his desk the office was fittingly traditional there was heavy panelling again the pungent smell of polish the model of a paddle steamer in a case and an almost soundless tape machine spewing a tiny stream of information neatly into a special container good to see you too said charlie guessing the reason for the frown that momentarily crossed the other mans face charlie added had a bad night willoughby thought it looked as if there had been a lot more than one charlie had always been unkempt but never careless willoughby suspected that the shabby suede shoes and departmentstore suits pockets bulged with mysteries had always been a contrived camouflage of anonymity behind which the man operated using the condescension of others to his own advantage the underwriter had never seen charlie muffin in a pressed suit or crisp shirt there was an obvious inference and willoughby was glad of it if charlie hadnt wanted employment it might have been difficult sorry i didnt return your call earlier apologized the underwriter i was out of town thought it was time to make contact again said charlie why did it take you so long because i screwed your wife in america and knew it would continue if i kept in touch thought charlie he was sure after so long that clarissa wouldnt be a problem anymore he said busy with one thing and another thats good said willoughby he was a sparse hesitant man of halfcompleted hurried movements every few moments he brushed back from his forehead an imaginary flop of hair im not any more said charlie quickly the secretary came in carrying a silver coffee tray fully laid even the coffee pot and the jugs were silver if willoughby had had a po under his bed that would have been silver too thought charlie willoughby poured offhandedly he said thought about you a lot clarissa often asks after you charlie remained impassive how is she the underwriter settled back in his chair fine he said charlie decided that willoughby was nervous and wondered why after what you did it was me who should have called you said willoughby abruptly there was a surge of guilt and willoughby reflected that it was a pretty shabby way of repaying someone who had prevented his going bankrupt over a phoney liner fire in hong kong or on the loss of a russian stamp collection during the american exhibition but then if charlie had done what he suspected that was pretty shabby too you talked of a problem on the telephone charlie wanted to get to the purpose of the visit ever heard of lady norah billington no willoughby was genuinely surprised shes always in the newspapers he said not on the racing pages shes the mendale heiress theres an estate in yorkshire a villa in jamaica as well as rome and a flat here in london near us in eaton square what about her her husbands got a lawyers mind and reads the small print a year ago i underwrote a replacement cover policy on her jewellery its coming up for renewal first time value was one and a half million but the indexed rise will bring it up to two million ive got to agree the adjustment in writing and hes asked that i do so what exactly do you want me to do guarantee the protection said the underwriter its listed in specific detail on the policy but before i agree the rise ive the right to check the alarm system and the protection willoughby smiled father always said you were the most securityconscious man he had on the staff that wouldnt be the assessment now thought charlie the same bastards who set him up for sacrifice manoeuvred sir archibalds replacement as director but charlie knew the old man would never have condoned the retribution morals are important in an immoral business charlie when charlie didnt reply immediately willoughby repeated apologetically not quite the sort of thing you did before it wasnt thought charlie clerks stuff senior clerk maybe but still a clerk but it would be better than getting so pissed by nine oclock every night that he couldnt count the bridges on the way home id like to do it he said sure said willoughby quite sure said charlie where rome said willoughby sir hector billington is our ambassador there charlie felt an abrupt stomach emptiness the sort of sensation that comes when a lift goes down unexpectedly seven years he thought nearer eight diplomatic turnaround averages three years four at the most hed never been attached permanently to any embassy anywhere just used the facilities passing through and never rome what hed done would have remained a secret apart from those at the very top so what was the risk less than per cent acceptable enough to lift himself out of the shit in which hed been wallowing for too long fine he said hed just have to be careful and hed always been that until recently willoughby put his hands flat against the desk top in a tiny slapping motion ive just had an idea he said what instead of checking through the files here why not come to the flat tonight and look at them there then we can have dinner the inclination to refuse was as always almost automatic then charlie thought of warmedup shepherds pie cardboard sandwiches and another empty evening in an anonymous pub sure clarissa wont be inconvenienced by the short notice he said positive as he passed through the outer office to the reluctant stop and start lift charlie was vaguely aware of a man in a greystriped suit he was reading a copy of the sun since the insistent instructions from moscow there was no longer any casualness about the observation theyd even ignored the abc cafe close to willoughbys office remaining instead in an alcove on the opposite side of the street the man who preferred night to daytime shifts because there was more opportunity for accidental groping spotted charlie first there he said the woman shapeless in sweater jeans and tennis shoes let the man move out ahead of her so there wouldnt be any body contact if he attempted to maul her like he had all the others shed determined to kick him so hard in the crotch hed wear his balls for a necklace general valery kalenin was an ambitious man who recognized the nearness of success and knew without conceit that he deserved it for almost thirty years he had served the kgb faithfully heading four of the five main directorates and leaving each better than when he had arrived latterly it had been the clandestine section responsible for overseas activities and objectively he considered that branch of the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezopasnosti more highly organized than at any time since its formation it was because of that pride that he instinctively opposed the assassination idea when it was proposed by boris kastanazy as an operation it was futile a pinprick irritation disposing of men who would be immediately replaced it was only after kastanazy anxious to reinforce his failing influence within the politburo had forced the decision through that kalenin realized the possible advantage in a society of indirect conversations and sideways manoeuvring it had been a positive gamble for kalenin openly to oppose the scheme arguing the danger of the rome detection there had been moments in the initial weeks when hed regretted the outspokenness but not any more the purge had begun and because of the stance he had taken he was absolved from it kastanazy could be the only sufferer which meant a kgb vacancy on the politburo kalenin prepared himself carefully for the forthcoming encounter knowing it was probably one of the most important of his career he was a small man and aware of it just as he would have been aware of the disadvantage of a speech impediment to gain the impression of stature he chose to wear his uniform and debated wearing the order of lenin and the hero of the soviet union eventually rejecting the medals as ostentatious ribbons would be sufficient reminder of the honours his ability had earned him in the past the drivers knock came precisely on time although he was ready kalenin delayed his response unwilling to give any indication of anxiety the man had other functions beyond driving and kalenin did not want any account of overeagerness relayed it was not until the third knock that he answered the door as always the driver hurried out into the reserved central lane and kalenin settled back in the deep leather seat the final snows still clung defiantly white in the chimney crannies and on the roofs but black and trafficgritted at the pavement edges and gutters helmeted babushkas so swaddled in layers of cloth and roughcut sheepskin that it was difficult to imagine a human body beneath the mushroom shapes chipped and swept and gossiped at their brooms in another month thought kalenin it would be spring the hills outside the city still wet but proudly green and with the new flowers under the birch and fir the signs said the grass should not be walked upon so the alexander gardens were still white and obediently untrodden the car passed the tomb of the unknown soldier and the monument to revolutionary thinkers and swept into the redwalled kremlin through the trinity tower gate there were already tourists crocodiling through the museums and cathedrals to the right where the public were allowed there were a few foreigners animated with cameras and brightly dressed but the majority were russian bundled like the street cleaners and following their tour leaders with dullfaced placid acceptance only the children appeared to be smiling not seeming to regard the visit as an official comparison of past decadence with the improvements of the present why did russians need vodka to make them laugh thought kalenin that couldnt be anything to do with the past theyd drunk as much under the tsars as they did now and under the tsars had been allowed to fall down and freeze to death during winters like this now there were nightly street searches around the capital and sobering stations to which drunks could be taken and hosed back to sobriety the car turned left towards the senate and the cordonedoff area cutting off kalenins view of the tourists it was recognized as an official vehicle and gestured through towards the praesidium wing there was a guide waiting for him which was unnecessary but kalenin fell into step with the procedure how many times had he journeyed along these tall echoing corridors to appear before ambitious men and inquiring committees too many to remember it would be good to have others come to explain themselves to him and it was going to happen he thought confidently it was a room the politburo used for committee meetings away from the main impressive chamber all thirteen members of the soviet hierarchy were assembled around the kidneyshaped table already there was a fug of cigarette smoke with pushedaside cups and glasses on the table even an occasional loosened collar he saw despite the impression of informality there was a secretariat table at the side of the room with three stenographers as well as a technician to operate the tape equipment kalenin was glad there would be records vladimir zemskov the first secretary was in the chair he was a driedout stick of a man thinhaired and emaciated like an erudite vulture he was smoking a fullpacked westernstyle cigarette not the halfandhalf soviet version and when he spoke his voice was thick and phlegmy there has been some preliminary discussion he said as he spoke zemskov looked sideways along the table towards boris kastanazy the man responsible for politburo control of the kgb was a complete contrast to the first secretary kastanazy was obesely fat so much so that there was no impression of a neck making it seem as if his head had been attached as some sort of afterthought from the perspiration pricked out on kastanazys face kalenin guessed the open damning criticism had already begun kastanazy looked as if he were gradually melting in the sun i have no doubt that rome has been exposed said kalenin forcefully he was aware of kastanazys facial expression something like a wince the embassy or the source queried zemskov its too early to be positive said kalenin at the moment i think only the embassy can it be saved im formulating proposals said kalenin the european summit creates a difficult time limit we must have internal access to that conference insisted zemskov decisions will be made affecting every one of our satellite borders in europe and not just europe greece will be attending this year for the first time so its the mediterranean as well its essential we know what happens its precisely because of that importance that the british will want it settled before it begins reminded kalenin heavily he added and why the killings should not have been risked what do you propose asked the first secretary to let them what zemskovs astonished reaction led the stir that went around the table im going to give them what theyre looking for announced kalenin two in fact the british already regard one as a traitor itll make it easy for them to accept the other how long a week i hope a fortnight as the outside which would leave more than a week to the summit yes zemskov coughed an unpleasant sound a great deal depends upon this comrade general i know said kalenin further along the table kastanazy blew his nose and quickly wiped his forehead to kalenin zemskov said proper gratitude will be expressed for success kalenin showed no reaction to the promise for which hed been hoping save rome and the seat would be his igor solomatin worked independently of the soviet embassy in rome under false documentation and identity and was sure he was undetected but he still returned to moscow by the prescribed dogleg route flying from italy to paris and then from paris to amsterdam to pick up the aeroflot connection to moscow he made the entire journey unaware of the rotating check squad of eight men instructed by kalenin to act as his protection the man entered the spartan office at the rear of dzerzhinsky square respectful but not awed by his surroundings and kalenin was impressed to be awed meant to be overly nervous and nervous people made mistakes as close as he was to success kalenin was determined against any mistakes for more than an hour solomatin sat attentively forward in his seat as kalenin outlined the operation the only movement an occasional nod at the end kalenin said well it should work said solomatin kalenin smiled impressed again most field operatives would have been fawning in their praise he lighted a tubed cigarette and said how is he frightened said solomatin a lot rests upon him he recognizes that can he do it i think so said solomatin what about the englishman the flight reservations have been made once hes there theres nothing he can do to avoid involvement are you sure of the italian hes ready kalenin offered a file across the desk there are all the details of the alarm system and burglar protection he stopped at a sudden thought he speaks and reads english i suppose sufficiently assured solomatin kalenin depressed the summons button on the desk intercom and said someone is returning to join those already with you in rome his name is vasily leonov solomatin turned as the outer door opened a slim fairhaired man stood there he wore westernstyle clothes and there was about him a vague almost distracted attitude that solomatin had known among professors at university it was a fleeting impression replaced at once by the suspicion that ground control of the operation was being taken from him whats your function he demanded illphrasing the question in the spurt of annoyance i kill people said leonov the conversion of the huge regency mansion in eaton square made willoughbys london home a duplex servants quarters and kitchens on the ground floor and a lift to the first where they lived overlooking the central park the underwriter answered the groundfloor entry bell instantly releasing the door and charlie entered into a polished marble hallway where nobody had ever dumped prams or bikes or left messages on the wall there was a small vanity mirror in the lift and charlie stared back at himself deciding the flush was from hurrying across the square now that it was about to happen his feeling at meeting clarissa again was eagerness rather than apprehension new york had meant nothing he was sure a betweenthesheets experiment which had worked because they were both good at it hed been a bloody fool to imagine it was anything more quickly he tried to control the shank of hair that curtained his forehead and was still with the comb in his hand when the lift stopped hurriedly he pocketed it glad no one was waiting directly outside the lift led out onto a small foyer willoughby was waiting by the open door into the apartment come in he said charlie had visited once before but there had been a lot of people and he hadnt been aware of the size of the place there was a large central corridor with doors leading off either side those into the drawing room were doublefronted and open giving an expansive entry clarrisas out said the underwriter leading charlie in got herself involved with some charity for abandoned animals charlie thought he made it sound a sudden hobby that would soon be discarded like collecting train numbers or cigarette cards you should have called if it was inconvenient he said she wouldnt hear of it said willoughby and it gives us time to go through the insurance file a man appeared at the door and willoughby motioned him away its all right robert ill do it the underwriter came back to charlie drink he said scotch said charlie he was glad willoughby was wearing a lounge suit on the way from sloane square underground charlie had wondered if he were expected to dress hed hired a dinner suit the last time and kept being mistaken for someone brought in to help for the evening willoughby handed charlie the drink and said ive got the stuff in the study it was miniscule by comparison to the city office but still opulent redfelt walls a small antique desk and chair a soft light apart from the single anglepoise lamp a storage bureau rolltop and antique again and some photographs they were predominantly of willoughby at school and university but then charlie saw the wedding group and moved closer to it father used his influence and managed to get westminster church said the underwriter it was i remember said charlie he had an operation to date it moscow july a randy mp crying foul because hed been photographed with his trousers around his ankles with an intourist interpreter looking irritated because she hadnt been able to take her suspender belt off for the camera charlie had done the only thing he could to reverse the scandal exposed the silly bugger himself and made a fuss about entrapment of british politicians on a supposedly friendly trade visit charlie peered closer at the picture this was how he would remember sir archibald cherubfaced and brighteyed like a garden gnome by a goldfish pond not like the last time at rye after hed been dumped a foodstained shaky old man his memory so whiskyblurred that sentences never had a coherent ending next to sir archibald lounged clarissa in a veil and engulfed in cascades of fashionable satin narrowfeatured even then high cheekboned her face chiselled by the permanent diet caloriefree tonic water for social appearances and handrolled cigarettes for highs remembered charlie did she still smoke or had that been a passing hobby like stray animals ive got the file here interrupted willoughby charlie turned back into the room seeing for the first time the small chair that had been set for him alongside the desk in front of the underwriter was a spread of documents and diagrams charlie took the side chair and twisted the lamp needing the illumination in the shaded room it was an extensive dossier with illustrations of the protection system and lists of the jewellery indexed against individual pictures of each piece taken from several different angles the correspondence between the ambassador and willoughby was included together with biographies of sir hector and lady billington it was thirty minutes before charlie looked up wealth i ask not hope nor love quoted charlie in the early days in the department hed habitually made remarks like that in a futile attempt to convey the impression of an education he didnt have theyre important people charlie ill tug my forelock and keep my place promised charlie sir archibald wouldnt have made a point like that even with cause i didnt mean to offend you said willoughby hurriedly you havent said charlie why did people always suspect hed break wind in a quiet moment they both started surprised when the study door burst open clarissa entered theatrically opening her arms towards them darlings she said both men stood charlie felt a pop of excitement deep inside she hadnt changed since new york even the hairstyle was the same bubbled out and frothing to her shoulders accenting the length and narrowness of her face hed forgotten the eyes and their startling blueness and the way she accented that too limiting the makeup just to the palest lip colouring she looked stunning charlie selfconsciously charlie took her hands and kissed her lightly on the cheek its so good to see you she said and you its been ages she still talked in italics yes he said the butler appeared at the door and willoughby said to his wife do you want to change no she didnt even look at him to charlie she said youve got fat the good life he said what have you been doing with yourself this and that charlie retreated behind the familiar cliche the social difficulty the impossibility of any normal inconsequential conversation about the past week or the past month was what got to edith first before the fear despite an education which had ended in switzerland and the time shed worked before their marriage as sir archibalds secretary which charlie would have expected to widen her attitudes edith had remained the suburban woman she liked dinner parties with neighbours and holiday photographs and gossip about children even though they didnt have any themselves were dead charlie we might as well go to russia or the bloody moon we havent got a life any more im working announced clarissa proudly offering her arm for him to go with her into the dining room so rupert said she seemed to remember her husband there was a committee meeting tonight and ive agreed to give a charity supper here if you like he replied i like willoughby said nothing lets eat said clarissa coming back to charlie the dining room was an unusual construction fifty people could easily have been accommodated but there were sliding partitions which crisscrossed in dividing positions so areas could be closed off to suit the number of people to be seated with only three the room was reduced to an annex a round table was set and clarissa stood waiting for charlie to help her to her chair he held back for willoughby to do it its a worthwhile charity said clarissa to charlie you must come ill try he said he wouldnt he was unsure even whether tonight was a good idea clarissa had always been dismissive of her husband but he hadnt suspected it would be this bad he and edith had never got like this not even towards the end when there was every reason for the resentment and recriminations under the butlers direction a latinlooking woman served pheasant while he poured claret from a cutglass decanter must be a year since you two were in new york said willoughby and two weeks added clarissa charlie wished she hadnt you must have enjoyed it there said the underwriter clarissa could hardly stop talking about it when she got back we did didnt we charlie it was fun fun was a favourite word of clarissas remembered charlie yes he said we had a few laughs rupert doesnt laugh a lot do you rupert she said i dont have much to laugh about theyd probably squabble over whether every day began with a dawn thought charlie he felt like a piece of rope being yanked over a dividing line between them did you ever it seems a long time ago i cant even remember i dont expect much time for sightseeing said charlie quickly ill only be away for two or three days no need to hurry back said willoughby what are you going to do check the protection of some jewellery id forgotten said clarissa pushing her plate away practically untouched thats what you did with ruperts father didnt you not really said charlie sidestepping i was more in administration a clerk she disregarded the qualification was it like all the books charlie considered the question no he decided in the books hed read there was a beginning and a middle and a neat tidy end charlie couldnt remember many occasions when all the questions were answered and the uncertainties resolved with the good guys winning and the bad guys losing hed always found it difficult deciding who were good and bad anyway from where i was it seemed all paperwork and records and bureaucracy he said sounds dull it was hed never thought it so trap or be trapped trick or be tricked the normal shitty chess game with too many sacrificial pawns charlie must still be governed by the official secrets act warned willoughby and liable under it for what hed done to a maximum of fourteen years in jail thought charlie he knew he couldnt be prosecuted under the treason act because it had happened more than three years ago charlie had checked that in the reference section of chelsea public library between three oclock pub closing and six oclock opening whats that supposed to mean demanded clarissa that we shouldnt embarrass him by asking questions for christs sake rupert they were talking as if he werent there thought charlie the nobody man again it didnt upset him another course was changed and with it the wine charlie sipped appreciatively it had been decanted like the first but he wasnt good enough to identify it rupert has always been in awe of his father said clarissa including him at last so was i said charlie irritated at her posturing silence frested around the table and charlie tried to think of something to say then he thought sod it if they wanted to behave like spoiled kids it was all right with him the pheasant had been just as he liked it not too high and the ubiquitous robert was always at his elbow with the decanter hed have a better class of hangover tomorrow have you finished your business demanded clarissa yes said willoughby so you dont expect the rigmarole of port and cigars willoughby looked inquiringly at charlie whod never been to a dinner where women withdrew whatever you prefer he said i prefer you to come with me she said charlie walked with her into the drawing room the curtains were undrawn and there was just sufficient light to show up the silhouette of the trees as soon as they entered willoughby said damn there isnt any brandy call robert said clarissa hes downstairs quicker if i get it myself clarissa turned as her husband left the room hello charlie muffin she said hello its nice to see you again he fell another stir the feeling hed known earlier and vou he said why didnt you call i didnt think it was a good idea why not you know why not charlie looked towards the large doorway through which willoughby had gone what the hells wrong with you two just normal thats not normal she made an uncaring gesture your numbers not in the book i looked why dont we leave it as it was clarissa how was that a novelty thing the dustman and the duchess is that how you thought it didnt you no she said all the brittleness of the evening gone im surprised you did there was a sound from the corridor and willoughby reappeared the refilled brandy decanter in his hand sorry about that he said he poured large measures into three balloons and handed them round heres to a successful trip he said cant imagine it being anything else can you said charlie i hope not said the underwriter it had been a mistake to accept the invitation charlie decided walking back towards sloane square he still fancied her rotten and she knew it he wouldnt see her again clever though it had been the british entrapment had a flaw and kalenin seized it albania and yugoslavia were not included in the list of countries to which the damning advisory message had been sent which left six to the foreign ministries and the intelligence services in warsaw east berlin prague budapest bucharest and sofia he sent demands for any inquiry which had come back from any embassy once it had been relayed kalenin was using the english plan in reverse it shouldnt take long it was very clever after all between his office and that of his deputy there was a room formerly occupied by someone with the title of forward planning executive which sir alistair wilson properly regarded as a piece of bureaucratic nonsense and abandoned after his appointment it was here that he and harkness created their incident room bringing in document benches filing cabinets for analysis folders and three progress boards on easels to chart the direction of the inquiry the conference was scheduled for ten and harkness entered as the clock was striking dossiers parcelled on his outstretched arms he dumped them on the prepared table and looked without expression towards the intelligence chief well demanded wilson potentially bad said harkness rome had grade two listing on the access list ive gone back three years if hes been leaking that long moscow has virtually been sitting in on most of the cabinet discussions affecting europe and because of nato theres a lot of cross referencing with america so nairehamiltons right about the possible embarrassment harkness hesitated conscious of how the permanent under secretary wanted the matter resolved reluctantly he said yes wed look very stupid damn said wilson its only an estimate qualified harkness he might not have been operating that long or it might have been longer said wilson objectively until we get him and can fix the date i dont think we should minimize what might have happened he looked towards the records harkness had brought with him any possibilities two said harkness on what grounds moscow service when they might have been turned one is our resident in rome whod have personnel movement access yes him first said wilson harkness took up the file going to the second table so he could spread out the information before he began talking he pinned an officiallooking posed photograph to the first blackboard the picture showed a heavily built jowly man with fair hair and a clipped military moustache henry walsingham said harkness late entrant after army service with the green jackets bought himself out at the rank of lieutenant tried a year with his fathers brokerage firm in the city then took the entry examination average pass went to electronic surveillance at the government communication hq at cheltenham and did well sort of mind that understands technical things transferred back to secret intelligence eight years ago high commission in canberra where he met his wife tokyo then moscow after moscow he went to washington left there about a year ago for rome record average theres a commendation for the way he handled a currency fiddle being run by some of the marines on security duty in moscow to avoid a scandal got them posted back here for a discreet court martial which prevented the russians getting upset could have brought him to their attention if theyd been investigating it as well suggested wilson yes agreed the deputy what about the australian wife names jill said harkness enjoys parties described as a popular woman marriage happy they spent three months apart when he was posted to tokyo stated reason was that her mother was ill in canberra was that confirmed no said harkness ive already cabled for the inquiry to be made money only what he earns the bank records will be here tomorrow wilson went closer to the blackboard gazing at the personnel photograph for several moments whos the other one he said turning away again harkness pinned a picture on the board before he started talking this time it was of a smallerfeatured darker man heavily bearded he was staring intently and unselfconsciously towards the camera richard semingford listed harkness career diplomat fathers a colonel so the boy went to stowe but didnt seem to fancy a military career modern history at cambridge graduated with a second married an undergraduate there entered the foreign office with an average pass mark good record as trade counsellor in washington initial secretaryship in tokyo at the start of the trouble over japanese car imports and did well three years in moscow distinction rating when he left posted to rome eighteen months ago as second secretary regarded as promotion material and likely to get an ambassadorship if he doesnt make any sort of major mistake wife ann bank managers daughter from henleyonthames archaeology buff so she couldnt be more content in rome any marriage problems no suggestion of any excessive spending harkness shook his head no inherited money from either side but they seem to live within his salary and allowances two kids at boarding school back here but the government pays for that of course bank records here tomorrow with walsinghams wilson turned away from the tables limping to the window the view wasnt as good as from his office just a foreshortened outlook of the houses of parliament and big ben its not much he said it was an observation not a criticism no admitted harkness how many more at the embassy about forty not including cleaners and transport staff and i think we can reduce that number if these two show up clean the leak is obviously high someone with maximum security clearance what about surveillance teams in place by tonight said harkness ive notified the embassy officially that six were coming to check security for the summit theres twelve they wont know about walsingham and semingford then said the director its a start at least the more detailed check might throw something up about them suggested harkness conscious of the other mans reservation what about hotovy said wilson hes maintaining contact said harkness theres still no news of his wifes returning from czechoslovakia hes going to have to decide soon thats the trouble said the deputy he already has the theatrical flamboyance of the garrick suited the permanent under secretary decided wilson following nairehamilton from the bar along the corridor lined with original gainsboroughs and reynolds into the dining room on the way the intelligence director recognized two stage knights and a millionaire novelist whose last book hed attempted and found incomprehensible it had been a spy novel the wine had already been decanted and as they sat nairehamilton said claret dear fellow that all right with you he was in broad chalk stripe again today there was a handkerchief in his top pocket an almost perfect match for the pink carnation of course said wilson like this club said nairehamilton belonged for years lowered the standards a bit recently admitting women things like that but i still enjoy it his butterfly hands fluttered around summoning waiters wilson had a soldiers lack of interest in food and ordered liver because it was the first thing he saw on the menu the permanent under secretary went into debate with the head waiter before selecting the steak and kidney pudding it came off the trolley and nairehamilton made the man adjust the portion increasing it before it was served conscious that they could still be overheard wilson said interesting paintings all genuine said nairehamilton committee cant afford to insure the damned things so we photograph them and hope theyre too well known to be stolen their food was served and when the waiters left nairehamilton said whats the progress his food forgotten the intelligence director outlined the potential harm the traitor could have caused if he had been operating any length of time thats appalling said nairehamilton it could be agreed wilson romes isolated now absolutely i was summoned by the foreign secretary yesterday disclosed nairehamilton theres been discussion in cabinet committee theyre extremely concerned im not surprised the attitude was as i predicted said nairehamilton wilson didnt believe any cabinet committee would have been as direct as that even for records that werent going to be public for fifty years nairehamilton took a lot upon himself i understand he said the summit is in three weeks continued nairehamilton pressing the argument its got to be over by then cant have half the government entering the sort of situation we know to exist there the prime minister is going to be using the embassy for gods sake he stared around the dining room to locate the trolley man wilson declined a second portion nairehamilton waited until he had been served tipped the man p and said you can take what ive said about the cabinet committee as a direct instruction wilson said shouldnt we find out exactly whats been happening before making arbitrary judgments pretty obvious whats been happening not to me it isnt nairehamilton carefully put down his knife and fork leaning forward he said there isnt a choice over this perhaps one might have to be made three weeks insisted the permanent under secretary thats all youve got the soviet surveillance group followed charlie from battersea to london airport and reported within minutes of the flight departure allowing igor solomatin three hours to get his people in position for the arrival in rome four independent observers were waiting when charlie emerged from the baggage reclaim area of leonardo da vinci airport the photographs had been extensive so they would have recognized him easily enough without the added advice from london that his suitcase was secured as a precaution with string charlie considered the airport bus knowing he would make at least profit on his expenses account against a taxi fare but decided against it his feet hurt and he couldnt be bothered with the delay at the city terminal willoughbys office had reserved him a room at the grand ville on the via sistina it was just two streets away from the eden even with the detour because of the roadworks the distance was not more than four hundred yards it was into the eden that the british security team were booked ostia has been the seaside for rome since the days of the caesars and the billington villa occupied a site where a general serving under claudius had lived it was secluded from the other constructions along the coastline the nearest neighbour at least a mile away the highway looped along the red clay and granite cliffs with a sheer drop into the sea on one side and then turned sharply at a minor peak and there set out as if for admiration in the small valley below was the mansion it was built right against the cliff edge and before the car began to descend charlie had a birds eye view of a verandah colonnaded and heavy with grapevines and bourgainvillea overlooking the sea there were walls on the remaining three sides and charlie was able to make out the central courtyard around which the main house was arranged it was almost all singlestorey with just one upper level five bedrooms according to the insurance information there was a fountain with a figure motif he couldnt distinguish directly in front of the gravel drive and along its entire length there was a border of neatly barbered cypress trees the gardens were tiered down to the perimeter fence against which were regimented groves of olives and oranges and more wine grapes posh judged charlie as he slowed the car at the gate lodge charlie gave the name of willoughbys insurance firm and noted for the report he had later to prepare the care with which it was scrutinized against a visitors sheet by a uniformed security guard as he was waved through he saw the telephone being lifted to warn the main house inside the grounds it was easier to see the cats cradle of electrical wiring topping the walls there were electrical booster points at the corners and charlie assessed the conduit weight powerful enough for a current that could kill the cypresses were bigger than they had appeared from the approach road shadowing the drive almost completely from the midmorning sun the protection ended just before the front of the house and the sudden glare was disconcerting charlie squinted against the brightness aware of a woman waiting for him she came forward as he got out of the car hand outstretched im jane williams she said secretary to lady billington charlie was conscious of her aloof scrutiny it had been hotter that hed expected on the drive from rome and his suit was concertinaed he pulled at the sleeves trying to straighten them and dry his hands at the same time she permitted the briefest contact lady billington asked me to look after you charlie grinned what does that mean her face remained blank it means ill conduct you through whatever sort of examination you wish to make of the security precautions of the house squires daughter judged charlie twinset pearls and the hunt on sunday except that because of the heat it was voile not cashmere and if she had to work for a living he didnt expect the pearls were genuine she probably still rode though she was slim and smallbusted with a fulllipped heavybrowed face her dark hair was strained back into a businesslike bun at the nape of her neck and the tortoiseshell spectacles were held like a wand of office in her hand a fashion magazine image of the perfect secretary he thought lady billington suggests you join her for sherry later said the girl all right accepted charlie he noticed that the fountain motif had water coming out of a cherubs nipples the secretary led the way into the villa through a side door charlie felt the chill of air conditioning and saw that the windows were tinted against the sun in addition to the venetian blinds the floor was black and white marble like a chessboard and halfway down the corridor there was another fountain this time the water was spurting from a fishs mouth there were recesses and alcoves with plinths and urns and from them trailed tendrils of evergreen plants she stopped at the beginning of the corridor that seemed to run the length of the house and said what exactly is it that you want reassurance i suppose said charlie to know that the security is still good sir hector is very security conscious she said curtly so it would seem is that electric circuit on the wall operated every night by a time switch she confirmed it prevents human error someone forgetting there are floodlights too along the beach what about the house why dont you see for yourself there were restraining fixtures on the majority of the groundfloor windows preventing their being opened more than six inches there were two sets of french windows one at the side overlooking the seaview verandah and the other at the front of the house leading out onto the wide driveway on each were two sets of breaker points to sound an alarm if contact was interrupted in addition there were pressure pads beneath the carpeting the same protection was installed at all the doors there was the main entrance the minor door through which theyd come into the house one leading out through the kitchen and a fourth out onto the verandah separate from the french window charlie followed behind the secretary from place to place checking the details against the protection listed upon the file copy he had brought from london are these manually activated he asked testing her time switch again she said but you can override it if you want to of course shall we see whatever for to guarantee it works why i would have thought that was obvious we werent advised this would be necessary ive only just decided it is bells that dont ring arent an awful lot of good are they these work have you tested them she moved her feet uncomfortably no so well check shall we but people will have to be warned one alarm sounds directly into the local police station youd better warn them hadnt you are you sure its necessary positive she turned on her heel and flounced out leaving him in what he supposed was a drawing room over the marble fireplace the unspeakable in hunting pink pursued the unseen uneatable the english scene seemed curiously out of place among the classical ornaments and carvings which charlie supposed were genuine there was no sense that anyone ever visited the room except to dust he ran his finger along the top of a sidetable they did that well enough it was fifteen minutes before jane williams returned are you ready she said if you are her face was expressionless what do you want is the alarm set yes the police warned yes i told them wed be testing for an hour and they were to ignore it during that time charlie went to the main entrance first triggering the alarm by opening the door and then by stepping on the pressure pad on both occasions the alarm jangled piercingly he repeated the process at every other entry point and at the french doors the protection operated every time good he said i told you it worked so you did can i put the system back to automatic now there was a note of weariness in her voice what about upstairs what about it arent there alarms you know there are then theyll have to be tested wont they she marched off with charlie close behind enjoying the bum movement beneath the skirt whoever followed jane williams up the stairs in different circumstances was a lucky sod he decided she turned abruptly and charlie tried to clear his face of expression something the matter she said no said charlie nothing they went first to the guest bedrooms sash bolts stopped the windows from opening more than six inches the air conditioning made sense charlie realized it seemed a great deal of trouble to go to just for the pleasure of wearing shiny stones now the master bedrooms said charlie it seems an intrusion thats what burglars do said charlie intrude for a moment her control slipped her face clouding quickly she recovered and said which one your choice said charlie careless of the annoyance he was causing her it was clear that in the staff social structure jane williams put him somewhere around the rank of boot black there were two doors at the head of the staircase and she went to the one at the right sir hectors she said charlie stopped just beyond the threshold the furniture was heavy and masculine appearing oddly out of place in a villa in the sun wardrobes as well as the bureau and bed fashioned from solid black teak near the dressing table there was a bust of a man whom charlie presumed to be the ambassador mounted on a slender marble plinth and to the side was a spotlight angled to illuminate it above the bureau and continuing around the walls were framed diplomas of billingtons progress in life and there were a lot of photographs from school group pictures up through childhood to adolescence there were several of a youth in shorts and cap with a racing boat behind directly above the bureau a rack held the sawnoff blades of oars charlie moved closer there were several groups with the sculls in the foreground and the crews with their arms around each other with the tactile need of sportsmen jane williams said sir hector got a blue for rowing at oxford charlie nodded towards the plinth shouldnt there be a laurel wreath it was sculpted by sir mortimer wheeler she said gosh said charlie her face twitched at the mockery the windows are there she said pointing one set opened onto a verandah with a spectacular view of the sea chairs were arranged around a canopied table on which lay some binoculars there were breaker points similar to those on the floor below and undercarpet pads again the four other windows in the room were small two had securing fixtures and two breaker alarms he tested each one and every time the bells clanged out theres a dressing room where the safe is said charlie remembering the plans hed studied with willoughby jane williams went across the room to a linking door the dressing room was strictly functional and predominantly feminine two walls were occupied entirely by cupboards except for a small bureau and along the third had been fitted an elaborate dressing table complete with a lightsurrounded mirror brushes combs and hand mirrors were set out in an orderly pattern and the jars of creams and lotions were grouped together like cuckoos eggs in a nest in front of the only window was a chaise longue and a small table charlie moved around and raised the venetian blind the glass was reinforced solidly into the frame not to be opened charlie tugged at the cord to lower the blind and turned apologetically i never can make these things work he said sighing she jerked at the string releasing it first time must be a knack said charlie enjoying her closeness she stepped back hurriedly now i suppose youd like to see the safe she said im going to need lady billington for that said charlie what the jewellery check has to be completed with the owner but thats not convenient neither is losing it lady billington has an appointment in rome in she hesitated glancing at her watch just under two hours how long will it take to go through the list as long as it takes said charlie unhelpfully certainly longer than two hours this really is most inconvenient she couldnt cancel rome of course not then ill have to come back charlie wasnt upset at the prospect it had taken a year for willoughby to consider using him again and like a child saving the strawberry in the pudding until last he was in no hurry to rush it ill see what can be arranged said the secretary we havent examined lady billingtons bedroom yet reminded charlie jane williams opened the door letting him precede her into a pink and white room of silk festoon blinds and tufted carpet there was a fourposter bed draped with venetian lace and haltered at each corner by wide bands of pink silk the walls were lined with silk too its like walking across the top of a wedding cake said charlie as he crossed towards the windows he was conscious again of photographs a montage of lady billington as a young child in a horsedrawn carriage before a house large enough to be a palace and then older on a ski slope with a villa behind her there were pictures of her in yachts cars boarding aeroplanes and at receptions with the famous charlie recognized the kennedys and the rainiers why was it that the rich needed so many reminders of their privilege quite an album he said jane williams didnt reply there was a verandah matching that of the other bedroom with a set of windows opening onto it the protection was the same and the bells sounded the moment they were tested the two additional windows had restricted opening satisfied you mentioned sherry said charlie she looked at her watch again i dont imagine lady billington expected it to take this long why dont we see the stairs were wide enough for them to walk abreast and this time she kept level unwilling for him to follow her all the way down the corridor she stayed in step with charlie until they reached a leatherpadded recessed door she knocked but didnt bother to wait for an answer the insurance man she announced and charlie conceded victory to her the one whod called every week on his mother in manchester for the penny policy was flatcapped bicycleclipped and always had his hand ready for a tip lady billington smiled a smile that didnt falter at charlies crumpled appearance how nice of you to come she said as if hed accepted a late invitation to make up a dinner number charlie guessed lady billington was about fifty but she didnt look it she was heavybusted which was unfortunate because it unbalanced the slimness of her figure she was brave enough to leave the slight greyness in her auburn hair which was long and looped to her shoulders and she didnt make the mistake of too much makeup she wore a plainly cut dress silk which seemed to be her favourite material and from the list that willoughby had given him charlie knew the pearls which were matched to perfection had been valued a year earlier at the diamond brooch was real too charlie was conscious of movement around her feet and saw two fluffballs of cats angora he thought no that was rabbits persian perhaps he felt the irritation begin at the back of his throat i said sherry remembered lady billington but i prefer gin what about you scotch please said charlie shouldnt do it you know she said do what drink in this climate the romans always watered their wine but then look what happened to them charlie liked her lady billington was the rolls royce to jane williamss daimler he decided accepting the drink from the returning secretary his nose was itching cheers said lady billington cheers said charlie must have been an awful nuisance for you coming all the way from london it was necessary for the valuation adjustment said charlie hoping that was the way proper insurance men spoke hector fusses so she said half the time people dont know the difference between the real thing and paste im afraid its not finished said jane williams it seems you have to be personally present when the jewellery is checked whatever for youre the owner said charlie i can only accept proof of identity from you its a term of the policy he sneezed just getting the handkerchief to his face in time cant do it today said lady billington due in rome for lunch hector treats lateness as a diplomatic incident she was sitting on a wide couch the cats snuggled up beside her and she began to fondle them your secretary explained said charlie im sorry i should have explained on the telephone no matter said lady billington she frowned at her empty glass and offered it to the other woman and look at the diary will you she came back to charlie what have you done checked the security which was the main point of the visit said charlie it seems extremely efficient i heard the bells charlie realized she had a tendency to overstress her sibilants and was unsure whether it was an impediment or the gin from what ive seen i should think youre safe enough he sneezed again have you got a cold charlie looked towards the cats bit asthmatic he said reaction to animal fur jane williams returned with the drinks and the appointments diary lady billington held up the animals take them out dear will you sighing the secretary carried both animals out into the corridor she returned picking fur from her skirt thank you said charlie she said to lady billington you could fit it in tomorrow charlie thought she made it sound like agreeing to a hack being shod come for sherry invited lady billington sipping her gin the cats were clustered at the door awaiting readmission when he left jane williams showed him out at the drive charlie said see you tomorrow i doubt it she said determined upon the last word charlie sneezed not managing the handkerchief in time alexander hotovy had stressed his wifes health when he made the request and had been given permission to travel to london airport to meet her on her return from czechoslovakia he sat in the rear of the car confident neither the driver nor the escort who accompanied him would discern the excitement that was throbbing through him it wouldnt be so easy with lora his wife knew him too well hed rehearsed the whispered warning for when they embraced so she would not question him until they got somewhere secure to talk dear god he prayed let her be well enough to accept it without challenge in a day two at the most they would all be safe the vehicle circled the roundabout and sped beneath the huge welcoming sign above the tunnel leading into the airport hotovy smiled at it briefly thats what he was being welcomed to a new life a new life without restrictions or suspicion or worrying about an indiscreet word or thought freedom his hands were wet with sweat he took a handkerchief from his pocket and wiped them under the pretence of blowing his nose safeguarded by the cd plates the car parked on the double yellow lines outside the european arrivals building and hotovy got out he walked with deliberate slowness into the terminal staring up at the indicator board for the flight from prague you are comrade hotovy yes in his surprise hotovy answered before he realized that the question had been asked in russian there was a man either side of him and as he turned he saw three more close behind what do you want look there please said one of them politely about a hundred and fifty yards along the concourse hotovy saw his two boys being led into the building there were three men and a woman with them they went to the desk handling the aeroflot flight tickets and boarding passes were handed to them without any checking formalities youre not going to make a fuss are you said the man no said hotovy it was two hours after the aeroflot departure that clarissa willoughby arrived at heathrow with the porter trailing her she went straight by the checkin counter for the nice flight to the ticket desk id like to change my flight she said to the clerk the man in the grey suit still with his umbrella busied himself among the magazines at the bookstall he found he read a lot in his line of business general kalenin would have preferred more time to assemble the material but he was confident he had forgotten nothing he arranged it before him on the desk top checking against the carefully prepared list for the final scrutiny the medal ribbon designated a hero of the soviet union and was accompanied by a long official citation made out in charlie muffins name there was a soviet identity card with a picture of charlie and an authorization again with a picture for admission to the restricted concessionary stores the passport contained charlies picture and was datestamped for the relevant countries where the britons had been killed there was five thousand dollars in cash and several congratulatory cables two referring to the assassinations in delhi and ankara the longest document was the briefing about rome it ran to two full pages and kalenin concentrated upon that most of all because it had to complete the entrapment he summoned the courier to take it to the foreign ministry for inclusion in that nights diplomatic pouch to london shrugging into his topcoat while he waited he followed the messenger from his office but descended in the private lift directly into the basement where the car was waiting in an area of guaranteed absolute security the journey to kutuzovsky prospect took only minutes and kalenin dismissed the driver for the evening it was one of the largest apartments in the government complex too big for his solitary needs but awarded to him because of his rank the size enabled kalenin to devote an entire room to his hobby from habit he went immediately to it staring down at the contoured papiermache layout and the positions of the miniature tanks with which he had been recreating the battle of kursk in the most recent war game it was over a fortnight since hed abandoned it normally he would have invited alexei berenkov to complete it with him but had decided against it tonight reminded of his guest kalenin went back into the main room and opened two bottles of aloxe gorton to let them breathe berenkov preferred french to russian wine and kalenin enjoyed using his official position to indulge his friend he lit a low heat beneath the bortsch and added meat and dumplings when it began to steam he had just completed laying out the caviar and smoked fish when the bell sounded berenkov entered as exuberantly as always enveloping kalenin in his burly arms the only legacy of the mans british imprisonment was the white hair the cowed apprehension of his immediate return had disappeared and under valentinas care all the weight had been restored he looked like a bear thought kalenin but elderly and docile the sort that live in childrens fairy stories valentina is sorry said berenkov repeating the apology of their telephone conversation earlier in the day i think asian flu is the best weapon the chinese have tell her i hope shes better soon said kalenin but i wanted to talk to you alone anyway for the caviar and fish there was vodka before they began eating they touched glasses toasting russianfashion that sounds intriguing said berenkov heaping his plate with fish its charlie muffin berenkov stopped eating what about him there was a sadness of anticipation in his expression berenkov had the highest security clearance for his appointment as senior lecturer at the spy college on the outskirts of moscow so kalenin recounted in detail the rome exposure and what he intended to do to save it berenkov sat hunched forward huge hands cupped around his vodka glass his food temporarily forgotten he couldnt have been better for our purpose said kalenin charlie muffin had been responsible for trapping the other man and kalenin knew that during the debriefing which followed a professional respect had developed between them how did you find him in america about a year ago said kalenin he was involved in the insurance protection of a tsarist stamp collection ive had him under observation ever since a convenient coincidence the british will be completely convinced kalenin brought the bortsch and wine to the table berenkov poured sniffing the bouquet appreciatively what do you think of the plan berenkov made an uncertain rocking gesture with his hand it seems good kastanazy is being purged kalenin needed to confide fully i expect him to be dismissed any day will you get the seat kalenin smiled its a possibility berenkov raised his glass to your success thank you berenkov put down the glass and said guardedly you shouldnt underestimate charlie muffin he might have been good once agreed kalenin but not any longer hes collapsed pretty badly during the last year berenkov laughed a short humourless sound he was right about the stick he said stick a remark he made at the last meeting we had in prison remembered berenkov he said he always got the shitty end of the stick charlie filled the bath with cold water rolled up his trousers and perched carefully on the edge easing his feet in with a sigh of relief rubbersoled suede wasnt good for hot weather and now his feet hurt like buggery he flexed his toes thinking of the ride back to rome had there been a lancia following hed only been aware of it for part of the journey and when hed slowed it had overtaken naturally enough but he hadnt been going fast in the first place so why had it crawled along behind maybe he was being overcautious by going out to ostia charlie had avoided any contact with the embassy so there couldnt be the slightest chance of detection he would have to be careful he didnt imagine danger where none existed there was a knock at the door it came again more insistently as he dried his feet he padded across the room without bothering to roll down his trousers going to the beach said clarissa willoughby just as soon as i knot my handkerchief said charlie you dont seem pleased to see me im not sure that i am clarissa sat in the middle of the bed with her knees drawn up beneath her chin so that her skirt gaped revealing too much leg charlie moved a crumpled shirt from the only chair in the room to sit down wanting to distance himself from her charlie was annoyed at clarissa for being so sure of herself and at himself for the excitement he felt this is stupid he said i dont think so i do its fun she meant it charlie knew people like clarissa did things simply because they were fun like boarding aircraft at dawn in the previous nights party clothes because breakfast at focquets seemed fun or like deciding it was fun to look at a friends villa in acapulco right after lunch at san lorenzo clarissa must worry about her passport like he worried about his feet what about rupert he thinks im somewhere off the coast of menton on a yacht i didnt mean that rupert didnt seem a problem for you in america whats so different now look at me said charlie im a wornout old bugger at least ten years older than you if you took me to the house of any of your friends they wouldnt let me past the kitchens youre an inverted snob would they i dont intend finding out she looked around her this is a pretty crappy room charlie i wasnt expecting to share it are you going to i dont know yes you do isnt this a bit too much slam bam thank you maam being a prissy hypocrite doesnt suit you flashing your arse doesnt suit you a flush of anger picked out on her cheeks but she remained smiling you thought it was a nice enough arse last time this was how it had been in new york he hadnt felt so emasculated by the approach then were the same clarissa continued not quite but almost thats why it was so good and will be again hed forgotten the disarming way she looked at anyone she was talking to with those unnaturally pale eyes he wanted her like hell and she knew it go away clarissa he said weakly ive had a long journey she said im tired and i want to go to bed theyve probably got rooms im in one stop it clarissa do you want me to yes i dont believe you this is like charlie waved his hands as if he were trying to feel for the expression it isnt real its real enough for me perhaps i havent had the practice youre being a bore you were never that charlie i was never raped either i was once it was fun jesus said charlie i never knew his name he was a chauffeur in spain being raped is a common female fantasy you know clarissa rolled off the bed on the opposite side from him and said help me with the covers charlie he hesitated then he got up from the chair and pulled them back on his side she came over to him and now unzip me when the dress parted he saw she was not wearing a bra she faced him as the dress fell to her feet and her hardnippled breasts pushed up for attention she reached for him and pulled his face to her you didnt kiss me when i came in she said he did now biting at her and she came back at him just as anxiously she brought her head back panting and said see just the same you make it seem as if youre trying to prove something come to bed and prove something to me she said for charlie it had been a long time and he was nervous so he finished too quickly she let him rest holding him against her breast and gently stroking his head then she pushed him down and said now do it properly he coaxed her gently with his hands and mouth holding back until she was almost ready before pushing into her she strained up to meet him head taut back for the groan that went on and on when she spoke the words quivered that was properly she said he turned onto his side but didnt part from her and she held him tightly to make sure he didnt no point in all that posturing was there she said no guilty yes sorry no neither am i she said but then i knew i wouldnt be what about all those animals you were supposed to be looking after ive found a hobby i like better she said sir alistair wilson stood before the easels comparing the photographs of henry walsingham and richard semingford ordinary unremarkable people he thought but spies and traitors always looked like ordinary people with mortgages and bills and kids at school and cars that went wrong the director turned at harknesss entry the replies are in announced the deputy before he sat down thrown up a couple of things about semingford what hes overdrawn by about five hundred pounds and theres an affair dont these damned people ever think of blackmail before they take their trousers down said wilson who is she lady billingtons secretary a girl named jane williams background admirals daughter from devonport unmarried excellent grades in her civil service examinations how old thirty how old is semingford fortytwo the middleaged wish to be young again thats familiar too said the director what about the security man walsinghams financial affairs seem okay and the australian inquiry jill walsinghams mother had a hysterectomy reported harkness as an afterthought he added it appears to have been successful semingfords the most likely then ive told the people in rome to concentrate upon him said harkness but its not much is it the other mans caution was justified conceded wilson not really he agreed going to tell nairehamilton no said wilson ill wait until theres something firmer he looked back at the photographs its taking longer than i expected its only been three days harkness was surprised at the remark and this is how its got to be done if they want discretion i know said wilson id just like a more positive development there is one wilson looked up hotovy didnt make his contact point there were backup rendezvous spots for succeeding days he hasnt shown at any of them what have you done put the czech embassy and all the residences under observation since dawn hes not been seen or the kids what about the wife still no sign that shes returned from brno hes gone then he was genuine said harkness if hed crossed at once hed have been all right it would have been a hell of a coup to have got him so it will be to get the bastard in rome said wilson igor solomatin arrived early at doneys wanting a pavement table from which he could see in both directions along the via veneto he had people placed to guarantee that the italian arrived alone but still wanted personally to be sure the evening promenade swirled back and forth in front of him a parade of peacocks thought the russian it wasnt criticism the reverse in fact solomatin knew hed miss it hed miss the svelte furcoated women who always seemed to favour beige and immaculate men whose shoes were always polished and who didnt look effeminate carrying wrist bags and being able to sit outside cafes like now and have waiters appear content to serve him instead of enduring the belligerent truculence of the steamfilled caverns of moscow and the clothes solomatin did not have the bulky russian heaviness hed been chosen for the posting because the slightness black hair and black eyes fitted easily into the latin surroundings reverting to the squareshouldered trouserflapping creations of moscow would be one of the small regrets hed have but very small the russian capital was where the promotion was and solomatin knew his promotion was inevitable after what was going to happen here hed been extremely fortunate solomatin monitored the approach and checked the safety signals of his ground men before waving to the italian whom he had cultivated for the past six months emilio fantani was no longer the male prostitute he had been when he first arrived in rome but he still swayed between the tables with hipswivelling suggestiveness solomatin noticed the eyes of several interested men as well as hopeful women follow the movement although he admired them the clothes were too gaudy for solomatin silk floral shirt black trousers and chamois jacket so thin as to be almost transparent slung casually across the italians shoulders fantani had a jangle of gold bracelets on either wrist in addition to the cartier watch and there was gold too circling his throat he was a thin wiry man never appearing properly relaxed with eyes that flickered constantly solomatin had never decided if he were seeking danger or prey when he reached the table fantani seemed out of breath which solomatin knew to be an affectation ive kept you forgive me he said i was early solomatin always spoke carefully when addressing fantani not because of any problem with his vocabulary which was excellent but because of his accent fantani had been born in a peasant hut in calabria one of the poorest regions in italy but had lived off his wits in rome since he was fourteen he had a streetwise intelligence that was often disconcerting shortly after they met fantani had suddenly questioned solomatins pronunciation and queried outright whether he was italian solomatin had talked of his birth in tarvisio on the austrian border and of being brought up bilingually fantani appeared to accept it but at the time it frightened the russian they shook hands and fantani said i was pleased to get your call with every reason thought solomatin it had been a careful softeningup period to convince fantani he was being considered for graduation from cat burglar to organized crime they had provided the man with four perfect robberies with alarm systems and house plans and safe combinations that had taken the kgb squad months to assemble its big said solomatin i wanted to get everything right a waiter came over and fantani quickly ordered an americano impatient with the interruption what is it he said jewellery where the british ambassador has a villa at ostia its in the safe there fantanis face creased thats not just a robbery he said thats political more than you think thought solomatin he said youre not scared the security will be strong ive got all the details itll be difficult to fence itll be impossible said solomatin more than half is antique it would be identified at once fantani stopped with the drink halfway to his lips whats the point of stealing what we cant get rid of were going to sell it back to the ambassador solomatin patiently shook his head to the insurers its a common practice the police dont like it but the insurers do its cheaper to pay out a percentage than the full amount well do it together ill tell you everything you have to do solomatin had been maintaining a note of the time and was ready when vasily leonov edged onto a table three places away it was unnecessary but leonov had insisted upon using the meeting to identify his victim the assassin showed no recognition within minutes of being seated his concentration was entirely upon fantani solomatin was too highly trained to show any outward reaction but he felt an inner clutch of coldness it was like watching a snake manoeuvre itself to strike at some tethered helpless animal how much information have you got said fantani everything perimeter protection alarm systems safe location the lot it sounds good it is when do i see it leonov had said he only wanted a few moments now said solomatin fantanis apartment overlooked the piazza del popolo a garish harsh place of overbright lighting steelframed furniture seethrough glass tables and black and white decor an amalgam of a dozen film sets curtains were opened and closed from a central electrically controlled panel which also operated a television and stereo installation positioned like neat birds nests in a lattice of tubular metal it was the first time solomatin had been there and fantani was anxious to impress a drink he hesitated gesturing towards a stone jar full of thickly rolled cigarettes or something else whisky said solomatin if he got the promotion he expected on his return to moscow hed be able to buy scotch at the concessionary stores like the clothes it was something he had come to enjoy solomatin carried with him a slim document case from it he took the information he had promised in the cafe setting it out on one of the glasstopped tables this is the big one emilio ive been waiting a long time its got to work it will the assurance was too quick too eager to please lets go through it it took a long time because solomatin was aware his future was dependent upon it and was therefore determined there would not be any misunderstanding he made the italian study the perimeter protection recite it back to him to guarantee it was memorized and then study the plan of the villa and draw it himself so that he would know the location of every room having established the design in fantanis mind the russian insisted he itemize the entry points and mark upon his drawing the burglar protection the final test was to recite the combination of the safe it was fifteen minutes before fantani got the numbering and dial changes correct he was sweating and most of the bombastic composure was gone solomatin gathered up his own copies and returned them to the document case if anything went wrong which he was sure it couldnt the only evidence would be in the italians own handwriting it wont be easy fantani was under no delusions but theres a lot here when do you want me to do it tomorrow night there was an almost imperceptible intake of breath then fantani grinned in agreement solomatin remembered the way leonov had looked at the man in the cafe and felt a sudden surge of pity it was brief but it annoyed him there wasnt any place for stupidity like that it was past midnight before solomatin returned to his own apartment on the via mecanate he put on the lights in a prepared sequence and sat down to wait leonov arrived after thirty minutes tomorrow night asked leonov yes sure he can do it weve tested him on four other burglaries hes good hes flashy said leonov is he homosexual does it matter dont like homosexuals said leonov from their protracted observation the russians knew charlie muffin lived alone and there was no danger of sudden discovery nevertheless they were careful breaking into the battersea flat positioning lookouts in the corridor as well as the entrance to the block three men actually entered the apartment together with material that had been sent from moscow they carried an extensive range of workmens tools one had a small batteryoperated vacuum cleaner to take the mess away with them afterwards when they left they removed the listening device that had been implanted in the telephone the table in the dressing room was set with a damask cloth and laid with glasses ice bucket bottles and water jug it was within reaching distance of the chaise longue upon which lady billington lay goblet in hand pell and mell didnt like it she said what said charlie the cats they spend all their time with me theyre locked up with jane and they dont like it charlie didnt imagine that jane williams would like it much either he carried his drink to the bureau he knelt before it released the securing bolt and eased sideways the lefthand pedestal leg the face of the floormounted safe was about two feet in diameter the combination dial snug in the centre hector used to suffer from allergies said lady billington took a course of injections for it once i tried said charlie it didnt work have i your permission to open the safe do you need it it seems so go ahead charlie huddled over the insurance guide to the safe combination turning the numerals into position at the final click he didnt lift the lid at once but felt carefully beneath there isnt a breaker alarm he said lady billington was leaning forwards towards the table should there be its not listed admitted charlie but i would have expected one better ask hector she said hows your drink fine thank you charlie lifted the covering upon a miniature cavern carved out below the cleverness of the concealment denied the normal facilities of shelves and the boxes were stacked one on top of the other charlie lifted them out first to the mouth of the safe and then across the room to arrange before lady billington automatically he separated the newerlooking containers from the old seeing the division she said theres a lot of heirlooms ive read the policy said charlie dont wear the old stuff much she confessed most of it is too big i feel like a shire horse decorated for the country fair its an awful lot of brass said charlie flattening the noun for the northcountry meaning she laughed it was a dazzling kaleidoscope of wealth the red of rubies and iced white of diamonds the dull white of pearls and the greens and blues of emeralds and sapphires briefly he was reminded of the bridge lights over the thames on those stumbling nights towards battersea better have a drink before we start suggested lady billington why not said charlie it didnt seem he was alone in drinking when he was bored her appearance wasnt affected yet perhaps it had only just started will i have to do this every year the hiss was more obvious when she spoke probably said charlie how do you want to do it as it comes i suppose cheers she said cheers charlie might once have argued it impossible for it to be tedious physically to handle one and a half million pounds worth of jewellery but it was he had to locate on his list whatever lady billington produced to compare with the accompanying photograph and description check the setting and stone content and then restore it to the safe to avoid confusion with what remained quickly all awareness of what he was touching disappeared cosmetic surgeons doing breast operations probably felt the same way lady billington treated the business with the same casual detachment after an hour she said when hector said this was legally necessary i thought it was a good idea now im not so sure its best to be careful said charlie she stretched her legs out along the chaise longue so he eased himself onto the dressingtable stool flexing the cramp from his legs pieces of fluff from the carpet speckled his trousers quite frankly i couldnt give a damn she said surprised yes said charlie right that you should be she said just as i should be surprised at the poor little rich girl feeling the confessional of gin thought charlie it was tenuous but charlie decided there was a similarity between this woman and the one he had left in bed at the hotel lady billington sought her escape in a bottle and clarissa in bed he felt a twitch of anger towards both of them lady billington stirred a box with her feet a rope of pearls charlie knew know what i think sometimes when im putting these things on what how many empty bellies they could fill she was draining bottles and putting messages inside he thought why dont you give them away then save this sort of thing every year she smiled wearily all the old stuff is in family trust anyway she said and there is already a charity established something to do with bringing africans to england to train them to be agronomists my father set it up arent there organizations you could become involved with international committees flying first class to new york or geneva and eating sixcourse banquets and agreeing how beastly it is for people to starve hed been wrong about lady billington she was a woman brim full of sadness its an uneven world agreed charlie thats trite she said but true lady billington added unsteadily to her glass spilling some onto the cloth so that a damp grey stain spread across it from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs she quoted indistinctly is that the karl marx original or the oxford book of quotations political science girton a poor second charlie indicated the boxes and then spread his hands to include the villa do you need all this truth is im not sure she admitted couldnt give a damn about the jewellery but i dont think i want to get rid of everything she smiled wearily again am i making sense vaguely i shouldnt drink so much its an easy habit to get into said charlie with feeling shouldnt we get on hows your drink all right thank you dont suppose i should she said reluctantly it took a further hour to complete the jewellery inventory they finished with lady billingtons engagement ring which was the only piece she hadnt returned to the safe in preparation for his visit one for the road she insisted a small one she looked at him curiously youve got bits all over your clothes charlie made an ineffective attempt to sweep away the carpet debris lady billington gazed vaguely around the dressing room suppose there should be a brush somewhere dont bother do you need to see my husband for anything she said if you do itll have to be at the embassy charlie shook his head in instant rejection no he said the whole business had been remarkably straightforward how easy would it be to persuade willoughby to employ him more regularly the idea settled and he decided it was a good one anything was better than the state into which he had been crumbling charlies mind blocked at the thought what about clarissa they left through the ambassadors bedroom and lady billington stopped near the oarblade display have you seen these she said the pride obvious charlie went alongside her lady billingtons finger traced a line along the photographs of her husband in the university rowing team he was almost chosen for the olympics she said although hed looked at them before charlie politely studied the pictures again all assured confident goodlooking young men their places in life guaranteed by name and influence lucky buggers they left the bedroom and lady billington walked with him down the marbled staircase and along the corridor to the door forgive the maudlin she said thanks for the drink drive carefully dont worry charlie was an intuitive man reacting to feelings and to impressions and the feeling at the moment was uncertainty as he took the hire car down the treelined driveway he tried to find a reason for it hed avoided absolutely any contact with the embassy and the security check had been what he had anticipated in willoughbys office a job for a clerk so why the unease on the return to rome charlie maintained a regular speed and constantly checked his rearview mirror today there was no obvious pursuit he must have imagined the blue lancia like everything else it had to be clarissa she was already in the hotel room when he got there surrounded by packages and parcels like a child whod found its way into santas storeroom ive had a fantastic time she said my american express card is like a piece of rubber i felt like that this morning said charlie i can fix that wont rupert wonder at purchases in rome when youre supposed to be off the coast of france on a yacht oh bugger rupert she said carelessly he never notices anything anyway in the foyer downstairs a patient man in a grey suit carefully folded the newspaper he couldnt read because it was in italian and made another precise entry in a notebook already the list was extensive henry jackson was a large softfleshed man who would have looked the part astride a policemans bicycle on an english country beat it was an impression he purposely conveyed because it made people careless he was in fact extremely astute and even when the occasion demanded physically quick which was why harkness had chosen him to supervise the british field team in rome henry walsingham greeted him with the withdrawn friendliness of an outoftown representative undergoing an annual visit from head office jackson emphasized plodding officialdom he insisted upon a complete tour of every department hoping to gauge the required degree of efficiency from the behaviour of the staff and the material on their desks in one office overlooking the via settembre he identified richard semingford the second secretary looked up in mild interest at the intrusion and then returned to his work there were marines on guard in the cipher and vault room and every check and identification was observed jackson remained for some time in the cipher room stressing its importance for the forthcoming summit for direct communication between the premier and his ministers in italy with the cabinet in london it would be necessary for him to instal someone over a longer period but jacksons initial impression was that the security was being maintained at the proper level back in walsinghams office he allowed himself to be taken through the list of every official and unofficial function in which the british party would be involved indexed against each function were details of the security provisions made by the italian government theres extensive use of helicopters so i see the whole thing is an obvious target for the red brigade said the embassy security man even when he was supposedly relaxed there was a military uprightness about him thats our assessment as well the italians are worried with every reason to be still didnt expect a visit from you people quite so soon said walsingham theres a lot of time left better to be safe than sorry said jackson it was the sort of remark the other man would expect ive brought five people with me i want to move them into the embassy tomorrow what for familiarize themselves with the working of the place said jackson find out where the lavatories and the different departments are i think i should advise the ambassador walsingham was a man who always deferred to a superior officer of course what exactly will they be doing poking around the cipher room and vaults mostly why ive told you said jackson patiently its from there all the stuff will be going back to london dont want any embarrassments do we indignation showed upon walsinghams face there is nothing wrong with the security at this embassy he said stiffly im sure theres not said jackson at once placatory he spread his hands entering the charade he was sure the other man would accept not my decision old boy you know what its like at whitehall they still use initials instead of proper names for the director and talk about moles and daft stuff like that there was a complete surveillance operation upon henry walsingham and richard semingford when they left the embassy that evening walsingham went to his apartment overlooking the tiber and remained there semingford met jane williams at a cafe on the via condotti they had a drink walked a short distance to a restaurant where they ate early and went back to her apartment semingford was still there at midnight and all the lights were out why the hell didnt one of the bastards react demanded jackson irritably when the reports were brought back to him at the eden i was supposed to have made one of them nervous kalenin used the best calligraphist but even so limited the entries to initialled notations in charlie muffins name and to the signatures against the bank authority there were four genuine messages of topsecret classification which he had received from the british embassy in rome recopied on paper brought in from italy to satisfy any forensic test the reference to the earlier meeting with charlie muffin in washington the previous june was provably upon russian foolscap and he hesitated looking down at it they had identified charlie in florida on june but from the checks later kalenin knew the stamp exhibition had been in new york from june from new york it was easier to reach washington than from palm beach just an hour on the shuttle it was the sort of detail that was important june was perfect he put it with the other documents then another russian foolscap containing all the information about the combination and security precautions at billingtons ostia villa the final fittingly cosmetic touch was ten thousand dollars in american currency kalenin had just addressed it for diplomatic transport to igor solomatin in rome when the message arrived from london about the previous shipment the hidden compartment had been fixed below the base of a bedroom closet and all the material placed in it they were confident it would be found but only after a rummage search kalenin sat back at his desk allowing himself a brief moment of satisfaction almost immediately he rose to his feet alexander hotovy had undergone sufficient preparation everything was going too well to allow uncertainty and kalenin was anxious to satisfy himself the czech did not represent any greater danger than he already imagined emilio fantani had a criminals ability to distinguish between true wealth and surface glitter and as he rounded the promontory on the ostia road to gaze down upon the billington villa he knew this was true wealth unlike charlie muffin who had taken the same route earlier fantani slowed and then stopped using the elevation of the hill for his reconnaissance the angle prevented his establishing a seafront approach but there would obviously be one leading up to the grape and flower hung verandah he could just determine at the righthand side of the house with a burglars patience he waited for thirty minutes slumped back in his seat ensuring the information about no ground patrol was correct before releasing the handbrake to coast down under minimal power towards the entrance he was briefly aware of the men in the gate lodge but his concentration was upon the electrical wiring thatched along the top of the walls the sea he decided reverting to his original intention there was a layby almost at the junction of the pratica road and as he reached it fantani saw the parked police car it was unmarked but identifiable from the heavy radio antennae that was always mounted in the roof as discreet as elephants in ballet slippers he thought there were three men inside the yellow vehicle lounged back with the practice of those who spend a lot of time waiting for things to happen fantani didnt slow to his right the sun sparked off the polished water and far out to sea a clutch of fishing boats moved sedately along the skyline like ducks in a line the hills were ochre and bald patched occasionally with thin grass hobbled goats neck bells jangling nuzzled hopefully and once fantani had to brake and swerve to avoid one that started into the road to tug at a suddenly discovered tuft it took longer than fantani wanted before he found a cliff break to get down to the beach he parked and took a towel and the raffia mat from the rear seat descending the looped pathway he set out through the footsucking sand and shingle in the direction of the villa it took an hour and fantani was glad he had allowed himself so much time he stopped some way from the barrier that made the ambassadors beach private fantani had come prepared already wearing a costume beneath his clothes he spread the mat undressed and folded everything neatly before stretching out apparently to sunbathe for almost half an hour he did before turning over onto his stomach to begin the examination the beach fence was high and spiketopped and projected some unseen distance into the water fantani did not think it was insurmountable it didnt matter anyway he decided looking to the cliff face it might have been possible to scale once but from the artificially smooth surface of the rocks he guessed it had been blasted away to create the almost perpendicular drop like a black line drawn down it there was a smokedglass lift linking the villa to the sea and alongside the zigzag of emergency steps it would only need one man at the top to protect both approaches fantani squinted up against the sun at the villa locating more pillars and bourgainvillea it was at the point where the protective estate wall abutted the cliff that fantani stopped the wall had been brought to the edge and from the conduit box which stuck up like a proud thumb he guessed the electrical connection stopped there the screen was completed by a wide halfcircle of meshed spikes splayed out like a womans fan against the wall end and the cliff face over a drop which fantani estimated at four hundred metres but accepted would probably be more because of his shortened elevation he smiled seeing the way and turned over onto his back again to doze in the sun for another hour he relaxed then dressed and rolled up his mat leaving his shoes and socks off for the gritty walk back to the car it was still only four in the afternoon so fantani continued towards pratica until he found the first roadside cafe he considered a brandy but decided his nerves didnt need any help instead he took coffee life was good decided fantani and going to get better a lot better it had taken long enough nearly fifteen years of screwing and being screwed trinket stealing from those who wouldnt risk complaint and then the gradual reputation as a competent craftsman he knew it was the reputation that had prompted the approach only two arrests and both unimportant it was the sort of thing the big organizers liked style and expertise fantani had no doubt whom he was working for who else but the mafia had the organization to get the details hed been provided with it had been a trial period with this the final test when he passed hed learn who the man was fantani was sure the name wasnt jacono but hed never shown any curiosity or tried to question they respected attitudes like that style thought fantani again driving back towards ostia fantani saw that because of a kink in the coastline the sun was setting on the landward not the seaward side which was an advantage already to his left the darkness was merging the clifftop blackly with the water fantani took the fiat up a track so that it would be completely concealed from the road and stood against the open boot changing into the clothing in which he worked everything was black for concealment even the canvas shoes before putting on the sweater he taped to one wrist the electrical bypass leads and to the other the glasscutter he kept the trouser pockets free for ease of movement but carefully zipped inside the cotton windcheater the collapsible silk bag the plans of the villa and its burglar protection the doctors stethoscope with a shortened length of tubing and the tape roll satisfied with his preparations he completed the last part of the ritual relieving himself against the wheel of the car he positioned himself carefully during the final approach to the villa neither too near the road where he would be visible to passing vehicles nor too near the cliff edge where he might be seen against the slightly lighter skyline three times cars swept along the coast road but on each occasion their lights warned him long before their arrival and he was crouched low and completely hidden when they passed he was adjusted to the darkness when he got to the villa perimeter conscious of the solid blackness of the wall near to it fantani squatted settling himself for the wait head tensed to one side for any animal or human sound to indicate a regular patrol hed failed to detect from the overlooking hill it was thirty minutes before he moved sure there was none near the clifltop the wind was stronger blowing harder against him than he had expected he hoped it wouldnt cause difficulties where the wall ended he crouched again gazing out at the fanlike halfcircle wanting to impress everything about it into his mind there were about forty spikes spearshaped at their ends and patterned together by looped metal spokes radiating outwards closer fantani saw it exactly like a spiders web cut in half he groped about his feet discarding the first two things his hand encountered and finally locating a stick stout enough for the purpose he edged closer so he wouldnt be defeated by the wind and threw it at the metal eyes half closed for a spark of contact if the electrification had been continued in some way he hadnt identified the twig hit the metal without any flash lodged for a few moments between one of the supporting arms and fell away into the darkness below fantani was able to trace its descent because floodlights had been switched on from the villa by leaning out slightly he could look down at the ambassadors private beach at the foot of the cliff a jetty nosed out into the black water and a speedboat jostled at a mooring fantani spread his hands along his thighs massaging them in readiness for the jump taking in deep breaths to calm himself the wind was gusting and he stayed crouched waiting for it to drop he started to go and faltered settling down again angry at the hesitation he squeezed the tension out of his hands coiled ready and when the wind lessened launched himself outwards he leaped spreadeagled arms and legs wide for any support aiming for the widest part of the halfcircle the villa floodlighting helped silhouetting the outline as he arced towards it over the fourhundred metre drop fantani landed well both hands connecting with one of the horizontal bars and his left foot slotting into place he winced as his unsupported right shin hit the metal before he got a foothold there he was completely exposed now like some insect trapped in the spiders web of metal the wind plucking at his clothing and strong enough to sting his eyes he hung there recovering his composure and then crabbed out further towards the speared ends near the edge he paused preparing himself for the strain he propped his right arm inside the furthermost spoke and wedged his foot for several seconds he hung with his left arm and leg dangling free and unsupported then he grabbed around the points snatching for purchase on the other side the tips pressed against the entire length of his body as if he were being impaled and he winced against the pressure they were sharper than he had expected them to be first his hand and then his leg connected he gripped tightly anchoring his body then released his right hand and pulled himself in a swinging manoeuvre around the barrier to gain the villa side fantani had to climb up the web to bring himself level with the cliff and feel with his foot without being able to look backwards for solid ground with a toehold he levered himself further onto the cliff fantani was stretched out now feet on the cliff and hands clinging to the metal struts his back bent painfully between using the strength from his shoulders fantani heaved himself up onto the cliff until there was solid ground to the level of his chest and he could release the metal without overbalancing onto the beach below fantani was panting and wet with sweat which was drying coldly against his face and back he was shaking and knew the coldness was only partially responsible theyd made the final acceptance job bloody difficult at last he stood vaulted the fence and pulled into the protection of some trees cypresses just like the driveway they had been planted in a regimented line closepatterned and the permanent shadows made perfect cover it took him almost to the house sufficiently close to gaze in through the uncurtained windows it was a kitchen area with the servants quarters alongside at first he thought there were eight around the table but then a girl appeared waiting upon the others so the ambassador and his wife must be at the residence in rome that was going to make it easier he retreated from the lighted part of the house still using the tree concealment to gain the darkened wall he hunched trying to recall from the plans inside his jacket where he was the identified kitchen provided the guide west wing nearest the drive that meant the study and drawing rooms there were breaker points on the window sashes and verandah windows to the study according to the plans fantani moved forward confirming the layout when he got nearer he went confidently to the drawing room window counting first laterally and then horizontally the paned windows isolating the third from the ground he unstrapped the glasscutter from his wrist and incisively arced an area he gummed tape strips across the cut line to prevent the glass either shattering or falling noisily into the room and cuffed it with the heel of his hand it broke cleanly swinging inwards on the sticky tape hinges fantani eased in his hand feeling for the connections between the doors which if broken would sound the alarm they jutted out like nipples and fantani fingered them familiarly he took the bypass leads from his other wrist shook out the wire to give him the maximum entry when the doors opened and went in again through the hole attaching the alligator clips to each nipple fantini counted up again to get alongside the latch and made another entry like the first hed been prepared for the lock to be empty but the key was carelessly in place he turned it depressed the handle and hesitating only momentarily pushed the door open to the full extent of the bypass leads there was no jangle of alarms fantani forewarned did not walk directly in but shortstepped sideways avoiding the secondary alarm system activated by the pressure pads beneath the window carpeting clear of the french windows he went cautiously towards the door leading further into the house hands held out for any obstruction at the door he stopped listening with his head close against a panel from the other side there was silence cautious still fantani pushed open the door and waited again there was no sound he widened it sufficiently to see out and ensure the corridor was empty emerging into the brightly lit passageway hed been in darkness for so long that the suddenness of the light burst at him he blinked against it anxious for darkness again the approach to the second storey curved around the rim of the vestibule a broad sweeping staircase wide enough for at least four people to ascend all comfortably abreast fantani ran up lightly pausing at the top to regain his sense of direction guest bedrooms left and right master suite ahead with the best view of the tyrrhenian sea at the door he paused listening again for any noise from inside although he heard nothing fantani was not satisfied he gently lowered the handle and eased the door ajar standing back to run if there was a sudden challenge there was nothing fantani hurried in securing the door behind him alert for the deep breathing of someone asleep he checked that the drapes were closed and actually felt out over the bed as a final insurance against its being occupied before he put on the light this wasnt a shared bedroom fantani knew at once only a man had ever slept here a proud man conscious of his success near the dressing table there was a bust which fantani presumed to be the ambassador by switching on the light hed activated the spotlight cleverly mounted alongside one of the wardrobes it gave the carving a godlike appearance the italians eyes moved uninterestedly over the pictures and diplomas stopping at the bed it was turned back only on one side with pyjamas neatly laid out so they werent sleeping at the official residence spurred by the warning fantani hurried to what was obviously the communicating door looking for the room that had been identified on the documents hed studied the dressing room was a large square place lined with cupboards apart from one entire wall elaborately arranged as a womans makeup area with lights fixed carefully around the mirror fantani took it all in at a glance seeking the desk he drew the safe blueprint from his jacket laying it out beside him on the floor there was no disturbance of the carpet to indicate how the pedestal might turn and fantani felt a momentary lurch of uncertainty he groped back beneath the leg area the securing bolt came snugly beneath his fingers he slid it easily aside and pushed lightly at first and then more strongly the left support swivelled sideways fantani stooped low inside the cramped space positioning the shortened stethoscope against the combination dial he began to sweat again because of the nervousness and the tightly enclosed space impatient for the numbers to coordinate with their code and snap into place around him the house remained quiet and undisturbed at the count of seven fantani began gently easing the lid it lifted at nine he stopped abruptly taking the thin tip of the glasscutter and running it gently beneath the rim feeling for any alarm trigger satisfied there was none fantani lifted the top off completely staring down inside the safe feeling the sharp burst of sensual pleasure more intense than he ever felt gazing at the naked body of a waiting woman beneath the circular opening the safe opened into a square retaining area and in it jewel boxes and containers were stacked like bricks in a childs construction game fantani took the cases individually from the safe emptying their contents into the silk bag every colour in the spectrum dazzled up at him reds and greens and blues and iced white and he felt the excitement block in his throat his hand was shaking when he replaced the safe top and twirled the dial to lock it he repositioned the covering pedestal and swept his hand across the carpet to erase any signs of disturbance he decided to leave as he had entered through the male bedroom he turned off the dressingroom lights crossed the darkened room and eased open the door to the landing and the widely sweeping staircase he was halfway out when he heard the womans voice talking animatedly before he snatched back into the bedroom he was trapped the interrogation rooms were subterranean far below ground level but there was no dungeon impression they were reached by a smooth operating lift and the corridors were rubbertiled and well lighted by concealed strips behind unbreakable overhead glass so that it appeared more like a hospital hotovy was in one of the central rooms kalenin stopped just inside the door the man was in a sitting position but not really in a chair it was a metal frame moulded to support a human shape hotovy was clamped into it completely naked with metal bands around his wrists arms waist ankles and thighs making him utterly immobile there was also a band around his neck to keep him upright the finger ends were pulped and crushed and electrodes were pasted to his genitals and nipples where he had been forced up against the tethering in the agony of the current being applied his body was purpled and bloodied there were some haphazard whip marks across his chest and thighs and his face was swollen and bruised the eyes moved although dully at kalenins entry there was a telephone just inside the door and kalenin used it to summon the waiting doctors there were three of them what exactly do you want asked the physician in charge complete awareness said kalenin hes got to recognize others can suffer as he has for how long kalenin shrugged a brief confession theres only one thing i really want to know any concern about lasting effects none they set up an intravenous drip and then examined hotovy for internal injuries there was some spleen and liver enlargement which they diagnosed as bruising but an encephalogram disclosed no brain damage hotovy was already stirring when they prepared the other injections the first stimulant they put into his arm but the second larger dose they pumped directly into the aorta an insertion only normally used for resuscitation after a heart collapse hotovys recovery was dramatic and complete to full consciousness kalenin had expected the man to show fear certainly there was apprehension but there was still a sullen resistance thirty minutes estimated the chief surgeon bring him ordered kalenin striding from the room supported by guards on either side hotovy was hauled feet dragging behind the kgb chief it was only a few yards to the other side of the interrogation area here the chambers were larger and partitioned so that observers could watch questioning unseen from a soundproofed box behind the glass hotovys wife and two sons sat cowed on a central bench the woman wore a shapeless prison dress and the boys were clinging to her terrified as they watched one gave way and began to cry and the woman pulled him into her shoulder to comfort him hotovy gave a cutoff strangled moan and pushed forward against the glass the guards were ready and held him back the czechs head moved like a boxer who has taken too much punishment no he said please no rome demanded kalenin what did you tell the british about rome hotovy looked round bewildered rome he said i told them nothing about rome it was a genuine confession thought kalenin you made a query to your ministry in prague about british concern at our expansion in africa theres a file record only for the designation of source whimpered hotovy and that was cape town rome was never mentioned kalenin went to the microphone linking him to the men standing over the woman and boys on the other side of the screen hotovy moaned again when he saw the russian reach out for the control switch what about rome persisted kalenin i dont know anything about rome wailed hotovy on my life its not your life said kalenin its theirs i dont know anything about rome for gods sake believe me kalenin did which meant the damage was no more extensive than he already knew it to be abruptly he turned on his heel and left the room the chief doctor caught up with him at the lift entrance that was a massive stimulant said the man id guess a collapse almost at once itll be severe kalenin turned as the doors opened hes not important any more he said richard semingford was a precise neat man given to blazers with club buttons and ties clubstriped too he had a closeclipped beard and on the first night they had slept together in her apartment jane williams had produced a picture of her bearded father in naval uniform and theyd tried to remember the opposite of an oedipus complex and failed they had made love there again tonight but not well and now they lay in the darkness side by side but untouching you didnt have to buy the meal he said i know things arent easy she said it costs a lot maintaining anns mother in that damned old peoples home and there are a lot of things the foreign office doesnt pay for with the kids schooling i said i dont mind she reminded him i do she felt out for his hand you shouldnt i love you and i understand i want to ask ann for a divorce is that sensible no he kissed her on the cheek she might have relaxed her catholic principles to marry a protestant but im pretty sure she wouldnt about divorce so whats the point permission isnt necessary any more she could still make it unpleasant the foreign office doesnt like personal unpleasantness you know she might not if she thought she was being properly provided for she squeezed his hand and how could you do that darling you cant manage as it is his hand tightened upon hers thats the bloody problem he said its always money she tried to think of something to break his mood and said we had an awful man out at the villa who some insurance assessor checking lady billingtons jewellery frightful person what was wrong with him cocksure for a start literally i could practically feel his hand up my skirt whats his name i never bothered to find out i used to see men like him wandering the streets of portsmouth and chatham when daddy was on base stumbling from pub to pub and leering at any girl they saw once more the mornings indignation was building up within her bloody cats made him sneeze and i had to look after the damned things what did lady billington think you know her the social conscience of the world she thinks everyones wonderful mustnt it be marvellous to have the billingtons money said semingford never again having to bother about endofmonth sums on the backs of envelopes ive never thought about it because you never had to he regretted it at once and said im sorry it doesnt matter it does and im sorry really i am ill get the money and divorce ann of course she said dont patronize me i didnt mean to but you did and you were rude i meant it about divorcing ann he said dont do anything silly darling she said im happy enough the way things are im not he said grimfaced in his initial panic fantani ran halfway across the bedroom which was a mistake by the time hed realized it they were outside so there was nothing he could do but make for the dressing room he was caught like a rat in a trap and with nowhere to hide he couldnt risk any of the closets because they might be opened on him the extravagantly lighted dressing table was built into the wall with no gap for concealment and there was no cover by the desk he heard the outer door open and close in the adjoining room and the light drove a silver brightness beneath the door almost at once there was the sound of the far door to the womans room and then the light snapped on there was only the window area it was the part of the room hed studied least of all vaguely remembering an ornate couch and heavy drapes he felt out sliding his foot gently across the carpeting to avoid a noisy collision he brushed lightly into the chaise longue groping down for the arm and sweeping his hand cautiously before him to ensure his path was clear suddenly he felt velvet between his fingers he reached behind the curtains every nerve end strained for a place beyond there was a space groping blindly his hands hit the sharp edge of the venetian blinds they rattled slightly against the window and fantani jerked back his next move was more cautious easing the curtains apart and then feeling forward to gauge the distance a metre no more hardly a body width and with the blinds at his back ready to clatter if he relaxed for a moment fantani pressed through pulling himself sideways at the sound of footfalls at once the room flooded with light and fantani closed his eyes in despair there was a parting between the curtain edges where hed failed to close them the light shafted through against the window providing him with a perfect reflection of the room and if either one looked too closely into the extensive brightly lit mirroring against the wall of the dressing room they would see him it was a woman and she was naked the evening gown crumpled in her hand she tossed it onto the couch on her way to the dressing table not completely naked he corrected there were still the rings and the ruby choker and the matching earrings she began leisurely to unfasten them concentrating not upon what she was doing but upon her body about fortyfive estimated fantani with professional expertise but shed taken care there was hardly any droop to her ass and shed retained the muscle control of her stomach so that there was no unsightly bulge when she relaxed she tossed one earring onto the table in front of her and cupped a full breast in either hand lifting them so the nipples rose like the noses of inquiring puppies hector she called what came a muffled voice im sure that woman with the german ambassador has had her breasts lifted it was his wife whats that got to do with it didnt think you knew who she was of course i knew who she was do you think she has what had her breasts lifted i didnt look with a dress like that it was hardly necessary i wonder if it hurts fantani heard but didnt see the other door open into the room how should i know the man came into view he was wearing a robe but his socks were still supported by old fashioned suspenders secured in an elasticized band just beneath the knee i sag complained the woman do you think i sag let go she lowered her hands and her breasts slumped theyre fine sometimes dresses are better without a bra middleaged wives of ambassadors dont walk about with their nipples sticking out and they dont stay so close to the cocktail waiter she unfastened the other earring then the necklace and began creaming the makeup from her face ive never let you down not yet frightened that i might i just wish youd cut it down a little fantanis body began to ache with the effort of holding himself away from the blinds and his legs began to shake get out he prayed desperately in the name of jesus and mary get out youre not worried about something are you he said of course not id like you to be careful over the next few weeks said billington were going to be under the microscope because of this damned summit will we have to stay at the official residence in rome yes i dont like it there its only for a short while those receptions and banquets and dinners are so boring how the hell do you expect me not to drink he moved so that he was between her and the mirror i expect you to support me as a wife he said she put down a mascarastained ball of cotton wool havent i always you have and im grateful said billington i just dont want there to be any mistakes its important for promotion you mean yes i wont do anything to hurt you she said solemnly i love you he said i love you too im sorry youre not happy the ambassador moved away from fantanis view what about the jewellery she called after him shouldnt it be put away fantani winced distantly the mans voice said in the morning goodnight then she called goodnight the light in the dressing room went out as abruptly as it had come on and fantani tottered forward against the back of the couch to take the strain from his legs he was thoroughly cramped like hed been sometimes as a child when the snows came to calabria and the cold had eaten into his body numbing him so badly it was difficult to walk still nervously alert for any sound he lowered himself into a kneeling position as if he were praying he swallowed hard to prevent the sob clamping his lips between his teeth against any breakdown gradually the spasms eased and he rolled over to rest his back against the rear of the couch it was two hours before fantani considered it safe to move he was fully recovered by then as careful as he had been when he first entered the ambassador had left the dressingroom door open fantani waited until he had located the mans slow easy breathing and then padded swiftly across to the outer door soundlessly he tiptoed down the marble staircase and when he got to the drawingroom windows his hinged entry spots were as he had left them in the garden he stopped dragging the cold air into his lungs almost done it he thought almost but not quite he found the cypress grove and slipped swiftly down the utterly black avenue to the wall at the cliff face he turned his back to the sea and paced five steps inland having established his marker he turned to the wall cupped the silk bag in his hand and like a basketball player going for a goal hefted the jewellery high over the electrified barrier with a sense of relief he heard it crunch on the other side getting back was not going to be easy the villa lights had been dimmed there was no moon and although he was close enough to reach out to feel its attachment to the wall he had to peer out to locate the blacker outline arching over the cliff at least the breeze had dropped fantani breathed in deeply tensed and threw himself into the blackness he didnt land flat as he had before but instead jarred into the web with the left side of his body he failed to get a foothold and for a second hung only by his left hand he felt the grip being torn away by the weight of his body and swung his right hand around desperately for support and impaled his hand upon one of the spear heads he gasped at the pain feeling the metal drive into his flesh he pulled away conscious of the skin ripping and managed to crook his almost numbed fingers around a spoke his body hung suspended at the furthest point of the halfweb and directly over the drop he could feel the blood running back along his arm he twitched his feet in tiny sideways movements to get a foothold with his left foot he managed to lever himself up sticking both arms through the bars and then curving them so one hand was free to discover how badly hurt he was the point had driven through the gloves almost at the centre of the palm like one of the sacrificial wounds in the church models of jesus that his mother had made him pray before when he went to confession he clamped his mouth shut against the moan dear god it hurt it hurt more than anything hed ever known before he was bleeding heavily and the fingers were stiffening there was hardly any grip in his right hand so he had to press his body tight against the sharpened tips they scraped his face and he felt the cotton of his windcheater split he made the turn and stopped again his arms holding him he couldnt manage it much longer the numbness was spreading from his hand into his wrist he crabbed towards the cliff but pushed his body first this time he got as far as his waist when his foot slipped and his legs slipped away from the metalwork dangling over the edge fantani snatched out with his uninjured hand locking his fingers into a bracken outcrop he heaved up and wedging his elbows beneath his body dragged the rest of his body to safety he rolled away from the rim and lay on his back he was crying at the effort tears mixing with the sweat and itching his face he let the emotion flood out needing the release he got up at last pulling awkwardly with his left hand at the jacket zip and slotting his right arm into it to create a makeshift sling reluctantly he went to the edge paced in five steps and stopped putting his good hand over the wet grass he quickly located the jewellery and wedged it beneath his left arm the lightness of dawn was already showing to the east as he took the car along the ostia road and then turned inland towards rome the feeling had practically gone from his hand and the lightheadedness he knew from marijuana and cocaine made him giggle aloud careless at the closeness of hysteria hed done it the nightduty man contacted harkness at home and the deputy decided the importance justified the use of an insecure line telephoning the director in hampshire wilson answered on the second ring sorry to disturb you harkness said what is it i asked for a deep investigation beyond what we already had said the deputy weve just had a response from australia it seems for a brief period jill walsingham was a member of the communist party there there was a short silence then wilson demanded whys it taken so long to find out it was brief like i said just three months during her last year at university then she resigned which is the first thing she would have been told to do if she was going underground said wilson did she know walsingham then not for another two years they met when he was attached to canberra so she could have sought him out under instructions yes so now the walsinghams are more likely candidates than semingford said the director during the night hed turned away from her charlie eased himself around to avoid disturbing her if she awoke she would want to make love and charlie still had the ache of the previous night the light was pale hardly enough at first to create more than a silhouette clarissa slept on her back with her mouth slightly parted she was snoring faint bubbly snores and as he watched her face twitched first into a frown and moments later into a smile he wanted to reach out and touch her but held back what was he going to do about her thered been affairs before when edith was alive and shed always been the excuse to end them the person hed gratefully returned home to but now edith was dead so he didnt have his excuse and he didnt know if he wanted one anyway clarissa wore floppy hats to the royal enclosures at ascot and crewed yachts during cowes week and ate from fortnum and mason hampers from the back of rolls royces at glyndebourne and he was charlie muffin who had never got closer to ascot than the betting shop in dean street thought ocean racer was the name of a greyhound and had never known the difference between an aria and an intermezzo no matter what she said to romanticize her adventure it was a novelty fun it would be wrong to let his loneliness make it into anything more the telephone interrupted his thoughts charlie jumped fumbling it from the rest to avoid awakening clarissa there was the echoing delay of an overseas connection and then the sound of rupert willoughbys voice charlie hunched forward at the edge of the bed his entire concentration upon what he was being told and its implications he turned to see clarissa blinking at him what is it she said theres been a robbery at the billington villa said charlie flatly everythings gone she jerked up so the bedclothes fell away from her but thats just too much of a coincidence completed charlie what are you talking about she said i dont know said charlie not yet in london rupert willoughby stared down at the telephone and at the preliminary report of the inquiry agent which was alongside he felt disgusted at clarissa at charlie and at himself early in his intelligence career charlie muffin developed an instinct a personal antenna for danger it had been instinct that turned him from the east berlin border to hand the keys of the marked volkswagen to a student to drive into a hail of machinegun fire instead of an escape to the west and it was the same instinct that gripped him now as he went towards the villa at ostia he wasnt a clerk any more making ticks against a piece of paper he was charlie muffin a renegade operative who had spent seven years hiding from any sort of authority being forced to confront god knows how many police and a security system of a british embassy and he was being forced his initial thought in the rome hotel room had been to run but if he ran less than twentyfour hours after completing an insurance survey during which hed learned the security and opened the safe hed be the obvious suspect and get no further than the first check at any airport he attempted to escape from so there was only one thing he could do continue under the guise of insurance assessor and try to recover every scrap of the expertise hed once had to avoid detection it would be like trying to cross a fraying tightrope without a safety net he never had liked circuses there was a police roadblock a mile from the villa officialdom showing its stabledoor mentality but charlie had taken the precaution of telephoning ahead and after a radio check he was waved through from the vantage point of the approaching hill the villa looked as if it were under siege by blueuniformed carabinieri they encircled the outside wall apparently prodding through undergrowth for clues and charlie saw more moving in similar headbent fashion throughout the stepped gardens there were police everywhere rooflights flickered red and from other cars came a distorted crackle of radios the gate check was more stringent than the one on the road and charlie tensed at the scrutiny of his photograph against the willoughby insurance authority and the recording of the hirecar number the fear became a positive numbness permeating his body but they were all italians here so there was little risk of their identifying him and it was still fiftyfifty with any of the embassy staff if he were recognized at ground level he could give the same story hed used with willoughby premature retirement because of policy changes and hope to christ no one was efficient enough to query it with london before he was released at the gate permission was sought by telephone from the main house in a babble of italian and for some reason a policeman got into the passenger seat for the short journey to the villa there were white sweat rings under the arms of his uniform and he had a machine pistol looped over his shoulder the muzzle nudged against charlies leg when the man settled himself and charlie waved it away the man eyed him insolently but shifted slightly he muttered something in italian and charlie said fuck you too nearer the house a concentration of uniformed and plainclothes people were gathered by a wooden cradle like the sort used on office blocks by window cleaners it was slung over the cliff edge and men in overalls were strapped into it they appeared to be examining a metal protection device shaped in a half circle jane williams was waiting for him this time there was no offered hand this is a terrible business she said yes said charlie trouble always seemed to bring out the cliche in people the ambassador is in his study more men in uniform were assembled in some sort of guard outside the house and as they went in charlie saw plainclothes technicians working at a window area in one of the rooms off the central corridor who discovered it said charlie the ambassador how he went to the safe to replace some jewellery lady billington wore last night and found it empty any signs of entry through one of the french windows back there she stopped outside a door and said sir hectors in there the ambassador stood up at charlies entry coming gravefaced towards him he was a large man tall and heavily built his hair was cultivated long for a patrician appearance and if it hadnt been for the tan charlie guessed he would be floridfaced he must have modelled for the upstairs sculpture several years before billington wore white pumps white trousers and a silk cravat was immaculately knotted beneath a blue silk blazer charlie thought he looked ready to walk onto the set of one of those fellini films hed counted the minutes through in his early conformist days in the department willoughby promised to contact you said the ambassador did he say why no said the ambassador have you met the police yet i wanted to see you first billington showed charlie to a chair and sat himself behind a pristinely neat desk willoughby tells me everything has gone said charlie all except what my wife wore last night whys that wed been to a reception at the german embassy said billington everything was intact when we left at seven because my wife had the safe open to choose what to wear when i went to put it back this morning it was empty everything gone how many staff have you got ive already told the police id like you to tell me pressed charlie billington hesitated and said nine they heard nothing not a thing how was the safe opened it was opened said the ambassador as if the question were ridiculous by explosives or combination said charlie patiently combination said billington the police say it was extremely professional must have been said charlie i went through the whole system two days ago who had the combination whats that supposed to mean the ambassador bristled its supposed to mean im investigating the theft of a million and a half pounds worth of jewellery said charlie billington coloured are you suggesting some member of my staff isnt trustworthy im suggesting that no thief is professional enough to bypass the security i saw locate an unusually concealed safe and pick a combination lock like the one upstairs without some sort of help said charlie so who had the combination i did said billington stiffly my wife the secretary the embassy security man theres a record of it in the security vault at the embassy and my solicitor of course in london thats a lot of people said charlie all trustworthy did anything happen which now seems to have been at all unusual either here or at the embassy immediately prior to the robbery like what anything you can think of no the response was categoric what about afterwards this morning for instance why are you asking me this said billington irritably the jewellery is useless for any sort of normal disposal so whats the point of stealing it resale to the insurers said charlie thats why willoughby was so anxious to stop me leaving rome he wants me to be here on the spot ready to negotiate billington smiled for the first time showing cosmetically even teeth i suppose its obvious he said its been such a confused morning it hadnt occurred to me he thought for a moment then said these negotiations you talk of would they be independent of the police i doubt if theyd accept it said charlie their interest is in an arrest billington looked doubtful im not sure i could agree to bypass the authorities were talking about jewellery you estimate to be worth two million pounds which is adequately covered by an insurance policy that doesnt expire for another month reminded the ambassador obviously id like it back intact some of the pieces are irreplaceable and it would take years to build up a collection again charlie hadnt anticipated billingtons opposition id like you to think about it he said one doesnt cooperate with criminals said billington firmly you wouldnt be said charlie i would i think youd better tell willoughby id like a settlement its not as easy as that why not before we could consider any sort of settlement we would have to be absolutely satisfied about the circumstances of the robbery and that there was no possibility of any of the articles being recovered said charlie formally he thought it sounded quite convincing im not sure if i fully understand what youre implying said the ambassador im not implying said charlie i am ensuring that you appreciate the terms of the policy i left that to my solicitor to negotiate said billington then he should have made it clear that replacement is only considered when the police indicate theres no chance of recovery exaggerated charlie he supposed billington could check with the lawyer but it was a chance he had to take how long could that be i imagine the political embarrassment would prevent such an admission for a long time this is preposterous said billington tightly youre telling me ive virtually no cover your cover is absolute and assured insisted charlie ive just set out the two ways it could be resolved one quick one protracted ill have to give it some consideration usually there isnt much delay in making an approach id be assured of your discretion absolutely it was like gradually tiring a hooked fish thought charlie its not a situation i enjoy who does said charlie but there are occasions when one has to be practical it would be a tragedy to lose some of the older pieces said billington reflectively theyve been in the family for generations if theres an approach and we dont respond itll be broken down and sold piecemeal lost for ever billington had almost given up fighting it was time to slip the net beneath him and haul him in there was a sudden knock at the door and the chance was lost charlie looked up irritably there was a man behind jane williams dwarfing her with his bulk inspector guilio moro she said do you want to see me inquired billington rising to his feet no said the policeman pointing at charlie him the robbery report had come in less than an hour after the australian information about jill walsingham this time the duty officer awakened sir alistair wilson and then sent a car so the director arrived on the south side of the river earlier than normal harkness was already waiting when he got there theres to be a meeting in downing street said the deputy youre expected at eleven oclock wilson had anticipated the summons what do we know so far a robbery some time during the night said harkness theres extensive security precautions but all appear to have been bypassed the safe is hidden in some peculiar way beneath a bureau or a desk or something it was found easily enough opened and cleaned out of what only jewellery its a private safe carelessness isnt unusual its a leaky embassy said wilson just jewellery assured harkness our people involved not directly said harkness i thought it best to keep the surveillance as it was walsingham has gone to the villa wilson got up and walked stifflegged over to his river view but did not bother to look out what does it mean could be coincidence not a chance said wilson positively he stood still for a moment what about the ambassador sir hector john billington harkness read from his file father sir john billington who was ambassador to washington and paris before returning to the foreign office as permanent under secretary in the late forties the son was brilliant got a triple first in greats at oxford and a law degree which isnt the usual combination entered the diplomatic service a year earlier than his father passed every internal examination with honours usually a year and sometimes two ahead of the normally expected period junior posting to washington with distinction first ambassadorship to saudi arabia big impact there credited on an internal memorandum with greatly influencing the saudi court in maintaining a moderate stance and keeping oil prices down through opec from saudi arabia he went to brussels difficult time in belgium explaining our reduced defence support for nato particularly as the common market is headquartered there after brussels posted to rome hes been there two years wilson picked up the inconsistency immediately why rome he said billingtons obviously a foreign office star rome is a backwater harkness smiled i had the same thought he said hes rising too fast theres a log jam of seniority above him when the retirements come in a year or two hell get the prime postings either paris or washington what about the wife lady billingtons family name is hethenton said harkness father was lord mendale the fortune is put at ten million but thats only a guess tax lawyers and accountants have got it so well spread it could be that much again wilson began his aimless stumping around the office again we know theyve got hotovy he was thinking aloud theyve obviously broken him but he didnt know the reason for the inquiry reminded harkness so what can he tell them just that he found the origin of a message was cape town by itself thats meaningless i still cant go along with coincidence said wilson the internal telephone sounded because he was nearer harkness answered the cars waiting for you downstairs he said thanks theyre going to want some answers i havent got any said wilson the prime ministers residence in downing street has several entrances there is the obvious and public front door or the less conspicuous corridor from the official house of the chancellor of the exchequer next door the most discreet is at the back from horseguards parade and across the gardens and this was the route that sir alistair used the patterned hand of the ministry of works was obvious from the scrupulous flower arrangements wilson looked for roses and was disappointed nairehamilton was already waiting in the downstairs anteroom he hurried up at the directors entry he was flushed more than wilson could remember seeing him the redness suffusing even his balding head what on earths happening demanded the permanent under secretary youve read the early account of the robbery of course then you know as much as i do the door opened suddenly and a secretary beckoned them forward wilson deferred politely to nairehamilton following him to the prime ministers firstfloor study it overlooked st jamess park and the rose beds perhaps thats why they didnt bother with them in the immediate garden thought the director idly the secret intelligence service comes under the direct control of the foreign secretary with ultimate responsibility held by the premier both men were waiting for them george ramsay was a thickset bespectacled man who had won the previous election largely through personal appeal as the blunttalking man of the people who would neither mislead the electorate with monetary gymnastics to achieve economic miracles nor allow unions to abuse their powers even ramsay a consummately professional politician had been surprised by the reaction to the straightfromtheshoulder approach recommended by the advertising agency who masterminded the campaign ramsay cultivated the image of the prime minister who had come to power after a divisive period of british politics to introduce stability he worked hard to sustain the role because basically he enjoyed it he sported chainstore suits and smoked a reassuring pipe occasionally the plain speaking was overwhelmed with welsh rhetoric and a fondness for cliche a favourite metaphor had him as the captain guiding a troubled ship from storms into calmer water another was the need to avoid rocking the boat he was at his desk when nairehamilton and wilson entered the pipe was alight and he wore cardigan and slippers the intelligence director didnt think he looked much like a captain more like a clever mp on his way to a fancydress party dont like this announced ramsay at once obviously plainspeaking time decided the director its going to cause a lot of publicity cant have that with the other business supported ian beldon the foreign secretary entered politics from cambridge where hed had the chair of philosophy it was difficult to imagine him as an academic he was a burly redfaced man of heavy ponderous movement rumour was that he was the cabinet bully and wilson found the accusation easy to believe wilson had expected the permanent under secretary to lead but nairehamilton turned inviting the response from him theres got to be a connection said the director what demanded ramsay at this stage i dont know we dont seem to know much about anything do we said beldon we only confirmed the origin of the leak a week ago said the director annoyed at the attack i was instructed to conduct a cautious discreet inquiry ramsay got up from his desk and went to an adjoining table to knock the dottle from his pipe the slippers were the type without heels so he shuffled across the carpet ramsay worked with a pipe cleaner it was several minutes before he appeared satisfied he turned back to the two men and said the risk now is that everything is going to come out were fully aware of the situation said nairehamilton entering the discussion at last im not going to be made to look stupid insisted the premier unless this is settled and settled as i want it to be i cant lead the delegation to rome in a fortnights time no one can go no said nairehamilton and we cant cancel either said beldon so what are you going to do demanded ramsay again the permanent under secretary gave wilson his cue there are two possible lines of inquiry said the director uncomfortable with the words as he uttered them possible or positive seized ramsay with a politicians ability to discern an empty sentence only possible admitted wilson thats not very encouraging said the foreign secretary theres a filter on anything sensitive going into the embassy and ive got six men inside under cover of summit preparations and a separate surveillance team of a further twelve said wilson what exactly have they come up with said beldon the inquiry has only just started youve already said that beldon wasnt going to make this easy we accept the difficulties interceded ramsay but its got to be settled he paused thats why i want you to go personally me said wilson i know its not usual but the circumstances arent usual before i can set foot in that embassy ive got to know its scoured clean i see the point said nairehamilton glad you do said ramsay i want you to go too nairehamiltons hands rose and fell like frightened birds seeking a spot to land but thats not usual i know the premier interrupted weve already discussed that i want wilson here solving the security problems and i want you cementing over the cracks i want to go to italy in a fortnights time with only the summit to worry about he smiled a politician imparting a confidence believe me thats going to be enough nairehamilton looked like he was standing to attention on a parade ground it was anger wilson decided this temporary inspector had altered the bus route more drastically than was permitted and nairehamilton was offended if thats your wish he said brittlevoiced no said ramsay relighting his pipe its not my wish its my instruction youve got a week at most im laying on raf transport at northolt for whatever needs you have im entrusting you with full authority all i want to know is that its been cleared up nairehamiltons car was waiting in horseguards road by the park he strode angrily towards it around the edge of the parade ground head forward wilson had to step out to keep pace which was difficult with his lame leg who the hell does he think he is exclaimed nairehamilton the prime minister said wilson simply damned upstart the ambassador directed them to the reception room in which charlie had been abandoned by jane williams on his first visit there was a palatial embarrassment of space the two men regarded each other warily charlie trying to conceal his apprehension inspector moro was a pearshaped shambles of a man his clothes were a contradiction of effort the shirt bubbled apart from the strain of each fastening and the crumpled silk suit that enveloped him looked like a castoff from someone even larger the heat troubled him despite the air conditioning so he frequently dabbed a oncewhite handkerchief around his face and inside the neckband of his shirt charlies impression was of a bloated python sweating to shed a skin you didnt take long getting here i was already in rome said charlie i know so why the surprise no surprise just curious charlie recognized that there was nothing scruffy about the questioning moro was conducting the interrogation exactly as he would have done in the circumstances hard and sharp the policemans english was immediate without any pause for the right word why curious said charlie you spend two days here looking at the security and the collection and then theres a robbery said moro if you were a policeman wouldnt you be curious i suppose so conceded charlie except that im here at the villa and not on some plane going in the opposite direction you wouldnt have made it what the plane i closed every airport against you four hours ago thank christ he hadnt tried to run thought charlie but the numbing cottonwoolinthehead feeling was making an uncomfortable return satisfied he said he hoped his nervousness didnt show no why not it would be cleverer to come back wouldnt it im not involved insisted charlie would the policeman already have made an identity check through the interpol communications link charlie felt the sweat prick out on his back convince me said moro how tell me how a security system as impregnable as this was so easily breached i would have thought that was obvious perhaps it isnt to me it cant possibly be an outside job said charlie there has to be inside knowledge of the alarms and the position of the safe which you knew so did at least six other people apart from the staff hardly impregnable was it said moro no which could be expensive for you either way either way if youve got to pay out as a genuine insurer or if youre involved because theres no way youre going to get out of italy the nausea swept through charlie so that he actually belched he hadnt expected the confrontation to be easy but he hadnt expected this sort of hostility either moro made a sweeping gesture with his hand i havent investigated a crime for a long time he said not even a crime of this size so what are you doing here my job whats that diplomatic protection which accounted for the perfect english thought charlie whats diplomatic about this by tomorrow the newspapers here and abroad will be saying we cant protect foreign politicians and diplomats any more than the government can do anything effective to stamp out terrorism our subversive groups are quick to see a trend we cant take the risk with the summit what summit said charlie uncertainty was piling upon uncertainty in two weeks time italy is hosting a common market and nato summit said moro the department wouldnt be directly involved calculated charlie but there would be a watching brief with all the protection intelligence channelled for routine information and that would extend to photographs charlie thrust his hands deeply into his pockets clenching his fists until his fingers hurt to stop the nervous shaking i understand your problem he said im not sure that you do supercilious bastard thought charlie im sure youll explain it he said the mockery got through to the italian his lip tightening against his teeth my orders from the prime ministers office are to stop the trend before it begins he said and that means an arrest so im going to get one which should save my company a lot of money im not interested in saving your money what are you interested in catching who did it so you want to recover what was stolen to minimize your liability isnt that the same dont be smart said moro i know how these robberies are usually settled with insurance companies some blackcar meeting in an alley with a ransom exchange but that isnt going to happen here if theres any contact for a percentage settlement i want to know about it i want to know the time its made when the meeting is arranged and i dont care how much of the jewellery is lost in the process bollocks thought charlie do you understand what im saying you speak the language well enough said charlie try it any other way and therell still be an arrest itll be yours for impeding inquiries and if i find youve paid over any money the charge will be complicity to rob loud and clear said charlie moro smiled unexpectedly it had the effect of puddling the fat on his cheeks im not intending it to be onesided said the detective as a sudden concession for cooperation from you therell be cooperation from me ill show you the safe first moro had an odd rolling gait as if his weight needed constant balancing but he moved through the house with an immediate familiarity there were police on guard outside both bedrooms leading to the dressing area moro entered through billingtons door there were more men inside heads bent in the hunt for clues like those in the garden the bed was unmade and billingtons pyjamas were draped over a pillow the examination of the dressing room had been completed and it was empty of forensic scientists the area around the safe was white from fingerprint powder absolutely clean said the italian charlie raised his eyebrows stooping he saw they had even tested the securing bolt at the rear of the sidewaysmoving pedestal ive never known an installation like this he said neither have i so it wouldnt be an obvious place to look no what about entry said charlie downstairs sitting room said moro there was more fingerprint powder around the french windows and sticky tape acted as hinges on two cleanly cut panes one near the lock and another low adjacent to the breaker alarm nipples there were bypass clips still linking them what about them asked charlie two thousand lire in any electrical shop in the city said moro wind was gusting in from the sea dissipating the oppressive midday heat moros hair lifted in the breeze tousling untidily around his perspiring face the two men walked out onto the verandah and looked out towards the men suspended over the cliff in the window cleaners hoist it cant have been easy said charlie it wasnt said moro one of them must be quite badly hurt it happened on the way out otherwise there would have been bloodstains inside the house theres a lot of blood on the metalwork and smeared against the grass on the other side well be able to get a grouping and at least part if not all of a palm print its a hand injury looks like it said moro he pointed to one of the spearshaped points we think he caught himself trying to get around that clothes were torn too weve got a lot of fibres for comparison moro turned away from the forensic examination to look directly at charlie whats your insured value one and a half million sterling said charlie impassive moro made an entry into a notebook with a surprisingly small gold pen the writing was neat and precise im going to limit all the information said moro i dont want you making any press releases publicity was the last thing charlie wanted dont worry he said at the moment you know as much as i do said moro which isnt much said charlie remember what i said how could i forget youd better not said moro emilio fantanis hand had been stitched and then strapped across his body so that the damaged palm was practically upright against his left shoulder there had been an injection against both the pain and infection but the italian was still wheyfaced wincing at occasional spasms the police will check hospitals and doctors warned solomatin the injury was unforeseen and solomatin was unsettled by it the plan had been perfect and now it was flawed the doctors a queer said fantani tightlipped in his discomfort ive got photographs that could ruin him solomatin felt the anxiety lessen slightly what about fingerprints the fingers of the gloves remained intact said fantani solomatin smiled briefly you did well he said what have you done with it all safe assured solomatin in the deposit box with the other material that was going to switch suspicion hiding it in the box hadnt been part of kalenins plan and solomatin was uneasy at the improvisation fantani looked at his bandaged hand the tendons could be affected he said the doctor made me try to move my fingers and i couldnt bruising said solomatin itll be all right the man would be dead before he had the chance you know where the insurance man is solomatin nodded it wont be long now how long two days three at the most fantani tried to flex his injured hand hurts like hell he said all you have to do is arrange one meeting said solomatin ill do the rest ill even carry the stuff to the exchange spot where demanded fantani an apartment on the via salaria apartment im going to move people in said solomatin to cover the exchange fantani felt reassured by the promise of protection were going to work together now arent we he said anxious for the commitment hand in glove smiled the russian it was a bad joke but fantani smiled in the censored society of moscow ambiguous phrases and expressions have evolved to convey happenings which are never officially announced criticism on tass or in pravda or isvestia of the failure of a programme or an announced development plan is usually the first hint of a purge against the man in charge sometimes though not often the victim is named so as to remove any vestige of doubt if there isnt identification in the first instance it usually comes from the disclosure of some illness or other to account for an absence during any public event with boris kastanazy the procedure was different his secret position with the kgb prevented any criticism of work failure so the suggestion of ill health was unexpected and initially confused the western embassies who monitor and attempt to interpret such statements valery kalenin wasnt confused he put the newspaper aside and lit one of his tubed cigarettes the place was vacant on the politburo he intended it to be his it was an irrational impression standing on a clifftop overlooking hundreds of miles of open sea but charlie was gripped by a feeling of constriction of being enclosed and he was enclosed as securely as if he had been inside the four walls of a jail his name would be on file now the description fed into the computers ready to be spewed out at the touch of a button charlie tried to breathe out against the surge of panic thered been moments of danger in the past seven years but hed never come under this degree of official scrutiny moro had started out treating him as a suspect and charlie knew the detective wasnt completely satisfied despite the apparent willingness to cooperate it would only need one computer printout punched into another and the lights would go on like christmas decorations charlie walked back through the cypress grove the sickness bunched in his stomach shit he said vehemently shit the search squads had worked up through the gardens and were milling around in the driveway with nothing to do some lounged against cars and others squatted at the grass edge smoking and talking a police vehicle had been driven in behind his car and the radio was on like those near the gate lodge so the stutter of conversation was overlaid by bursts of staticstrained talk between controllers and radio operators robbery or no robbery charlie didnt think it would take long for the ambassador to become annoyed at his property being trampled over by half the police feet in italy charlie entered through the side door police crowded the corridor using the fishmouthed fountain as a gathering point lady billington was at the foot of the staircase looking around her in bemusement at the activity her face relaxed when she recognized charlie would you believe all these people she was carrying one of the cats and charlie got the impression it arched its back towards him im sorry said charlie theyre not with you are they i meant about the robbery she put her head to one side i wondered what it would be like not having them didnt i she said now i know whats it feel like nothing she said actually its you i feel sorry for youve got to pay one way or another thought charlie he said what happened exactly i was dressing when hector came in to put away last nights jewellery he opened the safe and said oh my god every case we opened was empty you heard nothing during the night not a thing she shuddered dont like the idea of some awful man going through my things they will be caught wont they the police seem very determined you thought the security was adequate everyone did hectors dreadfully upset hes waiting for me now said charlie excusing himself there was someone else in billingtons study wanted to talk your idea through with henry walsingham said billington security momentarily charlie was shielded by the ambassador it lasted seconds but there was a bizarre slowmotion surrealism about walsinghams approach charlie was confronted by a palefaced man with blond nearwhite hair a matching drooped moustache and a stridently checked threepiece suit walsingham shook hands with a stiff hingeintheneck sort of movement that reminded charlie of the national service subalterns whod made him scrub coalhouses with a toothbrush a stranger decided charlie relieved he was sure theyd never met before but his stomach was still moving loosebowelled the more i think about it the unhappier i become declared billington returning to his desk after the formalities were over a sellback was inspector moros first thought said charlie taking the chair to the left of the desk walsingham sat in front back upright one leg crossed over the other the trouser creases were sharpedged and the brogues glimmered charlie recognized a hotspoon job is he happy about it said the ambassador hardly said charlie but he didnt oppose it what then he knows its the most likely way the thieves will choose and wants us to work together an idea began to form in charlies mind it had a conceited desperation about it but it was feasible are there any clues the security man had a thin weak voice a lot on the cliff said charlie one of them was injured getting around the metal protection theres sufficient blood for grouping there are some clothes fibres trapped on the spikes and at least one palm print i think we can leave it to the police said billington the police want me to negotiate said charlie theyve got enough for a conviction not an arrest that will come from the insurance arrangement it would be unseemly for an ambassador of the crown to deal with thugs billington retreated to his basic objection you dont have to be involved repeated charlie all you have to do is wait for the contact and tell me as quickly as possible so i can get the hell out of it you will liaise with the police ive given inspector moro that undertaking that was an exaggeration too but billington was on the hook again and this time charlie couldnt afford to lose him what do you think the ambassador asked walsingham i think official approval from the police is essential the man replied guardedly which i have said charlie there wasnt any point in buggering about with halftruths any more speed was what mattered then i suppose it would be all right walsingham was still doubtful ill pass on any initial contact agreed billington suddenly but thats all thats all i want from that moment i dont want any part of what follows youll liaise entirely through walsingham here and if theres a return or whatever youre to handle it nothing more to do with me typical bloody commander thought charlie back at base camp out of the firing while everyone else gets their asses shot off beside him walsingham uncrossed his legs and placed his bright shoes at attention what would you want me to do he said to charlie and youre the sort of silly sod who marches off to the front whistling colonel bogey thought charlie he decided the mans moustache would make soup hazardous contact numbers would be useful he said the security man took a worn leather wallet from inside his jacket and charlie half saw a faded regimental crest walsingham handed him a card with his private number as well as an embassy telephone listing is that all walsingham was clearly disappointed until there is any approach there cant be anything else can there said charlie through the perpetual apprehension came the feeling of satisfaction he always got at winning i dont want this to become embarrassing insisted billington neither do i said charlie all billington had to lose was one and a half million pounds worth of shiny stones charlie had much more there was a lancia interchanging with a fiat behind him on the return drive from ostia it would be the police charlie knew it would be wrong to overreact to moro if he let his nerves respond to every development like a bellstriker on a fairground ringyourstrength machine he was going to create precisely the suspicion he was attempting to avoid he was at the sharp end of a difficult situation but hed been in worse and got out clarissa wasnt at the hotel when he returned and charlie was relieved she was another problem that had to be solved when he was working properly working charlie didnt like distractions the robbery could be the excuse he had been looking for in bed that morning charlie listened to willoughbys london number being dialled and was conscious of the concern in the underwriters voice when he came on the line the embarrassment that charlie felt at their earlier contact wasnt there any more how bad is it demanded willoughby bad said charlie he gave a swift but complete account and when he finished willoughby said theres obviously a thief on the ambassadors staff not obviously said charlie but possibly you warned billington of an approach yes said charlie hes not keen on recovering everything intact hes worried that any personal involvement would compromise him said charlie hes talking about a settlement that wouldnt be easy said willoughby what do you mean i mean two million pounds he was going with alice through the lookingglass and the room was getting smaller again didnt you spread the cover said charlie wearily just like hong kong and the liner fire no i didnt think gambling and insurance went hand in hand said charlie i needed liquidity said willoughby whoever would have thought billingtons stuff could be stolen whoever took it said charlie unhelpfully what about obviation of policy if there isnt a sellback said willoughby not a chance charlie would not give the man false hope i confirmed every item on the list twentyfour hours before it was taken and there hadnt been the slightest alteration to the protection as its described youre one hundred and one per cent liable thanks a million two million corrected charlie is there any point in my coming out charlie glanced towards the closet where clarissas clothes were tightpacked i dont think so he said not yet youve managed difficult things before not like this said charlie he needed all the luck he could get in london willoughby looked across the room towards the safe in which the observation reports were locked he wouldnt use them he decided hed wait for another occasion to trap clarissa and knowing her it wouldnt take long henry jackson was already waiting when wilson and nairehamilton entered the suite that had been established as a communal briefing room an uptodate summary demanded wilson crisply we let walsingham go out to the villa as instructed said jackson he got back to the embassy about an hour ago weve spoken by telephone he says the police believe there was inside help from our own observation we identified police being moved in to watch the villa staff and put a cover on all embassy personnel with frequent access what about the embassy not the panic that id hoped for and ive had our people making a bloody nuisance of themselves to walsingham and semingford whats the security like asked nairehamilton walsingham gave me a tour said jackson seemed tight enough you advised the embassy of my arrival said wilson half an hour ago lets see if i can shake the trees said wilson clarissa sensed charlies mood she didnt speak in the lift but outside the hotel on the via sistina she looped both hands through his arm and hugged against him charlie glanced towards the spanish steps and isolated the unmarked police car with its bootmounted aerial he moved off in the opposite direction why are we walking she said good for us said charlie when the moment had come in the hotel room hed ducked it like a bloody fool it wasnt going to get any easier she pulled closer to him but didnt say anything the via sistina is a street of small shops none very fashionable but charlie went through the charade of stopping and staring and quickly identified the man following them in the reflection of a boutique window he was small in a doublebreasted suit and a widebrimmed hat which was identifiable and made him an amateur at surveillance for positive confirmation charlie crossed suddenly near the road junction by the theatre as if he wanted to check the programme the man darted after them clarissa was curious but said nothing with all the determination of the committed sightseer which is what he wanted to appear in the subsequent reports to moro charlie set a course for the trevi fountain the nearest landmark he could think of there was the usual throng of tourists around the base of the monument when they arrived in the square clarissa immediately demanded a coin to make a wish work youve got to stand with your back to the fountain charlie said she did as she was instructed closed her eyes and tossed the coin awkwardly over her head quickly glancing sideways charlie saw the bluesuited man at the side parapet where the horsedrawn carriages were parked waiting for tourist fares now you said clarissa cant afford it said charlie irritated with himself he took her arm guiding her through the crowd up to the higher balustrade as they walked charlie saw one of the carriage horses start to urinate in a sudden steaming burst and from the way the policeman jumped charlie guessed he hadnt been able to get his feet out of the way in time there was a small cafe with three tables wedged onto the pavement but they were all occupied it was cramped in the dark interior and smelled of yesterdays garlic charlie ordered cognac with his coffee but predictably clarissa refused alcohol they sat unspeaking until the drinks were served and then clarissa said why not say it i dont want you to stay i know you could be in menton by tonight i dont want to go to menton im working and im in the way charlie swirled the liquor around the tiny balloon glass something isnt right he said what do you mean the robbery isnt right i dont know what it is you arent making sense nothing makes sense at the moment i still dont see why i cant stay with you i dont think its safe that sounds dramatic we were followed here by the police clarissa stared wildly around the cafe good lord what happens if they check with rupert in london i dont know of course you bloody know dont shout im sorry just go please slam bam thank you maam your rules you played and now the game is over it isnt just that is it she put her hand on his arm charlie could not hold the stare from the clear blue eyes unless were sensible this is going to end up a real mess he said so what i dont want it for rupert or for you so what are you going to do i dont know you ran away after america yes there was no doubt he had a talent for it dont run away this time id like you to leave he said doggedly clarissa sighed im disappointed charlie i didnt make any promises it wasnt promises i wanted what then she considered an answer and then appeared to change her mind dont come back to the hotel with me she said all right see you in london she said and charlie knew she meant it he said nothing he followed her as far as the cafe door as she walked away charlie watched mens heads turn and he felt pride not jealousy the bluesuited detective shifted and then relaxed again against the balustrade overlooking the fountain charlie saw someone else move away from the crowd it could have been coincidence because there was a constant flow of people along the approach roads but he didnt think it was the man was wearing a grey suit and charlie had the feeling he had seen him before the meal began in frigid silence like all the others after a few moments semingford pushed his plate away food untouched something wrong no what then ann semingford was an angular sharpfeatured woman who had responded to her husbands neglect by neglecting herself the smock dress was the one she had been wearing for most of the week and her hair hung lankly around a face that was shiny without makeup im not hungry love i want to talk thatll make a change i want a divorce ann she stopped eating the moment of truth she said striking a pose dont be stupid isnt it you whos being stupid whats the point of either of us bothering you know how i feel about divorce thats hypocritical in the circumstances do you want me just to walk out i dont think youd do that richard it would hardly help your career would it bugger my career since when it isnt important any more what is finding a way to be with jane sir alistair wilson entered the embassy through the main entrance off the via settembre identified himself at the reception area and signed in walsingham appeared within minutes hurrying across the marble vestibule he was heavier jowled than he appeared in the personnel photographs with the beginning of a paunch corseted by the waistcoat of a brownchecked suit sir alistair wilson said walsingham tentatively wilson extended his hand walsinghams response was wetpalmed ive told the ambassador you were coming he said eagerly thank you said wilson the security officer appeared more nervous than wilson would have expected he said to let him know if you wanted to see him walsingham hesitated and added actually he was surprised you hadnt approached him is there an office we can go to said wilson the abruptness seemed to unsettle walsingham even further he hesitated and then said certainly wilson walked in silence along the echoing corridor conscious of the occasional look of curiosity from people they passed it had clearly been a minor palace in the past and wilson admired the gracious marble and panelling walsinghams office was on the second floor at the rear of the building overlooking the via cernaia wilson noted the soldierly tidiness about everything i was in the middle of preparing the report when i heard you were coming said walsingham about what the robbery of course thats why youre here isnt it the man was very much on edge wilson didnt think walsingham would have made a good interrogator which was probably why hed been passed over twice for promotion no he said i thought mr jackson was supervising the summit arrangements he is walsingham smiled feebly im afraid i dont understand did you know your wife was a member of the communist party in australia said wilson sharply walsingham made an indeterminate sound somewhere between a laugh and a grunt of disbelief of course i knew its not on the antecedent records or in the personnel file it was when she was at school for gods sake imagined herself in love with some student and joined because he did to be in the same place the membership ended when the romance did she thought they were a lot of bloody fools rushing about with banners protesting about the vietnam war it wasnt recorded because neither of us thought anything about it i belonged to the scouts but i didnt record that you were an officer cadet too you put that down because it was relevant to my going into the army and not directly joining the diplomatic service who decided to leave it out you or she i cant remember try walsinghams hand was at his face as if the skin irritated i really cant remember it was not a conscious decision something we discussed but it was said wilson she told you about it in the first place not about belonging to some daft organization it was one of those honesty things admitting all the previous romances so we would start married life without any secrets it was the student she told me about the party membership was incidental didnt you do that sort of thing with your wife no said wilson coldly surely you havent come all the way from london to ask me about something as unimportant as that said walsingham the nervousness had melted into outrage perhaps it isnt unimportant ask my wife why dont we walsinghams fifthfloor apartment was situated near the river in an old building without a lift the staircase spiralled around the walls creating an open central tunnel down which it was possible to look from the top to the bottom they climbed in hostile silence walsingham had asked to telephone but wilson forbade it not wanting to permit the woman any preparation here we are there was the sound of a radio playing inside the apartment taking immediate control wilson pushed walsingham aside and knocked jill walsingham was a plump sagging woman flesh bulged beneath her jeans and she wasnt wearing a bra the tshirt strained with the effort she had a roller crimped on either side of her head so that she appeared to be wearing some odd sort of hat and her face was clear of makeup there was a brief frown of surprise then she smiled and said what are you doing here im not sure said walsingham she stood back to let them enter it was a large apartment with a view of the tiber from an outside balcony the drapes were velvet and reached the floor which was thickly carpeted the furniture was heavy but the room was big enough to allow it wilson noted that the couch and chairs were antique the oil paintings either side of the fireplace were school of tintoretto and the mantlepiece clock was eighteenth century french guessed wilson he thought the apartment was remarkably tasteful for a woman who looked like jill walsingham did at eleven thirty in the morning and then guessed it was furnished she crossed to a sideboard and turned off the radio it was intrusive in the surroundings an elaborate machine of dials and level meters and extension speakers they stood uncertainly in the centre of the room wilson said id like to see you alone please mrs walsingham the woman looked to her husband whats this about hes the director alone please repeated wilson why she said defiantly the australian accent was pronounced i have some questions id like to ask you what about wilson looked pointedly at walsingham waiting for him to leave the room could we refuse she said of course what would happen if we did id suspend your husband from the embassy immediately and have you both taken back to london to answer the questions there what questions walsingham broke the impasse im going to get myself a drink in the kitchen he said his wifes attitude softened almost immediately the door closed after him whats he done she said has he done anything for christs sake she protested when are you going to talk in a straight line from may until august of the same year you were a member of the australian communist party said wilson she looked at him blankfaced you were a member of the communist party so what so your husband is a member of an intelligence department and theres no reference to your involvement on any records because it wasnt a bloody involvement her voice was a mixture of exasperation and incredulity what was it then i was living with this fellow who thought the world was going the wrong way and wanted to get it right he even had a beard like jesus i was writing out posters saying nixon and kissinger were warmongers and he was screwing the girl who printed the newsletter in the cupboard where they kept the paper so you stopped of course i stopped she said like i stopped believing that you catch a dose by sitting on dirty toilet seats wilson recognized the attempt to embarrass him was her way of fighting back so there was no reason why it shouldnt have been listed on your husbands records no why wasnt it how the hell do i know one of you does she threw her arms out and her breasts wobbled jellylike ask him i did he said he couldnt remember whether it was you or he who decided not to mention it we didnt talk about it i got the impression you did i dont remember it but you gave a reason for its not being mentioned said wilson youre twisting what i said no im not jill walsingham walked over to one of the antique chairs bordering the fireplace her attitude altered when she spoke again the anger evaporating look she said inviting belief i suppose it must look bad but it isnt i dont know why henry didnt put it down but theres nothing sinister in it honestly who was the man what man the one you joined the communist party to be with ericson she said after a long pause stefan ericson his family were swedish do you maintain contact with him of course not i told you it was a schoolgirl thing that ended years ago and the party let you go just like that wilson snapped his fingers i was only a probationary member anyway people other than stefan came around a few times but i told them to push off in the end they stopped bothering wilson started towards the door but she stopped him sir alistair yes im sorry for swearing and all that i didnt mean to be rude wilson paused at the kitchen door jerking it aside abruptly walsingham sat at a table by the sink too far away to have overheard the conversation there was a glass and a whisky bottle on the table beside him and the director thought it was early to be drinking you can come back now he said this is my home said walsingham indignantly and your job without waiting for a response wilson returned to the room in which he had left jill walsingham she had not moved from the chair when walsingham entered wilson said your wife doesnt remember any discussion about omitting to mention the communist affiliation she thinks it must have been your decision it would have been something against me during annual review wouldnt it yes id hated being in the army and id hated working for my father in the city but i loved security i didnt want to lose that as well so you lied i didnt lie i just didnt include it on the yearly paper a lie insisted wilson theres a specific question about association with anything you consider might be subversive i didnt think of it as a lie have you at any time subsequent to been involved with anything you know or suspect might have been subversive wilson was icily formal no what about you mrs walsingham she responded slowly as if she had been thinking of something else definitely not she said at last this isnt serious is it said walsingham i mean it wont affect the job or anything like that im not sure yet said the director for several moments after wilson left neither of them spoke then walsingham drove his fist into the palm of his other hand and said damn we knew it might happen not after so long hell get you if he can dont you think i hadnt realized that already theres no need to fight with me im sorry weve got to start being careful she said make sure nothing happens they can trick us with yes he said very careful she said inspector moros office was like the man overflowing into untidiness against the far wall there was an ancient couch leaking its horsehair stuffing through a collapsed sacking belly the seat was confettied with papers that had dropped from the filing cabinets alongside moros desk was in front of the only window in the room flystained and unwashed behind venetian blinds papers were scattered over the desk and spilled like a frozen waterfall from a tiered set of plastic trays there was a rustspotted filing cabinet beneath framed diplomas made out in moros name nearly all the drawers were half open on top was a potted geranium which had died in disgust charlie had accepted coffee which came in a polystyrene cup now he didnt know what to do with it its happening just as we feared it would said moro the french have asked permission to send a contingent of their presidential security corps in addition to normal bodyguards and the germans want to send an antiterrorist squad as well isnt that an overreaction said charlie hed suggested the meeting to convince the policeman of his intention to cooperate and reduce the possibility of moro making inquiries about him in england being in a police station was not doing anything at all for his peace of mind of course it is said moro but because of it there had to be a cabinet meeting this morning afterwards there was an assurance to all common market governments that they would be adequately protected but its still embarrassing charlie leaned forward and wedged his coffee cup onto moros cluttered desk the policeman appeared not to notice it was untouched we agreed to cooperate said charlie so what have you to tell me nothing said charlie certainly not that he intended to try it alone if there were a sellback approach rather than risk the interfering involvement of the police that could ruin any handover and trap him in italy until the summit arrival of the intelligence protection then why are you here i thought it was twoway cooperation moro absentmindedly moved some papers on his desk weve identified the blood group its ab negative its a common group you got any police training said moro suddenly charlies apprehension tightened several notches he shook his head sort of thing you pick up over the years common or not moro said itll be the link when we get him you talked of fibres caught on the spikes nylon said moro the sort of stuff used in mens jackets have you traced the firm only the manufacturers said moro they produce millions what about street informants there must be a lot of talk over this moro gazed steadily at charlie thats the surprising thing he said were getting nothing back at all the bastard still thinks im involved thought charlie what about the servants at the villa all emphatic denials and good alibis and the embassy staff who had knowledge of security and the safe the only account we cant confirm is that of the security officer walsingham he says his wife was at the cinema with a friend and he stayed all evening at his apartment but theres no corroboration everyones under surveillance that was giving art a bad name thought charlie its still only twentyfour hours he said unable to think of anything else and youre still our best hope said moro it had taken igor solomatin several weeks of patient searching to find an apartment suitable for their needs four separate houses had been modified and knocked together over the years creating a labyrinthine collection of rooms and flats on different levels and linked by sudden corridors its most obvious advantage were three separate entrances at the front and a spiders web of fireescape grilles at the back vasily leonov examined the empty stalesmelling rooms with detached professionalism how long will we be here he said im allowing twenty minutes but i hope it will be over in fifteen said the russian controller the first is unimportant we can take fantani whenever we want its the second that matters weve rehearsed the run over the distance and at the same time on five occasions and always arrived within three minutes of schedule we expect the englishman will do the same whats our escape margin five minutes thats not long but sufficient solomatin depressed the button of a stop watch and led the way back out onto the main corridor the stairway that provided the only access was almost directly opposite solomatin turned away to the left where a doorway led into a corridor it links with the next house said solomatin they halted on an adjoining landing down one flight and to the left is the rear fire escape solomatin set off again at a leisurely pace stopping the watch at the window leading out to the back of the building two minutes he said two more to get down well be in the street before they come in the front door what if something goes wrong said leonov a breakdown or a puncture the whole purpose of sending him up and down the autostrada is surveillance reminded solomatin well be with him all the time the alarm wont be raised until hes reached the city and we can judge his arrival here to the minute theres still the chance of a mistake leonov was unconvinced nothing will go wrong said solomatin in two days well be on our way back to moscow to a heros welcome they left the building separately through different exits and solomatin drove across the city to fantanis apartment in the piazza del popolo i can move my fingers said the italian as solomatin entered it hurts but i can do it i told you it was only bruising everything ready solomatin nodded its time to make the call charlie moved about the hotel room without direction experiencing a loneliness he hadnt felt for a long time he started opening and closing cupboards and doors at the back of a shirt drawer was a pair of clarissas tights for a moment he ran the material through his fingers and then he dumped them in the waste bin it was right that he should have told her to go he just hadnt expected it to be like this charlie sat on the edge of the bed automatically removing his shoes and massaging his feet he snatched out for the telephone when it rang smiling in anticipation of her voice then he recognized billington ive been given a meeting place said the ambassador and instructions i didnt get the impression that the ambassador was particularly pleased said nairehamilton he said today was impossible so ive arranged it for tomorrow does he know im with you yes said the permanent under secretary what about walsingham circumstantially it looks strong good enough to ship him home possibly but im going to leave him where he is if hes the one hell panic to his control what if he doesnt we keep on looking the surveillance was more inept than before they used an unmarked police car again but it was away from the designated parking area parked over yellow lines showing it could ignore official restrictions the same small man in the blue suit was in the passenger seat when charlie passed pricks he thought at the top of the spanish steps the via sistina balloons out and there is a taxi rank charlie asked for the piazza navona because it was the first place that occurred to him the police car pulled out to position itself with only one vehicle between them the congestion that charlie wanted began almost as soon as the taxi started down the via della mercede at the junction with del corso it became so heavy they had to stop completely charlie took a crumpled wad of lire from his pocket looked at the meter and counted out double to avoid any delaying argument the taxi turned left onto del corso traffic was freer but there was still a tailback the block was perfect just beyond tritone with no side roads to allow the following driver to turn charlie gestured the taxi to the side of the road and pressed the money into the drivers hand ill walk he said charlie was back level with the police car before they properly realized what had happened he walked smartly past and from a window reflection in the via del tritone charlie saw that the small man had got out and was actually running from the police car which was still pointing in the wrong direction with the driver gesturing and shouting in a vain attempt to clear a path for a uturn charlies feet hurt slowing him down he stared about him for the right taxi arrangement he let the first one go because there was another close behind which the policeman could have taken he was almost at the crispi turning before he saw what he wanted a vacant cab with only private vehicles behind charlie waited until it was practically level then flagged it down it was satisfying to watch the frustrated policeman run forward as if he half intended to stop the car then gaze wildly around for a taxi of his own charlie guessed moro would trace the cab through the registration so he went all the way to the railway terminus rather than switch to another vehicle he entered the station through one door came out through another and picked up a third taxi which dropped him at the borghese gardens traffic wasped around the piazza in front of him and charlie decided against attempting to dodge his way through it instead he followed an old ladys example and used the crossing he liked rome it might be frayed at the edges but it had style something that was missing from harrys bar charlie enjoyed beer in straight glasses in pubs without jukeboxes harrys bar didnt have the jukeboxes but it had pretensions that were deafening it boasted chrome and mahogany and barmen who spoke eight languages it was featured in all the guidebooks and a number of novels as the epitome of chic and was always crowded with people looking for the famous who never came because people stood around looking for them charlie made for the halfmoon bar and saw that the stool stipulated for his identification was occupied he ordered a whisky and took it to one of the minute tables against the wall it was thirty minutes beyond the meeting time before charlie was able to get the stool he wanted reaching it a halfbuttock ahead of a woman with a large hat and a poodle with a diamante collar she waited for charlie to be gallant and then turned away tutting noisily charlie ordered another scotch with a better view of the bar he tried to pick out his contact the woman with the poodle found a seat opposite him at the far curve of the bar she looked at charlie with positive hostility charlie smiled up yours he thought charlie had expected the approach to come from the direction of the door or the lounge beyond the most crowded part but it didnt he got an impression of someone behind him and turned to see the man at his left shoulder the gucci crest was on the shoes belt and watch strap the raw silk trousers were black and bum tight worn with a shirt in contrasting white it was silk and open at the neck with several buttons undone to show a hairy chest cushioning a heavy gold medallion a fawn jacket worn the way that had always intrigued charlie from those baffling fellini films was draped casually around his shoulders but here there was a practical purpose the jacket almost concealed a sling that supported a wellbandaged hand seeing charlies look the man said its inconvenient particularly if a policeman sees it the italian shook his head my fingerprints are on record not palm impressions he was wiry and hardbodied with eyes that darted constantly i burned the clothes too he said he nodded to the table lets sit away from the bar charlie followed carrying his drink if the mans fingerprints were on file it wouldnt be hard to get a positive identification from criminal records when he went through the photographic files with moro im glad you came by yourself said the man the english was accented but good the cologne was very strong you have the jewellery said charlie i might be able to arrange its return gangstermovie dialogue thought charlie good he said there would be some expense how much twentyfive per cent thats a lot half a million is better for you than a full payout said the man yes said charlie it is sterling of course i want complete recovery how long will it take to arrange the finance asked the italian a day tomorrow then should be possible id like it to be tomorrow charlie intended to have the money numbered before he paid it over that would make it useless and traceable moro could get his conviction and billington could recover his jewellery whether or not he made them available for any court exhibit would be a matter between him and the police willoughby wouldnt have any remaining liability better still he wouldnt suffer any loss because eventually the five hundred thousand would be returned everything would be tidied up nicely everything except clarissa where shall we meet said charlie further down this street at the corner of the via ludovisi theres a public telephone kiosk be there at noon youll be called and told what to do ill be there said charlie be by yourself youll be watched all the time if theres any sign of a policeman its off ill be alone said charlie until tomorrow then the italian shrugged the jacket closer around his shoulders to keep the sling under cover and made an elegant exit from the bar probably danced a hell of a tango thought charlie he didnt hurry to leave holding the glass before him in both hands and staring down into the amber liquid everything had gone according to plan but it just didnt feel right it was a nagging persistent uncertainty like a stone in his shoe unable to resolve it he beckoned the barman paid and left the bar outside the street was thick with people cars and noise charlie threaded his way down the via veneto marking the telephone that had been identified moro would have reacted to his evasion by now and would be concentrating upon the hotel as the only known contact point so he couldnt go back immediately charlie chose a post office with an overseas telephone section there was no line congestion so charlie was connected at once willoughbys anxiety was obvious thank god he said keep praying until ive bought it back said charlie how much five hundred thousand in sterling willoughbys sigh of relief was audible is that going to be possible charlie decided against telling the underwriter how he intended to recover the buyback money just about said willoughby im indebted to you charlie where do you want it sent the main bank of rome it should be there first thing tomorrow which would give him sufficient time to record the numbers charlie blurted the underwriter what im sorry what for just sorry said willoughby breaking the connection charlie queued patiently to pay for the call if there were an apology it should have been his to the underwriter he thought as he walked back to the grand ville up the gently sloping streets charlie determined to keep walsingham out of it at this stage wanting to restrict his contact with the embassy to the minimum about fifty yards from the hotel charlie saw the car with the boot antennae move and knew theyd seen him it accelerated too fast and stopped too quickly so there was a screech of brakes and people turned the man in the blue suit had the door open before the car stopped get in he said his shoes were still stained with horse piss inspector moro was quite calm which increased the sense of menace he lounged back from the crowded desk eyes fixed on the ceiling and talking in a consciously controlled voice his jacket was rucked up from his shoulders heightening the skinshedding appearance i warned you he said i warned you and you ignored me i didnt you dodged from a taxi in the via del corso to another that took you to the railway terminal said moro there you immediately got into a third car which took you to the top of the via veneto we traced you that far id have been disappointed if you hadnt the reply seemed to confuse the inspector i told you there were to be no arrangements without my being involved you ignored me who did you meet no one dont treat me like a fool moros voice rose for the first time dont treat me like a criminal what i agreed to do nothing without telling you first said charlie it was an undertaking i intended to keep having given my word i dont expect to be pursued everywhere i go are you saying you evaded my people as some sort of stupid protest yes said charlie and to prove their ineffectiveness it didnt sound as good as hed hoped it would in fact it sounded bloody awful i decide how to run an investigation whether or not to impose surveillance said moro if you werent going to trust me there was little purpose in our agreeing to an arrangement in the first place the policeman had not expected attack and was finding it difficult to adjust i meant it he said about what i would do if you tried anything independently i never doubted you for a second now was the moment to change his mind to admit everything and go with moro through the records until they got a name if he did that the entrapment would never work not the sort the police would attempt charlie said nothing did you have a meeting with anyone today repeated the policeman no now he was committed if i find that to be a lie then youre guilty of impeding a police investigation i know that i want to know anything the moment it happens said moro you said that before reminded charlie this time believe me sir alistair wilson replaced the telephone after harknesss london call and turned back into the communal suite towards nairehamilton and jackson thats interesting he said what is demanded the permanent under secretary richard semingford has written to foreign office personnel asking about pension entitlement and the size of the sum thats commutable in the event of his leaving italian banks open at eight thirty in the morning charlie was ready early wanting as much time as possible to list the currency numbers today there was no vehicle with the familiar aerial as he walked by the medici hotel a man who had been studying the tariff pushed slightly too quickly through the swing doors and charlie smiled at the hurried avoidance he was curious to see how theyd follow his taxi the mobile cover was better theyd positioned cars at intervals along the street so that the contact would be taken up not with a vehicle pulling out in obvious pursuit but emerging first in front and then letting the taxi overtake it was the black lancia decided charlie the driver wore a cap as if he were the chauffeur and the observer rode in the back reading a newspaper but holding it in such a way that his view of the taxi wasnt obscured charlie knew there wouldnt be any second chance if anything went wrong at the bank of rome an assistant manager took him to a deputy manager and the deputy manager took him to the manager charlie produced his accreditation from rupert willoughby and the manager confirmed that the money draft had been received the previous night charlie stipulated cash rather than a letter of credit and asked for the numbers to be run through a computer for record the manager allowed a brief expression of irritation and summoned back the deputy manager together they went to the basement and the notes were distributed between two programmers it took two hours to complete the list charlie ascended to the managers office calculating that by now moro would have the exterior of the building under siege thank you for your assistance said charlie believing charlie wanted the numbers recorded against loss the manager said a letter of credit would have been simpler im afraid my client insists upon cash of course said the manager eager to terminate the meeting but i accept the danger said charlie i wonder if i can impose upon you a little more the manager frowned this is a large sum of money said charlie hefting the case as if the man needed proof despite the precaution with the listing im still nervous of carrying it unguarded you want a security guard a security van said charlie its a comparatively short distance little more than three or four kilometres i suppose that can be arranged said the manager reluctantly it was the turn of the deputy manager to escort charlie through the rear of the building into a completely enclosed yard there was a burst of hurried italian and charlie saw one of the drivers grimace at the interruption to his routine the armoured grilled vehicle had no windows at the rear doors and only a small barred aperture with a microphone to communicate with the driver charlie climbed in and smiled his thanks it took less than five minutes to reach the via ludovisi and charlie was beside the box ten minutes early from the same pavement table at doneys where he had identified the italian to leonov three evenings before igor solomatin sipped an espresso and watched with a minute to go before the arranged time he raised the copy of il messagero giving the signal to fantani inside to ensure the line had not become blocked charlie had entered the kiosk at five to twelve going through an elaborate performance of consulting diallingcode instructions the telephone rang promptly at noon very good said the voice he recognized from the previous day youre alone i said i would be reminded charlie do you have what i want do you cant you see the case i dont know whats inside its all there said charlie youll need a car to your right is an avis sign once youve hired the car go north out of the city the autostrada to milan is numbered al almost as soon as you join theres an agip gas station ignore it drive on for about fifty kilometres there is a slip road to your right just after the indicator sign is another agip station stop there then what go into the station shop be by the telephone there at four another entrapment precaution arent we letting this drag on said charlie the response was immediate we dont want anything to go wrong do we a man trained in diplomacy can convey offence as well as avoid it billington conveyed it extremely well he came stiffly forward to meet them the handshakes a passing formality he ignored the desk area leading the director and nairehamilton to part of the embassy office furnished with leather clublike chairs before they sat he said i consider you have been extremely discourteous wilson and nairehamilton remained standing that wasnt our intention said wilson the ambassadors face was flushed there is protocol he said if you wished to question one of my staff then i should have been informed in advance an unfortunate oversight said nairehamilton belatedly billington indicated chairs and they sat is there anything wrong with walsingham he said his wife had some communist contact when she was a student in australia said wilson in the thirties flirting with communism was a popular pastime billingtons sarcasm was pointed this was in said wilson and he didnt declare it on his personnel records i should have hardly thought this justified your coming all the way from london said billington theres also the summit said nairehamilton a secretary arrived with coffee she put it on a table between them and poured no one spoke until she left the room i understood youd already sent people to look after that said the ambassador theyve been here for days that was before the robbery said wilson whats the robbery got to do with it i thought you might be able to tell me billington edged forward on his seat youre being obtuse was anything more than jewellery taken i beg your pardon billingtons face was getting redder work sometimes gets taken home records show that various members of the embassy travel quite regularly to ostia its slightly unusual for an ambassador to spend so much time away from the official residence nothing leaves the security vault which isnt cleared to do so said billington i resent the implication of it even being considered there was not nor has there ever been any authorized documentation kept in my personal safe it would have been a direct contravention of all security regulations as you are perfectly well aware im glad of the reassurance said wilson you appreciate surely that the inquiry had to be made no i do not said billington and i intend to protest most strongly to the foreign office about both the manner and implication of this visit as they walked back along the wide corridor towards the main exit nairehamilton said what on earth was the point in behaving like that theres no security classification on a complaint said the director within half an hour of it being sent there wont be anyone in the embassy unaware of our presence if it isnt walsingham weve got to cause someone else to panic fantani had emerged from doneys by the time charlie completed the hiring formalities and took a seat beside the russian fantani strained to identify the car but the rental office was too far away and he gave up my people know what theyre doing said solomatin hell be covered all the way and back it all seems very complicated fantani gently attempted finger exercises with his damaged hand weve got to be absolutely sure theres no police involvement said solomatin i make the next call from the via salaria said fantani solomatin counted out some coins to pay for his coffee feeling a reluctance to take the man there it was the first time he had been so closely involved with violence and he was nervous wed better go he said he was having to wave his arms and legs when the strings were pulled and charlie muffin had never liked the puppets role he preferred to be the one in control the manipulator he took the car angrily from the link road onto the autostrada careless of the blare of protest from a fiat on the inside lane charlie knew he was going to get a lot of pleasure screwing that shiftyeyed little sod for several kilometres he concentrated upon the cars travelling around him at the same speed then without warning pulled over onto the hard shoulder there was another screech of horns from behind but charlie ignored it he got out of the hire car and kicked the front offside tyre as if to check a possible puncture appearing satisfied he got back in waited for a gap in the traffic and rejoined the motorway charlie was confident he would have been too quick for any following vehicle to avoid passing him so he drove looking for any familiar car that might be waiting ahead for him to catch up he clocked ten kilometres and detected nothing bugger them he thought charlie saw the service station ahead indicated and turned smoothly into the forecourt he was thirty minutes early so he topped up the petrol and moved the car away from the pumps into the parking area it was a busy station cars and lorries and people swirling around well chosen thought charlie greater professionalism than he would have expected in fact he found the telephone in the vending area and went to it the card walsingham had given him ready in his hand the security man came curtly on the line the eagerness obvious in his voice something up there might be said charlie i just wanted to know where i could contact you later im leaving the embassy now where to home youve got the number were going to be there all night stay there said charlie where are you miles up some bloody autostrada said charlie theyre making sure i havent got the police with me shall i tell the ambassador not yet said charlie if theres no contact here itll be a waste of time there was always the possibility that moro would contact the embassy once he knew hed been tricked at the bank what do you want me to do just wait sure i cant help any more than that not yet its not much it will be when the time comes charlie replaced the receiver and lingered in the sales area always keeping the clock in sight christ time was going slowly he checked his watch to ensure the station clock hadnt stopped and then pushed his hands into his pockets annoyed at his nervousness right to be tense before a thing like this but not nervous nervous people made mistakes the stoneintheshoe feeling came again he couldnt have missed anything there was nothing to miss it was a straightforward robbery with a straightforward settlement he went to the kiosk early once more to keep the line clear lifting the telephone at the first ring youre doing very well said the voice wait you bastard just wait thought charlie are we going to do it here he said no where back in rome fuck me there was a moments silence then the instructions continued uninterrupted come back into rome find your way to the via salaria from to theres an apartment complex you need use the centre doorway its facing you on the third floor at the top of the stairs it was a bloody awful setup but he didnt have a choice charlie realized ive got it he said what time itll take you an hour to get back to rome well allow fifteen minutes for unforeseen delay be there at eight fifteen all right arrive alone said the voice if you dont therell be no one in the apartment when you get there i understand said charlie when moro staged the identity parade hed pretend to walk by at first so the smart little bugger would think hed got away with it dont be late the line went dead charlie dialled again at the first attempt charlie got a woman who identified herself as walsinghams wife and said he had not yet returned from the embassy charlie wandered impatiently around the service area letting five minutes pass on the slowmoving clock the security man answered the second time ive got a meeting place announced charlie genuine how do i know do you want me to come charlie calculated thirty minutes for the transfer make it eight fortyfive he said where via salaria centre door ill be waiting what about the ambassador charlie hesitated get the jewellery back to billington first and then advise moro tell him he said what about the police ill do that when its over it could all still be a hoax you dont really believe that do you id be wasting everybodys bloody time if i did good luck yeah said charlie in his apartment overlooking the tiber walsingham put down the telephone and his wife said did you get it of course i got it said walsingham you going to tell the ambassador yes watch your back she said just dont forget to watch your back theyre bastards all of them rotten capitalist bastards the inquiries had been made overnight and because of the time difference with australia the reply from canberra arrived almost at the same time as confirmation of walsinghams salary from london the information had no outside relevance and harkness telephoned direct to the eden relaying the details to jackson after stoppages walsinghams salary is seven hundred and eighty pounds a month said jackson to nairehamilton and the director the apartment rental is five hundred and sixtyfive reminded wilson which only leaves two hundred and fifty jackson checked the london information theres a housing allowance of a hundred pounds he added still an expensive choice said nairehamilton what about australia stefan ericson is still a political activist read out jackson he remembers jill walsingham or rather littleton as she was then what about her he says she was quite politically aware why did she quit after only three months nothing to do with her politics according to ericson it was over some row they had because he became involved with another woman jill didnt want to continue their relationship the telephone sounded again and jackson answered it the ambassador he said to wilson the director took the phone is walsingham suspect asked billington at once why i think ive been rather indiscreet there was an obvious reluctance in billingtons admission what do you mean ive allowed myself to be persuaded that the jewellery stolen from ostia could be recovered by some sort of ransom i appointed walsingham to act as a liaison between me and the insurance assessor so walsingham has just telephoned hes off to see the man muffin this evening for several moments wilson remained silent the telephone held slightly away from his head what he demanded the others in the room were aware of the sudden rigidity of his body i said walsingham was going to no shouted the director the name what was the name you used muffin said the ambassador charles muffin he is an insurance assessor from london i thought there were going to be others here for protection said fantani the nervousness had grown since the conversation with charlie muffin on the autostrada he was moving restlessly around the room eyes darting about him for the handover said solomatin any minute now itll be all right wont it said fantani i mean i gave the instructions properly fine assured solomatin you were just fine when he heard a soft knock at the door the italian smiled and said your people yes said solomatin he opened it and vasily leonov came quickly in off the corridor sorry i cant shake hands said fantani indicating his tightly strapped arm leonov who couldnt speak italian and didnt understand the remark raised his hand anyway and fantani had the briefest glimpse of the tokarev before it fired he was killed instantly his body lifted back over the chair arm and then folding sideways so that he ended in an oddly crouched position as if he were praying behind solomatin retched leonov turned to him curiously and said whats the matter on the other side of town henry walsingham replaced the receiver after the telephone call and said theyve changed the time its eight oclock the photograph that sir alistair wilson had ordered from london had arrived by the time he and nairehamilton got to the embassy they went directly to the communications room unpeeling it from the transmission drum and carried it limply into the ambassadors office billingtons antipathy still showed the intelligence chief decided to ignore it he thrust the picture towards the ambassador and said is this the man yes he said why wilsons whole body appeared to deflate hes a traitor he said simply seven years ago he wrecked an intelligence department billington laughed uncertainly you cant be serious i wish i werent good god i want to know everything said wilson theres little to tell i warned my underwriter i wanted the jewellery revalued according to the policy terms and they sent this man he spent two days at the villa checking the security and itemizing the pieces then he came on the day of the robbery and told me the thieves would most likely offer it back at a price and asked me to cooperate what happened tonight demanded the intelligence director i had a call from walsingham about an hour ago he said muffin had contacted him and that an exchange had been agreed he was meeting him and hoped to recover the jewellery from the surveillance already imposed wilson knew the security man was still in his apartment and there were five men outside waiting to follow wherever he went did he say where the meeting was taking place some apartment complex on the via salaria i think yes what time eight fortyfive wilson and nairehamilton looked at their watches simultaneously still more than an hour said the permanent under secretary were going to get him said wilson in a sudden flare of confidence what about the police suggested the ambassador no it was nairehamilton who spoke his voice loud seeming surprised at his own outburst he said more quietly not yet were risking an incident said billington were attempting to avoid one said nairehamilton i have ultimate responsibility here said the ambassador its a debatable point said nairehamilton if you want a ruling i suggest you contact the prime ministers office would someone tell me whats going on demanded billington henry walsingham let his car coast slowly along the via salaria as he strained through the darkness to make out the numbering the rushhour traffic was still heavy and there were hoots of irritation from behind him the security man parked and checked the time relieved that he was five minutes early he felt like he had during the army exercises particularly on the plains of germany with men behind him and hoping to christ he didnt make a ridiculous mistake he got out unaware of the two following cars that had stopped a hundred yards away for a moment walsingham stared up at the jagged rooftops outlined against the night sky and then pushed through the centre door as instructed he found the pushlight which dimly illuminated the stairs curling away from him there was no lift walsingham climbed steadily pausing on the first and second landings for the light switch number faced him as he came puffing to the third floor he listened at the door for voices and heard nothing his first knock was hesitant there was no reply he rapped again more forcefully solomatin opened the door and said in italian im glad youre not late come in as walsingham stepped forward leonov crossed the landing from the linking corridor entrance opposite there was a shot no louder than the heavy closing of a door the impact forced walsingham across the room arms outstretched his body slid when it hit the floor so that one hand was almost touching fantanis go on said leonov urgently solomatin knelt down and edged a key into walsinghams pocket pulling hurriedly back as soon as he had done it leonov tossed the gun down beside the body and followed solomatin out they were through into the adjoining building and making for the rear fire escape when wilsons car stopped behind the observer team already in position sir alistair wilson deferred to jacksons experience as a field operator during the short drive from the embassy he briefed the supervisor and then held back while jackson organized the surveillance teams the directors car which was being used for control was moved from the via salaria to a culdesac opposite jackson reversed the vehicle into it and extinguished the lights how long he asked the director twenty minutes according to walsingham jackson quickly left the car crossing to the apartment block and paced out a distance checking to see if their vehicles were conspicuous he dodged back between the traffic and sat heavily into the driving seat good enough he said everybody understands perfectly theyre to let him go in and then seal the place the director stared across at the building looks like a warren well chosen wilson grunted what happens if he doesnt show up on time we give it fifteen minutes he said and then go in what do you think hes doing here whatever it is hes the key hes got to be along the main highway in front of them traffic fireflied by in a continuous flicker of lights in the culdesac vehicles were parked in careless rome fashion half on and half off the pavement there were bicycles secured to railings by chains how much damage did he really do a lot said wilson the cia director as well as our own controller was seized for exchange with a spy of their own its taken years to build up confidence with washington again kalenin was supposed to be crossing into vienna the americans had put in almost a hundred people on the ground and we matched them man for man it was obviously impractical to take them all back into czechoslovakia the russians fingerprinted and photographed the bloody lot of them bastard wilson looked apprehensively to the man beside him i dont want him hurt he said not until i can gauge the extent of the damage well wait said jackson wilson tensed as the car stopped opposite but relaxed as a young couple got out laughing and hugging he massaged the joint of his stiffened leg it wasnt cold so there was no reason for it to ache conscious of the movement jackson said from beside him waiting always screws me up weve been waiting a long time for this one said wilson charlie had become engulfed in the rush hour on the outskirts of the city stopstarting his way through the congestion impatiently he had tried short cuts guessing the general direction and become blocked by even worse jams hed fought against the irritation knowing it was pointless and submitted at last to the slow crawl it was seven thirty before he approached the centre of rome and three stops before he found someone with sufficient english to explain the route but once in the via salaria charlie had little problem finding the number it was bad unprotected and carrying half a million pounds he was having to walk into a bloody great building in which a hundred villains could be hiding just waiting for his head to emerge around a stairwell in the old days hed have had twenty men already moving through the building disguised as cleaners janitors and repair men and another squad outside for additional protection charlie scratched his nose hed buggered it up and the old days were gone for ever he considered taking a tyre lever from the boot but quickly dismissed it if there were to be an ambush a tyre lever would be about as effective as spitting at a house fire charlie checked the mirror until the traffic eased and then got out of the car pulling the case behind him instinctively he looked both ways along the road squinting to see into the parked vehicles it looked safe enough but in a place like this it was impossible to be sure without backup the middle door he remembered he pushed gently against it feeling it give at once beneath the pressure and eased through into the darkness he barked his knuckles against the time switch but was grateful for the light somewhere in the distance he heard a babys cry long and protracted charlie realized he was sweating the handle of the case slippery beneath his fingers the light clicked off before he reached the first landing so that he had to make the last few steps in darkness the babys cry was louder and he wondered why somebody didnt do anything about it the italians were supposed to love kids he found the switch again and continued cautiously upwards somewhere above a door opened and closed and he waited for footsteps but none came the second landing was as empty as the first charlie lighted the way but didnt begin the final climb he put the case between his feet and wiped his hands along the sides of his trousers the baby had stopped crying he hadnt been aware of its happening there wasnt a sound now in the whole building only charlies laboured breathing he saw the apartment the moment he pressed the thirdfloor switch the door was ajar he went past and found the link corridor into the next building it was deserted he came back to the door listening against it and then pushed it wider not attempting to enter he saw walsinghams body first on his face and spreadeagled and then the hand of someone else every nerve every instinct every memory of his basic training screamed at charlie not to go in he did the italian was staring glazedeyed at the ceiling there was a lot of blood on his chest where the artery had burst and it was difficult to see the exact wound charlie noticed a gucci bag near a side table and was stretching towards it when he saw the gun partially concealed beneath walsinghams body he recognized it at once as a russian weapon there was a second of numbed shock then a voice behind him shouted stay where you are there were three men just inside the door fanned out so they had him in a twentyfivedegree arc of crossfire they were hunched in standard marksman position legs bent pistol arm fully extended the other hand clamped to the wrist to minimize the recoil behind the gunmen was an elderly wisphaired man he said any move no matter how slight and theyll fire not to kill you itll be into your legs to cripple you he waited appearing to expect a response then he said weve got you charlie muffin the ambassador and nairehamilton listened gravefaced for the intelligence director to finish the explanation and then nairehamilton said its a nasty one very nasty indeed what are we going to do demanded billington recover as best we can suggested the permanent under secretary to the ambassador he said i think youd better contact the italian government right away the preparations had begun before their arrival but men were still working when charlie was led down the stairs into the main storeroom of the embassy basement an area about twenty feet square had been cleared the boxes and containers pushed against the far wall and stacked into a floortoceiling barrier charlie expected the questioning to start at once but he was pushed into an annex below ground and without any windows against the far wall there was a cot with one blanket and beside it a bucket to pee in henry jackson followed charlie into the cell and snapped his fingers lets have them he said charlie thought fleetingly of feigning ignorance but then dismissed it as pointless everything would be pointless from now on he bent extracting the laces from his shoes and handed them to the man together with his tie and belt jackson pointed towards the bed and said everything in your pockets on there methodically charlie began unloading there was a comb in his top pocket passport and travellers cheques inside his jacket his airline ticket with the baggage label still attached a crumpled sponge of italian paper money a pen the keys to the battersea apartment a driving licence and one neatly folded square of toilet paper linings dutifully charlie turned all the pockets inside out he stood in front of the man clutching his trousers and aware of the barely subdued hostility watch charlie unstrapped it from his wrist know what id like to do said jackson what id like to kick the shit out of you charlie had been waiting for the beating he tightened his body against the attack and the man sniggered the names jackson he said remember it im going to be the first he scooped charlies belongings into a plastic envelope and closed the door there was only the sound of a single lock and charlie didnt think the woodwork looked particularly resistant he dismissed the speculation as academic he was not going anywhere any more the seizure at the apartment house and the bundled drive with his hands manacled painfully behind him had been too hurried for him to examine his situation with any detachment but alone in his rectangular box smelling of decayed abandoned paper charlie confronted the realization that after seven years of middleofthenight wakefulness and gutheaving at casual glances theyd got him an overwhelming feeling of helplessness settled over him the muscles in his thighs began jerking in involuntary spasms and he sat down quickly upon the cot wrapping his arms around his legs the man what was his name jackson jackson had said thered be a beating why not at once maybe the standard technique complete solitude to let the fear seep in and make sure there was no sleep to complete the disorientation scalpalomine maybe but why that was standard procedure to break someone to erode a false cover or deceit they knew who he was and what hed done he didnt have a cover story to destroy he had no one to protect charlie rolled sideways onto the bed keeping his knees in a foetal ball under his chin he didnt want anything to happen to willoughby clarissa either particularly clarissa he tried to put her from his mind and concentrate on his surroundings was this what he could expect from now on an eight foot by twelve existence with a cot and a bucket and water dripping down the walls from outside tame the sound of heavy things being shifted and scraped across the floor twice there were footsteps seemingly right outside and charlie raised his head apprehensively both times they receded he looked at his wrist before remembering the watch had gone a time check was one of the first things to establish according to the resistance technique something else hed forgotten an hour charlie estimated maybe longer he closed his eyes against the light trust me edith well beat the bastards he hadnt not in the end charlie reckoned it was another hour before they came for him he managed to swing his legs to the floor before they reached him there was another man with jackson charlie blinked at them grittyeyed even though he hadnt slept up said jackson charlie rose grasping at his waistband the hush puppies threatened to fall off and he had to scuff his feet across the floor the only obvious change in the room beyond was a baizetopped table positioned near the centre there was a smaller table alongside and as he got closer charlie noticed the tape recorder from a more darkened part of the basement a man came into the light and sat behind the machine he didnt bother to look up sit down said wilson he was seated in the centre of the table clearly the questioner nairehamilton was to his left charlie sat the operator started the tape your name is charles muffin said wilson yes said charlie it had been a long time since hed heard his christian name properly you were for eighteen years a grade operative within the security service of great britain yes had it really been as long as that and as such signed an undertaking governed by the official secrets act yes charlie coughed not wanting his voice to betray any nervousness when he was called upon to respond in any greater detail did you at some date in communicate with the soviet union it seemed so damning put as bluntly as that yes said charlie how demanded wilson through vienna i made contact with the soviet embassy his voice remained controlled with whom a kgb colonel what was his name valery kalenin did you know of this man i knew he was operational head of the komitet gosudarstvennoy bezpasnosti what was the purpose of the meeting revenge to teach arrogant bastards they couldnt throw him to the dogs like so much disposable meat but whichever way he attempted to put it the explanation would make him what theyd already decided a traitor nine months earlier i had controlled the arrest of a man running a soviet spy cell in britain his name was alexei berenkov during the final stages of that operation we needed documents from east berlin proving the mans identity to be russian to create a diversion and minimize the risk of the documents being intercepted the department arranged for my capture the car they had marked as the one i should have been driving was destroyed had i been in it i would have died charlie licked his lips not bad so far he thought i suspected a setup an east german who believed i was arranging his crossing into west berlin drove the car i returned by ubahn the purpose of the vienna meeting was retribution against people who had decided i was expendable a bad finish conceded charlie retribution said wilson the soviet union never allows captured spies to endure long imprisonment they wanted an exchange and i provided people for it who the british and american directors kalenin let it be understood he wanted to cross to the west both directors went to austria to receive him they were taken by soviet commandos to be held until there was a swap you knowingly betrayed to a hostile power the identity and whereabouts of the two most senior officials said wilson an exchange was guaranteed that was the only reason for their seizure i knew they wouldnt be held for more than two or three weeks in a barren room surrounded by impassive men it sounded a weak plea of mitigation at the end of after the seizure of your superior officers you defected to the soviet union said wilson charlie stared blankly across the small table at the director we got your london address from your driving documents said wilson ive had the place entered we found everything i dont know what youre talking about said charlie it sounded fatuous he realized we know you have killed three british agents during the last ten months and about your connection with walsingham no charlie stiffened and instantly felt hands on both his shoulders forcing him back into his chair i admit what i did in vienna he said i dont understand anything else youre saying the asthma banded around his chest squeezing the breath from his lungs it was midnight when the director and the permanent under secretary got to billingtons office the italians are furious said the ambassador ive been officially summoned to the foreign ministry tomorrow they want a full explanation wed rather it wasnt given said nairehamilton thats preposterous said billington youve trampled all over the scene of a killing removed bodies and evidence and disregarded absolutely that any italian sovereignty exists it was necessary insisted nairehamilton theyll never accept that ask them to expand the meeting tomorrow suggested wilson include their security people and promise our attendance you the ambassador appeared surprised it would be easier than briefing you said wilson we dont think the italians will want a scandal so near the summit any more than we do you cant conceal crime protested billington when its necessary you can said nairehamilton easily trying to force a little calm billington looked towards a drinks tray and said would you like anything both wilson and nairehamilton chose whisky the ambassador took nothing he handed them the drinks and said on a personal level i consider i should have been told what was going on until we had proof everyone was suspect momentarily billingtons face clouded how long had walsingham been a spy according to what weve already discovered in london from the flat of the man muffin a long time we might learn more when the banks open here tomorrow walsingham had what appears to be a safe deposit key on him his wife insists she knows nothing about it what about her shes still to be questioned said wilson its likely she was the link from her past association i would have staked my reputation that walsingham was sound said billington not brilliant but sound thats the sort of impression spies are trained to convey and the other fellow said billington what sort of man commits five murders a desperate one wilson replied not any more said nairehamilton hes finished the permanent under secretary looked directly at wilson and i mean that he said the empty place at the politiburo table stood out like a childs gaptoothed smile general kalenin studiously ignored it concentrating fixedly upon the first secretary an overwhelming success comrade general it was fitting to be modest it will be several days said kalenin before we can be completely sure zemskov frowned at the reservation how long he said wanting specifics two or three days well look forward to the meeting and so would he thought kalenin hed wear his medals for the ceremony the butler in dressing gown and pyjamas tried to prevent their entry but the security men were accustomed to delaying tactics bustling him aside the moment the door was opened into the eaton square apartment two took the stairs while another two waited for the lift the fifth man insisted the butler take him through the servants quarters and up the back stairs rupert willoughby awoke startled to find his bedroom full of men what the rupert willoughby yes weve a warrant for your arrest under the treason act said one of them treason wed like you to get dressed and come with us i want to ring my solicitors a security man moved the telephone away from the underwriter the one holding the warrant said later just come with us now they hadnt allowed him any water to wash or shave charlie had peed in the bucket and knew that the smell of the room clung to him jackson beckoned him from the doorway charlie got up slowly from the bed stretching the cramp from his back hed spent the night hunched against the wall knees beneath his chin and felt lightheaded from sleeplessness charlie clutched at his unsupported clothing and shuffled out into the interrogation room the arrangements were the same as before except that there was a second man in hornrimmed glasses at the recording table he was seated behind a box file but there was no chair for charlie this time bastards he thought he stood with his legs apart trying to keep his trousers up that way they bagged at the waist well discuss your defection said wilson as if there had only been a few minutes interruption there was no defection said charlie at the end of you went to the soviet union i did not wilson put out his hand and from the box file the bespectacled man produced a small wallet wilson leaned forward across the table and said is that your photograph yes said charlie curiously wilson turned towards the recording equipment exhibit that charles muffin has identified containing his photograph is an identity document according him the rank of major in the kgb and establishing entry into the soviet union in november this is nonsense we found everything in your flat said the director and walsinghams ondemand safe deposit box here in rome if he hadnt panicked youd have got away with it he would have been dead but youd still have been free wilson was handed something else from the document box and held it up for charlie is that your photograph attached to this card of course it is careful he thought hed let the irritation show again wilson turned to the side table let the record show that muffin has just acknowledged his photograph on the official authorization to concessions in certain restricted moscow stores it will be exhibit why are you doing this demanded charlie you know its not true wilson ignored the protest do you know what these are he held up some sort of decoration in his hand with it was a long officiallooking form charlie saw the writing was cyrillic ive never seen either before in my life said charlie he tried to reject the panic sweeping through him once more wilson spoke to his right exhibit is the official decoration of the hero of the soviet union with a citation commending charles muffin for outstanding work on behalf of the security service of the soviet union its not true said charlie desperately its complete invention nairehamilton cupped his hand to wilson the director listened and then said to charlie theres no point in extending this is there why not admit it my name is charlie muffin he recited in a name rank and serial number monotone in i disclosed to the soviet union the whereabouts in vienna of the british and american intelligence directors for personal reasons that is all i have ever done at no time beyond that have i had any contact with russia he stared straight at nairehamilton i have killed no one whats that demanded wilson a canadian passport said charlie take it charlie held onto his trousers with his left hand and felt out with his right whats the entry stamp on page thirtysix charlie turned the pages awkwardly supporting the document against his chest delhi he said did you on april two days after the admission into india recorded on that date stamp kill a british intelligence agent named walter thomison no whats the entry on page twentyeight charlie fumbled through ankara did you on august one day after your arrival in turkey assassinate rupert bullock a british intelligence agent attached to the embassy there this is a farce page fortyfour stipulated wilson dully charlie turned the pages bangkok did you on october four days after your arrival shoot peter weighill who had been identified to you as an intelligence operative working out of the british embassy in thailand no said charlie his mind was misted by the accusations being made against him do you recognize these demanded the director offering a fan spread of paper charlie sighed no he said wilson went to the note table this will be itemized as exhibit the passport being exhibit he said it consists of congratulatory cables two signed personally by general kalenin commending charlie muffin on the success of his assassination of british agents attached to embassies in the three countries in which the canadian passport numbered shows he had access hed let them play themselves out there was nothing else he could do let the deposition show we are discussing what i shall identify as exhibit said wilson he offered it to charlie it was long running to two pages and on flimsy paper that charlie remembered from intelligence briefings do you know this no wilson sat back holding it loosely before him its your instruction sheet what instruction sheet telling you what to do here said wilson telling you that henry walsingham a spy like you had panicked after the caution from moscow that he was under suspicion and intended organizing a robbery on the ambassadors safe believing information incriminating him was being held there wilson broke off you were brilliant getting to that safe as you did to find it wasnt so didnt walsingham believe you when you told him there was nothing there walsingham wasnt a spy wilson waved the paper the instructions make it clear you were to kill him because hed become unstable you had to improvise when the robbery went ahead didnt you like everything else alleged today this is complete nonsense said charlie he spoke towards the recorder if they were going to get the bullshit on tape his denials were going to be there too you knew walsingham didnt you you were his control no weve proof said wilson we found the key to the safe deposit box its all there i met henry walsingham the day after the robbery at the ambassadors villa at ostia i had never met him before wilson reached for the document exhibit will be listed as the soviet message indicating initial control contact with charlie muffin he said it contains a notation in walsinghams handwriting confirming that the meeting took place on june last year in washington relief surged through charlie what was that date june no said charlie triumphantly and now its in the record theres nothing you can do about it as charlie through of willough by there was a kaleidoscope of imagery of his meeting in the underwriters office and then intrusively of a greysuited man reading a magazine in the waiting room the same greysuited man who fell into step behind clarissa as she walked past the trevi fountain bastard said charlie but why hadnt he been the bigger bastard for what hed done with clarissa willing though she might have been ironically it made things easier he looked at the director rupert willoughby can prove i wasnt in washington on june last year charlie hesitated arrested by another image the crying tearstained face of edith during one of their last rows and her accusation nothing matters to you but survival does it charlie nothing at all shed been right as always to wilson he said and it can be corroborated it was a vast highceilinged room already prepared for some of the conferences to be held during the forthcoming summit it was dominated by two tables arranged in a t ministers sat at the top cross section and their advisers were spread away from them wires ribboned the floor for the microphones set before each place and for the translations to be fed into the headsets clipped discreetly against each chair arm beyond the main seating arrangement was a small table for the conference secretariat and it was here that billington wilson and nairehamilton sat i would like to say at the outset on behalf of my government that we greatly appreciate your understanding in allowing this discussion nairehamilton fell easily into standard diplomatic verbosity the london instructions were that he should lead the meeting to spare billington full responsibility as the permanent british representative and on behalf of my government i want to make it clear that we consider what has taken place to be a flagrant breach of every diplomatic understanding said guiseppe belli the foreign ministry official was a saturnine sallowcomplexioned man whose lightweight pinstripe matched nairehamiltons in elegance he made a striking contrast with inspector moro who sat to his left the third italian roberto delcasta was the deputy director of italian intelligence a slight bespectacled man there was no intention for it to be said nairehamilton how else can it be construed demanded belli impatiently his english was clipped and precise as a sincere attempt on behalf of my country to avoid a scandal said nairehamilton how demanded delcasta the robbery had already created security doubts with other countries nairehamilton nodded for wilson to take over succinctly with no deviation from the rehearsed story the intelligence director talked of the suspicion of a traitor within the british embassy their efforts to locate him and the discovery of a man who had disgraced the service seven years earlier as he spoke he stared intently at the three italians facing him aware of the slight relaxation of their attitude it was fifteen minutes before he stopped and at once nairehamilton said throughout it has been the intention of the british government to limit the possibility of embarrassment for the common market summit in a fortnights time cooperation would have achieved the same result said belli nairehamilton could not be deflected so easily until eight oclock last night we saw it as an internal matter to be controlled within the privileged precincts of our own embassy we had less than two hours to act when it turned out otherwise that is still no explanation for removing the body of the dead british national said moro or seizing the man responsible that is positive interference in an investigation being carried out by the italian authorities ive already explained the purpose the instinctive reaction was that to call the police risked the matter becoming public nairehamilton was adamant there has to be a satisfactory solution said belli which is why we sought this meeting said nairehamilton what said the italian you had a robbery of a british ambassador which was distressing so close to the summit said wilson realizing the offer would have to come from them and from the palm print and blood samples you know you have discovered the thief so demanded moro it cant be too hard to invent an account of a successful police investigation culminating in an attempted seizure during which the man was killed a story like that could never be contained within the civil police protested delcasta no need even to try said wilson already it is known that inspector moro is attached to diplomatic protection an attempted arrest by a security squad would be publicly acceptable and also ensure secrecy it would also reassure other governments of the effectiveness of your diplomatic safeguard added nairehamilton and be a strong argument against increasing their own bodyguard contingent and you would look after your own problems said belli absolutely said nairehamilton which leaves the summit said belli which im also prepared to discuss said nairehamilton wilson looked curiously along his side of the table and then realized that the discussion had moved beyond the seizure on the via salaria my government does not see it as an easy meeting said belli there are certain contentious issues said nairehamilton a possible dispute between us i believe about subsidy contributions im aware of the agenda said nairehamilton it is an item which my government would prefer not to have been included said belli i understand that the items for discussion are still subject to final agreement between the secretariat said nairehamilton thats also my understanding said belli im authorized to say that my government would greatly appreciate your discretion about the difficulties with our embassy and im authorized to bring it to a conclusion disclosed belli it would be unfortunate for there to be disagreements between our two governments i am sure it can be avoided have i your guarantee on that again there was a pause before nairehamilton replied yes he said an absolute guarantee belli pushed back his chair allowing a smile neither delcasta nor moro joined in wilson felt the meeting moving in their favour he felt a rare admiration for the way nairehamilton had conducted the negotiations any official investigation into what happened at the via salaria could provoke unwelcome publicity said belli he looked to moro can we make it work with the greatest difficulty said moro reluctantly the anger was moving through the policeman so that he found it hard to remain still but it is possible pressed belli i suppose so belli returned to nairehamilton my government would also want an assurance that never again would you consider acting in such a fashion in our country which i have given you unhesitatingly said nairehamilton at once belli forced his public smile i think we have an agreement they shook hands there has been no official transcript said belli it is important that we trust each other for the agreements to be kept wilson saw moro look towards the extensive electronic equipment on the larger table and decided his earlier doubts were well founded there will be no misunderstanding assured nairehamilton they had used billingtons official car with the glassed partition between them and the driver nairehamilton and billington sat in the back with wilson opposite on the jump seat the pm wont like the concessions predicted nairehamilton there was no choice said billington the italians had all the cards hed set his mind on getting the subsidies properly distributed itll look a ridiculous climbdown lesser of two evils said billington nairehamilton looked up at the intelligence director now thats resolved we can go ahead as planned he said wilson moved on the cramped seat i want to question him further he said that date is an odd disparity nairehamilton let the pause become obvious between them weve pulled back from a potential disaster he said slowly i want to avoid another one said wilson they had allowed him coffee and bread for breakfast charlie guessed it must be midmorning when they let him empty his bucket but without any daylight it was difficult to judge he shuffled across the basement one hand at his trousers the other through the wire grip of the pail with jackson leading and two men behind it was a small toilet obviously rarely used but there was a hand basin they made him keep the lavatory door open afterwards without asking charlie went to the bowl sluicing water into his face there wasnt any soap and when he looked around he realized there was no towel either i dont suppose youd let me have a razor dont be bloody stupid said jackson they formed up as before and marched back to the cell the table and the recording equipment were still in place the hope came quickly they were checking what hed said the brief excursion made him aware of how cramped he was so he didnt squat again on the cot but kept pacing the small room he thought back to the meeting with willoughby in the office and then at dinner and then the visits to ostia willing himself to recall the conversations thered been unease he remembered and stupidly hed dismissed it but unease about what a car that might have been following no more than that a feeling that somebody had said or done something which was inconsistent but what among so much it was like trying to climb out of a sandhole constantly pulling the sides back in upon himself charlie had to bunch his toes to prevent his scuffed old suedes sliding off and soon his feet began to ache so he went back to the cot the room beyond was completely silent once he stood putting his ear to the door and then without purpose pushed at it the door moved slightly against the bolts he did it again more forcefully and waited there was no reaction from outside charlie jerked away when the door suddenly opened there was a man with a tray and behind him was henry jackson id like to kick the shit out of you hed get the chance charlie knew there was cold sausage bread and more coffee because there was a knife and fork on the tray the door was left open and jackson remained inside charlie picked at the food the nausea thick at the back of his throat missing the caviar and vodka never touch the stuff you wont again charlie removed a piece of gristle from his mouth and examined it before sticking it on the side of his plate he splayed his knife and fork and took up the coffee cup been in the department long five years whats wilson like the best damned director there is reminds me of someone i once knew said charlie he got you said jackson and we knew all about walsingham carefully charlie replaced the coffee cup and took up the knife and fork how the trap of course and we found out about the communist party links in australia charlie broke the stale bread into pieces what did he have a leak which they believed theyd found with a trap and some communist affiliation and walsingham whom he knew wasnt the man plus his own curious involvement it was like trying to make up a fourthousandpiece jigsaw that included a lot of sky and with no cover picture for a guide why wasnt walsingham arrested we werent ready said jackson uncomfortably and then you buggered it up said charlie jackson shook his head youre the important one and you know what id like to do yes said charlie you already told me willoughbys habitual stoop was more marked and the suit looked creased and overworn his hand strayed in the familiar sweeping gesture towards his hair what the hells going on he said wilson gestured for the tape to be activated and said you are rupert willoughby who are you sir alistair wilson the director of intelligence my colleague here is with the government willoughby glanced at charlie whats he supposed to have done do you know him asked wilson of course i do were you aware he was an agent of the soviet union for a long time willoughby didnt speak at last he said thats ridiculous he worked for my father were aware of his history said wilson heavily all of it i want a lawyer said willoughby my home was forcibly entered ive been brought here without explanation im saying no more until im allowed access to a lawyer youll get one when we decide said wilson i want someone in higher authority were the only authority here said nairehamilton charlie looked sadly at the underwriter willoughby was bent as if he were supporting a weight too heavy for him then he remembered the man in the grey suit charlie didnt feel any rancour willoughby had been more than justified in putting an inquiry agent onto him at no time did rupert willoughby know what i had done charlie interrupted he knew id left the department but not what die circumstances were hes not guilty of any offence thats for us to decide said nairehamilton he thought my training might help with something his firm was finding difficult thats all insisted charlie impatiently wilson turned from charlie back to willoughby and said did you have any contact with this man in the summer of last year i do not know anything about the sort of activities youre suggesting said willoughby did you have any contact in the summer of last year persisted wilson yes when around june i suppose were not interested in what you suppose said wilson when june said the underwriter what date in june there was an exhibition of stamps first in new york and then in florida said willoughby distantly we covered them and i wanted some reassurance of protection it would have been early in the month how early said wilson or june said willoughby no he corrected in sudden recollection im sure it was the th definitely june what precisely was june the exhibition in new york and he was there yes when did he return it ended on july he came back to london the following day where were you me i dont understand new york or london london of course so you dont know where he was in america new york ive told you and then palm beach what proof is there we spoke by telephone every day of course not every day there wasnt the need there must be hotel records hotel records are of registration not occupation said wilson you dont know whether he went down to washington what would he do that for answer the question ive no idea did you speak to him by telephone on june i cant remember as specifically as that dont you keep a telephone log no this is pointless broke in nairehamilton as i always knew it would be all weve got is confirmation of the meeting which we hardly needed anyway when the moment came charlie held back reluctant to speak not a murderer he thought or a soviet agent and from the conversation with jackson he knew there was one and that he was still undetected i gave you another name he said to wilson clarissa willoughby must have been brought direct from the yacht she was wearing jeans espadrilles and a sweater and came through the door with an uncertain smile on her face as if she suspected herself the victim of some elaborate practical joke and then she saw her husband and charlie awkwardly holding up his trousers she looked to the intelligence director who was obviously in charge and said whats going on who are you british security said wilson irritated at the constant need for identification the halfsmile came again this is a joke isnt it clarissa said do you know this man wilson pointed to charlie of course she snorted willoughby intercepted her look towards charlie and the pain showed immediately how what do you mean how how did you meet him he was employed by my husband was there an occasion when you were together in new york clarissas eyes flickered back to charlie again before she replied yes willoughby was intent upon his wife oblivious to everything else in the room when is this important yes why hes a soviet spy said wilson bluntly hes also a murderer dont be so utterly absurd we have proof said wilson when did you arrive in new york last year june when did you encounter charles muffin the same day we stayed at the same hotel what about the day after that there was a reception for the exhibition said clarissa we were all there could he have left the reception gone to washington for instance no said clarissa after the reception we had dinner about eight of us and the following day the th said wilson could he have flown to washington that day we were together throughout june said clarissa looking back to charlie i remember it very well where exactly mostly in bed she said we were together the entire day and night jane williams came back from the table in front of the chaise longue where she had freshened lady billingtons gin and side by side they looked down at the jewellery boxes which were stacked in a neat wall like building blocks in a nursery i never thought youd get them back so quickly or intact said the secretary no said lady billington did you the ambassadors wife shrugged didnt really think about it jane looked at her curiously werent you really worried she said i mean to have lost all that no said lady billington i really wasnt i wish i had been it makes me feel a freak she sipped her drink do you know the only feeling i have what sadness that for some reason i dont understand someone had to die over them isnt it difficult to feel sad after what walsingham did perhaps said lady billington but he was a human being whatever hed done they were still breathless after the lovemaking and jane williams lay with her head against semingfords chest he was moving his hand gently up and down her back and she realized pleased that he would want to make love again soon ive had a reply from london said semingford about the pension if i cashed it in id have three thousand pounds after settling the overdraft which isnt good enough for anything much is it she said no so what are you going to do i dont know lady billington says she feels like a freak not being concerned about the jewellery she sounds it and that she feels sorry for walsingham she felt him pull away from her what i know thats what she said was she drunk no more than usual theyre moving heaven and earth to keep it quiet said semingford the italians have agreed to cooperate its difficult to imagine walsingham doing it isnt it its funny said semingford two days ago before any of us knew it was henry now everyones calling him walsingham wonder what its like to be a spy how the hell would i know said semingford moving his hand between her legs in rome as in other embassies sir alistair wilson had used the communications centre was a room within a room an inner shell fastened to the outer wall by a series of tubular struts from above and below as well as from the sides the inner compartment had been created by security workmen guaranteeing that no monitoring device could have been built in access was across a drawbridgetype walkway which pulled up once the room was occupied cipher machines like experimental typewriters were banked against the left wall at the back a huge radio dominated the room a pilots cockpit of twitching dials and level measures to the right were the securitycleared telex machines the telephones were on a narrow bench to the left there were three all designated different colours the white fed directly into downing street equipped both here and at the other end with matching voice modulators which scrambled the conversation into unintelligible static unless it was cleared through a corrective device this programme was changed weekly to remove the need for a cipher clerk nairehamilton had chosen the telephone before making the connection he and wilson had written out a full account and then attached notations to a master sheet to ensure that the permanent under secretary omitted nothing he made the report with only occasional interruptions from london and by the time hed finished his voice was hoarse and strained there was a sheen of perspiration on his face when he finally replaced the telephone he isnt happy he said what the hell does he want he thinks the italians got too much that we allowed ourselves to be pressured nonsense but easily said from the comfort of downing street what are the instructions nairehamilton hesitated to terminate everything he said he wants us out by tomorrow i think we should continue the debriefing to what purpose for gods sake why did walsingham have the wrong date a simple enough mistake men who keep records like walsingham and muffin dont make simple mistakes im fed up to the back teeth with sitting in that dungeon staring at that fellow holding up his trousers like some damned scarecrow said nairehamilton one more session said wilson urgently jackson handed charlie his belt as he entered the room seeing the start of apprehension the supervisor smiled and said not yet theyre pissed off seeing you standing there as if youve shit yourself still without laces charlie had to shuffle once more into the interrogation room the arrangement was as before with no chair for him to sit on without the necessity of supporting his trousers charlie stood with feet apart with his hands clasped loosely behind his back it was the sort of insolent atease that had driven the parade sergeants mad wilson didnt like it either how long had you been the liaison between moscow and walsingham said the director i was never the liaison until the day at the villa id never set eyes on him wilson was handed something from the folder this will be exhibit he said towards the recording machine he offered it to charlie who is this who do you think said charlie it must have been taken by a hidden camera it looked like a london street but he couldnt be sure i want the deposition to show that this photograph of charles muffin was recovered from the safe deposit box in the name of henry walsingham attached to it were instructions upon identification for the contact meeting in washington those instructions were dated february of last year something pricked at charlies memory and he groped for it like a man trying to distinguish a halfformed shape in a fog quite obviously it was planted there said charlie walsingham knew you he didnt know me until we met at the villa thered been a previous time in washington bullshit youd been identified to him for the washington meeting the meeting charlie shouted the words thats where it went wrong what are you talking about said wilson charlie didnt respond at once then the answers came like a flood that follows the initial trickle through the dam wall it had taken him a bloody long time it wouldnt have done once four days ago i made contact with the man who robbed billingtons safe said charlie the man i found dead at the apartment emilio fantani said wilson i never knew his name i recognized him then from the hand injury the police talked about it was in harrys bar on the via veneto the staff there can confirm it itll be independent corroboration of what that a meeting took place it had to said wilson your instructions were to silence walsingham and fantani was the link what was the only thing that would have mattered to fantani wilson considered the question the payoff i suppose thats what hed been promised by walsingham according to the message from moscow the payoff agreed charlie the payoff figure was wrong what do you mean you believe walsingham staged the robbery on his own initiative wilson was beginning to feel slightly uneasy the insurance was for one and a half million pounds said charlie fantani demanded a ransom of twentyfive per cent well whats twentyfive per cent of one and a half million three hundred and seventyfive thousand said wilson but fantani asked for five hundred thousand said charlie youve recovered the money count it yourself whats the significance fantani knew the policy was a replacement one with adjustments for the increased value of the jewellery that took its cost up to two million and he couldnt have learned that from walsingham because walsingham couldnt have known those details you did but i wasnt working with him according to you wilson and nairehamilton exchanged worried looks in the pause the final piece of the puzzle fitted into place the timing said charlie more to himself than his interrogators walsingham was at the via salaria earlier than i said what are you saying demanded wilson youre going to kill me arent you nairehamilton twitched nervously towards the turning tapes and then back to charlie he didnt speak neither did wilson i know who did it said charlie i know who your spy is who a deal said charlie my life for the name of the spy if not you can go to hell willoughby and clarissa were put aboard the same raf plane that had brought the underwriter to rome and seated next to each other it occurred to neither of them to object which they could have done because clarissa was not under any detention the aircraft had been flying for almost an hour before willoughby spoke i know what happened in rome she glanced at him but said nothing i trapped you he said with bitter triumph i could have got anyone to do the security check but i knew he was desperate and so i tricked him into coming i guessed what had happened in new york and i knew youd come rutting after him instead of going to menton you were watched the whole time you neednt have wasted your money she said wearily all you had to do was ask youre a whore he said havent we had these recriminations before im divorcing you youve said that before too how could you said willoughby with him even before you knew the sort of man he is clarissa smiled wanly actually it wasnt easy she said he didnt want to at first said it would be letting you down you mean you seduced him yes she said i suppose i did it was a joke at first it means nothing to you does it no she agreed not normally he looked at her disbelievingly surely you dont think that you love him yes she said i think i do insane isnt it wilson was seated in the small office that had been allocated to them in the embassy nairehamilton was still striding about the room the more nervous of the two his hands twitched about him do you realize the risk youre taking do you realize what it is if i dont what authority have you got for giving in to his demand none admitted the intelligence director if i hadnt given it he wouldnt have told us bloody guttersnipe what if hes right there was a knock at the door mrs walsingham is here said jackson at first igor solomatin remained stiffly to attention but kalenin seated him and watched him gradually relax under the congratulations you made no contact afterwards with the embassy asked kalenin i considered it safer not to quite right theres little doubt that it worked though said solomatin hurriedly there would have been news of an arrest if it hadnt seeing the mans anxiety kalenin said it was a brilliant operation thank you solomatin was visibly relieved there is a vacancy upon my staff of deputies said kalenin id like you to take it youd be responsible for initiating clandestine activities precisely the sort of thing youve just done im honoured comrade general said solomatin kalenin knew his turn was coming the politburo meeting was only two days away sir hector billington came hesitantly into the basement a chair had been set on the side opposite the recording table and the permanent under secretary showed him to it we appreciate your coming said nairehamilton are you sure this is necessary essential said wilson how can i help you asked billington on some points he has raised said nairehamilton nodding towards charlie billington regarded charlie with undisguised contempt im to be questioned by him it wont take long i sincerely hope not proceed wilson said to charlie you telephoned me at the hotel to tell me where to meet fantani charlie couldnt afford to make one mistake billington appeared embarrassed at the reminder of cooperation yes he said where was the meeting i think it was harrys bar at the villa the day after the robbery the police decided to limit the information publicly released and the value was put at the original assessment one and a half million pounds billington looked annoyed what is the purpose of this establishing guilt said the permanent under secretary billington returned to charlie go on he said stiffly when i met fantani he demanded twentyfive per cent of the insurance value and put it at five hundred thousand and that was the new not the old valuation i dont see your point said billington lets try something else then said charlie when i talked to fantani he made a remark about there being no danger of his being arrested because police had fingerprints not palm prints and that he had destroyed the jacket so there would be no fibre tracings billington gave an exaggerated shrug no information was publicly released about a palm print being found at the villa said charlie or of cloth fibres but i told you after id talked to inspector moro billingtons eyes pebbled in abrupt realization colour flooding his face he jerked around to nairehamilton and wilson and said of all the are you allowing this man to crossexamine me as if im involved in some way in a robbery of my own property youre a cautious man persisted charlie everyone kept telling me that when i first went to the villa and you obviously are ive never seen so many alarms so why didnt you put away the jewellery your wife had worn that night thats what a properly cautious man would have done unless he didnt want to risk premature discovery i want this stopped demanded billington and in the end it was premature said charlie your wife told me what happened because she was in the dressing room about your saying oh my god immediately you opened the safe but you couldnt have seen anything immediately you opened the safe could you all the jewellery was kept in cases which had to be opened your wife mentioned that too when we opened the cases everything was gone she said billington was holding himself stiffly in the chair he stared fixedly at charlie finish he said i want you to finish theres only one more thing said charlie on the day of the robbery i talked a lot of quasilegal rubbish making it up as i went along to persuade you to agree to a settlement idea and you didnt challenge me but youre a lawyer with an oxford degree so you would have known i was talking nonsense billington rose to his feet standing with his back to charlie and looking down at nairehamilton and wilson from the start he said only just managing the evenness to his voice your behaviour has been appalling i have permitted it because of the circumstances that were explained to me making every excuse and every allowance but this i will not excuse today i am going to request the foreign secretary to recall me to london there i shall demand a full inquiry even to have considered asking me to confront these demented ramblings of a known traitor to imagine any need for me to explain myself is scandalous sit down said wilson jill walsingham came like a sleepwalker into the room solicitously wilson helped her into a chair and nodded towards jackson the supervisor appeared with a water glass and put it by her on the recording table she was going through the deadening period of shock when the senses retreat this wont take long assured wilson i want to know whats going on insisted billington from the facing chair you will said wilson i promise you will he looked back to the woman you told me you were frightened after i found out about the communist association in australia jill walsingham kept her eyes fixed just above their heads seeing and hearing nothing mrs walsingham said wilson sharply she shuddered concentrating upon him after i challenged you about australia you were frightened yes why because it was silly why was it silly because it didnt mean anything we told you why it didnt mean anything but you didnt believe us tell me what you decided to do asked wilson softly to be careful she said at once why would you need to be careful because you were trying to trap us i demand to know whats going on interrupted billington this is obscene shut up said wilson irritably therell be an account for this wilson ignored the ambassador were you careful he said she nodded like a child anxious to please henry was very good you know he studied at the electronic surveillance establishment at cheltenham how were you careful encouraged wilson any contact she said particularly on the telephone wilson turned to the ambassador who was sitting rigid in his chair tell me about the telephone calls on the night your husband died said the director henry wasnt back from the embassy a man called for him and i told him to ring back who was the man he said he was from the insurance company did you know him no wilson nodded and the operator of the recording apparatus depressed a button into the room came the sound of charlie muffins voice during his questioning of the ambassador on the day of the robbery i talked a lot of quasilegal rubbish making it up as i went along wilson flicked his hand and the man stopped the tape is that the voice it sounds like it then what happened i told henry when he got back from the embassy he said it was important that an arrangement was being set up to recover the jewellery and he would be involved the second telephone call came after about ten minutes who was it henry said it was the insurance man a name like mutton or mullen or something what was the point of the conversation a meeting said the woman henry had to go to the via salaria where the jewellery was to be bought back was there a time given eight fortyfive then what happened we had plenty of time it wasnt even seven we decided to eat first did you she shook her head there was another call changing the time henry had to be there at eight was it the insurance man again she frowned at the question no she said turning into the room she pointed to billington him this is incredible erupted the ambassador ill have your jobs for this did you answer the telephone no henry did so how do you know it was the ambassador he said so at once youre listening to the words of a spys wife said billington his voice stretched a known communist wilson gave another instruction to the technician alongside charlie muffins disembodied voice filled the room make it eight fortyfive where via salaria centre door ill be waiting for you what about the ambassador tell him what about the police ill tell them when its over it could all be a hoax jill walsingham began to sob her fat body trembling with emotion she put a handkerchief to her face mumbling through it im sorry very sorry walsinghams voice came over her apology you dont really believe that do you id be wasting everybodys bloody time if i didnt good luck yeah i want to say something said billington i want i told you to be quiet said wilson there was a brief smear of static on the tape then the sound of a telephone being dialled billingtons voice came at once onto the line the intonation of respect was obvious the via solaria said the security mans voice eight fortyfive are you sure not until its happened ill be here at the embassy ill call you as soon as its confirmed as genuine the break appeared the same as before but this time there was no dialling tone because the call was incoming im glad i caught you yes ambassador the man who called me about the meeting in harrys bar hes been on again he says the handover time has been changed to eight oclock i cant contact the insurance man i dont know where he is all he said was something about milan and an autostrada id like you to go there yes said walsinghams voice mrs walsingham said wilson what did you do after i challenged you about the communist party membership she looked up from her handkerchief recorded all the telephone conversations of course i told you henry graduated at electronic eavesdropping he was very good she started to cry again it was a celebration and so there had been champagne french because of berenkovs preference valentina was already slightly drunk giggling too eagerly at things that werent really funny kalenin and berenkov were tipsy too laughing with her berenkov raised his glass spilling some wine as he did so and going through an exaggerated performance of mopping it up with his napkin before continuing a toast he declared to general valery ivanovich kalenin a member of the politburo of the union of soviet socialist republics not yet said kalenin not long to wait said berenkov only until tomorrow yes agreed kalenin suddenly sobered by the realization only until tomorrow it was quiet in the basement after the removal of charlie muffin and walsinghams wife billington sat in the concentrated pool of light all the bombast and protest gone how long demanded wilson the director was aware of how close they had come to making a mistake and the anger he felt towards himself was discernible in his voice billington didnt respond immediately remaining with his head lolled forward against his chest i said how long the ambassador stirred and looked about him like someone awakening from a deep sleep he blinked at wilson so very long he said distantly i want to know precisely years said billington he made an effort straightening in his chair i didnt want to he said his voice stronger not ideological nothing like that why then difficult now to remember what he even looked like clearly ive tried really tried isnt that ridiculous who prompted wilson he was controlled now cajoling knowing that it would come out at billingtons pace with only the need to prompt occasionally didnt you ever have a special friend when you were at school get drawn to a particular person no the story was sadly familiar it wasnt serious i mean i didnt continue it not like that at all its just something that happens part of growing up wilson made a note to check if the other man had succumbed to similar pressure how long after you left university said nairehamilton several years said billington i was third secretary in washington id passed everything by then knew it was all going to be wonderful everything was going to be wonderful engaged to norah the wedding was already planned royalty came you know what happened in washington said wilson he was a polite man good english at first i thought he was an american from the state department approached me at a reception and began talking about oxford said hed been there rang me afterwards and suggested lunch and so we met and then he showed me a picture he looked up at the intelligence chief his eyes flooded i didnt know it had been taken thered been a finals party with a lot to drink we were saying goodbye to each other isnt that ironic that was when it ended the last time what did he say this man in washington said nairehamilton he talked of my career and the marriage said how quickly it would all be over if there were any exposure didnt ask for much he could have got it from a reference book in the library if hed waited for the annual list just the details of the trade figures not even classified you gave them to him billington nodded the next time it was for something a little more important some papers on a warplane the americans were thinking of buying from us and then details of the aircraft itself because it had just been shown at farnborough and was new some of the equipment still secret didnt you protest of course said billington and then they showed me more pictures not of oxford this time in washington with me meeting the man whod first approached me exchanging the first package hed gone back to moscow by then a known russian agent they said how would that look with the other photograph so you went on handing over things that were more and more important said wilson but i had to dont you see if i hadnt id have been disgraced the family would have been disgraced weve got one of the finest names in the diplomatic service with a sense of rising disgust wilson wondered how long it had taken billington to lobotomize himself against the guilt what about the assassinations he said i didnt want that said billington urgently i warned them of the danger he hesitated at the sudden stiffness in the directors face haltingly he added i was told it was a policy decision that i had to do it how many did you identify wilson had to guard against the possibility that the russians had suspended the killings when they realized rome had been uncovered intending to resume them later three said billington new delhi ankara and bangkok the recollections came abruptly frigid pictures of calmfaced men with their chests torn apart what about the robbery wilson said had to do somuch said billington petulantly not just the alarms and the combinations had to threaten withdrawal of the policy from willoughby unless the check was made by then theyd discovered what the man muffin did for him claimed his involvement would create added confusion they were very excited when it worked said the coincidence of his being in america at the same time as walsingham made it perfect who told them about walsingham i didnt want to said billington defensively they knew about the business in australia insisted it was ideal when i found it wasnt on his record havent we heard enough said nairehamilton as disgusted as the director others can take over before wilson could reply the ambassador continued you will help me wont you now that you know i didnt have any choice ill resign of course but i dont want a scandal theres the family to think of norah too i know just how im going to treat you promised wilson it will be brilliant if it works said the permanent under secretary im going to make it work said wilson vehemently it isnt possible to recover the situation but i want to undo as much of the damage as i can im sorry i tried to hurry things said nairehamilton we got it right in the end thank god nairehamilton laughed the relief obvious such stupid mistakes werent they why the hell provide a positive date for america for gods sake if it hadnt been for that we wouldnt have listened to anything else the damned man had to say its always the small things said wilson he paused and the ability to spot them reminded of charlie muffin nairehamilton looked toward the closed door of the boxroom cell with two men on guard outside brilliant idea if it works he said again charlie was using the bucket when wilson came into the room he turned his back hurriedly zipping his fly sorry he said and was then unsure what hed apologized for if it hadnt been for the disparity of the meeting time hed have got away with it said the director it should have occurred to me before said charlie it would have once we were lucky with the tape conceded the director it wouldnt have meant much without it charlie realized it was automatic to remain standing respectfully in wilsons presence so much like sir archibald willoughby he thought one reflection prompted another what would happen to rupert and clarissa it was inevitable he supposed but he still regretted being the cause of their collapse did billington break wilson nodded full confession he said there usually is said charlie its the relief now theyd got what they wanted from billington there was no reason why they should keep the undertaking he had no way to make them in their position hed have made the same promise without any intention of keeping it im going to turn him disclosed wilson im going to have him kept here as ambassador and im going to watch his every move and im going to feed moscow everything i want charlie nodded approvingly for that to work theyll need to be convinced the disinformation was successful of course agreed wilson theyve no reason to doubt it itll need something more insisted charlie something public a scapegoat said wilson at once but ive got one havent i charlie the occasion demanded medals should be worn and as he walked towards the assembled politburo kalenin heard them clinking together the reception was taking place in the larger official room with the enormous portraits of lenin between the furled soviet flags because it was the only ceremony of the day the other twelve members were freshly pressed and formal with none of the casualness of the encounters in the smaller committee room its time for congratulations announced the first secretary when kalenin came to a halt before him kalenin bowed his head in a curt greeting but did not respond the operation has been a complete and overwhelming success said zemskov on behalf of the politburo i formally thank you i did my duty said kalenin he wanted the record to show modesty there has been discussion before your arrival said zemskov making the announcement properly formal it delights me comrade general to declare that in accordance with the power vested in it between conferences of the supreme soviet the politburo has today unanimously elected you to serve with it as a replacement for comrade kastanazy the first secretary thrust out his hand kalenin took it and then bent forward for the obligatory kiss on either cheek the formality eased there was more handshaking and kissing and then attendants appeared with vodka and champagne zemskov held his glass towards the kgb chief there is someone else who should rightly be here with us sharing this celebration he said there has been a message from rome said kalenin hes operating normally again epilogue charles edward muffin the charges against you are that being a servant of her majestys government and a signatory to the official secrets act you did on divers dates charlie stood with his hands lightly against the dock rail only half concentrating upon the drone he moved his toes in the luxury of expanded suede theyd allowed him his own clothes for the hearing and for the first time in a
