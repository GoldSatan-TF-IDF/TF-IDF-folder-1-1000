canal dreams by iain banks fantasia del mer tic tic tic tic tiny noises of compression sounding through her skull shed been alarmed the first time shed heard them over the noise of her breathing and the tinny wheezes of the scuba gear which sat on her back wrapping its plastic limbs round her and jamming rubber and metal into her mouth now she just listened to the ticking noises imagining they were the signature of some erratic internal metronome the unsteady beats of a tiny bony heart the noises were her skulls reaction to the increasing weight of water above her as she dived descending from the unsteady mirror of the surface through the warm waters of the lake to the muddy floor and the stumps of the longdead trees she had held a skull once and seen the minute fissures marking its surface tiny hairline cracks stretching from side to side and end to end jagged valleys on an ivory planet they were called sutures plates of bone grew and met while the baby was still in the womb the bones jammed together and locked but left one area free so that the infants head could pass through its mothers pelvis producing the spot on a babys head which remained soft and vulnerable until the bones had clasped there too and the brain was safe locked in behind its wall when shed first heard the noises in her head shed thought it was caused by those boneplates in her skull pressing harder in against each other and the noise travelling through those bones to her ears but then philippe had disillusioned her it was the sinuses which produced the faint irregular clicking sounds it came again like some slow abacus tic tic tic she pinched her nose and blew equalising the pressure on either side of her eardrums deeper she followed philippe down keeping his slowly stroking flippers a couple of metres in front of her conscious of her rhythm matching his her legs moving through the water in time to philippes his white legs looked like stocky strangely graceful worms she laughed into the mouthpiece the mask pressed harder into her face as they continued down tic tic philippe began to level out she could see the lake floor clearly now a crumpled grey landscape fading slowly away into the gloom the old tree stumps poked up through the mud flat eruptions of drowned life philippe looked round briefly at her and she waved then levelled out too to follow him along the waterburied surface of the land over the sliced trunks and the slow bursts of mud produced by his flippers tic the pressures equalised the column of water above her and the fluids and gases of her body achieving a temporary equilibrium the warm water moved against her skin in silky folds and her hair ruffled behind her in the slipstream of her body stroking the nape of her neck settled into the pace of swimming balanced and lulled flying slowly over the slow settlement of a nearcentury following the justtangible turbulence of the mans wake she let her mind wander she felt as she always did down here untied from the commonality of breath that was the air above here however briefly she was free it was a freedom with its own many and precise rules of times and depths atmospheres and experience maintained equipment and weights of air and it was a freedom purchased through surrender to the technology that was strapped to her back clicking and hissing and burbling but it was freedom the air in the mouthpiece tasted of it under the waves with the skull adjusted headlong through the warm waters like an easy and continual birth swimming like flying the one buoyant image of her fear she could accept this had been rainforest the trees had grown in the wind and the sunlight and trawled the air for clouds and mist now they were gone long turned to planks and rafters and ribs and seats perhaps some of the great trees were pulped and became paper perhaps some were turned into sleepers for the railways that helped the canal be built perhaps some formed the buildings in the zone and perhaps some became small ships boats that had plied the lakes sunk their waterlogged timbers would nestle in these shaded depths rejoined maybe some became musical instruments a cello even she laughed to herself again she listened for more tics but heard none she followed the man in a few strokes and kicks she knew she could pass and outdistance him she was stronger than he knew perhaps she was even stronger than he was but he was younger he was a man and proud so she let him lead in a few minutes hypnotically over the drowned forest they came to what had once been a road philippe stopped briefly treading water over the muddied track raising clouds of soft grime beneath him while he studied the plasticwrapped map she drifted nearby watching his bubbles wobble their way to the surface his breath he put the map back under his tshirt nodded down the road and set off she kept pace she knew the gesture hed just made and knew the sort of grunt that accompanied it she imagined shed heard it translated through the water she followed him thinking dreamily of whale songs before they found the village they heard the noise of an engine she heard it first and hardly thought about it though some part of her was trying to analyse the noise put a name and a key to it she realised it was engine noise just as philippe stopped in front of her looking around and up and holding his breath he gestured to his ears looking at her she nodded they stared up the shadow of the boats hull went past not overhead but a few tens of metres to their right a long dark shape dragging a twisted thread of bubbles after it the noise of its passing grew peaked then fell away she looked at philippe once the boat had passed and he shrugged he pointed down the road again she hesitated then nodded she followed philippe but the mood was different now something in her wanted to go back to the gemini the inflatable theyd set out from was moored a hundred metres away in roughly the direction the boat had been heading she had wondered if the noise of the boat would alter after theyd passed telling her it had slowed and stopped at the gemini after all it might look as though it had been abandoned but the boat seemed to have continued on beyond that heading for the middle of the lake and the ships anchored there she wanted to go back to return to the gemini and then to the ships to find out what that boat was doing and who was on it she didnt know why she felt so nervous so suddenly full of a low nagging dread but the feeling was there the war might be coming to touch them at last the drowned road dipped and they followed it tic tic she heard diving deeper tic tic as they swam towards the ruins when hisako onoda was six her mother took her to a concert in sapporo the nhk orchestra playing works by haydn and handel hisako onoda was a restless occasionally recalcitrant child and her weary mother suspected shed have to remove the squirming wriggling and quietly but insistently complaining child before the end of the first piece but she didnt hisako onoda sat still looked straight ahead at the stage didnt rustle her bag of taka rabukoro and instead incredibly listened when the concert was over she didnt clap with everybody else but started eating the deepfried tofu in the bag instead meanwhile her mother stood up with everybody else clapping brightly and happily with small fast movements of her hands blinking furiously and gesturing to hisako to stand and applaud too the child did not stand but sat looking around at the politely enthusiastic adults towering everywhere about her with an expression somewhere between mystification and annoyance when the applause faded at last hisako onoda pointed to the stage and told her mother i would like one please her mother thought for one confused moment that her seemingly gifted but undeniably troublesome and disobedient daughter wanted a western symphony orchestra of her own it was some time before she was able through patient questioning to discover that what the child wanted was a cello the drowned village was wrapped in weeds and mud like tendrils of some solid cloying mist the roofs had all collapsed caved in on their timbers tiles lying scattered and ruffledlooking under the wrapping of grey mud she thought the houses looked small and pathetic floating over a broken street she was reminded of a row of rotten teeth the church was the largest building its roof seemed to have been removed there was no wreckage inside the shell philippe swam down into it and trod water above the flat stone table that had been the altar raising lazy clouds of dust about him like slow smoke she swam through a narrow window and rubbed one of the walls wondering if there were any paintings under the film of mud the wall was dull white though unmarked she watched philippe investigate the niches in the wall behind the altar and tried to imagine the church full of people the sunlight must have shone on its roof and through the windows and the people in their sunday best must have trooped in here and sung and listened to the priest and filed out again and the place must have been cool in the summer heat and white and clean but it was difficult to imagine the thickness of the underwater light the monotonous ubiquity of the grey mud the enfolding quietness of the place somehow denied the past that had brought the village and the church into existence it was as though it had always been like this was always meant to be like this and the chatter and light of the village when only the wind had flowed down these streets and around these walls had been a dream a brief breezy immature little life before the burying permanence of the water extinguished it the noise of an engine drilled through her thoughts the sound was far away just audible and soon faded she imagined the faint grumble echoing off the muddy walls of the drowned churchs shell the only vestige of music left to the place philippe swam over to her and gestured at his watch they both struck up for the surface flippers waving down at the wrecked church beneath them as though saying goodbye the gemini bounced across gatún lake beneath a bright overcast sky heading for the moored ships she sat in the bows slowly drying her hair watching the three vessels coming closer perhaps it was the national guard she turned round to look at philippe but it sounded bigger than a gemini perhaps philippe nodded slowly but it did not come from the direction of gatún frijoles perhaps the fantasia she smiled back at him watching his brown tanned face looking at the small lines around his eyes which made him look older than he was a frown crossed the mans face i think it is not to come until tomorrow he shrugged she smiled again well know soon when we get to the ships he nodded but the frown resurfaced briefly he was gazing past her watching their course there were old logs floating in the lake almost waterlogged that could turn a gemini over or break its outboard prop hisako onoda studied the mans face for a while and found herself thinking she ought to write again to her mother perhaps that evening maybe she would mention philippe this time but maybe not she felt a little warmth rise to her face and then felt foolish i am fortyfour years old she told herself and still feel embarrassed to tell my mother i have a lover dear mother here i am in panama in the middle of the war i dive we have parties we see artillery battles and missile streaks and planes scream over us sometimes food good weather warm mostly love hisako ps i have a boyfriend a french boyfriend a married french boyfriend who was younger than she was ah well she looked at her fingertips crinkled from the water as though after a long bath maybe i should have flown she thought rubbing at the corrugated flesh hisako hisako its only a few hours to europe mr moriya looked exasperated he waved his pudgy fingers around not much more what am i an airport information place he heaved himself out of his chair and went over to the window where a repairman was kneeling fixing the office airconditioning unit moriya wiped his brow with a white handkerchief and stood watching the young engineer as he stripped the faulty unit and laid the pieces on a white sheet spread over the fawn carpet hisako folded her hands on her lap and said nothing it will mean weeks at sea yes she said she used the word hai which was almost like saying yes sir mr moriya shook his head stuffed the sweaty handkerchief away in the breast pocket of his shortsleeved jacket your cello he looked suddenly pleased with himself yes wont it warp or something all that sea air the salt moriyasan i did not mean to go steerage what i think the ship will have ventilation airconditioning airconditioning breaks down mr moriya said victoriously pointing at the dismantled unit spread out on the white sheet like some dead machine being prepared for interment the young engineer glanced up for a moment hisako looked dutifully at the defunct unit she could see the glittering towers of downtown tokyo through the gap under the window where the unit normally sat she shrugged dont they mr moriya was talking to the engineer now he had to repeat his question before the young man realised he was being addressed when he did he jumped up hai airconditioning machines break down dont they mr moriya asked him hisako thought it would be a tricky question to answer in the negative given that the young man was standing surrounded by bits of a machine that had done just that yes sir sometimes the engineer was practically standing at attention gaze fixed at a point over mr moriyas head thank you mr moriya said nodding what can i do he said loudly gesturing widely with his arms and walking past the engineer to look out of the window the young mans gaze followed him he seemed to be uncertain whether this was a rhetorical question or not eh mr moriya said he tapped the young man on the shoulder then pointed at hisako what would you do this lady is one of the finest cellists in the world the world finally after years decades almost of invitations she decides to go to europe do concerts give classes but she wont fly the young engineer was looking embarrassed smiling planes crash hisako said ships sink retorted mr moriya they have lifeboats well planes have parachutes moriya spluttered i dont think so moriyasan mr moriya turned to the engineer im sorry forgive me go back to your work the young man looked grateful and knelt down again perhaps the situation in russia will change mr moriya said shaking his head they might open up the railway again he wiped his neck with the handkerchief perhaps soviets ha mr moriya said angrily shaking his head at the tokyo cityscape hisako raised one hand to her brow traced the line of a bead of perspiration she put her hands back on her lap there will be storms around the cape mr moriya said trying to sound knowledgeable there is a canal through panama i believe hisako said tiring of the argument is that still working it is theres a war there not officially what officially what is to be official about in a war mr moriya sounded incredulous it has not been declared she told him it is a local dispute bandits in the hills a police operation and all those american marines at at last year at limón mr moriya looked confused i thought it was cosa costal costa rica hisako told him she pronounced the r sound in the gaijin manner even exaggerated it a little that was police no a rescue mission hisako smiled faintly the air conditioning engineer was scratching the back of his head he sucked air through his clenched teeth and looked up at mr moriya who wasnt noticing him hisako if it looks like a war sounds like a war the americans will keep the canal safe like this rimón place moriyasan hisako said looking up at him i would like to fly but i cannot i go by ship or i do not go i could go to california and then by train to new york and another ship or through suez which i would also like to see but i would prefer to come back that way mr moriya sighed and sat down heavily in his seat behind his desk couldnt you do what i do he suggested get very drunk the night before the flight beer sake whisky and young australian red wine always works i find so that you have such a bad hangover you feel death would come as a welcome release no yes mr moriya said to the young engineer sir may i use your phone i will order a replacement unit yes yes of course mr moriya waved the man to the phone hisako he leant his smooth bulky forearms on the desktop the engineer chattered down the phone to his office couldnt you try take some sedatives i did moriyasan i went out to narita last week with a friend whose brother is a senior pilot for jal but i could not even sit on the plane with the doors closed she shook her head it must be by ship she tried to look reassuring mr moriya sat back disconsolately in his seat and gently slapped his forehead with one palm i give in he sighed it will only be a few weeks she told him then i will be in europe in london paris berlin rome madrid stockholm all the places we have agreed and prague and edinburgh mr moriya said sounding sad but looking a little more hopeful it will be worth the time i will practise on the journey and florence and venice i need a break from so many recitals and classes anyway not to mention barcelona and i think bern want you too mr moriya watched the young engineer who was still talking to his office and athens and amsterdam ill arrive refreshed so much sea air it will be good for me it must be your choice mr moriya said glancing at his watch im just your agent i just want to see you use your talent to the full you dont have to listen to me i always do moriyasan but i cannot fly a few weeks thats all it will take mr moriya looked glum again the young engineer put the phone down and said a new unit was on its way he packed his tools away and then started wrapping up the pieces of the broken airconditioner in the large white sheet now it was more than two months later and half those dates had been cancelled or postponed her visits to those magically named cities cities she had never seen before and only ever dreamed about had become casualties of an undeclared war the list of their names growing every few days like a slow accretion of the dead là philippe said the fantasia she followed his gaze and just beyond the stem of the ship they were heading for philippes ship the tanker le cercle she could see the small white shape of the fantasia del mer heading for gatún port pushing away from the three ships anchored in the centre of the lake so it was her she said must have gone to frijoles first then she looked back to him perhaps well get some mail now some real beer even philippe grinned you be rucky she laughed putting on a thick japanese accent he laughed too and she felt as she always did at such moments about a third of her real age the warm humid air blew about her as she turned to face the bows again still trying to dry her hair the line of hills on the far side of the broad lake beyond the trapped ships looked like a towering dark wave somehow frozen against the steelgrey sky calvados rémy martin fresh bananas and two sides of meat and metaxa seven star lekkas the cook on le cercle shouted down to hisako and philippe as they moored the gemini to the small pontoon at the foot of the companionway and started up the steps scuba gear hoisted over their shoulders the fantasia del mer had delivered the first supplies for two weeks i have olives lekkas shouted waving his arms about in circles flour for pitta bulgar feta tonight i make you meze well have greek meal much garlic he reached down and took hisakos cylinders from her as she reached deck level ms onoda sounds good yes yes she said any mail no mail lekkas said any news george philippe asked nothing on the radio sir two editions of colón news come with the supplies channel well is just as usual philippe glanced at his watch news in a few minutes anyway he clapped the cook on the shoulder greek tonight eh the three of them started walking along the deck hisako went to take her own gear but lekkas lifted it as he nodded to philippe and i have a bottle of ouzo and some of retsina i been saving we have one good meal they put the scuba gear in a storeroom on the main deck level lekkas went to the galley while hisako and philippe went up to the officers quarters aft of the bridge philippes cabin was a smaller version of the captains across the corridor a modest stateroom a doublebed cabin with three portholes facing astern a closet and a shower room philippe switched the tv on as soon as they got in hisako decided to take a shower she could hear some game show on the tv over the noise of the water when she came out philippe was lying naked on a towel on the bed watching channel news a uniformed woman of the us southern command read out the latest releases from the pentagon cuba panama city san josé bogotá and managua then detailed guerrilla and government losses in costa rica western and eastern panama and columbia hisako lay down on the bed beside him stroking one hand through the black hair on his chest philippe took her hand and held it still watching the screen for the peace conference in salinas ecuador next week representative buckman spokesman for the congressional group said they hoped to overfly gatún lake in the panama canal where three ships are at present trapped by the conflict south africa and the increasingly beleaguered white regime in johannesburg has again threatened to use philippe clicked the set to standby and rolled over to take her in his arms so we can wave to the yanquis when they fly over us eh we should be grateful yes she smiled and said nothing but put one fingertip on the end of his nose wiggling it feeling the cartilage under the l skin he moved his head up softly biting her finger he kissed her moved against her then looked at his watch again he took it off ah we have enough time then she said conspiratorially she knew he was due to talk over the radio to the shipping lines agent in caracas soon just about theyll wait what if they replace you she whispered sliding one arm under his body what would i do then philippe shrugged if they can replace me they can get you out too it wasnt what she meant and she wondered if he knew that but he moved his arms down her spine making her shiver to the small of her back and she didnt feel inclined to pursue the point she walked down the muddy highway she wondered where all the traffic had gone the highway looked broad enough for enormous trucks and vehicles like the scrapers you saw constructing new roads or the huge dump trucks in opencast mines she looked behind her shivering but saw nothing the sky was dark but the ground was bright corn swept back and forth on either side of her like weeds in a stream the corn was grey like the sky and the ground and the road her feet raised slow clouds of dust from the road and the clouds floated in the sky behind her the road wound round the sides of low grey hills twisting this way and that through the silent landscape away in the distance through the slowswaying weeds men fought swinging sparkling swords at each other she had to jump up and down to see the faraway figures the weeds were crowding in around her once when she jumped up to see the warriors she couldnt see them at all but instead over the field of swaying grey crops glimpsed another landscape entirely far below and far away with a great dark stretch of water lying among mountains but when she jumped after that all she saw were the samurai again swords striking sparks off each other while the sky beyond boiled blackly like smoke the track entered a dark forest where the bright leaves fluttered against the starless sky finally the path became twisty and narrow and she had to force her way through the wet foliage to the city the city was deserted and she was surprised and angry that her footsteps made no sound they ought to echo off the tall sides of the great buildings her boots were clean now but when she looked back she saw that she was leaving a line of silvery footprints along the street they glittered and wobbled where they lay on the paving stones as though they were alive it was growing darker in the town and the alley had no lights she was frightened of tripping on something at last she came to the temple the temple was long and thin and tall buttresses and the ribs of its roof made lines against the dull orangeblack sky she heard something at last metal ringing and raised voices so she started looking for a way into the temple she couldnt find any doors and began to hit the stone walls then she noticed a great window set low down in the wall with no glass in it she climbed through inside it was like a factory but the machines sat on the grass at the far end of the building on a stage raised a little off the grass the samurai were fighting she went up to tell them to stop and saw that the two warriors werent fighting each other they were both fighting philippe she cried out to him and he heard and stopped to wave putting his sword down one of the samurai pulled his sword arm back behind him and then swung forward and down the thin slightly curved sword bit into philippes white dress uniform at the neck and cut him in half coming out at his waist philippe looked surprised she tried to scream but no sound came out the samurai bowed slowly and put his sword back carefully into its scabbard his left arm jutted out like a triangle from his side and his thumb slid up the blunt side of the sword as it went back into its sheath she saw a little bead of blood wiped off the edge of metal it collected on the warriors thumb then the sword burst out of the scabbard again and started jumping about the altar like a firecracker jumping and unravelling and making a noise like a flexible metal tape measure as it leapt and expanded and unfolded over philippes white and red body philippe was weeping and so was the warrior and so was she philippe woke her pulling her to his side her jerking legs had kicked him and hed heard her breathing oddly she wasnt crying when she woke up but she sighed deeply when she realised none of it had been real she buried her face in his shoulder and clung to him like some terrified monkey to its mother while he gently stroked her hair and she fell gradually back to sleep again and relaxed once more breath slackening and slowing and shallowing bridge of the world she was promised a cello for her birthday but she was impatient so she made her own pocket money bought an old violin from a junk shop and she discovered a large nail on a building site she glued the nail on to the bottom of the violin to make the spike dont ever forget its not a violin her mother told her amused youll stab yourself in the neck she made a bow from a piece of wood salvaged from a broken screen an aunt in tomakomai was throwing out and some elastic bought in a sapporo market the stretched elastic broke the wooden bow before she even had a chance to play the violincello so she made another from a branch she found in the woods she thought you were supposed to put chalk on the bow so the violincello ended up covered in white each time she played it as did her hands she shook the chalk dust out of the holes in the instrument afterwards hisako and her mother lived in a tiny flat in the susukino district and the sound hisako made was so terrible her mother raided her savings and bought the child a real cello in october three months before hisakos birthday hisako had to wrestle with the huge instrument and much to her consternation throwaway a great deal of assiduously groundup chalk begged from school but finally succeeded in producing tunes her mother could recognise and by her birthday the following january was clamouring for lessons mrs onoda discovered only a little to her dismay that there was a gentleman in sapporo able and willing to give cello lessons a lecturer in the university music department who championed western music in general and the string quartet in particular mrs onoda made another resigned trip to the bank and paid for a sixmonth course of lessons with mr kawamitsu panamá puente del monde said the taxis number plate bridge of the world mr mandamus translated though hisako had guessed what it meant this was one of the names they called the country the other was the heart of the universe ah she said politely it was eight oclock in the evening on pier in balboa on the day the nakado had docked after its pacific crossing they were taking a taxi into panama city which was lighting up the overcast sky beyond the orangenecklaced dark bulk of balboa heights oh get in here mandamus im hungry broekman said from inside the cab it had taken them longer than theyd expected to clear customs puente del monde mandamus said and with a clumsy flourish opened the passengers door for hisako narrowly avoided jamming her ankle in the door as he closed it again and got into the back seat beside broekman panama city por favor mandamus shouted at the driver a young man in a vest panama the driver said shaking his head yeah ok any particular bit via brasil mandamus told him hisako laughed covering her mouth with her hand via brasil the driver nodded he stuffed the copy of newsweek hed been reading between the dash and the windscreen and put the auto into drive the cab bumped over the rail tracks sunk into the rough concrete of the dock there was a brightly lit checkpoint where they left the canal area at the junction of avenida a and avenida de los martires the driver cursed and spat out of the window as they approached the short line of cars and light trucks though they were soon waved through by the us and panamanian troops the queue of vehicles waiting on the far side of the barrier was much longer they drove through the city through the stink of traffic fumes and sudden oases of flowerscent frangipani mr mandamus said sniffing deeply and nodding hisako rolled her window down letting the hairdryerhot moist air spill round her as they sped and lurched their way down the crowded avenues the city was just waking up it was bright and busy and full of cars with their windows down and their music turned up even the troopfilled jeeps they encountered usually had a ghettoblaster perched on the rear or taped to the tbar beside the machinegun the population made the biggest impression though the streets swarmed with riotously different people every colour and race she thought shed ever heard of she had gone ashore in honolulu for a day while changing ships and been surprised at how odd it felt to be surrounded by so many gaijin though the hawaiian natives hadnt looked all that unusual to her then on the nakodo due to take her from honolulu to rotterdam via panama and new orleans shed been surrounded mostly by foreigners the korean crew broekman the second engineer and mr mandamus the one other passenger only the three senior officers on the ship and the steward were japanese so she thought shed adjusted but the extravagance of the racial mix and the sheer numbers of people in panama amazed her she wondered how broekman felt a south african he professed and seemed to despise the white state but hed been brought up in it and she thought panama must still come as something of a shock to the system they drove to the juji on the via brasil it was a japanese restaurant mr mandamuss idea of a surprise she had wanted to eat local cuisine but didnt let her disappointment show the restaurant had a japanese chef a skiing fan from niigata who knew sapporo well and they talked for a while only water skiing in panama the shabushabu was good and the tempura broekman grumbled about steaks but seemed content enough after that mr mandamus having checked with hisako that slurping was still quite in order proceeded enthusiastically to slurp his way through every dish presented even the dry ones halfgargling with kirin beer on the other side of a screen a noisy group of japanese bankers easily outdid mandamus in volume and spent most of the time making elaborate toasts to each other and ordering more sake she felt she might almost as well be at home when they left the city was still waking up the nightclubs and casinos opening for trade they went to a couple of bars on avenue robeno duran mr mandamus didnt like the look of the first one because most of the men were gis i have nothing against our american cousins he explained to hisako as they walked away she thought he wasnt going to say anything else but then he leant close and hissed danger of bombs and ducked into another bar broekman shook his head in the marriott casino they gambled strolling among the greenfelt tables and the stunning local women and the men in their white tuxedos she felt small and dowdy in comparison like a raggedly dressed child but with a childs delight at the glitter and buzz of the place too the roulette wheels clicked dice clattered across the baize cards flicked from manicured hands guards the size of sumo wrestlers tried to lumber inconspicuously between the white jackets and long dresses or stood impassively against the walls hands behind their backs displaying tailored bulges under their jackets only their eyes moving mr mandamus lost little and often on the tranganiquel stuffing quarters into the flashing machines and claiming he had an infallible system broekman won two hundred dollars at vingtetun and ordered champagne for hisako who gambled without much enthusiasm or luck at dado they took a taxi back into the centre and walked along the avenue balboa by the side of the bay where the pacific broke whitely and patrol boats grumbled in the distance then finished up in bacchus ii where mandamus found ah surprise the karaoke room and spent an embarrassingly long time singing along with the japanese backing tracks trying to get hisako to join in and making noisy friends with the same group of bankers theyd encountered in the juji she was falling asleep in the taxi back to pier virgins at the shrine would take mouthfuls of rice and chew it to a pulp and then spit it into the casks and youre making this up you crazy man no no really that is how the fermentation was started an ensign in their saliva a what an ensign in their saliva their spit i know broekman broke off hisako jerked her chin off her chest she yawned her head hurt did you hear that broekman said what mandamus said hear what explosion the driver fat silverhaired watching a tiny colour watchman stuck to the dash when he wasnt overtaking turned and said something in spanish hisako wondered if broekman had really said explosion she wasnt exactly sure how long afterwards the taxi stopped somewhere on balboa heights the puente de las americas to their left straddling the canal entrance and ablaze with lights mandamus helped her from the car and the three of them and the driver stood at the roadside and looked back down into the baycupping city where a huge fire near the centre was surrounded by a hundred flashing blue and red lights and a thick column of smoke like a black cauliflower climbed towards the orangesmudged clouds the crackling of smallarms fire sounded like logs sparking in a grate shaped like an s lying on its side it was the only place on earth where the sun could rise over the pacific and set over the atlantic one day in a spaniard from the province of extremadura called vasco nunez de balboa whod started out as a stowaway on somebody elses expedition then taken over in a mutiny climbed a hill in darien and saw what no european had ever seen before the pacific then they called it the southern ocean balboa made friends with the people who already lived in that stretch of land and an enemy of the man who governed most of the isthmus which the spanish called the castilla del oro the governor took his anger out on balboas own isthmus he had him beheaded the fact that balboa had become his soninlaw did not stay the blade the governor called pedrarias the cruel by history founded a town on the pacific coast near a little fishing village called panamá in the local language panamá meant lots of fish the spanish called the trail between it and the caribbean the camino real the royal road down that road the looted wealth of the inca empire went by slave and donkey the slaves were brought in from africa to replace the locals whod been slaughtered the donkeys were better treated and so the slaves escaped into the jungle whenever they could they were called cimarrones they formed their own settlements and raised their own armed forces and sometimes went in league with the english french and dutch pirates attracted to the area by the intense concentration of vast wealth looting the looters in francis drake and his gang of licensed pirates attacked the spanish gold galleons and the town called nombre de dios they captured the town of cruces and burned it to the ground ninetyeight years later the welshman henry morgan captured panamá itself he set fire to it the treasure required mules the spanish rebuilt the city along the coast with bigger walls fiftyeight years after that when britain and spain were at war admiral vernon captured portobelo on the caribbean coast plus the fort of san lorenzo a few years later in the spanish gave up and started sailing their treasure ships round cape horn instead panama was neglected though not allowed to trade freely with the rest of europe in the panamanians declared themselves independent and joined bolivars greater columbia which neglected them there were revolutions before the spanish came to panama there were over sixty native tribes living in the area afterwards three then somebody found more gold far to the north this time in california the plains of north america still under invasion were far more dangerous than a sea trip from new york or new orleans to the río chagres a short paddle and a quick mule ride to the pacific and another voyage from there to san francisco panama was back in business the short paddle and quick mule ride was so much fun the fortyniners called it the road to hell they died in droves mostly from disease some already rich americans formed the panama railroad company somehow persuaded of their righteousness the columbian government granted them a monopoly it made money the track ran from colón to panamá over one of the old spanish gold trails then a golden spike was driven into its heart thousands of miles to the northwest in the united states of america the first rail route from sea to shining sea was in operation so people began to neglect panama again ferdinand vicomte de lesseps builder of the fabulous sealevel distancereducing desertcrossing empirelinking allsinging alloperatic suez canal a

that panama was outside the volcano belt it didnt have earthquakes was there not an arch still standing the famous arco chato or flat arch part of the church of san domingo which had stood intact for three centuries in panama city congress was convinced the word went out that it would be a good idea if columbia let la compagnie universelle sell all its rights to the us the columbian congress disagreed and wouldnt ratify no matter what president roosevelt wanted incredibly an uprising in panama city played right into the uss hands and when columbian troops were sent to squash it congress sent a gunboat washington recognised the independent republic almost before it was proclaimed it was the new government of independent panama thought it was a neat idea to cede partial sovereignty over a strip eight kilometres wide on either side of the canal route to the united states in perpetuity for ten million dollars down and a quarter million a year the latter eventually raised to close on two mill when it got embarrassing the diseases were vanquished despite everything the problems of geography and topography were conquered by brains brawn and lashings of cash the temporary rail system built to help construct the canal was the greatest railway network in the world at the time mountains were moved rivers dammed forests drowned islands created the zone became an island of clipped lawns in an ocean of jungle in august while the great war in europe was still beginning the first ship passed through the new canal in the us paid million to columbia to compensate for the loss of the isthmus called panama cut to jimmy carter agreed a new treaty in it would all be given back to the locals the panamanians never had liked that in perpetuity clause the zone became the area but most people still called it the zone pineapple face spoiled things a little but not so youd notice things went on the second millennium crept closer and that was as far as hisakos guidebooks took her the rain was warm and the air smelled of the lands own heat vegetable and intense like something that had willed itself into being through a chemical spell without the intercession of the sun six oclock and it was already dark and the rain fell steadily glowing in the lights of the nakodo swinging about her mooring in the gentlest of evening breezes the waters of the lake looked dull and flat and oily covered with the everchanging patterns of the big raindrops ephemeral dots and dashes on the slowly moving surface the air was so thick and humid it was hard to believe the rain could fall through it so fast ms onoda hisako youll get soaked she turned from the rail to see mandamus waddle up coming from his cabin on the main deck level hisako brushed a few droplets from her fringe of dark hair the rain was falling almost straight down and the deck above had sheltered her but mandamus liked to fuss mr mandamus the alexandrian portly and effusive with greyly olive skin and dyedly grey hair a friend of mankind peripatetic expert in multitudinous fields and reputedly holder of degrees from universities on three continents took hisako onoda s hand in his and kissed it precisely hisako smiled as she always did bowing a little mr mandamus offered his arm and she took it they walked along the deck heading forward and where have you been today i was a little late for lunch but you ate in your cabin i believe i was playing she told him the deck was dry near the superstructure spattered with dark drops near the rails ah practising hisako studied the deck wondering whod decided the pattern of tiny diamond shapes on the metal was the best one for providing grip i worry about becoming out of touch rusty rust is best left to the vessels ms onoda mandamus told her gesturing they arrived at the forward limit of the nakodos superstructure looking out over the rainbattered hatches bright under the masthead lights to the forecastle to starboard the lights of le cercle and the nadia burned through the night and the warm rain floating islands of light in the darkness she wondered what philippe was doing when theyd made love the evening before after the swim through the ruins before the nightmare philippe had held her shoulders his arms through her armpits clutching at her shoulders from underneath arching her shed had the dizzying sensation of still wearing the scuba gear the straps pressing into her skin shed remembered the silky warmth of the water and the sight of his long tanned body sliding through it wave lights rippling from the surface like grid lines across the sweet geography of his back and legs hisako are you all right oh she laughed and let go of mandamuss arm which shed been gripping too hard she clasped her hands at the small of her back and walked quickly on desperately trying to recall what mandamuss last words had been im sorry she said i am acting like a schoolgirl she told herself mr mandamus caught her up offering his arm again as they walked so that it stuck out between them like a podgy guardrail it had been something about rain and mud how romantic yes yes its terrible but they are fixing this no too late i fear mandamus said dropping his arm they turned the corner walked towards the stern the companionway leading up to the level of the dining room lay straight ahead the deck was quite dry so many trees have been cut down so much topsoil washed into the lake the situation was quite serious even before the war the canal has been deteriorating for years gatún lake itself mr mandamus gestured around them is shallower and smaller than it used to be as are the dams feeding it before too long you and that dashing french officier will be able to go paddling rather than diving they ascended the stairs hisako took another look back at the lights of le cercle a kilometre or so distant across the lake before being ushered through the doorway into the cool brilliance of the superstructure she had settled into shipboard life very quickly the gassam maru carried her to honolulu over the empty blue pacific she watched the contrails of jets eleven kilometres above with a smile and no regret within a couple of days of leaving yokohama she felt comfortable and at home her place in the hierarchy of the ballasted tanker was that of honoured guest with the privileges of an officer without the responsibilities in rank she seemed to be just beneath the captain equal with the first officer and the chief engineer the crew ignored her with extreme politeness turning back down stairs if she appeared at the top to let her descend but averting their eyes and looking confused if she thanked them the junior officers were only a little more assertive while the senior ones treated her as one of their own apparently according her the respect they felt she was due as an expert in her field which they regarded as no less complex and worthy than their own captain ishizawa was cold and formal towards her but then he was cold and formal with his officers too so she did not feel his lack of warmth as an insult after the frenetic bustle of the last month shed spent in tokyo finishing courses making final arrangements for other people to continue her tutorials and classes having several sendoff parties visiting various friends trying to calm mr moriya going to be hypnotised at his begging being dragged out to narita to board a plane and still getting panicky and weak the moment she boarded and almost hysterical much to her shame when they were about to close the door life aboard ship seemed simple and easy the set structure the regular watches and rhythms the adheredto rules and definite lines of command all appealed to the orderly side of her nature there was the ship and the rest of the world all nice and definite and unarguable the ship ploughed the ocean affected by tides and wind in touch via radio signals and satellites but it was basically a unit separated by its mobility the wide sea the vast skies the soothing consistency of the view reliable in its simple outline but ever various within its elemental parameters made the voyage an escape an experience of freedom of a type and duration shed never encountered before something sublime like a raked garden or a perfectly proportioned room like fuji on a clear day rising beyond tokyo like a great tent being drawn up towards heaven and the stradivari violoncello circa rebridged and reendpointed beijing survived she had taken a device which recorded temperature and humidity in her cabin and a backup airconditioning machine which could work off the ships electricity supply or use its own batteries for up to fortyeight hours all this seemed a little excessive to her but it kept mr moriya if not quiet then at an acceptable volume of terrified hysteria she practised in her cabin sheets taped folded neatly over one blank wall to get the acoustics right practised for hours eyes closed hugging the warm wood of the instrument lost in it so that sometimes she would start playing in the afternoon and when she opened her eyes it would be dark outside the cabin portholes and she would sit there in the darkness blinking and feeling foolish back and arms sore with that rewarding ache of something worthwhile bought at the expense of effort the steward must have mentioned the sheets taped to the wall because the deck officer told her they had found some cork tiles in a store could they fix those to the offending bulkhead uncertain whether they would be insulted if she said no she let them it was done in a day she asked them not to varnish the cork the cello sounded better indeed the last harshness of the cabin gone she tried to listen to herself in a way she hadnt since her earliest days with mr kawamitsu and recorded her practice sessions on her old dat walkman and thought though she would never have admitted it to anybody that she had never played better she was sad to leave the gassam maru but had made no special friends so would not miss anybody particularly the voyage had been enjoyable in itself and its ending was as much a part of it as any other so the sadness was not deep and almost satisfying she boarded the nakodo another yotsubashi line vessel though this time a car transporter chartered to carry nissan limos destined for the north american market she found the nakodo busier more cosmopolitan and more interesting than the gassam she settled in there quickly as well her cabin was larger and woodlined and the cello sounded good in its warmth she stood at the bows of the ship sometimes a little selfconscious that theyd be watching her from the bridge but she stood there all the same like garbo in queen christina but with her hair blowing in the right direction and looked out into the creamy blue emptiness of the western pacific heading eastsoutheast for the isthmus of panama and smiled into the tropic wind like philippes ship the nakodo was under the command of its mate first officer endo sat at the head of the table hisako to his right mr mandamus across from her broekman would sit beside the egyptian second officer hoashi on hisakos other side next to him was steve orrick a student from cal tech whod begged a lift on the nadia in panama city hed been trying to get out of the city for weeks and the nadias american captain had taken pity on him after radioing for permission from the ships owners when it became clear the ships were going to be staying in gatún lake for some time orrick had offered to pay for his keep by helping out with whatever he could at the moment he was on loan to the nakodo helping to paint her he was tall fairhaired awkward and built like an olympic swimmer hisako found the young american a strain to talk to it was a western cuisine night knives and forks graced the brilliant white starched tablecloth the predictable rotation of meals had become one of the most intense of the rituals practised on the three trapped ships each vessel had its own rhythm and each played host to the officers and guests of the other two ships on a regular basis sometimes with the addition of people from gatún shipping agents canal officials occasionally somebody from the consulates in rainbow city or colón tomorrow night they would all troop over to the nadia for a dance and a native feast eating local for a change last night on le cercle with lekkass greek banquet had been a break in the cycle which she and philippe had appreciated but still the pattern of meals drinks parties dances and other social occasions helped to fill the time while they waited for the war to run its course stagnant in the stalemate only this ritualised consumption seemed to make much sense or offer a tangible link to the outside world hisako wondered if she still smelled of garlic the talk turned from the riots in hong kong to the us peace mission to ecuador perhaps we are free to go before long said endo in carefully navigated english you be rucky hisako thought toying with her heavy soup spoon well yeah orrick said looking up and down the table could be you get these guys talking and they can fix this thing up hell all they got to do is get the panamanians to let the marines back into the zone and get them fs flying point and the old venceristasll have to head back into the hills park a battleship or two off pc thatll get to them practically fire shells right over the goddamn country he made a trajectoral motion over the white tablecloth with one broad blondhaired hand our young friend is one of the old guard mr mandamus said to those at the end of the table orrick shook his head the old national guard aint gonna get rid of the reds only way were gonna get the ships out of here is get the marines and gis out of that southern command base and back into the rest of the zone with the handhelds and the microbursts panamanians lose face to do that endo shook his head i guess they might sir but they lost the canal right now heck theyre losing the whole country and they cant even guarantee the safety of american citizens in their major cities how much longer are we supposed to wait these guys have had their chance perhaps the congressmen will succeed in their mission hisako said well just have to perhaps the redsll see the light and join the boy scouts orrick said to her perhaps i have an idea mr mandamus announced holding up one finger why dont we open a book they looked at him in puzzlement hisako wondered what mr mandamus could be talking about then if he was showing signs of converting to some religion opening the bible at random for inspiration and guidance was popular with certain christians shed heard and muslims did the same thing with the koran the steward an old man near retirement called sawai came in with a tray full of soup bowls and a basket of bread wager mr mandamus explained i shall be bookmaker we can bet on what day the canal is finally reopened or on what day the first ship completes its journey whichever what do you say officer hoashi asked hisako what the man was talking about she translated and thanked sawai as he placed a bowl in front of her i do not bet endo said but he spread his hands ill bet that when they open the canal itll be yankees doing the opening orrick said and launched into his soup i might be prepared to cover that wager mandamus said unenthusiastically what are we betting on broekman strode in and took his place at the table nodding to endo when the ships are released mandamus told him which decade which year broekman snapped his napkin and twirled his spoon waiting for sawai to serve him the engineer smelled of soap and cologne a little sooner than that we think mandamus said laughing heartily do you well i wont be betting mr orrick want to send in marines endo said slurping daintily at his soup and making a game attempt at the americans name standard us behaviour broekman nodded yeah it works not in beirut it didnt broekman told the younger man orrick looked puzzled broekman waved one hand impatiently before your time maybe send a gunship mandamus said loudly as though quoting well anyway this isnt beirut orrick took a piece of bread from the basket broke it in half and ate isnt saigon either but so what broekman looked suddenly annoyed and scowled at the bowl the old steward put in front of him ach it isnt up to us itll sort itself out one way or the other we arent even pawns in this the congressmen will see the ships though hisako said and we were mentioned on the news again last night channel broekman said thats because were local for them and a lot these congressmen will see from seven miles up anyway if its a clear day hisako looked down sipped at her soup were a symbol man orrick told broekman we matter thats why the reds havent attacked us or blown away the dams they took out that lock at gatún easily enough broekman said yeah but just one like to prove they could do it and the tanker lying at the bottom of limón bay it was us registered like you keep telling me mr broekman orrick said and it hadnt gotten famous it wasnt mentioned in the news till it was blown away but the reds arent gonna attack us its too public a situation we mean something thats why that planes coming to looksee well be centrestage numero uno you reckon broekman said dipping into his soup well who am i to argue i will hazard mandamus said with slow deliberation and narrowed eyes that if negotiations go well the ships will be released before the end of the month broekman laughed coughed into his soup dabbed at his mouth with the napkin orrick nodded his young blond head slowly only if the guys come in if the guys come in then youll see some action in what guise though mandamus said as though to himself yeah you wait orrick said tearing another piece of bread apart youll see the universal company hello hello hisako ms onoda i am here ah how are you well very well and you hisako what are you doing why are you still on that ship ive put the dates starting in den haag back by exactly one month except for bern not always the same venues but we can sort that out later but you have to get out of there are you listening hello its not easy to get out mr moriya helicopters are shot down small boats are attacked sometimes near the coast of the lake panama airport is closed they must have more than one and because the no the city only has one civilian airport colón is shut down for i meant in the country and the pan american is mined what the airline mined no the highway also the rebels have taken hostages in panama and colón but youre japanese not american i mean why theyve kidnapped theyve kidnapped japanese americans europeans brazilians many different people one of the captains of the ships was taken hostage in cristóbal captain herval i might get through but i might not at least here we are fairly safe cant they get those ships out cant they move them the rebels have missiles also they could blow up the locks or the madden dam or the mindi dyke the canal is delicate even though it is big hisako are these real names no never mind isnt there some way out somehow theres more interest than ever because its been on the news youre there but the europeans wont wait for ever and you arent forgive me but you arent getting any younger hisako oh im sorry say you forgive me im not sleeping well and im on the phone to europe half the night and im snapping at people and im sorry i said that do say im excused thats all right you are correct of course but i have talked to the consulate in panama they say it is safest to sit tight they expect there will be peace soon or that the americans will take over the zone again but when who knows watch the news i watch the news i cant take my eyes off the news when im not running up a phone bill to europe the size of the us national debt im stuck to cnn nippon but watching the news does not get you to europe to play the cello im sorry mr moriya but i cant think of anything i can do oh oh me neither but but oh its all just so frustrating ha why didnt i stay with the nhk like my mother said never mind are you practising how is the instrument i am practising the instrument and i are both fine i didnt know you were in the nhk what yes many years ago trumpet i left because i was making more money doing bookings for other people also playing it hurt my eardrums you are what they call dark horse mr moriya i am what they call broke agent hisako and more broke the longer this call goes on you keep practising hai thank you for calling goodbye sayonara hisako the nakodo stayed at pier for a week there was a problem with the ships propeller which had stuck at one pitch after two days of rioting and curfews the city had been declared safe again hisako went back in with mandamus broekman and first officer endo while the divers tried to fix the prop captain yashiro paced impatiently up and down the bridge watching a succession of ships sail under the puente de las americas past pier and on towards the locks at miraflores helicopters filled the skies clattering between the southern command base at fort clayton and us aircraft carriers and troop ships stationed in the gulf of panama the venceristas were said to be moving down from the cordillera central and the serrania de san bias cuba had warned the us not to intervene and offered help to the republic the us reinforced its base at guantánamo on cuba the soviet ambassador visited the white house to deliver a note to the president the text of which was not released mr mandamus stirred his mint tea and looked out on to the avenida central where the clogged traffic honked and hooted furiously and outrageously decorated buses full of brightly dressed people contrasted with the matt camouflage of the guards jeeps and trucks they had started at the santa ana plaza where mr mandamus guidebook in hand led them down calle after having his shoes polished twice hisako mr mandamus said was the only japanese person hed ever encountered who didnt own indeed had never owned a camera she agreed it was unusual officer endo took photographs of everything in a manner mr mandamus obviously considered a much more satisfyingly traditional japanese fashion hisako spent much time and money on calle the street was packed with shops and shoppers she bought kantule perfume from the san blas archipelago a chaquira necklace made by the guaymí indians a ring with a small columbian emerald set in it a chácara bag a circular pollera dress a montuna shirt and several molas a small pillow a bedspread and three blouses mandamus bought a hat broekman stocked up on cuban cigars endo bought a mola for his wife and two extra diskettes for his camera the men helped her carry all her shopping broekman thought some of the natives looked shifty and said it was probably just as well they were all together especially as hisako had collected enough loot on her shopping expedition to make a conquistadore jealous they trooped down to the docks and through the fish market then got lost in a maze of small crowded noisy streets mr mandamus was delighted the area was called sal si puedes which meant get out if you can and it was traditional to get lost in it you mean you knew wed get lost broekman said once they were lost he waved away a variety of people trying to sell him things well i thought we would mandamus said thoughtfully you thought we would you crazy man of course mr mandamus said glowing with airy satisfaction while a lottery ticket salesman and the owner of a chinese restaurant studied the map of the city mandamus had produced they were arguing they keep changing the street names you see mr mandamus explained the maps have the new names but the people call the streets after their old names its quite simple really but what do you want to get us lost for broekman said almost shouting this citys bandit country these days we need to know what were doing we need to know where we are dont worry mandamus said wiping his brow with a white handkerchief he pointed to endo who was filming the arm movements of the two arguing panamanians mr endo is a navigating officer hisako looked round clutching her shopping bags to her because broekman had said she ought to but despite the heat and the crowds and the fact they were lost feeling happy not because shed bought so much but because here she was finally in a completely different place it was dangerous sometimes frightening quite lawless compared to japan but just so different she felt alive she tried to think of what music it would be good to play now what composition she could take this mood to so that the notes would sing and speak and take on resonances she hadnt heard in them before they got out eventually they continued walking admiring the old spanish villas the cathedral plaza bolivar and the brilliantly white presidential palace with its flamingos i take it the antiaircraft missiles on the roof are a recent addition broekman said looking over mandamuss shoulder at the guidebook so one would imagine they went down to the sea to the plaza de francia and looked out from the old walls to the islands in the bay the pacific was green and blue and violet shimmering under a cloudless sky seabirds wheeled in the baking air they strolled back up the avenida central until they came to a café called the international run by a huge black man called macpherson who spoke with an accent that combined jamaican and english public school they took tea mint for mandamus chinese for the rest oh mandamus said suddenly still reading the guidebook listen the lower part of the ramparts near the law courts contains vaulted cells in which condemned prisoners were chained at low tide mandamus looked up eyes bright you see and then when the tide came in the pacific drowned them the moon drowned them we should go back and see these cells what do you say her classmates made fun of her because she looked like a hairy ainu the ainu were the natives of japan its abos its injuns after the eighth century theyd been pushed further and further north by the yamato japanese moving in from the asian mainland until they clung on only on hokkaldo the most northern island stereotypically the ainu were tall thickbuilt and hairy and hisako though of average build had deep black hair and bushy eyebrows which almost joined up with the hair at the side of her scalp her eyes were deepset which added to the ainu look so the children in her school taunted her and offered to tattoo her lips and wrists the way real ainu were marked in school she was poor at almost everything except english and the other girls told her shed never get to university not even a twoyear one because she was stupid and never get a husband because she was an ugly hairy ainu and shed grow up a poor widowed office lady like her mother she ignored them tried to read fairy stories in english and practised her cello playing once in the middle of winter four girls caught her in a school cloakroom and held her hands down on a nearboilinghot radiator she cried screamed struggled while her hands blazed with pain and the girls laughed and imitated her cries finally roaring with the agony and the unfairness of it all she pulled her head free of their grip leaving one of the girls with a handful of bloody thick black hair and sank her teeth in the wrist of the biggest girl she bit as hard as she could and heard the screams go on around her though her mouth was closed and her hands still burned she woke up on the floor there was blood in her mouth and her head ached her hands were seared and red and tight and she sat there legs crossed rocking back and forward with her hands in her lap weeping quietly to herself and wishing that life was like a fairy story so that her falling tears would heal her hands where the drops fell on the raw red skin her mother seemed to accept her story about pulling an iron rod out of a bonfire on the way back from school mrs onoda said nothing about the patch of missing hair or the bruise on the side of her daughters face and hisako thought her mother stupid and easily fooled for a while until she heard the stifled sobs coming from her mothers room that night hisako let her hands be bandaged she would lie in her mothers arms being read to or rest her english books in her lap turning the pages with her nose or just sit with her cello looking at it and rubbing her cheek against it whenever she started to cry she buried her face in the crook of her elbow in case her tears stained the cellos varnished surface mr kawamitsu had been delighted by the progress shed made she was exceptionally gifted he told her mother who sighed when she heard this because it meant it would cost money mr kawamitsu was very excited he had written to the tokyo music academy and they had agreed to listen to the child to see if she was as good as he said if she was she would be given a bursary of course this meant travelling to tokyo mrs onoda went to the bank it was too soon after her hands had been burned but the date had been set and mrs onoda was terrified of upsetting the academy they were both sick on the ferry she still felt terrible when she was taken into the room in the old building near yoyogi park to sit in front of a dozen sternlooking men she played they listened they looked just as stern when shed finished and she knew she had played badly that she had thrown away her chance and mr kawamitsu would be made to look stupid and her mother would weep behind the screen again she was right she didnt get the bursary they did offer her a place but mrs onoda couldnt afford the money mr kawamitsu looked sad rather than angry and said she must still play because she could do something very few people could do and such a gift was not just hers but belonged to everybody and she owed it to everyone else to practise diligently she found that difficult and her playing became mechanical and without lustre the academy sent for her again a month after their offer of a place had been rejected another chance for the last bursary place but mrs onoda had little money left hisako thought about it and came solemnly to her mother one evening holding the cello like an offering at a shrine suggesting they sell the instrument to raise the money for the fare she could borrow one if she had a chance to practise she might be able to adapt to a new cello her mother ruffled her hair and went to the bank the next morning to take out a loan the ferry journey was smooth and for a long time she watched the wake the ship left stretching back to the dark island of her birth in the forbidding room in the old building near yoyogi park she played again again the sternlooking men listened because her hands had healed she could use them to tell the judges how much it had hurt when they were forced on to the rough metal of the radiator how much she had been hurt how much her mother had been hurt how much everything hurt they still looked stern but they gave her the bursary she wore the pollera and one of the mola blouses to the party on the nadia the third ship stranded in the lake the nadia was a general cargo vessel registered in panama itself but japaneseowned like the nakodo it had been crossing from pacific to atlantic when the canal was closed the nadias parties were held under an awning on an upper deck it was a clear night for a change and on the way over in the nakodos launch heading for the bright patch of light and the sound of latin music she watched the stars fabulous and strewn arching across the sky above the darkness of the lake philippe was already there looking tall and fine and tanned in his white dress uniform she felt the way she always did when she saw him like this afraid and embarrassed afraid that he would look at her one day and instead of smiling as he did now coming forward taking her hand kissing it scowling she would know what that scowl meant it would mean that he no longer wanted her that he was wondering what hed ever seen in her what had possessed him to take this older woman this smallbreasted unglamorous japanese woman to his bed that he was thinking how foolish how blind he must have looked to everybody else and how he could gracefully disengage from the association so she searched his face for that look at almost every meeting knowing the expression might be fleeting knowing it might be almost invisibly brief but sure she would recognise it when it came her embarrassment was caused simply by the thought what was she doing with this handsome young man you are very ethnic tonight philippe said to her looking her up and down as they went to the drinks table she made a flouncing movement with the pollera and you look most dashing but i expand he patted his jacket over his belly too much of this he nodded at the food and drink displayed on the tables under the awning she squeezed his hand more exercise she told him then said hello to the steward at the drinks table and asked for a pernod do you want to dive tomorrow philippe asked her we can dive at night perhaps the lights are ready philippe had wanted to dive in the lake at night for weeks but didnt have any underwater lights apart from a couple of small torches viglain the engineer on le cercle had agreed to make some lights for them she nodded yes lets do that she raised her glass to his santé santé nobody had braved the journey from frijoles a few kilometres away down the canal towards the pacific coast or gatún about the same distance away in the direction of the atlantic hisako spent a great deal of time dancing the only other women there were the wife of captain bleveans the nadias skipper and marie boulard le cercles junior deck officer they sat down to eat ceviche de corvina tamales carimañolas lobsters and prawns she passed on the chicharrones small pieces of fried pork crackling she talked to captain bleveans hed been the only one of the people on the ships whod known anything about her and her career before they met though a few of the rest had at least heard of her bleveans had some of her more recent recordings and shed let him tape the two recitals shed given since the ships were trapped on the other side of the table orrick and broekman were arguing mandamus seemed to be reading mrs bleveanss hand philippe was talking to one of the nadias engineers endo was doing his best to converse with his opposite number on the ship she tried not to keep looking at philippe all the time theyd first met at a similar party on his ship le cercle it had been less than a week since the closure of the canal captain herval the nadias captain had suggested that the officers of the three ships have an informal gathering passengers were invited too shed been talking to mrs bleveans the wife of the nadias captain was a tall thin woman who always dressed well and never appeared without subtle but obviously carefully applied makeup but whose face hisako thought looked faintly if tastefully dismayed as though you were forever telling her something she really did not want to hear but was not prepared to stoop to arguing about excuse me madame bleveans hisako turned to see the tall darkhaired frenchman looking first at mrs bleveans then at her smiling slightly theyd been introduced his name was philippe ligny he nodded to the american woman and to her mademoiselle onoda yes hisako said there is a radio call for you it is from tokyo a mr morieur moriya she said amused at his accent he says it is urgent he waits i can take you to the radio yes yes thank you she said my agent she explained to mrs bleveans mr ten percent huh well give him hell honey hisako followed the young frenchman through the ship admiring his back imagining the feel of those shoulders under her hands and telling herself she might have had too much wine ah an elevator she said philippe motioned her to enter the small lift first we are very decadent on ships todays he told her following her in and pressing the top button she smiled at the todays then told herself his english was ten times better than her french they had to stand with arms touching she felt awkward standing so close to him he smelled of an aftershave or cologne she could not identify the lift hummed around them sending vibrations up her legs she cleared her throat wanting something to say but couldnt think of anything the radio is just like a téléphone he held out the handset for her while she sat in the chair just vacated by the radio operator the wall ahead of her was packed with small screens lights dials and buttons there were another couple of telephonetype handsets plus two other microphones thank you i will be forward on the bridge he pointed she nodded when you finish you hang the the piece here she nodded again she could already hear the squeaky voice of mr moriya coming from the receiver in her hand philippe ligny closed the door behind him and she sighed wondering what mr moriya thought important enough to track her down here hisako yes mr moriya look ive had an idea supposing i hired a helicopter mr moriya retired defeated after about ten minutes mollified by the information that the canal authorities hoped to have the canal operating within a few days she left the radio room it smelled of electronics she thought to herself and went down a short corridor to the redlit bridge where more tiny lights winked the bridge was very long or wide she supposed and full of even more complicated equipment than the radio room multifarious surfaces levers buttons and screens glinted in the strange ruby glow coming from the overhead lamps the bridges sloped windows looked out over the dark lake to the lights of the nakodo a kilometre away and beyond that she could make out what must be the lights of gatún normally obscured by the various small islands between the town and the buoyfield where the ships lay moored she went to the ships wheel it was small about the size of a sports cars she touched it not bad news no she jumped a little and thought at least her blush would go unnoticed in this ruby light and turned to ligny whod come from another redlit room just off the bridge she shook her head no my agent is worried i am due to play in europe in two weeks and she spread her hands well i will be late i suppose ah he nodded slowly looking down at her his face was smoothlooking and somehow theatrical under the red lights she expected the usual questions why hadnt she flown would she be going to his country and so on but he just looked slowly away she noticed he was holding a clipboard he glanced at it excuse me he said i will call one of the men to take you back i stay it is my watch i can find my own way back she said bien i was just she looked around at the banks of controls and screens admiring all this machinery so complicated he shrugged she watched his shoulders move it is more simple than it looks the ship is like an instrument i think a violoncelle is more difficult perhaps she found herself shrugging too realising halfway through the action she was unconsciously imitating him but there are only four strings on a violoncelle she said and one person can work it not twenty or thirty but one person can work the ship he said he motioned at the expanse of controls we control the engine from here direct this is the wheel there is radar echo sounder the ah machine for the anchor we have computers and satellite location as well as paper charts of course in reality he said realité she decided she could listen to his accent for hours days you need many more people for maintenance so on she wanted to extend the moment so moved along the edge of the controls sloped beneath the windows but theres so much so many controls she felt a little guilty at acting the ignorant female but then although officer endo had shown her round the bridge of the nakodo she hadnt paid all that much attention she ran her hand over one set of blank screens what does this do say those are monitors televisions so that we can see the bows stern so on ah and these was she being too obvious running her fingers along the levers this was silly really there was a very attractive young woman officer on this ship much better looking than her but what was wrong with flirting she wasnt even really flirting anyway probably he hadnt noticed she was being oversensitive pumps to pump the cargo the oil and here controls for fighting fire foam water sprays ah ha so you carry crude oil she folded her arms yes from venezuela we take it to manzanillo in mexico on the pacific coast ah yes you were going in the other direction he smiled and so we meet indeed she smiled back he kept looking at her she wondered how long she could keep up this eye contact when i was young he said slowly yes she leant back a little backside against the lip of the control deck i was i had to play the violon violin i tried the how do you say violoncelle cello cello he said smiling i tried the cello but i was not very good i was just a little boy you know she tried to imagine him as a little boy your cello is stradivari he said he looked a little more boyish when he frowned she nodded just keep speaking you beautiful man she thought and what am i doing this is absurd what age am i supposed to be i thi i thought he made violons only no cellos too him and his sons it is very good cello then well i like the sound it makes thats the most important thing inspiration would you like to she gulped would you like to to play it he looked shocked oh no i could not i might hurt i might damage it she laughed oh its not so easily damaged it looks delicate but really its strong ah if you would like to play it if you can remember please do id like you to i could give you lessons if you like he looked almost bashful she thought she could see him as a little boy just perhaps he looked down at the deck i would be is too kind of you no im going to europe to play but also to teach i must practise to teach as well as to play he was still looking bashful the tiny frown was there too she wondered if she was being too obvious well he said perhaps could i pay you no she laughed and bent at the waist bringing her head briefly near him she shook her head quite hard knowing it made her collarlength hair flare out what am i doing oh please dont let me make a fool of myself i know she said she looked down the length of the bridge well trade you could teach me how to work the ship it was his turn to laugh he waved the clipboard in the same direction shed looked is not really so much not moored here if you like i show you but is there anything else you could teach me as soon as shed said it she wanted to close her eyes and run away she heard herself suck air in through her teeth have you ever dived with the ah aqualung dived no i could perhaps teach you that i have a a système yes and there is another for the ship i can ask capitaine herval i think he would let you use that is a good trade his smile showed perfect teeth she nodded put out her right hand suddenly bold yes a good trade they shook on it his hand was large and strong and cool and he looked surprised when she met his grip with one just as firm and sure thats complete crap perhaps mandamus agreed generously with orrick but its an idea if not a new one saying thats complete crap isnt even an idea its just an opinion what is your idea i just cant believe you can be so pessimistic and and still be alive jeez if i felt that way i think id kill myself its not pessimism mandamus said its what i call the bleak view but it isnt pessimism if its right its right truth is truth i am oldfashioned in that regard but i believe as i say we are like a cancer to be like a cancer in one way may be no bad thing we live and grow the question is how much we resemble cancer in any other way if just because were smart is that what youre saying just being smart makes us bad thats crazy you dont listen the smartness im listening i just dont believe what im hearing you must have heard of gaia the planet as organism well we are the cancer in its body do you understand that we were like an ordinary organ once part of the whole we lived and died we behaved ourselves like cells existing and being replaced just another species preying on some species preyed on by others whether we lived or died as a species made little difference then phut intelligence mr mandamus snapped his fingers the younger man shook his head drank from his beer bottle the others were keeping quiet even broekman who was sitting back in his chair looking tired and smoking a cigar his collar undone hisako glanced at philippe who winked at her and with that mandamus said everything changes we invent ways to blow up the world but before that we start destroying other species the other organs of the gaia body and we change her body oh shake your head steven but come with me to alexandria come to venice alexandria becomes venice venice atlantis the waters are rising the ice is melting and the waters are rising what we do means everything now whether we survive or not matters not just to us but to all the other species we take down with us if we go under because we have the drives of any species to live to breed to spread but we have this extra thing this consciousness nothing else has yeah what about whales fah if they were so smart they wouldnt let us kill them so easily theyd post lookouts theyd avoid all ships or ships smaller than a certain size or ships that turn towards them or maybe they are maybe some of them are but we just cant no they cant hide from satellites mandamus said quickly and made a motion as though brushing this aside but there we are whales are intelligent for animals they are big they are impressive and beautiful but we kill them we make them extinct because there is money in it because weve made it easy because we can so we spread ourselves and kill everything else only our intelligence lets us do this it is what takes us beyond the stop message all other species have they are limited by their specialisation by the adaptation they have made to fit their niche we take our niche with us even into space thus we threaten to metastasise so were just doing what were supposed to do orrick said and if we kill off other species maybe they should have been smarter its the smart survive it isnt our fault if were too smart for anybody else mandamus made a spluttering noise and drained the rum hed been drinking shaking his head and wiping his mouth young man christ said broekman they looked at him he came tipping forward on his seat its front legs thudding into the deck those on that side of the table were following his gaze hisako turned with the others the sky to the west was flickering with silent bluewhite bursts of light silhouetted against the unsteady flarings were the hills on the west side of the lake the underbellies of the clouds snapped in and out of view with the fierce strobing of the light like folds of cloth hung in some vast hall half the horizon glittered and danced gatún lake reflected it all a distorted mirror held up to the edge of the sky gone crazy the outline of le cercle sat upon the livid image like a toy what the fuck is that orrick breathed l language mr mandamus said absently but shakily is it just lightning points of flame appeared beneath the clouds they blossomed and spread like vast slow fireworks rubbing an unnatural sunlight on to the sagging undersurfaces of the clouds then falling in a thousand curved yellow streaks towards the ground arcing coruscations flicked to and fro across the sky winking out or disappearing in the clouds like red and silver sparks the first cracks and rumbles broke over them that isnt lightning broekman said the noises increased in volume and became more various scattering into bizarre whizzes and screams against a background of sharp bangs and muffled crumping sounds captain bleveans stood up i guess we better get inside mr janney he turned to one of the nadias junior officers see what were getting over the radio get harrison to try the lowtech military bands even if we cant unscramble it we can get an idea of the traffic ladies gentlemen i think i go back to my ship philippe said rising with the rest people began to follow janney whod almost run through the nearest door into the ship i too endo said he looked at mandamus orrick and hisako you may be best to stay here i hisako began she didnt know what to do stay go back to the nakodo go with philippe inside first please bleveans said they were ushered into the ship the horizon was a billowed cliff of light and darkness split with fissures of fire it stopped after a few minutes a dull glow was left in a few places as the rumbles faded away from distant hills the officers had waited a few minutes to find out what could be heard on the nadias radio it was silent whatever had happened whatever sort of action or bombardment had taken place it had done so without the accompaniment of any signals the ships civilian communications gear was capable of picking up they used the vhf to contact a sleepy policeman in the office at frijoles hed thought it was thunder at gatún the guards officer they talked to said hed seen and heard it but didnt know what it was they were awaiting orders from panama and would probably send out a patrol in the morning they gave it a halfhour or so crowding into the officers mess and drinking some more hisako listened to them all and to herself and heard the sounds people make when they dont know whether to be frightened or not the talk was light jittery inconsequential mandamus and orrick did not return to their argument hisakochan you are not afraid philippe asked her no she held his hand shed stood in a corner watching the rest standing close he almost blotted out the rest of the crowded room for her and now we must go can i come back with you that tiny frown drawing in his black eyebrows i think it isnt so good idea we are closer to the combat and also a tanker he squeezed her hand i have to worry for the ship to worry for you too thats all right she stood on tiptoes and kissed him take care they went down to the water down the long ladder at the side of the ship the sky was milky in places coming and going like some soft aurora the boat hadnt arrived but they could hear it coming through the fogbank she knelt down at the edge of the pontoon and looked at the water the people behind her were still she couldnt see their faces whatever was wrong with the water it was slopping and splashing very oddly and slowly it looked wrong she drew back the arm of the kimono reached down the water was warm and thick the trees on the nearby islands looked very green they floated above the creamy fog the black prow of the first boat was appearing through the swirling mist the water felt slippy and too hot she could smell it now something of iron for a moment she thought she couldnt withdraw her hand but it did come out though it seemed to resist sucking at her hand wrist forearm her fingers were stuck together the sun came out flooding everything in light she looked at the blood dripping from her hand wondering how shed cut herself the blood dribbled down her arm to her elbow and dripped from there and from her bloodglued fingers falling in slow ruby droplets down to the lake but it was blood too the whole lake she lifted her gaze from the red lapping tide at her feet out across the calm smooth surface to the islands and the black boats in the distance a woman came up through the red surface making a strange plaintive hooting noise and holding something tiny but bright between thumb and forefinger of one hand hisako felt her vision zooming in the pearl was the colour of the fog and cloud the stench of blood overpowered her and she fell into her pillow she dragged her face out breathing heavily looked round the cabin a chink of brightness where the curtain over one porthole let in light the soft red glow of her old alarm clock on the cabinet numerals refracted and reflected in the tumbler of water alongside she got up on one elbow feeling her heart thud and sipped at the water it had become warm and tasted thick and stale she fumbled her way out of the bed to go to the bathroom and get some more on the way back she pulled aside the curtain over a porthole the lit stretch of deck she could see looked the same as it ever did she was looking in the direction of whatever had happened in the hills to the west but if there was still any glow left in the sky it was quite drowned by the nakodos own lights water business she hadnt thought it would be so beautiful the rugged lumpy little hills around the canal were covered in trees displaying a hundred different shades of green broken here and there by clumps of bushes and stretches of grass smothered with bright blossoms she had imagined low wastes of monotonous jungle but here was a landscape of such variety of texture and shade and such delicacy of proportion she could almost imagine it was japanese the canal itself was impressive enough but save when the ship had entered the gloomy depths at the bottom of one of the massive locks its scale was not as oppressive as shed expected as the ship slowly rose past the enclosing walls floating on a raft of swirling water the manicured grasslands and neat buildings surrounding each great double set of locks came gradually into view at the same time she thought something of the smoothness and massiveness of the operation the sensation of inevitability and contained power involved in the raising of the ship in such a stately nearly majestic fashion somehow transferred itself to her and to the others on the ship she thought they all became calmer and less fraught as each set of locks was negotiated and not just because with each step along and up that ribbon of concrete and water they were closer to their goal of release from panama and a clear run through the caribbean and the gulf of mexico the repairs to the prop had been completed in that week of waiting the situation had become worse with the venceristas mounting attacks on the towns of david and penonome and a brief raid on escobal which lay on the western shore of gatún lake itself worst of all rockets had been fired at two tankers between gamboa and barro colorado inside the canal the rocket fired at the first ship had missed another launched at the second tanker had glanced off the vessels deck the canal authorities had told a tanker making its way through from the caribbean coast to moor in gatún while the situation was assessed canal traffic had dropped off sharply dozens of ships were tied up against the docks of panama city and balboa moored in the bay or swinging at anchor further out in the gulf of panama awaiting instructions or advice from owners charterers insurance companies embassies and consulates the nakodo was already late the permission to proceed came through from tokyo as soon as she was ready to sail and it all seemed so calm so orderly and assured the precise lines of the great locks the tidiness of the expanses of grass bordered by the concrete at the side of the locks like inlay edging a lacquer cabinet the quaintlooking but powerful electric locomotives that pulled the ship through the locks the deeply eaved oddly templelike buildings set at the side of the artificial canyons of the locks or perched on the thin concrete island dividing one set from the other the feeling of procession as the ship made its way up towards the level of the lake as though it was a novice being gently guided prepared and anointed and clothed for some fabulous and arcane rite in the heart of a great basilica everything made the war seem distant and irrelevant and the fuss about threats against the canal and the ships that plied it somehow undignified and paltry miraflores locks where the gush of fresh water descending from the lock above washed the pacifics salt from the nakodos keel pedro miguel where the buildings around the locks sat in disciplined rows like solemn spectators and where a bulk carrier passed them sinking in her lock as the nakodo rose in hers the crews waved to each other her ascent completed the nakodo cruised quietly on through the echoing depths of gaillard cut and on into the ruffled emerald landscape beyond where the canal swung gradually towards the lake and a train moved outdistancing them to their right theyd seen a few guardia nacional wandering about the edges of the locks or draped over jeeps and trucks parked on the various roads or sitting smoking in the shade of the canal buildings but theyd looked nonchalant unconcerned and waved back as the ship passed hisako had been allowed on to the bridge after making great entreaties captain yashiro was worried that if the ship was attacked any sensible guerrilla would aim at the bridge however he had finally compromised by agreeing she could stay on the bridge until they approached gamboa but it was all so tranquil so patently normal that she was pleased but not at all surprised when gamboa slipped by to starboard and she was not asked to leave the bridge and go below the panama canal commission pilot was chatting in english to officer endo gamboa and the mouth of the upper reaches of the chagres river moved slowly astern the train which had overtaken them earlier left the town and passed them again carriages rocking and wheels singing only a few hundred metres away the morning sun slanted over them between small clouds which speckled shadows over the forested slopes only in a few places could she see the naked hillsides where the trees had been cut down and gullies and ravines had formed scarring the smooth green land the commission pilot had said something about problems in the hills trees cut down topsoil washed away dams silting up and so decreasing the available water the canal required to keep functioning she hadnt thought of that of course the canal could not operate without water at its head water was its currency gatún lake they moved under a slightly hazy sun through the vague shafts of cloud shadows with the land starting to shimmer on each side and the v of the ships bowwave breaking against the shores further and further away they cleared barro colorado leaving the island nature reserve behind to port there must have been a little tension on the bridge after all because she noticed that people talked a little more now they were past the section the two tankers had been attacked in they were in the main part of the lake now ahead of them across the sparkling waters of the lake its lines sharp and definite against the jumbled greenery of the lakes scattered islands lay the lone tanker the authorities had told to remain there while the current emergency existed it was french registered in marseille and called le cercle they didnt hear or see the explosion at gatún but the vhf call came through just as they were passing the moored tanker and the masts of another ship the nadia were appearing over the trees of barro colorado island behind them theyd told her her mother had told her mr kawamitsu had told her but she hadnt thought they were serious she had to leave her mother and go to live in tokyo to attend the academy for months whole seasons at a time she was twelve she didnt think it was allowed to desert somebody who was just little but everybody seemed to think it was for the best even her mother and hisako didnt even hear her weep the night after the confirmed offer of the bursary and place came through hisako looked at the palms of her hands that night it was so dark she wasnt sure whether she could see them or not and thought so this is the way the world works is it she felt oddly remote from her mother over the next few months and really didnt seem to feel very much when she was taken to sapporo station to board the train she was looking forward to the ferry journey that was about it her mother was embarrassingly emotional and hugged her and kissed her in public as the train pulled out hisako stayed at the carriage door face expressionless waving goodbye more because she felt it was expected of her than because she wanted to at the academy everybody seemed cleverer and wealthier than she and the cello lessons very basic they were taken to hear the nhk she preferred it when there wasnt a cello work on the bill because when there was she couldnt help listening to learn rather than just to enjoy on sundays the hostel children were usually taken round an art gallery or museum or into the countryside hakone izu and the fuji five lakes which was much more fun she got to climb things and go on ferries to her dismay the academy teachers were just as scathing about her academic performance as the teachers in sapporo had been she remained convinced she had actually learned vast amounts throughout her life and they were just asking the wrong questions she came top in english about average in her cello class close to bottom in everything else hokkaido was clean and clear and empty after tokyo on her first vacation and fairly deserted and unspoiled even compared to the countryside west of tokyo her mother took her walking in the woods like in the old days once the two of them sat beneath some pine trees overlooking a broad valley watching the warm wind stroke slow patterns across wide fields of golden grain beneath them and the tiny dots of cattle moving on the green swell of a hill on the far side her mother told her how shed cried the night hisako had left for tokyo but that really she was sure they were tears of happiness hisako felt ashamed she hugged her mother and put her head in her lap though she did not cry she coped with tokyo she mourned for hokkaido sundays were still her favourite days sometimes a group of them was allowed to go out without a teacher they said they were going to museums but they really went to harajuku to watch the boys they strolled down omotesando boulevard trying to look mature and sophisticated hisakos command of english began to be admired she still came top in that and her other grades were improving not that that would have been difficult as all the teachers pointed out and she won a prize in the academys cello competition shed never won a prize in anything before and enjoyed the experience she wanted to use the small amount of money involved to buy some new clothes but her mothers last letter had talked about a parttime job in a bar so she sent the money home instead another year another too brief visit home to hokkaido the pace of tokyo life the urge to do as well in exams as any other child but to be a musical prodigy as well even the regularity of the seasons cold mild hot stormy warm fuji invisible for weeks then suddenly there floating on a sea of cloud a flurry of cherry blossom lasting hardly longer than a pink snowstorm all seemed to conspire to sweep her life away from under her her grades went on improving but the teachers seemed to make a special effort to remind her how important they were she read novels in english book in one hand dictionary in another she won all the academys cello prizes she spent some on clothes sent the rest home she was getting used to the remarks about having a cello between her legs the academy offered her a bursary for another three years somehow shed expected they would but she didnt know whether to take it or not her mother said she must mr kawamitsu said she must the academy said she must so she supposed she had to philippe had hoped there might be fish in the lake that would be attracted to their lights as well as simply desiring the novelty of diving at night so far in their daytime dives they had seen hardly any fish the aquatic life in gatún lake had suffered twice over first there had been a series of algae blooms caused by fertilisers washed down from the distant hills around madden lake and the far western shores of gatún itself then the fish and plants had been affected recently by deforestation chemicals used in the early stages of the war the scientific station on barro colorado said the lake was safe to swim in again but the plant community and fish stocks were recovering very slowly philippes blue flippers waved back at her the lake felt warmer than it did during the day which surprised her perhaps it wasnt really any warmer perhaps it just seemed so because she expected the dark depths to be cold the sense of placelessness of being contained and cut off yet somehow free as well was intensified by the darkness with the days silvery surface removed the limit of visibility became what their lights could illuminate and the lake felt both tinier and greater than it had before tinier because at any moment they could see only a short distance around them and so could have been swimming in some small pool but greater because there was no immediate way of telling the surface was not far above and the floor not far beneath using the lights the lake waters became like some swirling and disturbed version of space in the white beams of their lamps a galaxy of minute particles was revealed each mote glowing against the darkness like a swiftly passed star colours were more vivid too though there was little enough to see just the blue of philippes stroking flippers and the bright orange of the line he was paying out behind them to lead them back to the gemini she pointed her lights straight down and saw the floor of the lake gliding greyly by smooth and ghostly and quiet the national guard reported there had been a venceristas bombardment of escobal and cuipo followed by a retaliatory strike by panamanian air force jets this was the official explanation for the fireworks on the night of the nadias party the incident made the channel news briefly reading between the lines it appeared as though whatever had first happened hadnt warranted the pyrotechnics theyd seen unleashed bullshit broekman said leaning against the nakodos rail he had come up from the engine room for a cigar and met hisako sitting near the stern on a deck chair reading she joined him at the rail looking out to the heatwavering line of green hills the bombardment had taken place somewhere behind them you dont believe that she said broekman spat the stub of the cigar down to the waters of the lake and watched it drift slowly under the stern ah it all sounds very plausible more plausible than what we saw perhaps but it wasnt what we saw it all started at once and i didnt hear any jets the paf wouldnt get everything that coordinated anyway god help us theyd probably have bombed us if they had been around i thought that was why we keep all our lights on yes good theory isnt it broekman laughed clasped his hands over the rail never convinced me he spat into the water as if aiming for the cigar stub first time any terrs take to the water at night and the guard call up air support well get clobbered you watch excitable bastards just as well the yanks dont let them fly at night the last two days had been peaceful the only unusual activity theyd noticed had been a couple of national guard patrol boats venturing out from gatún and frijoles to disturb the peace with their droning outboards broekman had watched the inflatables with binoculars claiming he halfexpected them to be towing waterskiers hisako had ventured out on deck after lunch her cello practice took up about two hours each day but that was what she thought of as her tickover rate it would take the prospect of a proper master class or a concert in the near future for her to summon up the enthusiasm to practise more thoroughly she did some keepfit in her cabin her own mixture of canadian air force exercises and aikido movements but that could only hold her interest for about an hour so she still had a lot of time left to fill each day and got bored watching television in the passengers lounge or the officers mess mr mandamuss appetite for interminable games of chess and gin rummy seemed undiminished but she could only take so much that was why shed been teaching him go to her surprise there wasnt a go set on any of the ships so shed made one drawing the grid on the back of an outdated chart and scrounging three hundred washers from the ships stores half brass half steel philippe had radioed again that morning they could go diving tonight if there were no further excitements shed agreed well she said it all seems peaceful enough mmm broekman sounded unconvinced though panama seemed peaceful until that explosion she admitted trying to imagine what he was thinking and the canal seemed peaceful until they blew up the lock and sank that ship in limón bay she shrugged third time lucky she quoted dont they say that broekman nodded they say that but then theres the third light off the one match too broekman snorted they also say look before you leap and he who hesitates is lost so take your pick three is unlucky i thought it was thirteen three if youre lighting cigarettes thirteen for voyages in japan four is an unlucky number hnn broekman said just as well we dont have another ship here then i wonder if the panamanians have an unlucky number she said still watching the hills i liked panama the city i mean it was all right broekman agreed he inspected his thick blunt fingernails very cosmopolitan he was silent for a while longer then added we might have had something like that where i come from hnn he pushed himself away from the rail and clapped his hands together well no rest for the wicked he winked at her enquiring expression they say that too she went back to her book shed taught him the rudiments of cello playing he took to it quickly though he would never be very good she thought even if he wanted to be his hands were the wrong shape and probably not supple enough but she got to touch those hands he began teaching her to dive he was experienced qualified to tutor others in diving which made it all even more correct and proper and pleased her they swam and dived and she was adolescently roguishly delighted by the slim muscled body he revealed they swam beneath the boats inspected the buoys they were moored to investigated the floor of the lake with its felled drowned forests and traces of roads and trails and swam round some of the islets near by circling the summits of the mostly drowned hills under the quicksilver carpet of waves he talked in a selfmocking but still fascinated way about how some day hed like to dive in the harbour of portobelo on the atlantic coast of panama the body of the english sailor francis drake had been buried there in a lead coffin imagine finding that she thought that it must happen then that it never would she went through brief storms of despair and elation never trusting herself to believe fully that she really wanted it to happen never able entirely to stop thinking about him she discovered he was married depression but they were unofficially separated both thinking about it elation she found that marie boulard the junior officer on le cercle didnt interest him even annoyed him a little elation but then that they had had a brief liaison depression and dismay that she was depressed and a little jealous she started to wonder if really he was gay depression then she told herself it was good to have a friend and if he was gay it would probably just make them even more relaxed together and they might become close friends pretended joy faked resignation he likes me because he spends so much time with me he only pretends because theres nothing else to do hes humouring me im old and pathetic and he wont even have thought about it and if i made a move hed be revolted feel it was like his mother making a pass at him no he really does like me and he doesnt want to say or do anything because he feels hell lose me as a friend and i ought to flirt more obviously to encourage him but if i do he might think me ridiculous i might be ashamed and this is a small community not tokyo not sapporo not a university more like the size of an orchestra an orchestra on tour living in the same hotels that was probably closest settle for a friend then and so she went round in circles on the trapped ship she moved his fingers over the neck of the cello bending her head and neck near him she stood behind him he sat on a chair in her cabin another lesson more delicious frustration hmm that perfume kantule she told him frowning as she tried to form his fingers into the right shape i bought it in panama remember ah yes he paused and they both watched her place his fingers just so on the neck of the instrument trapping the strings at the appropriate points when i was in japan he said few women wear the perfume she smiled finally satisfied with the shape of his hand she shifted taking up his hand holding the bow oh we wear it though perhaps not very much she said but then im very westernised she smiled turned to look at him very close she felt the smile falter kantule he nodded shaping the word just as she had it is very nice i think she found herself watching his mouth he sniffed frowned minutely no it is gone again her heart thudded he was looking into her eyes her heart he must hear it must feel it through her breast her blouse his shirt and shoulder he must she leant forward a little over his shoulder so that she looked down the length of the cello she raised her hand the hand that had held his fingers to the cello neck to her own neck she moved her hair aside to reveal her ear then with one finger flexed it forward slightly ici she said quietly they found the wrecked boat when the line was almost fully paid out philippe had been swinging his lights from side to side and at the extremity of one sweep they both saw something white flash against the darkness on the lake floor when the beam returned it showed a straight white line an edge of some sort it looked artificial something shaped by humanity philippe pointed looking back she nodded the orange line made a perfect curve as they swooped towards the white triangle the boat was six or seven metres long open with no sign of a mast or rigging it was fibreglass and it lay without any obvious sign of damage flat upon the floor of the lake there was a layer of mud inside it perhaps a quarter of a metre deep she wondered how long ago it had foundered and how accurately you could date its sinking from the depth of mud inside it had probably been a fishing boat a few pieces of string or line moved like tendrils in the mud within its bows and some netting protruded from its centreline waving in the water like odd graphed weeds philippe moved to the boats stern and found its outboard motor missed initially because it was black and comparatively small he pointed enthusiastically then like the sound of a ghost she heard an outboard she stiffened felt her eyes go wide a brief panic seized her and she struggled for breath she breathed listened philippe still didnt seem to have noticed he was inspecting the drowned engine whirr a shrill distinctive noise burbling in her ears she shook her head but it was still there it was a relief when she saw philippe look up his face behind the mask looking surprised even shocked she nodded and pointed from her ear to the surface then at the outboard he still held the noise came closer she thought she could hear not one highrevving propeller but several philippe gestured hurriedly at her fiddled with his lights gesticulating at them they blinked out she realised immediately and switched hers off the darkness was absolute the moon was only a sliver and the clouds had moved over in late afternoon blanketing the skies above the lake the ships were a kilometre or more away she was blind the water moved round her limbs the lights felt weightless in her hand she let go of them just to feel the slight tug on her wrist as the lanyard tightened gently trying to pull her to the surface then she pulled the lamps back again the prop noise swelled like something angry and vindictive a drowning whine a dark force seemed to gather in her throat as though a sea snake had wrapped itself round her neck she fought it struggling to breathe again trying to concentrate on the high gargling sound of the approaching boats but the feeling increased blocking her air passage making her gorge rise she brought her hands up to her mask to her neck nothing there nothing round her neck hisako went limp relaxing giving in to whatever it was she hung there arms limp one hand hanging at her side the other hand raised over her head by the slightly positive buoyancy of the lights her legs dangling and her head down on her chest her eyes closed slowly the asphyxia started to loosen its hold on her she wondered if she was sinking or rising tic tic tic ah the noise of the boats peaked and passed her flippers met the soft mud of the lake bottom and she kept on going down her legs buckling slowly knees folding she felt the cool mud waft up around her thighs she stopped like that in equilibrium there she tested herself taking a few deep breaths no problem hisako opened her eyes looked around at nothing but darkness she brought her watch up to make sure she could still see as well as to check the time the luminous face glowed dimly at her theyd only been down ten minutes lots of air left the sound of the outboards cut suddenly she brought her lights down so that she could grasp them again she tried to remember which way the foundered boat might be perhaps she ought to search for it try to find philippe but she might get it wrong head off in the wrong direction she could try going in everincreasing circles until she found the line that led back to the boat if she didnt swim under or above it she could kick to the surface it was calm and she would be able to orient herself by the moored ships and find the gemini but whoever was in the boats that had gone overhead and then stopped might see her she would wait here for a while for ten minutes or until she saw philippes lights again or heard the boats move off she undid the popfastener on the big divers knife hanging at her hip as much to reassure herself she was doing everything she could do in the circumstances as to ready herself for a fight she knelt in the soft mud submerged in darkness breathing slowly looking around every now and again the high whine came again after seven minutes one outboard then two perhaps one more she turned her head in the direction the noises seemed to come from shed wait till they disappeared entirely then give it another minute before turning on her lights a light it was far away twinkling like a tiny drowned star but it was real blanked out by her hand and disappearing when she blinked she kicked once out of the mud then again to free herself from its slack grip she swam towards the light it disappeared wobbling and dimming then extinguishing but she kept towards it it reappeared a little stronger this time and started to resolve into two lights not one it dimmed all but disappeared and then came back definitely two lights she swam on brought her own lamps in front of her she was about to put them on when she thought what if it isnt him she hesitated kicking less powerfully though still heading for the twinned distant glow finally she brought the knife out of its sheath and held it alongside the lights in front of her she switched them on the lights in the distance started to dim again then jerked back wobbled up and down she did the same it had to be philippe she kept the knife where it was philippe turned the lights on his own face when she was about three metres away flooded with the relief she copied that too she swam straight into him ramming him hugging him lights floating knife clenched awkwardly in her fist trying to keep it away from his back and his air hoses i dont know he said when theyd kicked to the surface she could just make out the white smudge of his face but they had no navigation lights i think military i she thought he was going to say something more but he didnt they bobbed in the water directly above where theyd met she sheathed her knife looked towards the trio of distant ships she listened for the noise of outboard engines but couldnt hear anything where were you where did you go she asked i swam up towards them he told her i heard them talking but it was espagnol what now she spat some water out looked round for their gemini back to the ship he looked round too i lost the line he said he nodded in the direction she was looking you think that way to the gemini i think so me too they set off keeping the ships to their right she was waiting for an explosion a sudden flare of light a livid mushroom cloud from le cercle or a burst of gunfire the water leaping around them a sudden sledgehammer blow to the exposed back of her skull but they swam on the noise of their own progress through the water the only sound a glint in the distance a little to the left she squinted there again philippechan she whispered over there she moved to him and pointed lining his face up with her arm the tiny glint again perhaps the ships lights reflecting on the glistening hull of the inflatable magnifique and i thought all japonais are wearing les lunettes no she saw him make circles in front of his eyes with his fingers she giggled in spite of herself they climbed into the gemini sat breathing hard for a while philippe shook his head should have brought a radio he looked at the outboard well sometime we have to start it they both kept down as they headed back to the ships the gemini bumped against the pontoon he left her to moor the boat while he sprinted up to the deck she met him there a few minutes later as she arrived at the top of the steps carrying both sets of scuba gear he laughed when he saw her took both of them from her hisako im sorry you did not have to lift mine too its all right she panted everything all right certainly he nodded looking briefly at the gauge on his air tank then stopping frowning at it everything is all right he continued i radioed no one has seen any boats something wrong she tried to look at the air gauge too is stuck i go down to engineering you have shower she went up to his cabin showered and dressed then wondered why she had dressed and considered whether she ought to undress again she was looking out of one of the portholes wondering if shed heard a motor when he came back i try with new cylinder the point thing he gestured frowning she smiled point thing oui sur le cadran he mimed a circle with a pointer inside it the needle she said laughing at his clumsy miming yes the needle is stuck is all i fix tomorrow he skinned off his damp tshirt the intercom buzzer sounded merde he breathed lifting the phone oui he listened moment he hung up grabbed a dry towel from the rail in the shower room and wriggled out of his pants moving to the wardrobe is endo over on launch wants to talk she watched him dry himself roughly and haul on trousers and a shirt he flicked his hair into a semblance of order dragged a comb through it once she lay on the bed still watching him smiling to herself he went to the door looked back at her why you dress he asked looking surprised she shrugged slowly forgot she rolled over and undid a button at the wrist of her blouse dont be too long so she did undress and slid between the crisp white sheets and cuddled herself for a moment a thrill running through her and she moved herself in the tightly made bed just to feel the cool sheets on her skin she put the main cabin light out leaving the bedside lamp on the intercom buzzed making her jump she left it it sounded again twice and she got up out of the bed merde she muttered hisako philippe said philippe yes please come to the officers mess he hung up there was no dialling tone the handset was dead in her hand she looked at it slowly hung it up she didnt put on her jeans and blouse she went to the closet and took out a yukata a kind of light kimono and dressed in that went down to the officers mess suddenly nervous when she started in through the door she was caught by one arm and dragged to one side the room was full she looked quickly round saw what looked like the entire crew there lekkas marie viglainit was only when she saw philippe standing grimly at the end of the messroom table that she realised the hand holding her wrist wasnt his shed just assumed that nobody else would touch her like that she looked into the unknown face of the man who was holding her he wore dark national guard battlefatigues he was blacked up but sweating through it his beret wasnt national guard issue there was a little redstar badge on the front his voice sounded vaguely latin as he turned to philippe and said that is all captain i am not captain philippe said dully that is all he nodded there are no more endo sat at philippes side there were three other battlefatigued men standing against the same wall as her levelling guns at philippe and the rest hisako twisted her wrist to free it from the mans grasp and started to feel angry and think about forcing the issue then she looked down and saw the man was holding a small gun with a long curved magazine a stubby nightsight and a short barrel which was pointing into her kidneys she thought the better of trying to apply the way of gentleness the man looked at her and smiled white teeth in the blackened face welcome to the party señora we are from the peoples liberation front of panamá and you have just been liberated casus belli casus belli kasus beli or kahzus beli n act or situation justifying or precipitating war l concentration they had gone to the nakodo first the men in the first boat were wearing national guard uniforms but anyway werent spotted until they were on board nobody had heard the muffled outboards on their gemini they went straight to the bridge and radio room taking both over without a fight they had silenced pistols and boxylooking uzi submachineguns and nobody had been foolish enough to argue with them another gemini had whispered out of the darkness and unloaded more and more heavily armed men while the first boat made for the nadia taking endo with them to further reassure the nadias crew if they were challenged they were seen approaching and met when they came on deck endo asked to see bleveans the captain was having dinner with the other officers and his wife they put a gun to mrs bleveanss head and told her husband to summon the radio operator officer janney was on the bridge when the venceristas went to take it over he tried to fight and was pistolwhipped that was the end of any resistance on the nadia the second inflatable offloaded venceristas on to the ship while the gemini of fake national guards took endo over to le cercle by the time philippe had made his radio calls to the other two ships they had already been taken over guns pointing at the heads of the radio operators as they told philippe everything was just fine i am comrade major sucre the man whod caught her arm said he waved her to a seat we have taken over your ships for a little while please be patient you do not try to hurt us we wont hurt you ok he looked round the mess at the silent people the officers and hisako sat at one end of the table the crew some french most moroccan and algerian either sat at the other end or on the floor ok the comrade major repeated sharply finally philippe said yes he looked at some of the moroccan seamen sitting near by can i say what you just said in french these men do not understand english sucre smiled ok he hefted his assault rifle but you remember we have the guns philippe spoke to the others the men nodded a few grinned at the venceristas gave a thumbsup sign good said sucre you sit here now i come back soon he put one finger to his lips y silencio huh sucre left the mess taking two of the other armed men with him the two venceristas who were left stood at either side of the door they had come off the second gemini they wore black fatigues and black berets with redstar badges like the one sucre had worn they cradled nightsighted assault rifles with long curved magazines they had automatic pistols stuffed into their belts extra assaultrifle magazines webbed to their belts and two small round grenades attached to their combat jackets near their shoulders one of them slowly wiped his forehead and cheeks with a cloth rubbing off most of the black nightcamouflage hisako looked at philippe sitting expressionless at the head of the table hands flat on the surface he looked at her after a moment she smiled he gave a small twitch of his lips seemed as though he was about to nod then looked up at their two guards and fixed his eyes on the area of table between his hands sucre came back in alone clipping what looked like a small radio to his belt he put his hands on his hips looked round at them all you behave yourself good gonna take you on a boat trip youre going to the other ship ok the nadia he turned to one of the other venceristas to say something then saw philippe standing up slowly at the far end of the room sucre turned back yes captain you mean we all go yeah everybody i cannot i have to stay this ship is my he seemed to be searching for the right word sucre took the automatic pistol from his belt and aimed it at philippe philippe swallowed went silent hisako tensed sucre was a metre away she looked from sucre to philippe who glanced at her when she looked back at sucre he was still looking at philippe but the gun was pointing straight at her she felt her eyes widen the automatics muzzle looked very big and dark she could see the rifling at the end of the barrel producing a hole that reminded her of a gearwheel from an oldfashioned watch a thin film of oil glistened on the guns steel yes grinned sucre you come too captain im not the captain she heard philippe say yes i come too sucre stayed just as he was for a moment then turned to look at hisako smiled broadly and turned the gun round so it was in profile for her safety on see he said she nodded he stuffed it back into his belt captain how many people your launch hold twelve philippe sighed hisako took her eyes off the gun sticking out of the comrade majors belt how dry her mouth had gone she thought sucre nodded looked slowly round the room lips moving soundlessly ok we take you over ten each he pointed at her uno dos tres he pointed at nine of the crewmen diez you go now captain you tell them philippe told the men what was happening hisako stood with the rest they were taken down to the gemini and with one vencerista sitting watching them from the bows and a second operating the outboard with one hand while pointing his gun at them with the other they were taken over the calm black waters of the lake to the brightly lit shape of the nadia he was her bow so she thought of him the english pun amused her though it was too obscure to try and explain nevertheless it felt true she could hold him to her one hand at his neck and the other on the small of his back and she was the instrument he played upon she was the shape he pressed against and made sound the fourfolded string he touched she had not had very many lovers she was sure she had not had enough to estimate the general range of male sexuality to know how many emotional and physical octaves they could encompass so she could not tell if she had just been a little unlucky in the past or exceptionally fortunate now her bow as matched and sometimes as close as complete and as one as if she was the case and he the cello fitted and nested and secure and embraced at every point and part they spent days and nights in her cabin forever touching and looking at each other and being amazed that each touch and sensation still felt so new and good that each gaze was returned and that each succulent act seemed only to increase the desire for more sating and kindling at once it was an open secret and she thought no one wished them ill but they kept up the appearance of friendship only and she didnt come to le cercle to lie with him there that was where he had to go to work always leaving looking regretful and tired and so big but vulnerable she wanted to hug him for ever and so their partings like their couplings were always full of touches and small caresses before he was borne off by the launch that she watched all the way across and she was left to curl up and sleep in the narrow empty bed exhausted and slightly sore but almost immediately aroused by just smelling his dark male scent off the sheets and pillows already wanting him again still they found time to dive which she enjoyed and enjoyed even more knowing that he loved it so much and that it meant more to him having somebody else to dive with someone with whom he could share the joy he obviously felt and to whom he could teach the skills he was so proud of he kept on with his cello lessons though she suspected he was somehow humouring her and did indeed school her in the basics of operating an oil tanker that she found interesting too appreciating the ship as hed said as a kind of instrument and one which had to be maintained and kept in tune if it was to deliver all it was capable of only the immobility of it all frustrated her she could play with the satellite location system and mess around with the radar set but the satellite readout always displayed the same numbers and the view on the radar only altered according to which direction the wind had swung the ship in still it was fun to discover the vessels many systems how you could pump oil from tank to tank to keep the load as even as possible how from the bridge you could monitor even something as obscure as the amount and type of metallic fragments suspended in a gearboxs oil and so determine how each gear was wearing keeping the terms of their trade equal she tried to improve his english in return then captain herval left to return to france the shipping line had decided they would run the ship down to a skeleton crew she was terrified philippe would be the next to go the embassies and consulates advised staying put because the venceristas had begun a new campaign of urban terrorism which included kidnapping foreigners but everyone thought the diplomats were being excessively cautious a few of the nadias crew and captain yashiro of the nakodo also left for home or new ships captain herval travelled to colón to pick up another ship but never made it he disappeared pulled out of his taxi by gunmen half a kilometre from the docks the shipping line decided the crew should stay on the ship hisako tried not to feel glad herval had been taken philippe was in command of the le cercle now he changed with the responsibility but not very much and now at least she felt comfortable with the idea of sometimes staying overnight on his ship in his double bed the war went on around them the parties did the rounds from ship to ship the fantasia del mer made occasional trips from gatún with supplies and mail and some of the nearer islands in the lake were visited on picnics on a couple of nights they saw distant flashes in the sky and heard the dull thudding noise of bombs and shells exploding one afternoon a flight of paf jets blasted overhead a trio of glittering arrowheads trailing a brown wake of shattered air and an airport scent of used kerosene the nadia had a large lounge that was where they were taken it was strange to see everybody together and yet so quiet and powerless she thought a little like seeing actors out of costume and away from the theatre the people from the three ships even those from the nadia looked just as naked and placeless wrenched from their customary setting they were herded into the lounge by the venceristas there were two outside the door and another inside the room sitting on a high stool behind the bar heavy machinegun resting on a beer pump the man behind the bar had told them in broken english that they had to keep the blinds and curtains drawn and no they couldnt get a drink from the bar they were free to talk and walk about as long as they didnt try to cross the semicircle of small stools set a couple of metres out from the bar itself there were two toilets at that same end of the room they could use them so long as they went one at a time and didnt stay long hisako saw the people from the nakodo and went over to them hugging mandamus a slobbery kiss on the cheek broekman an encouraging pat on the back and even endo rigid fluttering surprise dear lady are you all right mandamus enquired fine she told him she felt a little foolish in her light kimono like the one person at the party wearing fancy dress whats happening she asked broekman still wearing his engineers overalls do you know why are they here they all sat down together on the carpet could be part of a general push broekman said more likely its an ambush of some sort i bet theyre expecting the national guard out here something like that broekman hesitated looked around have you seen the americans what she looked around peering over the tops of chairs and couches captain and mrs bleveans broekman said softly we know they clobbered janney but where are the bleveans and orrick i think orrick was up in the bow smoking when they came aboard mandamus said he wore his usual baggy creamy white suit you didnt say that broekman said obviously surprised mandamus shrugged massively i just remembered he goes there to smoke the kif i have smelled it i never wanted before to mention it well either theyve got him but havent brought him here like everybody else or hes hiding or escaped broekman said whatever it did occur to me the americans might be singled out shot maybe hostages perhaps theyve kept the radio operators separate too mandamus pointed out i think bleveans help mr janney endo said he was obviously letting himself go hisako spotted his loosened tie and an undone top button could be broekman agreed but what should we do this is the question mandamus looked laden with the responsibility of it all you mean broekman said should we try to escape dig a tunnel hisako couldnt resist it they looked at her sorry well that isnt one of our options broekman grinned but ought we to think about trying to get away depends on their intentions mandamus said glancing at the man behind the bar they no kill us yet endo said smiling with us split up mandamus was saying they havent said they will kill others if one tries to escape but i think one has to assume this is implied we live in an age where the etiquette of sieges and hostagetaking has become as one might say public domain they assume that we know the rules i think we have to test these assumptions before we make any hasty moves the etiquette of hostagetaking broekman almost choked what are you talking about some avantgarde theatre show or something these bastards are threatening to turn us into hamburger meat and youre talking about etiquette a turn of phrase mr broekman she stopped listening to them talk she stood up and looked to the door as it opened more of le cercles crew marie boulard came to her and they embraced the small trenchwomans hair smelled of roses her skin of some allotrope of normal human sweat fear perhaps hisako looked anxiously at the door but it closed again marie kissed her cheek then sat beside mandamus who patted her hand le cercles chief engineer viglain stood before hisako tall and vaguely cadaverous and smelling of gitanes he took her solemnly by the shoulders and announced il viendra in his surprisingly deep voice she nodded je comprends but thought how does he know he will come viglain sat down with marie boulard she watched broekman share a cigarette with one of the nakodos korean crew and wished that she smoked it was another twenty minutes by her watch before they brought philippe and the rest of the crew in she ran to him threw her arms round him they were hustled further into the lounge by the armed men they reassured each other they were both all right and sat with the others philippe and broekman started talking about what might be going on she halflistened but really only wanted to sit there holding philippes hand or with her head on his shoulder his deep voice lulled her she was shaken awake gently philippes face looked very large and warm he was holding her left wrist oddly hisakochan they want our watches he stroked her wrist with his thumb she had to ask him to repeat what hed said it was still night the lounge was warm comrade major sucre stood in front of her assault rifle strapped over one shoulder he was holding a black plastic bag philippe took off his big divers watch and dropped it into the throat of the bag as sucre held it out to him she looked at her watch shed snoozed for less than fifteen minutes she fumbled with the strap on the little casio wondering fuzzily where shed left her own divers watch probably in philippes cabin dont worry lady sucre said you get it back when were finished here why do you want our watches she said feeling her mouth stumble over the words the strap resisted her she tutted leant forward then philippe held her hand helped her hey sucre said you that violinist she looked up blinking as the watch came free cellist she said dropping the watch into the bag with the others i play the cello she only realised then that she hadnt thought of the instrument of course it might be at risk she formed a question to enquire after its safety then thought the better of it i heard of you sucre said i bet i heard your discs she smiled sucre had wiped most of the blacking off his face he looked young beneath it a lean hispanic face comrade major broekman said putting his watch into the bag i dont suppose youre going to tell us what youre doing are you huh why are you doing this why are you occupying the ships is free panamanian navy sucre laughed he moved off to take watches from other people he stopped looked back at broekman where you from south africa broekman said sucre sauntered back you fascist he asked hisako felt her palms start to sweat broekman shook his head when i was there they called me a communist you like blacks broekman hesitated hisako could see him composing his reply i dont like anyone automatically comrade major black or white sucre thought about this nodding absently ok he said and moved off again hisako breathed out she bought a new cello with one lot of prize money she took her old cello back to hokkaido for the winter holiday leaving the new one in the academy not knowing quite why she did this hisako had a decision to make she might stay on at the academy or she might go to todai tokyo university every japanese kids bright shining weptfor goal shed known people who had broken their hearts when they could not get into tokyo you heard all the time of people killing themselves because they didnt get good enough grades or because theyd failed when they got there and found the work too hard did she want to do this english at todai it would have seemed absurd just a few years ago but her grades had improved that much she honestly had no idea why she thought she probably could do it she had become a good student and she had the enthusiasm in the subject she thought necessary to carry her through but was she ready for the pressure did she really want to be a diplomat or civil servant or a teacher or translator or somebodys highly qualified wife none of those things attracted her she didnt particularly want to travel for one thing which closed off diplomacy or marriage to a diplomat she always felt slightly queasy at the thought of getting on a plane and she wanted to read and speak english because she enjoyed it not because it was her job but she didnt know if she wanted to play the cello for a living either she loved that too and thought she might be good enough to join an orchestra but the same problem applied anything she loved that much might be spoiled if it became her work as though to take her mind off it she had become very athletic spending more time in the academys gym than her cello tutors thought proper she lost herself in the developing abilities of her body the ferry journey north that winter was a wild rough affair but she sat outside part of the time hugging her old cello case to her her teeth chattering her hands raw and red in her mittens the salt spray a taste on her lips and a cold and grainy sweat on her face while the ship pitched and rolled and the white waves tumbled and slid battering the ferry like one sumo wrestler slapping another out of the ring her mother looked suddenly aged hisako sat with old friends in sapporo cafes and found she had little to say to them she went to the ice festival but found it preposterous she did some skiing but sprained her ankle early on in the holiday and spent the rest of it either in bed or hobbling around she went to see mr kawamitsu it was too long since shed visited him always finding excuses she had called once before and finding him out realised she was relieved he wasnt there but now she went in hope and he answered the door mr kawamitsu was pleased to see her his apartment smelled of yuzu and new tatami mats mrs kawamitsu made tea for them they talked about jacqueline du pré mr kawamitsu thought hisako could be an oriental du pré hisako laughed nervously hand over her mouth oh judo karate kendo you have become ninja hisako mr kawamitsu said when she told him of her newfound interests she bowed her head smiling but this is not very feminine for a young woman he told her so aggressive wont you frighten off all the boys perhaps she agreed still staring at the floor she fiddled with the cotton edging of the tatami mat but perhaps that is not so bad if you want to be a great cellist she bit her lip do you want to be a great cellist hisako mr kawamitsu asked in a formal manner as though it were part of a temple ceremony i dont know she said looking up at him and suddenly feeling very young and somehow clear and seeing how mr kawamitsu too had aged she felt glowing and pure mr kawamitsu nodded slowly and poured more tea on the ferry back she sat outside again watching the pitching ragged sea and the dark veils of distant squalls once more she clutched the old cello case to her looking across the empty deck and out over the cold turbulence of sea resting her chin on the shoulder of the cheap but to her precious old case and shivering every few seconds after a while she stood up crossed unsteadily to the rail on the shifting deck lifted the cello and its case up over her head and threw it into the water it fell flat to the waves and hit with a thud she thought she heard it floated off falling astern tossed and blown across the cold grey sea like some strange upended boat she got into trouble somebody saw the case in the water and was sure it was a body the ferry slowed and turned heeling over alarmingly as it turned broadside to the storm and headed back she hardly noticed at the time locked in a toilet sobbing the ferry was way behind schedule anyway but lost another couple of hours retracing its course to look for the body incredibly in that furious sea they found the old case bobbing mostly underwater just the head showing they got a rope round it and hauled it aboard hisakos name was inside the case the academy was informed she was punished with extra duties in the hostel and additional lessons on a sunday the old cello was ruined of course but she kept it and then one sunday in the spring after her punishment had ceased and while the cherry blossom painted the tokyo parks pink she took the waterwarped cello and its saltstained case on the train to kofu climbed to the bald summit of a hill to the north of the fuji five lakes and in a clearing using several cans of lighter fluid cremated the instrument in its battered twisted coffin the cello groaned and creaked and popped as it died and the strings snapped like whips the flames and smoke looked pale and insubstantial against the budding trees and the bright sky but the heated fumes rising through the clear fresh air of spring made fuji itself tremble the warriors moved amongst the people trapped in the great room she sat with philippe the room was like a vast ballroom with a complicated ceiling metal beams soared overhead painted yellow and grey but when she looked harder she was not sure if they supported panes of glass or not in the huge room there were pools of water and clumps of trees and little hills covered in shrubs and flowers and naked women moved slowly in the distance carrying towels mists rose from the warm waters of the pools curling around red ceremonial arches which stood in the choppy waves like letters in a foreign alphabet on a black shore by the side of a gently steaming pool smiling people all lying in a line were being slowly covered with dark sand out in the pool its surface halfobscured by the rising folds of vapour a woman surfaced wearing a black bathing cap on her head a pair of rubber goggles over her eyes and noseclips on her nose she bobbed in the water making a sad whistling noise in her hand between thumb and forefinger she held something small and lustrous and white she looked away from the woman on the beach they were still being covered by the black sand yellowuniformed attendants with plastic shovels heaped the dark stuff over the smiling chatting people slowly burying them she looked up at the clock high up in the dome but it was halfmelted like a painting and stuck at she looked at her own watch but it showed the same time the warriors came closer collecting bits of people on a hill outside the great glass room she could see the castle it was warm in the ballroom but outside there was snow the massive dark stones of the castle were edged in white and on each level of soaring roofs like the wings of some great black crow frozen in flight snow lay blending the castles tall shape into the milky sky the warriors came to her and philippe they wore long stiff skirts of brown and grey and their faces were obscured by long mesh masks they held long cane rods in both hands they brought the rods down on people turning the parts they hit to gold they touched them on the hand or the foot or the leg or the arm or touched their torso or their head wherever they touched somebody they would name the part they touched that part would turn to gold leaving the rest unharmed the unharmed bits lay inert and dry on the tiles or only twitched slightly warriors following behind the caneswordsmen collected the golden bodypieces in a big sack apologising the swimming boy had a leg removed the fat pharaoh his head he sat headless a smooth pink stump where his neck had been impatiently tapping his fingers on the tiles at the side of the pool the little brother his arms the black man his torso his limbs kept trying to reassemble themselves in the right pattern as though his body was still there but each time it seemed they were about to succeed one arm or leg would twitch a little and spoil the whole effect and an expression of annoyance would pass across the face on the betorsoed head the warriors bowed to them touched philippes feet and then her hands her hands glinted gold in the light and fell into her lap one of the men with the sack lifted them and dropped them into its dark depths with a dull clunk she looked down at her wrists all rosy and newlooking the stumps smelled like a babys skin her watch had fallen off and now lay on the tiled floor it still said she kicked it into the steaming pool over the monkeys crowding round its rim the watch flew a long way and disappeared into the mists she heard a plop the line of smiling people on the black sand had been covered from toes to neck they chattered like birds though she could not hear what they were saying the yellowuniformed attendants looked tired and glum philippe stroked her back making her arch it a little through the clouds of steam on the far side of the room she saw a golden bearded buddha standing on a small hill surrounded by trees one of the diving women rose up out of the water covered in a black suit and holding a face mask and a wooden bucket the woman came up to her and picked something out of the bucket it was her watch the woman made a soft hooting noise she thanked the woman and tried to put the watch on but couldnt it was still stuck at though she could hear it ticking she needed hands to adjust it she ran after the warriors took the sack from one of them and started rummaging around inside it looking for her hands there were so many it was difficult but she found them eventually they were the slightly melted ones they fitted perfectly a warrior came up to hit her but she took the stick from him and struck him over the head he fell into the water all the warriors fell into the water taking the sack with them it sank quickly a terrible screaming noise came from behind her and she turned still holding the bloody sword all the people she had left behind were writhing on the floor their blood smearing the yellow tiles as it gushed from their mutilated limbs the line of people on the beach was completely buried just a long line in the black sand the sky beyond the grey metal beams of the dome had gone black when she turned back the water in the pools had turned red and thick and she couldnt feel her hands or her arms the sword dropped from her and clanged on the tiles a great red fountain burst suddenly out of the turgid surface of the pool a terrible wailing noise filled the air she smelled iron philippe stroked her back speaking her name and she woke on a couch in the lounge of the ship it was darker than it had been and quiet nobody talking the brightest light was at the bar where it reflected off the bottles and glasses and the barrel of the guards machinegun she didnt remember going to sleep on the couch she must have twisted while she slept her arms were trapped beneath her cutting off the blood she struggled to turn round again while philippe asked her if she was all right shed been making strange noises her useless arms tingled and pulsed as the blood returned burning in the veins as though it was acid sal si puedes the aguacero came in the middle of the day a rapid darkening of the lightly clouded sky the sound of the wind around the ship quickly increasing then the storm itself spattering rain against the windows howling around the superstructure and the ship starting to roll a little heeling one way then the other without rhythm as the wind swirled and switched direction and gusts pushed the vessel across the lake swinging it around its mooring stem to its buoy and tied there like a noseringed bull to a post they had all slept during the night most fitfully it was warm and stuffy and uncomfortable the ships airconditioning was working but struggling with the heat produced by the sheer density of bodies crammed into the lounge the atmosphere was kept constantly smoky by the cigarettes of the moroccans and algerians the smokers had gravitated together in what looked like a form of racial segregation sitting furthest from the bar still their smoke drifted throughout the lounge broekman went down to sit with them a few times at first to smoke the two cigars he happened to have on him when he was taken off the nakodo and later to bum cigarettes hisako had the privilege of sleeping on a couch as did marie boulard some of the others had cushions from seats and couches the venceristas had brought a few blankets and sheets and pillows down from the cabins so that most people had something to cover themselves with if they wanted to in the heat of the lounge most people went without late in the night the gunmen took one of the larger algerians away the people still awake waited to see if hed come back he did holding the rear end of gordon janneys stretcher captain bleveans carried the front mrs bleveans led the party in followed by two venceristas janney waved from the stretcher and told people he was ok really his head was bandaged the right side of his face was bruised from chin to eyebrow they suspended the stretcher between two seats and made up a bed on a couch for mrs bleveans the nadias captain made sure his wife was settled then joined philippe and endo hisako sat beside philippe she hadnt been able to get back to sleep after her nightmare broekman was curled up under a sheet near by looking oddly childlike mr mandamus lay on his back under another sheet for all the world like a thin man pinned to the floor by a large sack philippe and endo with hisakos help told bleveans what had happened on their ships so no other casualties bleveans asked no captain philippe said they sat under a window near one corner of the lounge level with and about five metres from the bar where one of the venceristas sat machinegun resting on the polished surface drinking a coke endo sat forward a little closer to bleveans mr orrick not with us he rocked back again bleveans looked at philippe and hisako they took him away they didnt get him at all we think hisako said hmm bleveans rubbed the back of his neck tiredly looking down at the carpet hisako hadnt noticed he was going bald before and the radio operators philippe said they are not here yeah theyve got all three of them together in our radio room bleveans said pretending everythings normal you know like theyre all on their own ships how is mr janney hisako whispered bleveans shrugged i think hes concussed id get him to hospital normally men tell you endo said why this no bleveans frowned but they seemed ah annoyed unsettled over something they heard on the news he rubbed the back of his neck again we were in my cabin with the door open and we could hear they had cnn maybe channel on in the bridge thats their command centre far as i can make out logical i guess anyway sounded like the news and about halfway through it was like being in a bar and the local team gets shut out you know endo looked blank philippe frowned hisako translated for endo while bleveans rephrased for philippe like they got some bad news bleveans went on and something else he stretched back flexing his shoulders but at the same time getting to glance back at the guard behind the bar theyre talking to somebody else theyre using their own radios to talk to each other theres some of them on the nakodo i guess but you reckon they all came off le cercle bleveans looked at philippe who nodded i count them when they were together and also two of my crew see them in the boat and there were six all the six come over with us to the nadia so thats two groups and their high command or next military level on shore i guess they seem to talk different to them in what way different philippe said i dont know slower i guess perhaps the venceristas have suffered a defeat hisako said not looking at them whats that maam bleveans said oh when they sounded upset hearing the news maybe the venceristas lost a battle or somebody high up was captured or killed could be bleveans agreed what of congressmen endo said struggling with the word a little hows tha bleveans had sat forward to hear endo better then stopped and just nodded hmm yes hisako said looking at philippe they were to fly over tomorrow she looked at her watch to see if it was past midnight but of course theyd taken her watch at least that had not been a dream today if its past midnight she looked round the others is it yes philippe nodded near four and a half in the morning i think they change guards on fourhour watches and the last change was not long ago so its today bleveans said tapping the carpet with one finger the planes meant to fly over today he looked at philippe and endo what dyou think guys sams pardon wakarimasen hisako translated surface to air missiles for endo bleveans used the words rather than their acronym for philippe both nodded and looked worried i no see any samus endo told bleveans no philippe agreed their weapons i see are guns grenades same here bleveans said he glanced at hisako just a thought but if that is what theyre up to i guess they would keep the heavy weaponry away out of our sight on the nakodo hisako ventured mmhmm bleveans yawned nodding yeah the nakodo rather than the le cercle safer loosing off rockets from that than a tanker full of fuel you think they shoot plane endo said quietly maybe bleveans said is very dangerous i think philippe said frowning might just start world war three mr ligny bleveans said nodding in agreement yeah id call that dangerous if thats what they intend doing he rubbed his eyes sniffed anybody thought of any escape plans yet no philippe said hmm i guess they got this bit thought out fairly well he stretched again looking back for a moment leaving us free is a kindness gives us something to lose keeping those stools in front of the bar is gonna make rushing the guy next to impossible unless we want to take serious casualties we could try a diversion but i have a feeling thats always looked a lot more easy in the movies than it really is doesnt everything hisako blurted then put her hand to her mouth i guess so maam he started to get up they letting us use the heads yes hisako said when the two men looked blank philippe understood he shook his head i check in there captain i do not think is way out there bleveans smiled as he got to his feet i guessed that much philippe i just want to take a leak before i crash you know excuse me he nodded to them and walked off swinging his arms slowly holding each shoulder alternately he gave a sort of halfsalute to the vencerista behind the bar who waved the coke bottle in return todai is not to be taken lightly it is the place the harvard the ox bridge of japan virtual guarantor of a job in the diplomatic service the government or the fast track of a zaibatsu in a country more obsessed with education than any other in history tokyo university is the very summit still she sailed through it she had grown shot up in height at the last moment becoming briefly gangly her aboriginal ainu heritage catching up with her again still smaller than most gaijin she became used to looking down on the average japanese man she swam she hiked she went gliding a few times and sailing occasionally she kept up her japanese sports too the way of gentleness the open hand archery kendo these activities were financed with the money she got from the string quartet she helped form they were popular always raising their fees to keep demand down she knew she didnt practise enough and she scraped through numerous exams because no matter how smart and how energetic you were there was still only so much time in each day she still thought of it as sailing through then and afterwards and never lost a nights or even an hours sleep over an exam while her friends and the other people around her got far better grades and worried themselves sick she knew she didnt have to worry she would float through everything shed be found regardless and at her finale mountains would tremble so she thought of it sometimes in her wildest moments when shed had too much beer with her friends she would survive she would always survive she was smart and strong after all and with gaijin words or a gaijin music box shed get by for a while she had just three problems two were solved in one night after a great deal of thought having decided she didnt need love the way everybody else said they did or thought they did at least not the sort that you couldnt get from a mother or a few close friends or feel towards a piece of music or your homeland she decided to be seduced and to let a gaijin do the seducing he was called bertil and he was from malmo in sweden two years older than her spending a year at a language college in tokyo he was blond which she loved and oddly funny once you got past a layer of halfhearted scandinavian gloom she was still plucking her eyebrows and shaving her legs and arms thinking them hairy and horrible but when they got to the love hotel in senzoku and he undressed her shed told him she was a virgin she hoped he wouldnt be put off by the way she trembled he stroked her pubic hair so that suddenly she thought oh no the one place i didnt shave and its a forest down there and said well she was too flustered to remember the exact words but they were delighted admiring words and the one word she didnt forget the one that a quarter of a century later she still could not hear without shivering the word which had become almost synonymous with that feeling of a soft sensual stroking was the english word how pleased he had sounded to think of it luxuriant bertil had to go back to sweden a week later the parting was excitingly bittersweet she threw her razor away which left just one problem she hated the idea of flying she traipsed out to narita sometimes to watch the jets take off and land she enjoyed that it was no ordeal but the idea of actually getting on to a plane filled her with horror she auditioned for the nhk the same orchestra shed heard in sapporo when shed been a little girl and decided she wanted a cello that she was nervous about but her fate was unstoppable now she scraped through her last exams at todai just as shed scraped through the rest but it was still a pass and shed hardly finished celebrating when the letter came from the nhk the day before her mother was due to arrive from sapporo she went back to the bald summit of the hill north of the fuji five lakes and sat there crosslegged in her kagool listening to the rain drip off the trees and spatter on her hood and watched the clouds trail like skirts round the base of fuji she took the letter out a couple of times and reread it it still said yes she had the place it was hers she kept thinking something was going to go wrong and prayed her mother didnt change her mind at the last moment and in a fit of extravagance fly down to tokyo in the caribbean mr mandamus said in the midst of the storm pronouncing the name of the sea in the british manner with the emphasis on the third syllable if you are on a lowlying island or part of the coast you must beware of the slowtimed waves the normal timing of waves hitting a shore is seven or eight per minute but if the frequency becomes four or five beats a minute you must flee or be prepared to meet your maker first of all the sky will be cloudless and brassy and the wind dies leaving a leaden heat the sea goes strangely greasylooking becoming uniform and undisturbed except for the long ponderous waves all lesser movements are smothered the breakers hit the beach with a slow monotony regular and machinelike and mindless then in the sky streamers of high cloud like ragged rays of dark sunlight seeming to imanate from one place over the horizon they spread over the head while in the distance beneath them clouds form and the sun looks milky and a halo the colour of ashes surrounds it so that it begins to look like an eye in time the sun is put out by the clouds and it begins to go gloomy quick dark clouds fill the middle air while on the horizon a wall of cloud starts to engulf the sky it is the colour of copper at first as it comes closer and grows higher it darkens through brown to black and half the sky is covered by it it is like an impossibly tall wave of darkness tall like the night the winds around you are still slight and uncertain but the surf is hammering the beach like thunder slow and heavy like the beat of a cruel gods mighty heart the dark wave falls the winds land like hammer blows rain like an ocean falling from the sky waves like walls when you think if you are still alive to think it can grow no worse the sea retreats sucked back into the darkness leaving the coast far below the lowest low tidemark draining away into a violent night then the ocean returns in a wave that dwarfs all previous waves a cliff a black mountain spilling over the land like the end of the world perhaps you have seen satellite photographs of a hurricane from space the eye looks tiny and black in the centre of the white featheriness of the storm it looks too small and too perfectly round and black to be natural you think it is something lying on the film the hurricanes look very like galaxies which i hear also have black holes in their centres the eye is maybe thirty kilometres across the air pressure can be so low sailors have said blood comes to the mouth and the eardrums ache the water at the bottom of the eye is sucked up three metres above the rest of the ocean seen from a ship which has survived the winds it is like being in a cauldron the walls of blackness swirl round about but in the eye the air is calm humid and appallingly hot the circling storm moans from all around the waves on the water froth and jostle and leap up coming crashing in from every direction colliding and bursting their spray into the boiling calm air more often than not raggedy exhausted birds fly aimlessly inside the eye those not killed by it confused and beaten they fill up the moaning air with their cries a circle of clear sky overhead looks like earth seen from space blue and far away and unreal sun and stars shine as though through gauze removed and unreal then the screaming winds and the blackness and the drowning rain starts again you ever been in a hurricane mandamus broekman asked merciful heavens no mandamus shook his big head heavily but i have read about it hisako listened to the sound of the aguacero howling outside and thought mr mandamus was very likely the sort of person who talked about air crashes during a bumpy flight attempting to reassure nervous passengers with the thought that they wouldnt feel a thing possibly she decided not to correct him on imanate the storm passed quickly as aguaceros always did behind the drawn curtains of the stuffy lounge it looked like a pleasant day gordon janney had slept badly and his speech was slurred mrs bleveans was changing the dressing on his head her husband was still sound asleep on the floor there were two and sometimes three venceristas behind the bar at any particular moment one was reading a spanishlanguage superman comic then the venceristas took one of the cooks away some time later he returned with a trolley of burgers potatoes and salad the gunmen watched them eat and passed out bottles of water and coke mrs bleveans persuaded sucre she should be allowed to collect some toothpaste a few toothbrushes and a bottle of antiseptic before she went she checked with marie and hisako to find out if either of them needed any sanitary protection neither did christ i suppose that could be it broekman said rubbing his lips with one hand philippe endo and hisako had told him of the theory that the venceristas had come to shoot down the plane the noise of mr mandamus snoring as he slept off his meal covered any sounds short of a shout they were likely to make is just a thought philippe said flight today endo confirmed crazy bastards whatre they trying to do maybe were being paranoid hisako said well know soon anyway if the flight is today broekman said on the news yesterday there was talk of some lastminute hitch might be a delay there was hisako looked at philippe and endo nobody else had heard this on the world service just before our friends arrived philippe looked worried captain bleveans he said the venceristas became upset upset when they hear something on the radio last evening shit broekman said sounds uncomfortably neat doesnt it he rubbed one bristly cheek i didnt think the venceristas were that crazy i think we must get to the radio philippe said how do we do that broekman said patting his overalls pockets for cigars that werent there rushing the guy at the bar would be suicide and all we gets a gun or two and a couple of grenades plus we alert the others if we had the time and a screwdriver maybe we could unscrew the windows he nodded slightly towards the curtains if they arent rusted up but wed have to distract them for ten minutes or more theres no outside access from the toilets no access anywhere the alternative is one of us can try to get out on some sort of excuse and aim to overpower whoever they send with us thats probably our best bet and they probably know that philippe shrugged what excuse you think try pretending we have to do something to one of the ships tell them we have to turn on the bilge pumps or well sink or transfer fuel to the generator or well lose power something like that you think they believe us no broekman shook his head so is not much hope broekman shook his head doesnt mean it isnt worth a try perhaps well be lucky theyve been very casual so far maybe theyre not as confident and professional as they look maybe theyre just sloppy broekman ran one hand through his hair looked round at where the nadias captain lay one arm raised over his head to keep the light out of his eyes wed better get bleveans in on this its his ship we might break if it goes wrong do we wake him now or leave him to get up in his own time hisako confirmed endo had understood leave him endo said philippe pursed his lips i dont know if this plane the lounge door opened sucre stood there pointing the gun at hisako with one hand señora onoda he called bleveans stirred a little at the noise mandamus snored loudly and muttered something under his breath in arabic hisako stood up into a layer of smoke smelling gitanes yes she was aware that everybody was looking at her sucre waved the gun you come with me he stood away from the door there was another armed man in the corridor behind him philippe started to get up too she put a hand on his shoulder philippechan its all right he squeezed her hand hisako dont he began but she was moving quickly away is just a phone call señora onoda sucre told her on the way up to the radio room he was about the same height as she though much more muscled his skin was copperyolive and his face held no trace of the blacking it looked freshly shaved he smelled of cologne she suspected his black curly hair was trimmed and perhaps even curled to make him look guevaraish mr moriya sounds like sucre agreed shepherding her up a companionway she wondered if she could escape perhaps kick down disabling sucre taking his gun but it was better to wait until she was in the radio room her mouth was dry again but at the same time it was as though there was some strange electric charge running through her teeth and gums leaving a sharp metallic taste her legs wobbled a little as they walked along the central corridor that led to the ships bridge senior officers quarters and radio room a vencerista rested against the wall outside between her and the bridge she smelled more tobacco smoke cigars or cigarillos sucre took her elbow and stopped her swung her round so that she bumped into the metal corridor wall he pressed against her the automatic pistol hed pointed at her the evening before in his hand again he put the gun up under her chin she tipped her head back looked into his dark eyes señora he began señorita she told him then wished she hadnt hey youre cool sucre grinned he moved his thumb there was a click which she both heard and felt through her neck and jaw hear that señorita she nodded slowly now no safety catch safety catch off you say anything on the radio i blow your brains out then i give the other two women to my men we been in the jungles long time yeah and then after that i take the cojones off your francésman he put his free hand between her legs patting her through the light material of the yukata he smiled broadly her heart thudded she felt as if she might lose control of her bowels the gun was hard under her chin halfchoking her making her want to gag understand sucre said yes yes good and you make it short he will want to speak japanese she told him moriya would have used english to ask for her but of course would expect to talk to her in japanese sucre looked surprised then briefly angry finally he grinned tell him your francésman want to listen too she nodded carefully all right he took his hand away backed off waved her to the radio room the nadias radio operator let her into the seat sucre sat to her right facing her the automatic against her right ear ok he said quietly not taking his eyes off her she picked up the handset put it to her left ear it was the wrong side it felt strange hello she said swallowing hisako what takes these people so long and where did you get to anyway never mind look its getting ridiculous mr moriya mr moriya yes talk in english please i have a friend here who does not understand japanese what moriya said in japanese then switched to english oh hisako have i to please for me very well very well let me see perhaps we have cancellings altogether they still they still ah want you appear some time but oh i am sorry i am impolite how are you fine you oh dear you are being short with me always i know i say wrong thing when you are short with me i am sorry im all right moriyasan she told him i am well how are you are you well really you sound different sucre rammed the gun into her ear forcing her head over to the left she closed her eyes mr moriya she said trying to sound calm please believe me im all right what did you call for please i have to get back hot tears came to her eyes i just want know if anything anything umm happen out there umm what gives cnn say venceristas maybe to attack panama city this is true you must to get out must to go away the pressure on her ear had relaxed a little she brought her head up pushing against the gun stealing one angry glance at sucre who was staring intently at her unsmiling she blinked and sniffed the tears away ashamed at having cried well no she told moriya not right now maybe later perhaps later i cant get out now sorry she had decided she would say something not to warn but to find out she would say something about them waiting for the congressmens plane to fly over her heart pounded in her chest worse than when sucre had had his gun at her throat she started to phrase the sentence to try to say something that would get mr moriya to respond and tell her if the plane was delayed or not something which would not get her brains blown out would be a good idea too you look mr moriya said i call back when we talk together alone is too uneasy so ok i uh yes she said suddenly shaking unable to think straight the hand round the handset was aching she realised she was gripping the receiver as though she was hanging from it over a cliff goodbye hisako mr moriya said ye yes goodbye sayonara she could not control her trembling her eyes were closed the line made clicking noises somebody took the handset from her prising her fingers off she loosened them as soon as she felt the other hand on hers she opened her eyes as sucre put the handset back on its hook you did all right he told her that was ok now we go back afterwards her ears still ringing she found it all a little difficult to piece together it seemed as if things had happened in some strange disordered disjointed manner as though such violent action happened in its own microclimate of reality she was walking down the corridor still a little shaky with sucre behind her there was a hint of movement at the far aft end of the corridor where it led out of the superstructure to an outside deck she took no notice still thinking about what she might have said to moriya and feeling guilty at her relief that she hadnt had the chance to say anything and so endanger herself they were almost at the companionway leading back down to the lower decks there was a muffled shout from that end of the corridor she looked up then a shot percussive and clanging she froze sucre said something she didnt catch another shot she was pushed from behind the stairs were at her right steve orrick appeared dressed in swimming trunks holding a hand gun and an uzi from a cabin doorway right in front of her she felt her jaw drop his eyes went wide he brought the gun up pointing it over her shoulder she was struck from behind pushed against the rail at the top of the companionway almost sending her over into the stairwell she swung round and caught a glimpse of orrick grimacing clicking the trigger of the boxylooking uzi futilely sucre raised his own gun she kicked out with one foot hitting sucres rifle it blasted into the ceiling filling the metal corridor with stunning noise she had her balance back by then she chopped sucre across the neck open handed but he had started to move away it was only the second time shed ever hit somebody in anger sucre staggered looking more surprised than anything else and stumbled against the far wall orrick was fiddling with the small gun then he ducked and fired between her and sucre down towards the bridge her ears were ringing the uzi made a noise like heavy cloth ripping magnified a hundred times fire sounded down the corridor orrick leapt back into the doorway hed appeared from something tugged suddenly at the hem of the yukata she turned glanced down into the stairwell to see one of the venceristas pointing a gun at her she dived across the corridor into the cabin where orrick was it was dark blinds closed the acrid smell of powder smoke filled the place there was a dead man in the bed firing sounded behind her making her flinch orrick knelt at the door peeping out and firing she recognised the dead man it was one of the men whod guarded them during the night the one whod waved the coke bottle at bleveans he was missing most of the left side of his head and there was a huge patch of glistening darkness staining the white sheets around his midriff the noise of gunfire resounded through the cabin filling her she felt bad and had to sit down on the floor between orrick and the bed orricks broad waterspotted back filled most of the doorway the trunks had a little belt on them attached to it was a big sheathed knife she recognised his trunks remembered them from a day theyd all gone picnicking on she shook her head orrick was firing with the pistol the uzi lying at his knee she looked around the cabin the uzi magazines lay on the small table in a pile beside an open copy of hustler she grabbed them clattered them down on the floor beside orrick and nudged him she stood up the uzis ripping noise started again the side of the superstructure at this level was flush with the deck beneath but she leant over the bed and opened the blinds and looked out of the porthole to make sure she wondered if she might squeeze through and started unscrewing the wing nut securing the glass grenade orrick screamed and fell back into the cabin he tried to kick the door shut halfsucceeded it burst open again in a cloud of smoke and a blast that seemed to reverberate through every atom of hisakos body shed fallen she was lying on the warm stickiness of the dead man blood soaking into the yukata she struggled away from him the cabin ringing like a bell about her more firing behind as orrick squatted once again at the door she looked around wildeyed saw the dead mans combat jacket she took it felt its heaviness and turned it round searching the grenades were there she tore them from their velcro fastenings orrick was back at the door apparently unharmed she collapsed to her knees beside him nudging him again and offering the grenades he saw them grabbed one dropped the other still firing with his other hand he shouted something at her out she heard she felt as if she had road drills lodged in each ear she shook her head go first orrick screamed at her he looked at the grenade he held took the ring in his teeth and pulled it worked he threw it down the corridor towards the bridge picked up the other grenade from the deck and a magazine he emptied the uzi down the corridor after the first grenade then leapt out disappearing aft astonishing her a sudden increase in light from that direction then dark again and a metal door slamming instantly the grenade detonated a blast and clattering screech from forward a noise like a waterfall filled her ears she found herself sitting on the floor her head buzzed everything was going grey and watery reality dissolving in the reeking smoke and the obliterating noise she felt herself start to tip back and to the side but her arm moved in slow motion as though it moved through treacle while the rest of her body moved through air she hit the floor blinked she knew she was going to die perhaps they all were at least sucre had probably been the first the others might not know shed hit him she could see sucres face so smooth and shining the neat black fatigues not as though theyd been in the jungle jungle for weeks at all the pert little beret with its chic little red badge those black curls his face seemed to swim in and out of focus above her no beret this time curls in disarray he was looking down at her mouth twisted he reached down dragged her up he was real and alive thats it im dead she was thrown out into the corridor hit the far wall then she was pushed out into the sunlight she stood blinking in the glare blinded the aft hatches of the nadia lay below her water sparkled beyond holding the green shadow of an island sucre pushed her to the rail men were running along the aft deck to the stern of the ship they held guns at the rail she looked down along the hull of the ship a couple of men were leaning over the decks below flying down into the water towards the stern at the nadias landing stage midships a black gemini looked limp and low and crumpled in the water stern down she remembered the hunting knife on orricks trunks the men running to the stern stopped and looked over the rail every now and again pointing their guns down sometimes firing them sucre held her arm painfully far up her back forcing her on tiptoes grunting with the pain he shouted to the men at the stern of the ship they shouldered their guns and reached for their grenades she bent over the rail easing the pressure on her arm a little yes she could still see the ripples orrick must have jumped swam probably underwater as much as possible to the stern where the overhang would protect him from the guns but not from the grenades she watched them splash into the waves around the rear of the ship she looked up into the blue lightly clouded sky no sign of any plane what a nice day to die on she thought sucre was still shouting behind her men and their noise suddenly in a dozen places around the stern of the ship the water bulged and went white like a series of giant watery bruises the bruises burst fluting and climbing white stems exploding in the sunlight and falling back there was hardly any noise the ship rail under hisakos sternum vibrated with each shock sucre shouted again then there was silence she felt the sunlight on her neck and forearms could smell the distant land an insect buzzed distantly through the continual ringing in her ears orricks body floated out after a minute pale and face down spread like a parachutist in free fall the venceristas cheered and emptied their guns into the mans body making it disappear in a tiny forest of white and red splashes until sucres shouting made them stop he twisted her back round to face him he looked uninjured but shaken and dishevelled he took the pistol out of its holster she ought to do something but she couldnt there was no fight left i wont close my eyes i wont close my eyes sucre brought the pistol up to her face up to her eye pressed it forward she closed her eyes the guns muzzle pressed on to her eyelid forcing her head back she could see a halo of light against the brownblack like an image of the gun barrel and the twisted hole the bullet would travel the gun was taken away a slap jerked her head one way then another her head sang another instrument in the orchestra of internal noise that was crowding into her skull she opened her eyes sucre was standing grinning in front of her yeah youre pretty cool señorita he told her he flourished the pistol it glinted in the sunlight you a man id kill you he reholstered the gun glanced to the stern of the ship took a deep breath and whistled woo that was something huh she swallowed a little blood and nodded then the sound of rapid automatic gunfire came through the open door behind them from down inside the ship salvages she stood confronting her fear at last everything had led up to this it had been forever coming closer like a distant storm and now it had arrived and she was powerless and weak wallowing without way in the face of the dread shed tried and tried to confront but with which she had never been able to connect in school once in a physics class shed tried to push two very strong magnets together north against north and south against south and sweated and gritted her teeth and braced her arms against the bench and watched her straining quivering hands push the big ushaped lumps of metal together constantly trying to stop them glancing away sliding to one side struggling to twist out of her grasp and felt her strength going and so finally putting everything into one last explosive burst of effort and shouted out as she did so as if screaming the targeted part of the body in a kendo thrust the magnets slid across each other writhing in her hands like something alive clunking one south pole against one north the other ends of each u sticking out so that she was left holding a solid sshaped piece of metal it took an even greater effort than that shed just made to stop herself throwing the magnet down to the floor or just slamming it into the wooden bench top but she put the gunmetal lump down quietly and dropped her head a little as though saluting a victorious opponent it had been the same with her fear she had tried to force it to a confrontation to pin it down to wrestle with it but it had always twisted away wriggled mightily even as she tried to grapple with it and sunk back into the usual shape of her life so now she stood in narita airport waiting with the rest of the nhk orchestra to board the jal bound for los angeles shed sat in the departure lounge with some of the others chatting nervously and drinking tea and watching the clock on the wall and glancing all the time at her wristwatch stroking the new leather bag shed bought for the trip trying to make the cold tangle of cramp in her belly go away the others knew she hadnt flown before and that she was afraid they joked with her tried to take her mind off it but she could not stop thinking about the plane the fragile aluminium tube of its body the screaming engines encasing fire the wings that flexed heavy with fuel the wheels that it was that moment the visual instant when the spinning wheels left the ground and the aircraft tilted its nose to the sky and rose that sank her she could think no further she had watched that moment on television and in movies many times and could see that there was indeed a slowmotion grace about it and could quite happily admire the plane makers and the pilots skill and know that the same manoeuvre was completed thousands of times each hour throughout the world but the thought of being on one of those delicately huge contraptions as it lifted itself into the air still saturated her with terror it made her bones ache the others talked to her one of the younger men in the orchestra told her hed been scared of flying at first but then had looked into the statistics did she know he said that you were far more likely to die in a car crash than in a plane but not when youre in a plane she wanted to scream at him chizu and yayoi her flatmates who were also in the orchestra string section talked of a previous trip to the states when theyd been students how vast it was and how beautiful yosemite the mohave the redwoods a single state like a whole country sprawling and empty and unmissable even before the rockies and the grand canyon the fertile wasteland of the wheatfields from flat horizon to flat horizon like an ocean of grain the colours of a new england fall and the dizzy verticals of manhattan unmissable not to be missed she must not miss it the hands of the clock swept on impossibly thin wings the time came she stood with the rest clutching her new leather bag they went to the tunnel she lifted the bag up cradling it tightly in her arms it smelled luxurious and sweet and comforting she saw the plane outside in the sunlight massive secure anchoredlooking it was linked to the terminal at nose and tail by the fitted collars of the access jetties and fuel hoses looped under its wings from tanker trucks at one side a catering vehicles raised body stood perched on an x of struts over the braced chassis its platform extended to an open door in the aircrafts side tall thin trolleys were being wheeled from truck to plane by two men in bright red overalls a squat flat truck sat under the s bulbous nose fixed there with a thick yellow towbar various other vehicles scurried like toys about the poised bulk of the big plane squires and armourers to the impassive warriorking above them being readied to join battle with the oceanic air she moved towards the tunnel her legs felt as if somebody else was operating them the leather bag smelled of animal death she wished shed taken the pills the doctor had prescribed she wished shed got drunk she wished shed told them at the start she wouldnt be able to go abroad with the orchestra she wished shed turned down the job she wished she was somebody else or somewhere else she wished for a broken leg or a ruptured appendix anything to stop her having to board the plane the tunnel finished her the smell of fuel the sound of an engine the quiet flow of people in the windowless corridor tipping towards the corner that led to the plane itself she stopped letting people go past her staring ahead chizu and yayoi stopped too in front of her talking to her but she couldnt hear what they were saying they touched her guided her to the side of the corridor where she stood shivering in a cold sweat smelling that fuel smell and hearing the increasing whine of the engines and feeling the list in the floor tipping her towards the craft the people were filing into and she could not think and could not believe this was happening to her so well it had all gone so well shed fitted in shed made friends shed enjoyed the concerts and hadnt been very nervous apart from the very first one and recording could be boring but you could switch off to some extent nobody expected to do their most inspired work after thirty takes she had money and a new cello and her mother was proud of her her life looked set and certain and her future bright and exciting and shed wondered what could go wrong because she was used to things balancing out and this was it what was ironic was that the balancing disaster came from inside where she was most vulnerable shed never needed to develop the spurious justifications and excuses or the fragile egoprops and unlikely hopes so many other people had to construct to cope with their lives shed lived with some inner certainty that they hadnt had safe inside defences turned outwards weapons trained beyond her immediate space and now she was suffering for her hubris they did get her on to the plane eventually mr yano the orchestras tour manager and mr okamoto the leader of the orchestra came to talk to her and gently guided her down the rubber slope between the metal corrugations of the white walls to the open door of the plane where stewardesses waited and the plane was big and full of bright seats inside and the thick door sat a curved slab against the bulge of the planes skin she was shaking they took her inside she wanted to scream instead she moaned went down on her haunches and curled up around her bag as though trying to press herself inside it and hide and crying into her folded elbows her hands gripping the top of her head she was being stupid she had to act sensibly she had to think of the others in the orchestra what would her mother say her cello was already on board there were three hundred passengers waiting on her an entire plane america think of that all those great cities the thousands of people waiting her ticket had been paid for all her tickets paid for hotel rooms reserved programmes printed it was unheard of to be so selfish so selfobsessed she knew all this all these things had convinced her over the months since the tour had been announced and the various arrangements made that when it came to it she would find it simply unthinkable that she could turn round and not go of course it would be appalling disgraceful unutterably contemptuous of everybody else in the orchestra irredeemably selfcentred she was grown up now and some things just had to be done fears had to be conquered everybody was relying on her expecting her to behave like everybody else like any normal person that wasnt much to ask she knew all that it didnt help it meant nothing a set of irrelevant symbols in a language that was not the reverberating note of her fear mere scrawls on a page pitched against the resonating physical chord of terror they tried to lift her but she thought they were going to drag her to a seat and belt her in join her to this hollow machine which smelled of jet fuel and hot food and she cried then dropping the leather bag and clutching at somebody and pleading with them please no she was letting everybody down please dont she was behaving like a child im sorry im sorry i cant a spoiled child a spoiled foreign child please dont do this to me a gaijin brat tantrumming for cookies please dont she would be in disgrace please she was led out eventually up the welcoming slope of the jetty back to the lounge again then to the restroom a jal ground staff lady comforted her the plane was delayed by half an hour she would not leave the restroom until it had taken off alternate feelings of relief and guilty dread flowed through her in the taxi back to the tiny apartment she shared with chizu and yayoi it was over the ordeal had finally ended but at such a cost what shame she had brought upon herself and the others in the orchestra she would be sacked she ought to resign now she would could she ever look any of them in the face again she thought not she went home that night setting off for the station and hokkaido with the bag shed bought for the trip and had almost left on the plane and then almost left in the restroom a beautiful bag in soft natural glove leather still containing her virginal passport and a guide to the united states and as she sat redeyed and miserable on the train heading north through the night her friends her workmates would be somewhere over the north pacific just then she thought crossing the date line defying the sun and gaining a day while she lost her career she looked down at the glowing pale brown skin of the bag and noticed the deep dark dots marring its silky surface and could not brush them off and realised with another twist in the deepening spiral of her selfinflicted dejection that the marks were her own produced by her tears sucre looked wideeyed at her for a second she stared back the firing deep inside the ship went on sucre grabbed her hand spun her round in front of him and threw her through the door back into the corridor hed bundled her out of minutes earlier down he shouted ramming the rifle into her back making her run she halffell down the stairs sucre clattering behind her the firing stopped beneath them as they went down the next companionway grey smoke drifted from the doorway of the nadias saloon into the corridor she could hear crying and shouts sucre screamed at her to keep going the gun hit her in the lower back again the saloon was thick with acrid stinging smoke bodies lay amongst the plush chairs and couches like obscene scatter cushions she was standing behind one of the venceristas he was shouting waving his gun around another vencerista stood behind the bar heavy machinegun poised smoke curling from it she looked at the bodies the ringing in her ears made it difficult to hear things but she thought somebody was calling her name the bodies covered much of the floor almost from end to end of the room a few of the darkskinned men were still at the far end standing there with their hands behind their heads looking cowed and terrified hisako she heard her name and raised her head it was philippe she was shoved towards him anyway pushed in the back so that she had no choice but to move and so ran across the bloody carpet stumbled over bodies to him he hugged her mumbled in french into her hair but the ringing noise smothered all his words sucre was shouting at the other two venceristas then he ran down the length of the saloon and screamed at the moroccan and algerian men standing there he slapped one punched another in the belly and clubbed a third with his rifle sending the man crumpling to the deck more venceristas piled in through the door waving their guns sucre kicked one of the algerians in the leg making the man hop about trying to keep his balance while not moving his hands from the back of his head sucre kicked him in the other leg making him fall over hisako hisako philippe said she leant her head on his shoulder and looked through the room at sucre kicking the curled up algerian lying on the floor near the far wall at mandamus squatting beneath an upended chair bulging out from under it like a snail too big for its shell at broekman lying on the floor looking up now at janney and the bleveans captain bleveans holding his wifes head down near the floor at the side of the couch the motionless janney lay upon at endo sitting back against the wall crosslegged like a slimline buddha hisako these men were very stupid sucre shrieked at them waving his gun at the moroccans and algerians they died see he kicked one of the bodies on the floor they werent all dead hisako could hear moans this what you want sucre shouted this what you want they died like that stupid gringo kid out there hisako wondered if anyone of the people sucre was shouting at would realise he meant orrick you want this do you you want to die is that what you want huh is it he seemed really to want an answer bleveans said no sir in a calm measured voice sucre looked at him took a deep breath he nodded yeah well we been kind too long you get tied up now bleveans and philippe tried to argue but it did no good they were all made to sit down three venceristas covered them while sucre disappeared for five minutes he came back with a box full of plastic restrainers loops of toothed nylon which fitted over their wrists and were pulled tight sucre and one of the other venceristas started with the remaining algerians and moroccans hisako watched they had to put their hands behind their backs first before the restrainers were put on philippe tried to talk to her but one of the venceristas hissed at him when he spoke and shook his head philippe held hisakos hand a third guerrilla was dragging the bodies away taking them by feet or hands and hauling them out through the door she was sure that even over the ringing in her ears she could hear moans as the algerians and moroccans were pulled out the vencerista was away for few minutes each time she wondered if they were just dumping the bodies over the side but doubted it she sat on the lounge carpet trying to assess how she felt jangly as though her body was some assemblage of delicately balanced highly stressed components which had been roughly shaken and left ringing with the aftereffects of shock her face stung a little on both cheeks where sucre had slapped her she tasted blood in her mouth but not very much and she couldnt find where it was coming from the atmosphere in the saloon seemed thicker now the air tasted of smoke and blood and the place looked old and wornout already grubby after just one night she felt herself shiver in the yukata though she wasnt cold comrade major bleveans said to sucre after the vencerista had tied up the koreans in the middle of the room and approached the others leave the woman huh sucre looked down at bleveans who gazed as calmly back sucre smiled faintly mrs bleveans sat curled up between her husband and the couch where janney lay eyes open again and blinking confusedly up at the ceiling sucre had one of the nylon restrainers in his hand he played with it twisting it around his hand as though he was tossing a coin bleveans put his hands out towards sucre wrists together will you sucre took hold of both bleveanss hands in one of his and pulled the american round as though pirouetting a dance partner when sucre let go bleveans brought first one hand then the other round behind him sucre slipped a restrainer over his wrists and pulled it tight he put his mouth near bleveanss ear and said say please captain please comrade major bleveans said evenly sucre turned away expressionless he looked down at gordon janney lying with his eyes halfopen under the bulky bandages but moving and his lips working like somebody having a bad dream sucre used two of the restrainers to secure one of the mans ankles to the arm of the couch he ignored mrs bleveans philippe let himself be tied sucre looked at hisako for a moment rubbing the side of his neck where shed hit him earlier she wondered what he was going to do maybe he would tie her up after all sucre grabbed her right ankle pulled her towards him a halfmetre or so across the carpet su comrade major philippe began sucre took hold of his ankle too he put one nylon loop round philippes leg and put a fully opened restrainer round hisakos then passed one through the other and tightened them leaving her and philippe hobbled to each other broekman let himself be tied up without comment comrade major this really is unnecessary mandamus said he was sweating heavily and a tic jigged at the side of his face i am no threat to you i am not of a shape or size to crawl through portholes or engage in other acts of derringdo and while i may not agree with all the venceristass methods i am broadly on your side please let me ask you to shut up or i tape your mouth too sucre said he secured mandamus then endo who was already sitting quietly with his hands behind his back he left marie boulard with her hands free too this was stupid sucre told them when hed finished he put his boot under the last body left on the floor and turned it over the vencerista taking the bodies out came back into the saloon sucre nodded to him and he dragged that corpse away as well adding another smear of blood to the patterned carpet sucre looked at hisako i want to know who the blond kid was he glanced at bleveans but his gaze settled back on her she looked down at the shaped nylon bands shackling her to philippe steve orrick she said she had to repeat the name she explained who hed been the others confirmed what she said when sucre asked he seemed to believe them ok he told them this time we good to you ok he looked round them as though wanting to be contradicted ok you stay like that till we go uh what about using the heads comrade major bleveans asked sucre looked amused you just have to get help captain we werent being allowed into the heads with anybody else bleveans reminded him sucre shrugged too bad how much longer you going to keep us here comrade major bleveans asked sucre just smiled the vencerista behind the bar was counting used cartridges into a series of beer glasses the chink chink noise formed a background like the sound of coins being dropped into a till they were allowed to talk quietly theyd been split into more distinct groups the officers and passengers formed one the remaining moroccans and algerians the smallest and the koreans the largest the rest were lumped together into another they could talk with people in their own group but werent allowed to communicate with another as soon as they heard the shooting they were talking and some started to rise get up philippe told her when she asked what had happened they must have planned for a time before i think it was as if they would go then but they did not and the man with the machinegun shouted at them at all of us but then when the firing stopped that was when they jump up and run towards the gun philippe took a long breath closed his eyes she put her hand to his neck stroked him his eyes opened and he took her hand smiling ruefully was not very nice they fell he shook his head fall everywhere is big machinegun he looked towards the bar big bullets on a chain so he just shoots and shoots and shoots his hand clenched almost crushing hers she tensed her own hand the saloon was quiet it was late afternoon the heat just waning the thick atmosphere in the lounge sat like a weight on them all the bloodmatted carpet gave off a rich iron smell some people were trying to sleep propped up against seats and couches or lying on the floor shifting uncomfortably trying to move their trapped arms and ease the ache in their shoulders mandamuss snores sounded vaguely plaintive maybe philippe said looking over at the bar if we all had run en masse maybe we take the gun but we did not we did not run together he turned to her and hisako had never seen him look like he did then younger than he was almost boyish and somehow lost adrift she had told him more details of what had happened after the call from mr moriya the rest had been given only a brief account of orricks vain attempt to help them philippe had been admiring and chiding impressed that she had dared lash out at sucre but concerned for her safety they were at the mercy of these people after all shed listened to the men talk the feeling now was that there was nothing they could do they would just have to wait and hope that whatever the venceristas had come here to do would soon be over with the guerrillas had shown themselves quite able to deal with both the lone commando and the mass attack to attempt anything now when they were keyed up after these two incidents would be suicidal so they had convinced themselves breathing the air of the nadias lounge with its scent of smoke and blood nobody talked about the planeload of congressmen except to say that there was probably some other reason for the venceristas to want to take over the ships the disturbed siestas went on into the late afternoon sunlight made barshapes through the blinds behind the curtains gordon janney mumbled something in what might have been his sleep it was becoming difficult to determine when he was awake and when not as though his brain confused into accepting any sort of stability was trying to average out his awareness over the whole day and night leaving the man aground on the same dozy level of semiconsciousness all the time the cartridges went chink chink chink philippe was talking quietly to bleveans and broekman hisako sat against a chair trying to recall each second between the time shed first seen orrick that morning and her last view of him floating face down body jerked by bullets the water white around him they had heard the grenades in here philippe said you ok mrs bleveans knelt in front of hisako her face looked haggard the last traces of makeup producing an effect worse than none at all hisako nodded yes she thought more was expected of her but she couldnt think what else to say her ears still werent right you sure the american woman said frowning a little hisako thought mrs bleveans had never looked more human she wanted to say that but she couldnt hisako nodded again really yes mrs bleveans patted her leg you get some rest she moved back to her husband then went over to marie boulard hisako listened to the ringing in her ears and the chink chink chink noise coming from the bar like a currency of death her head nodded jerked back up the noises around her sounded far away and somehow hollow she wanted to move her leg but she couldnt there was a stairway underneath the ship they were led down through the vessel past holds full of plants and gardens and huge rooms full of furniture through another hold where hundreds of cars sat engines droning horns sounding drivers leaning out of the windows and doors with big red faces shouting and cursing and waving their fists in the air beneath that came a dark space full of rods and levers and strange sickly smells she couldnt make out who she was with or who was leading them but that was probably because the light was bad she thought she was probably dreaming but dreams were real too and sometimes what wasnt a dream was too real too much for reality to support too much for her to cope with a dream could actually be more real and that was good enough for her under the ship the air was stifling and humid it was like walking into a thick blanket soaked in something thick and warm the surface of the lake was red glass and supported above the undulating dark floor of the lake by enormous grotesquely gnarled red pillars they looked like immense waxsmothered bottles holders of a thousand gigantic candles each of which had burned down and left its solidified flow behind one of the pillars supported the ship they were descending from the steps ended on the dark ash of the lake floor it was difficult to walk in and they were all struggling she looked up through the glass there was a hole there burned as though the glass was plastic and saw steven orrick painting the bows of the le cercle standing on a little wooden plank he was working very slowly as though in a trance and didnt notice the people underneath him some of the people with her let little fluttering balloons go releasing them like doves they beat nervously up through the air past the great red pillars through the melted hole in the glass and up towards the young man painting the hull around the nakodos name the balloons got bigger as they rose and when they got to orrick they were larger than he was they spread their wings and wrapped themselves round him he dropped the brush dropped the paint tin and was held there on the little wooden plank gripped by first one then two then many of the expanded balloons which nestled tighter and tighter in with their wings and then soundlessly burst apart blowing out in a scattering of white feathers that rained slowly down while orricks shrivelled body fell cartwheeling lazily from the bows and crashed through the red lake surface he fell in a hail of quick red glass and slow white feathers where the paint tin had fallen against the bow of the ship it had left a long streak of red lead over one of the letters of the ships name so that the letters now spelled out nada she didnt see where orrick landed the air was full of white feathers the lake surface healed up where hed fallen through at the end of the lake where the dam had been the surface ended abruptly above them while the lake floor continued out into the open air down the course of a long dry river she felt glad to be back and to have left the other people behind above her the milky clouds let through a diffuse glow of sunlight the clouds had a grid written on them dark lines stretching northsouth and eastwest she walked the dry black dust passing shattered and deserted buildings in the distance to each side and watched the grid of the sky gradually fill up with huge circular shapes they occupied the interstices of the grid some were dark like the ash beneath her feet and some were milky like the clouds themselves and hardly visible just giant halos of light in the sky it became darker as more of the huge shapes floated down into place dna said the shapes this must be going on everywhere she thought like a giant game of go light and dark everywhere she wondered who would win she wanted the lightcoloured ones to win they appeared to be winning she walked on noticing that the city around her seemed to be growing the buildings were less wrecked and not as far apart as they had been the sky was lightening again as the milky shapes above surrounded and took over the dark ones the city was crowding in now buildings creaking upwards into the sky as she watched there were people as well they were small and still far away but they moved about the grid of the city beneath the towering stretching buildings the sky was milky the sky was clear the skywide circles had taken over the sky a terrific wind started up and howled round the buildings as the sky became brighter and the sunlight slammed down she kept walking but saw everybody else swept away and whirled into the air fluttering whitely the sun glinted through one of the great lenses in the sky dimmed briefly then flared exploded blinding her and wrapping a cloak of heat across her face when she opened her eyes the buildings had melted and stood as pillars over the grey ash beneath her feet supporting a sky of cracked red glass like something old and fused and smeared with blood the grey ash shuddered sending a tremor up through her feet shaking her the sky called her name she woke to find philippe shaking her shoulder sucre stood at her feet kicking them looking bored in one hand he held a large knife in the other her cello case her eyes widened she sat up sucre put the knife in its sheath and hefted his assault rifle the plastic restrainer joining hisako to philippe had been cut she was free sucre jerked his head towards the door you come with me we go to a concert conquistadores they took her across to the nakodo in le cercles gemini the one she and philippe used on their dives the sunlight was bright on the water through the patchy cloud and she hugged her cello case to her gaining some distant comfort from its leather smell sucre sat in the bows facing her mirror shades showing the cello case her and the vencerista at the outboard there was a small thin smile on his face he hadnt answered any of her questions about why they were heading for the nakodo with the cello he kept the kalashnikov pointed at her the whole way across she wondered what would happen if she threw the cello case at him would it stop the bullets she didnt think so he would probably puncture the gemini if the gun went off on automatic maybe he would even hit the vencerista at the stern but her own chances of surviving would be small she imagined nevertheless throwing it at him leaping after it sucre somehow missing it and her her grabbing his gun perhaps knocking him overboard though how to do that without losing the gun strapped round his shoulders or just knocking him unconscious still getting the gun from him in time to turn and fire before the man in the stern could reach for and fire his own machinegun yes and she could swim away from the probably sinking gemini using the cello case as a life raft and rescue all the others or get word to the outside world and everything would be just fine she swallowed heavily as though consuming the wildness of the idea her heart beat hard thudding against the cello case she wondered how often people had been in such a situation not knowing what was going to happen to them but so full of fearful hope and hopeless fear they went along with whatever their captors were arranging praying it would end without bloodshed lost in some pathetic human trust that no terrible harm was being prepared for them how many people had been woken by the hammering at the door in the small hours and had gone perhaps protesting but otherwise meekly to their deaths perhaps they went quietly to protect their family perhaps because they could not believe that what was happening to them was anything could be anything other than a terrible mistake had they known their family too was doomed had they known they were themselves already utterly condemned and without hope destined inevitably for a bullet in the neck within hours or for years even decades of toil and suffering in the camps before a cold and disregarded death they might have resisted then at the start when they still had a chance however futile their resistance might finally be but few resisted from what she knew hope was endemic and sometimes reality implied despair how could you believe even in the cattle trucks that what had been the most civilised nation on earth was preparing to take you all of you the entire trainload and strip you remove and sort artificial limbs glasses clothes and wigs and jewellery gas you by the hundreds in a production line of death and then pull the gold teeth from your skull how it was the stuff of nightmares not reality it was too terrible to be true even a people inured over the centuries to prejudice and persecution must have found it hard to believe it could really be happening in the west in the twentieth century and the doctor or engineer or politician or worker in moscow or kiev or leningrad roused from sleep by the fists on the door without knowing he was already dead as far as the state was concerned who could blame him for going quietly hoping to impress with his cooperation to save his wife and children which maybe he did nervously confident in his knowledge that hed done nothing wrong and had always supported the party and the great leader was it any surprise he quietly packed a small case and kissed his wifes tears away promising to be back soon the kampucheans had quit the city seeing some warped logic in it at first thinking it best to humour the men from the jungle how could they have known how could they have taken seriously the idea the glasses on their noses would bring the iron rods down on them smashing them to bits consigning them to mud even knowing what was going to happen perhaps you still hoped or just could not believe it was really going to happen to you in in their times chile argentina nicaragua el salvador panama she looked away from her reflections on sucres smiling face the distant land was green and squashed perhaps help would come from there maybe orrick had succeeded in a way somebody ashore might have heard the shots and explosions as they killed him the national guard would come and the venceristas would flee leaving their hostages alive it would be absurd to kill any more wouldnt it international opinion outcry condemnation retaliation she hugged the case closer felt herself shiver the rectangular bulk of the nukodo filled the sky in front of her blocking off the sun she followed sucre up the steps from the landing pontoon still holding the cello in its case in front of her another vencerista met them on the deck and led them into the ship she was ushered into the officers mess the curtains were drawn two lights shone from the far end of the messroom table she could just make out a figure sitting there a chair was drawn up a metre or so from the end of the table nearest her sucre motioned her to sit there then went to the vaguely seen figure sitting behind the lights she screwed her eyes up peering forward the lights were anglepoise lamps sitting on the table shining straight at her the airconditioned room made her shiver again making her wish she wore something more substantial than just the yukata ms onoda sucre said from behind the lights she shielded her eyes the jefe wants you to play for him she stayed as she was there was silence until she said what does he want me to play she saw sucre bend to the other man come upright again anything what you want she thought about it even asking whether she had a choice seemed pointless she could ask for her music and so delay things but she could see no good reason for doing so she would rather do this and get back as soon as she could to philippe and the others wondering who the man behind the lights was and why he wanted to keep his identity secret seemed just as useless she sighed opened the case and took out the cello and bow laying down the case it will take a little while to tune it she said adjusting the spike to the right height for the small seat then drawing the cello to her feeling it between her thighs and against her breasts and neck is ok sucre told her as she drew the bow across the strings the a string was a little flat she brought it into line with the others closing her eyes and listening she had always visualised tuning in her mind the sound was a single vibrant line of colour a column in the air changing like oil on water but always coherent and somehow solid if one shade jarred from an edge like a badly printed colour photograph it had to be refocused brought back into line the cello sang hummed against her the column of colour behind her eyes was bright and definite she checked fingering through a few exercises finding her knuckles and joints were less stiff than shed feared she opened her eyes again this is tung lois song of leaving she told the lights no reaction it wasnt a classical piece and she wondered if perhaps her shy captor would object to a modern work but the jefe behind the lights said nothing perhaps he didnt know enough to comment or perhaps he knew the piece and approved it was what had come to be known as new classical part of the melodic fin de siècle reaction against mathematical atonality she bent to the instrument closing her eyes slowly with the first broad sweep of the bow that was the awakening of the woman and the dawning of the day the piece would sing about technically it was a fairly undemanding piece but the emotion it called for to wring all that could be wrung from the music made it difficult to perform without sounding either offhand or pretentious she wasnt sure herself why shed chosen it shed practised it over the months since leaving japan and it sounded full and good in its solo form but the same went for other pieces and this was one she had never been convinced she had done justice to in the past she ceased to wonder about it and forgot about the lights and the man behind them and the gun at sucres waist and the people trapped and trussed on the nadia and simply played submerging herself in the silky depths of the musics hope and sorrow when it was over and the last notes died finally giving themselves up to the air to the flesh of her fingertips and to the ancient wood of the instrument she kept her eyes closed for a time still in her deep red cave of heartache and loss there were strange patterns behind her eyelids swimming and pulsing to the strong beat of her blood the music seemed to have set them into a theme of movement of its own and they were only now unravelling into their natural semichaos she watched them clap clap clap the sudden sound of applause shook her she opened her eyes quickly a glimpse of white hands clapping in the light before they pulled back the figure moved to one side towards sucre and he started clapping too matching the other man sucre nodded vigorously glancing from her to the man in the seat beside him clap clap clap the applause subsided stopped hisako sat blinking in the light sucre le ant towards the man beautiful sucre said straightening thank you she relaxed let the bow tip touch the carpet would he want more sucre bent again then said señorita please turn round face the other way she stared then turned awkwardly with the cello shifting the seat looked back at the door to the corridor outside why she thought surely not to shoot me do i play for him then obediently perform this last gesture which will make the killing of me easier for them light flared behind her she stiffened ok sucre said easily turn back now she pivoted on the seat taking the cello round in front of her the red glowing end of a cigar glowed dimly behind the lights a cloud of smoke drifted in front of the beams further obscuring the view behind she smelled sulphur the jefe wants to know what you were thinking of when you play this piece sucre said she thought conscious of her frown and of looking away from the lights into the darkness seeking her answer there i thought of leaving of leaving japan of leaving she hesitated then knew there was no point in pretending i thought of leaving the people on the ship the nadia she had meant to say one person or someone on the ship but something had deflected her even as shed spoken though she knew that sucre already knew about philippe even in these tiny hopeless increments do we try to protect those we love she thought and looked up into the lights i thought of leaving life of this being my last chance to play she drew herself up straight in the seat thats what i thought of she heard the man behind the lights draw in his breath perhaps he nodded sucre drew up a seat and sat down by the other man the jefe wants to know what you think of us it was as though one of the lights was talking of the venceristas si she wondered what was the right thing to say but they would know shed try to say the right thing so what was the point of it she shrugged looked down at the cello fingered the strings i dont know i dont know everything that you stand for after a pause freedom for the people of panama eventually a greater columbia cutting the puppet strings of the yanquis well that might be good she said not looking up silence from the far end of the table the coal of the cigar glowed brightly for a moment i am not a politician she said i am a musician anyway this is not my fight im sorry she looked up we all just want to get out alive the cigar coal dipped towards sucre she heard a deep voice smoky as though it had taken on some of the character of the pungent blue fumes it passed through on its way to her but the yanquis forced you to open up your country yes the american navy made you trade she sensed sucre lean close to the other man again heard the rumble of his voice once more and then less than a century later they nuke you the cigar coal was out to one side she could just see it under the glare of the lefthand light and she could imagine the seated figure arm on an arm of the chair huh sucre said that has all happened she said we she struggled to find the words to describe a century and a half of the most radical change any country had ever undergone we had strengths in our isolation but it could not persist for ever when we were forced to change we changed and found new strengths or new expressions of the old ones we tried too much we tried to fit ourselves to the peoples outside behave the way they did we defeated china and russia and the world was amazed and amazed too that we treated our prisoners so well then we became arrogant perhaps and thought we could take on america and treat the foreign devils as less than human so we were treated the same way it was wrong but we were too since then we have flourished we have sadnesses but she sighed again looking down at the strings resting her fingers on them imagining the chord she was producing we can have few complaints the lights still blazed the cigar was centred again and bright you think the people on the other ship support us sucre said after a pause they want to live she said maybe some want you to succeed maybe some dont they all want to live that is stronger a noise that might have been a hmm smoke billowed like a sail into the twin cones of light and flowed across the table in a slowly fluid tumble will you play in america sucre said after europe i said i would think about it i may she wondered how much the man behind the lights was taking in she wasnt choosing her words to make them easy you play for the yanquis sucre said sounding amused id swear i wouldnt if it would make any difference to you definite amusement from the far end of the table the rumbling voice again we dont ask that señorita sucre said laughing what do you ask sucre waited for the low voice then said we ask that you should play another the lights flickered and went out some tone in the ship never noticed because always there altered whined down the lights came on dimly for a moment then faded slowly filaments passing through yellow to orange to red the same colour as the cigar they went out the emergency lights came on from the corners of the room filling the mess with a flat neon glow she was looking at a man in olive fatigues square shoulders square face for a second she thought he was bald then saw he had blond hair crew cut his eyes were glittering blue she saw sucre stand quickly there was noise from behind her and the door opened a voice behind her said jefe then trailed off frozen the scene seemed cardboard and drained of colour almost monochromatic sucre moved uncertainly towards her the man holding the cigar raised it to thin lips under a thin blond moustache the red glow brought colour to his face the voice behind her made a throatclearing noise jefe the jefe looked steadily at hisako the deep voice rumbled sucre check out the engine room if somebodys made a mistake with that generator i want to see him sucre nodded and left quickly the man at the door must still have been there she saw the jefe look above and behind her raising his eyebrows fractionally and giving just the slightest inclination of his head si said the voice the door closed and she felt alone alone with the jefe the blond man sighed looked at the end of his cigar he tapped a couple of centimetres of ash into an ashtray on the table directly in front of him havana he said holding the cigar up for a moment he studied the end again you can tell the quality of the cigar well by the leaf but also by how much ash itll support he rolled the cigar round in his fingers for a few seconds rolled between the thighs of señoritas he smiled at her and smoked he reached down to his waist pulled out an automatic pistol and laid it gently on the table beside the ashtray he looked at her dont be alarmed maam he put one hand on the gun running his fingers over the barrel and stock looking at it his hands were broad largefingered yet he touched the gun with a sort of delicacy colt nineteeneleven aone he said his voice filling the room bassy and full she imagined cigar tar in his lungs vocal cords scarred by smoke the cello seemed to feel his voice responding the large hands stroked the pistol again still a damn fine gun after all these years this is a seventythree model he raised his eyes to her not as old as your cello though i guess she swallowed no not by two and a half centuries yeah he seemed amused leant back in the chair that much huh he sat nodding the cigar smoke made a ragged rising line in the air she wanted to ask if she was dead now if seeing him was her sentence and the light her executioner but she could not she bit her lips looked down at the cello strings again she tried to finger a silent chord but her hand was shaking too much you played real good miss onoda the deep voice shook her a sympathetic frequency to her trembling hands thank you she whispered maam he said quietly she didnt look up but had the feeling hed leant closer i dont want you to worry it wasnt my intention you should see me but now you have all it means is you cant go back to the others until our job here is finished his elbows were on the table between the lamps straddling the ashtray and gun his eyes disappeared behind a veil of smoke i dont want you to worry none see oh she said looking straight at him fine i wont he gave a throaty laugh damn sucre said you were cool miss onoda i see what the man meant now he laughed again the seat creaked as he sat back in it id just love to know what you thought was going on here you know that strikes me you might have all sorts of ideas none worth repeating the trembling in her hands was subsiding she could finger a chord no id really like to know she shrugged one chord to another the change made just so what if i said nothing you say to me makes any difference the voice seemed to rise a little as though stretching my job is to outthink people maam and i seriously suspect i outthought you some time ago so why not she heard the indrawn breath could see the cigar glow reflected just tell me what you think the hand waved the cigar around never far from the lying gun cant be worse than what i already think you think all the people whod gone meekly all the people whod gone weakly now i am dead she thought well it had to happen she looked into the blue eyes put the bow down to one side let the cello down to the carpet on the other and put her hands together on her lap she said you are american no reaction the man like a still photograph caught in the light you are here because of the plane and the congressmen i couldnt see why the venceristas wanted to shoot down the plane it would be madness the whole world would despise them it would be an opportunity for the us fleet to retaliate the marines to come in there would be no sense to it but for you for the cia it might be a worthwhile sacrifice it was said the words seemed to dry her mouth as they were spoken but they came out blossomed like flowers in the cold smoky air of the room you had us all fooled she added still trying to save the others nobody imagined youd shoot down your own plane steve orrick was fooled the young man your men grenaded to death oh yeah shame about that the blond man looked concerned boy showed promise he thought he was doing the right thing for america cant blame him for that the jefe shrugged his shoulders moving like a great wave gathering falling there are always casualties thats the way it is and the people on the plane the man looked at her for a long time then nodded slowly well he said putting the hand holding the cigar slowly through his cropped hair massaging his scalp theres a long and honourable tradition of shooting down commercial airliners miss onoda the israelis did it back in oh early seventies i believe egyptian plane over sinai kal was chalked up to the russians and we downed an airbus over the persian gulf back in eightyeight an italian plane probably took a nato missile in an exercise by mistake back in the seventies too not to mention terrorist bombs he shrugged these things have to happen sometimes hisako looked down again i saw a banner once on television she said from england many years ago outside an american missile base the banner said take the toys from the boys he laughed that the way you see it miss onoda the men to blame that simple she shrugged just a thought he laughed again hell i hope were here a while yet miss onoda i want to talk to you he stroked the gun tapped the cigar on the edge of the ashtray but did not dislodge the grey cone i hope youll play for me again too she thought for a moment then bent down and took up the bow from where it lay on the carpet and holding an end in each hand and thinking this is stupid why am i doing this she snapped it in two the wood gave like a rifle shot the horsehair held the pieces together she threw the broken bow down the table towards him it skidded to a halt between the darkened lights clunking against the ashtray and the gun where his hand was already hovering he looked at the shattered wood for a moment then took it slowly in the hand that had gone for the colt lifting the dark splintered bow up one end dangling by the length of horsehair hmm he said the door behind her opened one of the others came in hurrying to the far end of the table only glancing at her then leaning to speak to the blond man she caught enough aeroplano and mañana he stood taking up the colt she watched the gun i dont know she told herself calmly how do you prepare how does anybody ever prepare when it actually happens you can never find out ask an ancestor the blond man tall close to two metres whispered something to the soldier whod given him the message the background noise in the room altered increased humming the lights flickered on off then on again flooding the room with brilliance outlining the two men she was waiting to see what else the whisper was about too late to take advantage of any surprise caused by the lights always too late the other man nodded reached into a pocket he came round behind her while the jefe smiled down smoking his cigar he took the cello case from where it leant against one bulkhead the soldier behind her took her wrists put something small and hard round them and pulled it tight the blond man took her cello and gently placed it in the case take miss onoda back to her ship will you he said the soldier pulled her to her feet the jefe nodded his crewcut head dandridge he told her earl dandridge he handed the closed cello case to the soldier nice meeting you miss onoda safe journey back it was at the airport she killed a manafter the fiasco with the american tour and after a few tearful days with her mother unable to go out unwilling to see any of her old friends she went back to tokyo took out her savings and went on holiday travelling by train and bus and ferry through the country staying in ryokans whenever she could the land steadied her with its masses and textures and simple scale the distance from one place to the next the quiet relaxed formality of the old traditional inns slowly soothed her the body fell to the muddy trampled grass eyes still startled while the feet pounded and the cries rang and the sound of a jet landing shattered the air above them his legs kicked once she took the shinkonsen to kyoto watching the sea and the land whizz by as the bullet train sang down the steel rails heading south and west in that old city she was a tourist walking quietly through the network of streets visiting temples and shrines in the hills at nanzenji temple she sat watching the waterfall shed discovered by following the red brick aqueduct through the grounds at kiyomizu she looked down from its wooden veranda down the gulf of space beyond the cliff and the wooden rails for so long that a temple guide came up to ask her if she was all right she was embarrassed and left quickly she went to kinkakuji as much to see the setting of mishimas golden pavilion as to see the temple for its own sake ryoanji was too crowded and noisy for her she left the famous gravel garden unseen todaiji intimidated her just by its size she turned away outside it feeling weak and foolish instead she bought a postcard of the bronze buddha inside and sent it to her mother she stabbed at his throat with her fingers instantly furious beyond all reason or normality the pressure of all her frustration hammering her bones and flesh into his neck he dropped the baton his eyes went white at toba she watched the pearl divers they still dived for pearls sometimes though mostly it was for sea plants now cultured pearls were cheaper and easier to harvest she sat on the rocks for half a day watching the darksuited ladies swim out with their wooden buckets then sound disappearing for minutes at a time when they surfaced it was with a strange whistling noise she could never quite place on the conventional musical scale no matter how many times she listened to it he struggled body armour making him hard and insectlike behind his gas mask the orange smoke folded round them the wet rag round her mouth kept the smoke out better than the tear gas ten metres in front of them over the heads of the students batons rose and fell like winnowing poles a surge in the screaming pressing crowd pushed them over they staggered each sinking to their knees the ground was damp through her needlecords the riot policeman put his hand out down to the ground she thought it was to steady himself but he had found the baton he swung it at her her crash helmet took the blow sending her down to the wet grass one of her hands was trampled on filling her with pain the baton swung down at her again and she dodged it struck the ground the pain in her buzzing head and the burning impaled hand took her choked her filled her she steadied herself and saw through her tears and the curling orange smoke the policemans exposed throat as he brought the baton up again so hiroshima the girder skullcap and empty eye windows of the ruined trade hall she went through the museum she read the english captions and could not believe the cenotaph was so incompetent the flensed stone and bleached concrete of the wrecked trade hall was much more eloquent she stood on the banks of the river with her back to the peace park watching her shadow lengthen across the greybrown waters while the sky turned red and felt the tears roll down her cheeks too much turn away in the train again she passed through kitakyushu where the second bomb would have been dropped if the visibility had been better that day the cluttered hills of nagasaki took it instead the monument there a giant human statue epicentric she found more fitting what had happened to the two cities both crowded busy places again was beyond abstraction the line pressed forward they chanted and yelled voices muffled by the damp cloths many had over their mouths and noses to keep out the worst of the tear gas she had forgotten to bring a pair of goggles and the crash helmet had no visor her arms were held on either side linked with the students she felt good frightened but purposeful acting with the others part of a team greater than herself they heard screams from ahead batons like a fence rose into the air in front of them they stormed onwards the line breaking and giving way people tripped in front something whacked her crash helmet as she stumbled over a pile of people and caught a glimpse of police riot gear visors glinting in the remnant sunlight her arms were wrenched from those of the youths on either side and the orange smoke wrapped itself around her like thick fog the riot policeman came rocketing backwards through the orange haze crashing into her his right glove was off and she saw the leather thong attaching him to his baton slip from his wrist as they both tried to regain their balance he grabbed for the falling baton as he turned then punched her in the face she heard something click and tasted blood she rocked back ducked to the right expecting another blow but unable to see then lunged forward grappling with the man she ate satsumas on the ferry ride across from kagoshima city to sakurajima to see the volcano dust fell on the city that evening and she realised as her hair filled with the fine gritty stuff and her eyes smarted that it was true people in kagoshima really did carry umbrellas all the time shed always thought it was a joke at ibusuki she watched the sand bathers lie on the beach smiling and chattering to each other while the hot black sand was piled over them they lay like darkly swaddled infants near the waves progeny of some strange humanturtle god longlaboured on the black sands orange smoke and the sting of tear gas the orange smoke was theirs the tear gas belonged to the riot police the air was a choking thick mixture and the sun shone through the braids of dark smoke twisting through the sky from piles of burning tyres on the perimeter of the demonstration high cloud completed the set of filters marshals wearing bright waistcoats and specially marked crash helmets shouted at them from megaphones voices drowned by the sporadic screams of the planes between them and the airport perimeter fence the riot police lines were advancing dark waves over the long grass and reeds like the wind made solid heavy water cannons lumbered over to one side where the ground was solid enough to support the trucks the signal came to advance and the students cheered strode forward arms linked chanting their flags and banners and placards catching in the wind the shadows of planes flickered over them at beppu spa on the side of the hill in the great gaudy steamy aircraft hangar of the jungle bathhouse surrounded by blue water trees ferns a standing golden buddha thousands of coloured globes like gaijin christmas decorations and arching girders overhead with the vague smell of sulphur coming and going in her nose she bathed she came back on the sea of japan coast through hagi and tottori and tsuraga and kanazawa she went to see crow castle sitting blackly on its compressed rock base she worked up the courage and visited the suzuki school near by in matsumoto talking to the teachers and watching the little children play the instruments it depressed her how much better she might have been if shed started really early and with this fascinating method she was years behind as well as years ahead of these children she held off returning to tokyo but stayed near by returning to the fuji five lakes as her money slowly ran out then to izu peninsula then across by ferry to chiba finally fretting she realised she was only circling in a holding pattern of her own and so came back to the capital she passed narita on the way there were demonstrations over the plans to expand the airport when she got back to the city the orchestra was still on tour there were several messages and letters asking then telling her to contact the orchestras business manager whod stayed in tokyo instead she went out and found some of her old student friends in a bar near akasaka mitsuke station they were demonstrating against the airport extension on sunday she asked if she could come along i will pay for this she thought as the policemans eyes closed and the orange mist rolled around her i will pay for this her hands ached she sniffed the blood back into her nose something was flapping on top of her and she fought her way out from under a fallen banner people streamed past her again heading back the tear gas was thicker like a million tiny needles being worked into the nose and eyes and tingling in the mouth and throat her eyes flooded the banner covering the policeman fluttered in the orange wind she turned and ran driven back with the rest hisako sat midships in the gemini the cello case lying at her feet the outboard puttered idling she could feel the small eyes of the soldier in the stern watching her as she stared out across the lake to the folded green hills on the western shore sucre appeared at the top of the steps and clattered down them he got into the inflatable grinning broadly he reached forward and slapped her hard across the cheek rattling her teeth and almost knocking her out of the boat then sat back in the bows laughing and told the soldier at the out board to head back to the nadia her head pounded her ears rang she tasted blood the boat bucked and slapped across the glittering surface of the lake she felt sick and still felt so when they got to the ship sucre supported her by one elbow as she stepped shakily from the gemini to the nadias pontoon her wrists felt numb where the restrainer bit into them sucre said something to the other soldier then punched her in the belly winding her she collapsed to her knees on the wooden planking sucre gripped her from behind while the other man put a large piece of black masking tape across her mouth then dazed and bruised and terrified she would vomit and drown she was pushed and pulled up the companionway to the deck she caught a last glimpse of the cello case lying in the bottom of the gemini sucre and the other man met a third soldier at the door to the nadias saloon sucre opened it she saw philippe and the others he looked relieved she closed her eyes shook her head they took her into the room then sucre crossed to mrs bleveans took her by the elbow and with her in tow collected marie boulard he made them stand at the bar and put restrainers on them as well nobody talked in the room sucre had the two women kneel in front of the semicircle of low stools facing the bar like worshippers down at the far end of the room the koreans the north africans and the remaining crewmen had been collected into three giant circles they too were kneeling facing outwards their wrists apparently strapped to those of the men on each side of them one of the fake venceristas was completing tying up the koreans who formed the largest of the three groups the men looked out into the room with frightened eyes sucre had a word with the man behind the bar with the heavy machinegun then went down the room to the third of the circles patting the shoulder of the soldier whod just finished tying the men up she was watching now eyes bright with pain and terror her bowels feeling loose her stomach churning behind the bruise she saw sucre pretend to inspect the bonds of the men making up the far circle she saw him take the grenade even though nobody else seemed to she saw him wander away from the group towards the second one the soldier behind her tightened his grip on the restrainer one of the men in the first circle must have felt it he shouted something in korean screamed tried desperately to get up almost dragging part of the circle with him while the others looked round bewildered sucre skipped to the second circle and dropped the grenade into the middle of it repeated the action at the last circle of men then ran for the door the saloon filled with screams sucre ducked behind a couch with the soldier whod tied up the men the soldier holding hisako stepped back so that he was shielded by the door the man behind the bar disappeared behind it the noise was more muffled than it had been earlier when orrick had attacked she watched her eyes closed for the instant of the detonation but she saw the circle of men rise up saw the red cloud burst from one part on the far side the second circle of men had almost managed to stand some had been hit by shrapnel from the first blast but somehow they were almost on their feet she saw lekkas then yelling at the others and trying to kick behind him where the grenade had to be the ringing blast of the first grenade was just giving way to the screams and moans of the injured in the first group when the second detonated throwing men across the room flaying legs smacking blood and flesh off the ceiling something whined past her left ear the men in the third group were almost on their feet the grenade blasted their legs out from under them the machinegun opened up sucre and the soldier whod tied the men up scrambled to the side of the room and started firing too the man holding her shoved her forward and started firing with a small uzi making a cracking drilling noise by her head philippe broekman endo and bleveans were struggling to their feet marie boulard and mrs bleveans knelt shivering as though the noise itself shook them mrs bleveans was trying to look back to where her husband was hisako couldnt see mandamus the saloon was filling with smoke like a thick sea fog sucre saw the officers standing and turned his fire on them she saw broekman whipped back as though pulled by a hawser fastened to his back and philippe hit in the belly doubling up she closed her eyes she opened them again when she heard mrs bleveans scream over the noise of the firing the woman crashed through the barrier of stools towards her husband who lay on his side on the floor shirt covered with blood his wife fell towards him over him sucre kept on firing mrs bleveanss blouse kicked out in four or five places marie boulard had risen at the same time and threw herself at sucre the soldier holding hisako flicked the uzi to one side bringing the woman down in a cloud of smoke and noise they finished all the men off mr mandamus was miraculously uninjured and protested to the last before being silenced with a single shot from sucres pistol the soldiers decided both the other women were indeed dead they threw hisako to the floor and tore the yukata off they were going to rape her there but instead dragged her by the feet out across the corridor and into the ships television lounge because the air in the saloon was so thick with choking acrid smoke force majeure force majeure fors mahzher n irresistible compulsion or coercion unforeseeable course of events excusing from fulfilment of contract f superior strength aguaceros her fingers ached whenever she touched the cello after the demonstration they regrouped before dispersing to see who had been arrested or injured one of the students volunteered to go with the group of people who would follow the police buses back into the city and find out what had happened to those who were missing the rest of them returned by cars and hired minibuses she found it easy to be quiet her shock passed unnoticed everybody else was high on the exhilaration of the demonstration and the fact theyd survived with nothing worse than red eyes and sniffy noses they chattered relived and retold their experiences nobody seemed to have heard about the dead policeman they went back to the same bar shed met them in earlier that week she went to the toilets and threw up the television showed the news the clash outside the airport was the lead story with the murdered riot policeman providing the headline the students were divided some had bruises from the batons or knew people whod had arms broken by the riot police at the university the airport or in the streets on vietnam demos and muttered that the man probably deserved it or that another policeman might have done it settling some old score in the heat of the battle while the rest went as quiet as hisako she left as soon as she could coughing and complaining of a headache in the flat she sat in darkness staring at the patterns of light the city cast on to the ceiling and walls through the window blinds she was still staring at the white and orange barred wedges of light when they gradually faded under the pervasive grey of a new day she didnt know what to do to confess to run away to pretend nothing had happened she didnt know what had made her do it anger and pain perhaps but so what there must have been hundreds of people there whod been more angry and been hurt worse than she they hadnt killed anybody what was in her that could do such a thing she wasnt normally violent shed been accused of attacking the music sometimes of being too aggressive with the bow and her fingers but as she put her hands into her armpits staring at the grey day dawning that wasnt murder she still could hardly believe shed done it but the memory was there livid and raw like the taste and sting of the gas and the memory resided not just in her brain behind her eyes but in her bones in her fingers she could feel again the crumpling and cracking as they lanced into the mans neck they hurt again as she thought of her bones and his buckling compressing she hugged herself tighter and put her head down on to her knees sobbing into the jeans and forcing her arms into her sides as though trying to crush her hands it was impossible to sleep the next night too so she walked through the city until dawn through the soapland sleaze and past the quiet parks and down the side streets where the pachinko parlours sounded like a million tiny nails being rattled in a drum and the karaoke bars echoed with drunk businessmen singing badly down the streets where the plaster european models stood in bright windows hung with millionyen dresses and electronics companies displayed the latest crop of gadgets like glittering jewellery and through suburbs where the small houses sat crammed and dark and the only sound was the distant city grumble and faraway trains screeching through points that day she slept fitfully always waking with the feeling of shock convinced that some incredibly violent noise had just stopped echoing that a titanic explosion had caused her to wake and the air had barely finished ringing with the aftershock once a small earthquake did wake her but it was only enough to rattle the flat a little nothing remarkable shed never been bothered by quakes before but now she lay awake worrying that it was just a prelude to a big one a shock that would bring all tokyo down crushing her in her flat squashing her under tons of rubble suffocating her on the bed like a pinned insect grinding her bones destroying her while she tried to scream she got up took to the streets again and when she did try to play the cello her fingers ached the left hand the one that had been stepped on hurt a little but the right which had to hold the bow filled her with agony it was as though all the bones had been recently broken and the act of trying to move the bow across the strings fractured them once more she kept dropping the bow eventually she gave up she walked she sat in the flat she ate next to nothing she tried to sleep but couldnt then fell suddenly asleep and had to claw her way out of dreams of cruelty and pain and she waited for the police to come they never did later she found it difficult to work out quite how she ended up in hospital the orchestra came back and the two girls she shared the flat with but she hardly noticed she had settled into a routine by that time and the girls hardly impinged upon that she knew without looking at a clock roughly when to try to sleep when to go out walking when to try and play the cello and have her fingers ache sometimes she only thought about playing the cello and her fingers ached anyway when to eat a little from cold tin cans when to sit and wait drained for sleep to take her knowing that dreams and fear would wake her while sheer exhaustion tried to keep her under the girls tried to talk to her she remembered them showing her photographs of the tour bright very colourful but she had the impression all the smiles were somehow pasted crudely on and she couldnt work out why they were showing her these sad obviously faked and painful photographs and later one of the orchestra managers came as well but he left and another man came who was very calm and quiet and professional and she trusted him and tried to talk to him and the next day two young men who really did have white coats came and took her away without any trouble at all her two flatmates were there and seemed to think she should take the cello with her but she refused wouldnt let them do it made a scene and left the immediate source of her pain behind the hospital was in the hills near uenohara during the day if it wasnt cloudy or foggy you could see fuji in the evening tokyo blazed on the plain to the east she spent the first week crying unable to talk her every expression a currency of tears because she was sure this was costing so much money and she had spent all her savings running away and her mother would go into debt and bankruptcy paying for it all until she managed to voice her anxiety to somebody from the orchestra whod come to visit her and they told her the orchestra s medical insurance was paying not her mother she cried even more her mother came to visit on the second week she tried to explain to her that there was something shed done some terrible thing she was sure and she couldnt remember what it was but it was terrible terrible and nobody would ever forgive her if they knew her mother buried her face in her hands hisako went to her and hugged her which was very wrong far too open and obvious but she did it with a sort of glee that hurt as though to take her own mother in her arms in a public veranda overlooking the wooded hills near uenohara with other people near by and quite possibly looking on was some sort of secretive attack and she really hated her mother and this was a way of getting back at her subjecting her she tried to go for walks tempted by the lights of the city on the plain and the mountain hovering like an immense black and white tent over the hills to the south but they kept catching her finding her and she kept encountering locked doors and high fences too finely meshed to climb and had to wait there banging on the door or the fence with her palm or fist until her hands ached just enough or started to bleed and they came to take her away she slept sitting up propped by gaijin pillows afraid to lie down in case the roof collapsed the ward ceiling was too broad and big and she didnt think there were enough pillars or walls to support it properly one good tremor and the lot would come down smashing into her bed flattening her there and grinding up her bones and crushing her neck with ferroconcrete beams and suffocating her over the years while the orchestra went bankrupt and her mother turned to prostitution and she lay not alive and not dead with a necklace of reinforced concrete slowly choking her a burden upon all of them hated but indulged mr kawamitsu came to see her this confused her because he was from another time when she was young and still innocent and had no blood on her hands and no real dreams in her head and she couldnt understand how hed got here from there had they built the rail tunnel already they ought to tell her about these things she was disturbed that day anyway theyd been watching television the evening before and the nurse had been out of the room for a while during a programme about vietnam which showed terrible terrible things things of suffering and flame and blackened flesh and the orange flash and white pulse in the green green jungle a bruise in the forest while the sticky orange sticks tumbling lazily from the pretty plane fire and the white explosion cloud and tiny trailing threads medusa phosphorus gnawed their way through the olive skin to the white bone while the rome ploughs ripped and the hercules sprayed agent orange ha gasp pant and she saw the wordpicture for tree mutate before her eyes and thought in english it would go trees ree re e and only the screams of some of the patients brought the nurse back adjusting his clothing ho she noticed and turned the set on to a game show instead and everybody seemed to forget what they had seen except her she remembered and dreamed that night uppropped muttering plagued asweat and as she replayed and remembered and relived she laughed with each flicked frame of pain and grief because it had all already happened and demonstrating wasnt going to do any good now and because it made her feel good which made her feel bad but still she felt good in the end the dawn was bright and clear and blue that morning mr kawamitsu brought a cello he put her hands upon it showed her how to hold the device the sunlight leant shafts of gold against the walls of the room and fuji was invisible beyond the hills and inside the clouds she stroked the instrument remembering it wasnt hers but she remembered not just playing a cello she somehow remembered this cello even though she knew shed never seen or held it before it smelled good felt good sounded deep and rich and sensuous it played her rather than the other way round so her fingers didnt hurt she was sure shed talked to mr kawamitsu but didnt remember what shed said he left taking the beautiful cello with him the pillows were uncomfortable that night and the ceiling looked a bit more secure she swept the pillows from the bed and slept with her head on her arm soundly until the morning light she dreamed that her four fingers were strings and her thumb was a bow in the dream the strings stretched and snapped bursting and unravelling and disappearing in a cloud of mist the bow scraped against the neck of the instrument and snapped flailing tendon still attached bone broken it ought to have hurt but it didnt and she felt as though shed been untied let loose she studied her fingers the next morning they looked fine nothing wrong with them she made a tent of them and tapped the tips against each other checking out the rainy weather and wondering what was for breakfast they put it down to her fear and the idea that shed been so ashamed at letting everybody else down shed gone crazy she felt demeaned by such a judgement but accepted it as lenient compared to what she deserved for what had really driven her the cello belonged to a businessman in sapporo whod bought the instrument as an investment and because he thought it looked a pretty colour mr kawamitsu knew him hed persuaded the man that the stradivari should be used rather than stored mr kawamitsu always meant that hisako should have the chance to play it and perhaps own it one day bringing it to her now was all he could think of that might help it did but she told mr kawamitsu to take it back to sapporo with him when she could afford to shed buy it he went her mother stayed she left her mother slept in the same room with her for the first two weeks after she moved back to tokyo back into the same flat with the other two girls she couldnt believe it they wanted her to be there she wondered if maybe they were crazy too then her mother went back to hokkaido and she went to see the orchestra manager she could stay as a guest soloist she wouldnt be expected to tour abroad she couldnt expect to be a fully paidup member of the orchestra no more subsidised stays in exclusive mental hospitals from now on but she could play play with the orchestra when it was in its tokyo base or anywhere else in japan it was more than shed hoped for much more than she deserved she accepted wondering as she did so what the down side would be how life would get back at her for such apparent clemency she stayed and played she found herself in another quartet even more in demand than the first and she was asked to do recordings she was introduced to a man called mr moriya who was professionally appalled to discover how much she was being paid especially for recordings and helped her make more life went on she visited or was visited by her mother she took the occasional lover in or out of the orchestra watched her savings mount up and wondered what she was really doing with her life and why her hands hardly ever ached and even if she did wake up sometimes in the early morning with her hands crumpled and cramped and compressed into tearfully painful fists nails digging into her palms or caught between her arms and her chest stuffed into her armpits while she dreamed of fingers crushed in car doors great toothick car doors with lots of handles and levers and patches of obscurely important writing on them and even if she did wake panting and sweating now and again it was still nothing normal and fair and better than she deserved came a day when she could afford the down payment on the fabulous strad she travelled to sapporo to meet it and mr kawamitsu and mr kubota the owner there it was in her hands it was like meeting a husband picked out by your parents yet who youd already secretly known and loved she took the cello away to a ryokan just outside wajima for two weeks she had a double room in an outhouse across the courtyard from the main inn she played there it was a sort of honeymoon the cello was ancient made sometime between and it had belonged to a san marinan composer at the hapsburg court had narrowly escaped being used as firewood by napoleons army as it swept through piedmont in travelled to america with an italian virtuoso to celebrate fifty years of american independence had its spike shot off in the boxer rebellion in beijing survived an entire string quartet during the second world war because it was put on the wrong dc flying to algiers not cairo the dakota flying to cairo with the string quartet crashed below sea level in the qattara depression while the puzzled pilot tried to work out what had gone wrong with his altimeter and spent thirty years in a bank vault in venice before being sold at auction by sothebys of london to mr kubota mr kubota brought the cello back from england on a jal strapped into the seat between him and his wife he was watching from his firstclass window as the plane came into land at narita and saw what looked like a medieval battle going on underneath two armies banners smoke and fumes and lumbering cannon he remembered pointing it out to his wife it was that day that demonstration shed discovered when stuttering incredulous hardly daring to believe fate could dispense such undeserved balm shed asked him but it was true shed hugged mr kubota startling him and mr kawamitsu hisako onoda saw the cello obliterated by ak and uzi fire ripped to splinters against the stem of the nadia in the hazy sunlight of late afternoon strings tugged snapped flailed wood burst and sprang turned to dust and splinters under the hail of fire bullets sang and sparked against the metal of the bows behind the instrument as it disintegrated and collapsed in a cloud of dark and palebrown fragments strings waving like anemone limbs like a drowning mans fingers blood was in her mouth and bruises puffed round her eyes and cigarette burns burned on her breasts and the seed of a boatful of men ran down her thighs and she kept seeing philippe crumple under the first bullet that hit but it was the cello the needless pointless apart from to hurt destruction of the cello that finally killed her old wood new metal guess which won no surprise there killed she was free she heard the scream of the engines in the rasp of the guns the sky was filled with thunder and fire and she felt something die now she couldnt be who or what she had been she hadnt asked for this hadnt wanted it but it was here not her fault there was no forbearance no vengeance just chance but it had happened all the same and she did not feel she had simply to succumb acceptance was not nearly enough and far too much this took the scab off truth always hurts she told herself hurt sometimes truths they made her watch as the afternoon wore out and the clouds sailed and the wind moved as it always had and the water sparkled just so and the kalashnikovs and uzis barked and rapped and the cello dissolved under their fire she suspected shed disappointed them theyd ripped the masking tape off her mouth so they could hear her scream when they shot the instrument but shed kept quiet they took her away but it wasnt the same person they led off and something that was her lay there in the stringtangled debris of the wrecked instrument turned to less than sawdust by the impact she was a toy a mascot they fucked her and made themselves whole together but toys could corrupt she thought as they took her away from the sunlight back to her cage and captivity and torture and mascots might bite back they showed her their other toys too on the bridge the sam launcher they played at readying it to fire and pointing it at her once poked it between her legs joking about whether she was hot enough down there to attract the missile the plastique charges theyd sink at least one of the ships with once theyd downed the plane the vencerista literature and equipment theyd leave behind with a couple of their uniforms so that when the national guard did come to investigate thered be no doubt whod shot down the americans and massacred the people on the ships the radio operators were dead too shed seen the bodies in the nadias radio cabin as theyd dragged her along to the bridge past the scars and gouge marks of the fire fight orrick had started the ships radio was officially out of action the americans were jamming every frequency in sight to combat vencerista radio signals fearing a largescale attack they said the soldiers let her listen to one of the infrequent news broadcasts radio panama was playing martial music apart from the news programmes which were meant to be hourly but werent the jamming came right up against the stations frequency on both sides producing a background of whistles and rumbles and a sound somewhere between a heavy machinegun and a helicopter when theyd got to the bridge theyd tied her to the nadias small wheel forcing her to stand awkwardly unable to rest her legs her arms strapped to the wood and brass of the wheel her head was down and sheltered behind her greasy unwashed hair she looked down at the bruised burned body revealed by the ripped yukata and listened to the sounds of a world losing its head panama city was under martial law the president of columbia had been shot dead and five groups had claimed responsibility more us carrier groups were arriving off the pacific coast of central america and in the caribbean cuba said it was preparing to be invaded the kremlin was threatening a new blockade of berlin america and russia had both called for an emergency session of the un the us peace mission was on again the plane would leave dulles the following morning a thousand rioters were dead in hong kong and the azanian army had found a giant glass crater in the sands three hundred kilometres east of otjiwarongo which they claimed was the site of johannesburgs unsubtle cruisemissile warning shot the news ended with american baseball scores then the martial music resumed hisako laughed until they hit her so hard she blacked out for a moment she still giggled even as the plastic restrainers bit into her wrists and the weight of her body tore at her arm sockets she watched the blood fall like little bombs from her mouth to the cushioned deck of the bridge and felt herself snigger the music they were playing now was a sousa march it reminded her of a group of lecturers shed known in the todai english department who held a small party each week for staff and students theyd invite visiting english speakers along businessmen scientists politicians and sometimes somebody from the american or british embassy a brit diplomat appeared with a video tape one time and some of them watched it not everybody found the programme funny or even comprehensible but she loved it wanted more a subgroup formed to watch the latest tape flown in from london in the diplomatic bag each week she became addicted to the programme the music this music had meant that and that only to her for almost a quarter of a century so radio panama played the sousa march which had become the theme to monty pythons flying circus and she could only laugh no matter how hard they hit her the world was absurd she decided and the pain and cruelty and stupidity were all just side effects of that basic grotesqueness not the intended results after all the realisation came as a relief when dandridge called through on their unjammed walkietalkies they put another piece of masking tape over her mouth she had to swallow her blood dandridge said something about coming over to the nadia and they untied her from the wheel and after some discussion in spanish took her down into the bowels of the ship through the engine room and locked her in the engineering workshop with the light off she slept somebody had stabbed her she had just woken up and shed been stabbed the knife hung from her belly dripping blood she tried to pull it out but couldnt the room was dark echoingly big there was a line of red light at floor level all around her it flickered slightly she got up out of the dirty bed tangled in the grease and grimy sweat of the sheets she kicked them away and stumbled on the metal floor holding the knife carefully so that it wouldnt move around too much and hurt her even more there wasnt as much blood as shed expected and she wondered if there would only be a gush when she got somebody to pull it out she wanted to cry but found that she couldnt she came to the wall of the room and felt under the rim of the metal between floor and wall looking for a place to lift she moved round feeling under the wall with one hand holding the knife in the other eventually she came to a set of steps leading up out of the room to a very dim red outside where long booming noises shook the air and the ground the steps made of compacted sand were edged with wooden slats held in by little tuftheaded posts she came up out of the bunker into the gory glow of late evening strips of closepacked cloud lay overhead alternating with streaks of red like blood staining black sheets the thunder of the guns sounded in the distance and the earth trembled down in the trench she found the men lying exhausted against the sides of crumbling earth and rotten wood the mud was up to their knees and their eyes were closed red light hung like oil on their rifles they were bandaged everyone wore a filthy grey bandage on head or arm or over one eye or both or over their chest over their uniform or round one leg she wondered why they didnt see her and stopped and looked into the face of one whose eyes were open red light reflected in the darkness of his pupils he sniffed and wiped his nose she tried to talk to the soldier but no noise came from her mouth and the man ignored her she started to worry that she wouldnt find anybody to take the knife out at the end of the trench were men who looked like their boots their eyes were threaded up and down their leathery faces their mouths were stuck open like the top of a shoe tongues flapping spastically as they tried to talk to her their arms were like thick laces and couldnt pull the knife out of her one raised his foot out of the mud and she saw that the top of his boot melded naturally and easily into a naked human foot without a break she puzzled over this sure shed seen it before but then the boot soldier put the foot under the mud again and a whistle sounded the boot soldiers picked up their guns with all the rest and put rickety wooden ladders against the sides of the trenches she walked up out of the trench back to where a line of blasted tree stumps lay on the brow of a small hill like teeth the village on the far side of the hill was wrecked every building damaged roofs had collapsed walls fallen doors and windows been blown out and huge holes filled the road and streets she saw people in the town square facing in towards the centre where a red light shone she walked down the broad craterpitted streets passing people who stood looking to the central square she used sign language to ask for help but they all ignored her it took a long time to walk through the suburbs the crowd of silent raggedly dressed people became gradually thicker until she had to push her way through them which was difficult while she still held the knife she could hear a roaring noise in the distance the people looked exhausted and holloweyed and some of them collapsed as she pushed past the roaring noise sounded thick and heavy like a great waterfall slowed down the people fell around her crumpling to the ground as soon as she touched them no matter how careful she tried to be she wanted to say sorry she could see the silhouette of the giant fountain ahead against the crimson sky now the people were thick about her she pushed between them and they fell knocking into their neighbours so that they fell too and hit the people near them who also fell and took others down with them the wave of collapsing people spread out like ripples in a pond knocking everybody to the ground until only she was left standing and the fountain was there huge in front of her with the lake beyond the fountain was tiered shaped like a wedding cake it gushed blood blood roaring and falling and steaming through the cold evening air she fell to her knees when she saw it halfsuffocated by the smell of it mouth blocked a cataract of blood flowed away from it to the inland sea beyond the city she got up stepped over the fallen people stumbled down the steps by the side of the violet rapids until she stood on the shore of the lake red waves lapping at her feet she pulled the knife out and threw it into the lake no blood rushed out of the wound but the knife splashed when it hit and some of the blood splattered her face and feet and some hit the place where the knife had been embedded and a single strand dribbled down to the lake at her feet and the strand thickened and pulsed and the blood flowed into her not out of her falling up out of the lake as if a tap had been turned on she tried to stop it beating it down with her fists but the blood burned her breaking her fingers she fell back but the blood rushed out of the lake into her the stream thick as an arm filling her bloating her choking her sealing her mouth she lifted her ruined hands to the dark clouds and tried to scream and the sky flashed once above her the lake shivered the sky went dark once more at last her lips tore open and she screamed with all her strength and the sky lit up all over as though the clouds were catching fire the lake spasmed whipping the strand that joined it to her almost breaking its thin grip she drew air in through her ruined lips to scream with all the power of the lake itself while the sky trembled above her glittering and sparking on the brink of release poised and ready to catch and blast she woke up on the floor the place was dark the deck hard and cold breathing sounded loud and ragged in the harsh steel container of the room but it was only her own coursing through her nostrils the tape over her mouth still clamped her lips her breath quieted slowly while she sat trying to ease the ache in her shoulders it was late she didnt know how long shed slept but she knew it had been some hours early morning by now if not later shed been secured against a metal bench her hands attached to its leg by the plastic strap of the restrainer as soon as she awoke she hurt her backside had been spread in the same position for so long she felt welded to the deck her shoulders ached her wrists and hands felt numb and the places on her breasts where theyd touched her with their cigarettes burned as though the glowing red coals were still there sizzling through her flesh between her legs wasnt as bad as shed expected sucre had been small and the rest had added their own lubrication with each violation the pain didnt matter so much it was the feeling of being used of mattering so little as another human being and so much as a warm slippery container to be taken and crowed over look what ive done i did this even though she didnt want to the ship hummed around her she couldnt see a thing the light in the corridor outside between the engine room itself and the nadias steeringgear compartment must be turned off as well she tried to remember how the room had looked when they brought her in but couldnt too complicated for one thing full of machinery lathes and drills and benches with vices and tools it ought to be an ideal place to escape from but she didnt know how to begin she felt what she could starting with her fingers and stopped the rear flange of the lshaped leg supporting the bench which the restrainer was looped around was ragged it rasped against her fingers hurting blood welled on her fingers making them slick then sticky she explored the jagged edge she pulled forward and moved her wrists quickly up and down then stopped and felt the inner surface of the restrainer where it had been rubbing against the metal the material felt roughened she put it back where it had been and sawed up and down as hard and fast as she could she could hear it and after a while she could smell it too and that seemed like a good sign she was almost free when she heard steps and the light outside in the corridor went on she stopped for a second then resumed her sawing frantic with the effort footsteps clanged against metal stopped at the door she threw her hands up and down drawing her spine back to the metal edge of the bench with the effort of forcing the restrainer against the leg the door swung open just as the restrainer snapped average adjuster light swamped in she scuttled to the left behind another bench but too late she knew it was too late there was too much light and she must have been seen she expected the soldier to shout out but he didnt there was a noise like a chuckle and the sound of a hand moving over metal something clinked on the far wall the soldier spoke to her in spanish but she couldnt make out the words she peeped over the top of the bench the opened white loop of the plastic restrainer lay by the leg of the bench shed been attached to it ought to be obvious but the man hadnt reacted yet he slapped the metal bulkhead at the side of the door cursing looking for the light but still it didnt come on she realised then that her eyes had adjusted over the hours and his were still tuned to the wash of luminescence in the corridor outside and in the rest of the ship she was looking for a weapon but couldnt see anything on the surface of the bench she was hiding behind or anywhere near by a wrench a big screwdriver or a length of angle iron there ought to be hundreds of things she could use but she couldnt see any of them she looked round in desperation as the soldier said something else and came further into the workshop she peeped over the top of the bench again hoping shed missed something on its surface the man was smoking she could see the red glowing tip of the cigarette being transferred from mouth to hand señorita behind her she glimpsed something long and thin and glinting stacked rods of some sort she reached back grasped the soldier bumped into something cursed in the semidarkness it was like taking hold of a skeletal arm two thin pipes cold as bone and close together ulna and radius she felt up to a knurled collar like a cold brass knuckle that was when she realised what she was holding the soldier made a sound like hand rubbing flesh through cloth and said again señorita the red tip of the cigarette glowed brighter waving around in the darkness in front of the man light from the corridor reflected from his rifle she felt the end of the brasswork then the twin hoses they led back a few coiled metres to the tanks they were upright but in the shadow of the door she was still under the level of the bench her fingers crept up to the valves shed seen broekman do this even philippe she found the taps whirled them round the hiss of escaping gas sounded like a whole family of disturbed snakes the soldier stopped hesitated then changed direction came towards her hello he said the glowing cigarette tip came closer brandished like a sword when he was close enough and the smell of the unignited gases was wafting back over her making her dizzy she threw herself forward still holding the brass limbs of the oxyacetylene torch the gases flared on the tip of the cigarette igniting with a whoosh and blowing flame towards the surprised soldier flashing through the air in a vivid yellow ball the mans hair caught she saw his face mouth opening eyes closing as his brows sizzled and shrivelled and flamed blue his burning hair lit up the beret stuffed underneath his left epaulette the two grenades attached to his chest the kalashnikov strapped over his right shoulder and the belt with the oily black holster hanging over his left hip he drew in a breath and screamed as his hair sputtered and crackled and lit up the whole workshop he lit the place well enough for her to see a massive wrench hanging on the wall not a metre away she stepped smartly to it unclipped and swung it in one movement his scream had barely started and he had hardly moved the cigarette hed dropped hadnt even hit the deck before the jaws of the wrench buried themselves in his skull and he slammed into the metal deck as though hed thrown himself there his hair billowed yellow and blue for a moment then sizzled out against his scalp crisping it brownblack in places the fumes stank made her gag and only then did she slowly pull the black tape from her mouth the last lick of flame slowly consuming a set of curls over the soldiers left ear was extinguished by the black ooze of blood welling from where the circular head of the wrench had hit she watched thought how do i feel cold she decided so cold she kicked him over pulled the assault rifle free and hoisted it checking the safety was off no noise from the open doorway she waited for a few seconds then put the gun down and reached forward to take the mans uniform off she hesitated before she touched him then stood hefted the wrench and smashed it into his forehead only after that did she strip him she whistled under her breath as she did it sousa she didnt mean to impersonate a soldier she was just sick of the torn soiled yukata she wanted to be clothed again she tore some relatively clean strips off the yukata wiped herself as clean as she could with a couple of them and tied one narrow strand round her head keeping her hair back the soldier wasnt too much bigger than her so the uniform fitted hed been one of the ones whod raped her the one whod bitten her ears she fingered her earlobes puffy and scabbed with blood she studied one of the grenades in the light spilling from the corridor she even held the little shiny handle down extracted the pin inspected it and then replaced it letting the handle click back she tried to recall how much time had passed between sucre dropping a grenade into one of the groups of men and the explosion a bit more than five seconds she decided the kalashnikov was easier shed watched safety semiautomatic automatic the emplaced magazine was full and two more hung on his belt the pistol was a colt just like dandridges the safety was a simple switch on and off the soldier had a bowie knife on the belt so she gained that as well a cigarette lighter and packet of marlboros in one breast pocket she threw the cigarettes away she looked for a radio but he didnt have one she was at the door before she thought to go back and take his watch the little casio said she stared at it it couldnt be that late next morning already she tilted the display p said the little letter to one side p evening the same day she couldnt believe it she was sure shed slept for hours she shook her head stuffed the watch in a trouser pocket the corridor seemed very bright the engine room was more brilliant still and hummed noisily it smelled of oil and electrics deserted she crept along the open grillework of the catwalk between the two main engines towards the high girn of the donkey engine and the whining ac generator the stairway to the main deck level left her feeling exposed and vulnerable but nothing happened the evening air was still warm in one corner of the sky off to the west a single dab of red hung thick and dim above over all the sky a uniform darkness extended starless and without moon thick cloud like a layer of something more than night she decided the watch was right and her senses had been wrong she waited a moment felt the eastern wind move across her face and hands and watched the lid of cloud close over the red hole where the sun still shone until darkness consumed the lake and the land the exterior of the ship was darker than she was used to theyd turned the mast floodlights off or hadnt ever thought to turn them on she slunk along the side of the superstructure past dark portholes heading forwards she didnt know what to do shed dressed herself as a soldier but she wasnt one shed left the real soldier lying there and theyd have to go looking for him soon so maybe she ought to forget about dressing as a soldier and strip off again and get into the water and swim away she was a strong swimmer and the coast wasnt far she got to the forward edge of the superstructure light came from above it wasnt the masthead floodlights it seemed very bright in the darkness but it wasnt really just the lights from the bridge they werent bothering to use the red nightlights which would keep their eyes adapted maybe they didnt know about them she looked at the deep shadows created by the hatches and at the bows the stem pale splinters she went slowly forward looking up the bridge shone end to end she saw nobody she walked backwards then ducked into the shadow on hands and knees she crawled up the slope of deck to the winches and lockers of the forecastle apron she looked back at the bridge again still nobody it looked abandoned until she saw a bloom of grey smoke climb into the air near midships then another alongside she waited for the smokers to appear but they didnt she edged forward to the closedoff v of the prow and found herself stirring the splinters she was looking for the strings but discovered the spike alone the rest was matchwood the pegs and strings must have been blown overboard whatever she couldnt find them she scuttled back into the shadows the cellos spike jammed into the holster along with the colt back at the superstructure she could stand again and did so still trying to think what she was supposed to do she took the spike out and felt foolish she squatted down gun between her knees and looked out into the darkness beyond the bows insects curled above her attracted by the lights of the bridge she saw philippe fall heard mandamus shut up by a pistol shot watched the cello blast out and fall felt the soldiers push into her smelled her own flesh burn as they pressed the cigarettes against her she thought of the sky on fire and looked up into the night trying to imagine the stars beyond the cloud the length of bridgelight was made busy by the circling insects she crept into the ship the saloon was dark and silent and smelled of dried blood and expended smoke the whole lower deck seemed deserted the television lounge still smelled of semen she sniffed the dark air drawing the sharp animal scent into her stomach churning she took to the stairs and went up to the bridge snoring came through the halfopen door of the captains cabin she pushed the door further waiting for a creak or at least for the snoring to stop no creak the snoring continued she edged in fingering the door a little wider behind her as she went to give her more light a suite of course another open door she let her eyes adjust then approached the bedroom the cabin smelled of dampness and shampoo there was a man lying on the bed torso tangled with a single sheet arms drawn up behind his head face turned away into the corner of the bulkhead beneath and to the side of the porthole sucre his chest was smooth almost hairless nipples very dark in the halflight she crossed quietly to the bed and fumbled with the holster at her hip she kissed him hair brushing the sides of his face shadowing he jerked awake eyes white she drew back a little so that he could see her he relaxed fractionally then the eyes balled wide and he started up hands clutching together at the sheet beneath him before one went back up to his head fumbling beneath the pillow but he was too late and she was already pumping down with the heels of her hands the tip of the old cello spike on his chest then bursting through as she put all her weight on it forcing it between his ribs and into his heart he tried to beat her face but she dodged and waggled the spike inside his chest with one hand while she leant forward and round and slipped the pistol out from under his pillow with the other he gurgled once like somebody rinsing his mouth and darkness spread around his lips and the hole the spike had made in his chest the moonwhite sheets turned black where his blood touched the last noise he made as his chest subsided surprised her then she realised it came not from his mouth but from the wound around the cello spike she watched the dark bubbles for a moment she put the pistol another colt into a pocket in the fatigue jacket there was a walkietalkie on the bedside table so she stuffed that in a trouser pocket she left the spike where it was she was terrified of one of them coming back to life so she pressed her thumb down on to sucres right eye while she held the colt against one of his ears she pressed hard but nothing happened she drew her hand away with a shiver suddenly afraid of the eye bursting and the fluid trickling down his cheek she decided sucre was really dead she took his kalashnikov because it had a nightsight and dumped the other one there was an uzi on the table she took that a silencer for it and a few extra magazines she was starting to get weighed down and had to walk carefully as she left trying not to clink the bridge smelled of tobacco but there was nobody there she felt cheated she looked in all the cabins on that deck even the one where orrick had killed the first soldier but there was nobody in any of them she went down to the next deck nothing she looked out through the blinds covering the windows on the forward lounge and saw somebody at the bows the light from the bridge was just enough to make the man out she scratched her head went back out into the corridor and stood by the companionways leading up and down but heard nothing she went back down to the main deck level and out on to the external deck under the overhang she could still see the man he seemed to be leaning at the very prow of the ship his feet in the cello splinters looking out into the night to where the dimmed lights of the distant nakodo shimmered on the water she took the beret out of the epaulette pushed the hair not held by the strip of yukata up underneath the beret and walked quietly up the deck towards the man she glanced up once at the bridge as she went seeing nothing but emptiness and lights he didnt even hear her until she was less than five metres away he turned saw her turned away again gazing out over the water and only then looked back face puzzled she was on him while the expression of puzzlement was starting to turn into suspicion and he was reaching for his rifle she already had hers it cracked up and into his chin throwing his head back and whacking it off the bulwark he clattered to the deck like a broken doll he was not one of those whod raped her and she didnt have the heart to kill him just like that so she dragged him to the starboard anchors chain locker stripped him of weaponry chucked him in gently closed the hatch and dogged it carting all this hardware around was exhausting her so she tipped all his armament and one of the colts overboard the splashes sounded very small and far away she crept away again back to the main body of the ship then she found the others they were playing cards below deck level under an opened skylight set in the deck just in front of the leading edge of the superstructure smoke drifted out of the aperture tobacco and hash she took a peek over the lip and saw a table cans of san miguel a thick joint and hands of cards and hands of men it had been a long time since shed smoked any dope she lay there shoulder against the raised metal lip round the skylight remembering then quietly took a grenade out of its velcro fastening clutched the handle removed the pin let go the handle subvocalised wunih erephantu twori erephantu tri erephantu fori erephantu favi erephantu and was still chuckling to herself as she reached up and dropped the grenade through the skylight she heard it hit heard a few intakes of breath but didnt hear it bounce before the deck beneath her slammed up the skylight flipped back on a cloud of bright mist and smashed and a noise like planets colliding boxed her ears like an angry school bully she lay waiting her ears were singing again ringing with their own tired noise she unholstered the colt heaved herself up looked into the cabin beneath through the smoke and couldnt see very much she levered herself up further stuck her head and gun then her head and gun and upper torso in through the gap took a look round and decided they were all dead or very close to it she let a little more of the smoke clear listening as best she could watching the bridge and the sides of the superstructure at main deck level then she swung in through the skylight on to the table it had been blown almost in two strips of brown laminate sticking up like obstreperous licks of hair she had to swing her feet to make sure she landed close to the bulkhead so that what was left of the table would take her weight she dropped down through the stinging smoke her loosely booted feet grated on grenade shards and scattered playing cards one of the men moved and groaned she wanted to use the knife but somehow couldnt so put the gun to his head and fired she did the same with the other three though only one other showed any signs of life blood was making the floor sticky glueing the cards to the deck incredibly the joint was still alight and almost intact burning a brown mark in a shrapnelpunctured plastic seat she knocked the end of the tip off it where a little black bit of plastic hung and took a toke it still tasted bad so she ground it out under one heel it sizzled she sauntered from the cabin amazed nobody had come and only then started to think that perhaps they were all dead still she didnt believe it and searched the entire ship she found their sams and their plastique charges in the chartroom off the bridge looked again at sucre swathed in black and white spike like a cupids arrow in his unmoving chest found the bloodstains on the bed in the cabin shed been in briefly with orrick but could not find the body of the man orrick had killed found the three dead radio operators and the dead radio equipment she tried to make it work but couldnt even get the jamming signal empty fuse cradles mocked her looked again into the tv lounge where theyd raped her and braved the shadowy depths of the main saloon where the bodies still lay heaped and spread and she couldnt bear to turn on the light for fear of seeing one of them she felt for the heavy machinegun needing both hands and lifted a metal box full of ammunition she left the gun lying in the corridor outside then retraced her steps to the engineering workshop where the first one to die had spread his blood through his head over half the deck under the gleaming businesslike benches an hour after shed freed herself she was back on the bridge after a tour of the bows where the soldier shed poleaxed was making a fuss in the chain locker shed turned the bridge lights to red on her first visit and strode through the bloodcoloured gloom to the winchanchor console she tapped one finger against her lips as she inspected the controls then reached out and flicked a switch the starboard anchor dropped to the lake and splashed its chain rattled massively after it links whipping through the chain locker where the soldier was the rasp of falling chain drowned the mans scream though it must have been short anyway if shed waited till dawn she thought shed have seen him exit through the eye of the anchor port in a red spray but she shivered at the thought of his blood spreading over the surface of the lake the anchor chains thunder sounded through the ship making the deck beneath her tremble unbraked the chain kept on spilling out under its own weight there was a boom as it stopped she couldnt tell whether it parted or held she rubbed one of her breasts absently grimacing slightly when she touched one of the places where theyd burned her and reflected that revenge could taste remarkably bland when youd stopped feeling hisako onoda came to the conclusion there was almost certainly nobody left to kill on the nadia she decided to go and see mr dandridge who deserved a visit like nobody else did it was all still hopeless she knew but this was better than doing nothing the crumpled black gemini orrick had knifed lay draped over one end of the pontoon she looked at one of its bulky silenced engines worked out how to take it off and dragged it over to where the nadias own inflatable lay moored she stuck the military engines prop in the water pushed the starter the engine trembled rumbled even idling the prop tried to push itself under the pontoon she switched the outboard off unbolted the evinrude from the sternplate of the nadias gemini and let it slip into the black waters she replaced it with the big military engine working by the light from the ship above and sweating with the effort arms aching the pontoon was on the near side of the ship to the other two vessels she had the walkietalkie switched on and was vaguely surprised it had stayed silent it seemed nobody had heard or seen anything on the other two ships as she worked she waited for gunfire or the radio to rattle off some incomprehensible spanish at her but in that perverse sense waited in vain it took her two trips to bring all the weaponry down to the boat she topped up the outboard fuel tank with one of the jerry cans on the pontoon then stowed that with the missile launchers and explosives in the bottom of the inflatable and restarted the engine she pushed the gemini away from the pontoon the inflatable purred off into the night taking a curving course towards the bulky rectangular shape of the nakodo her mother kept a scrapbook it glossed over the time she was in hospital sometimes when she was home she would look through the scrapbook when her mother wasnt there the pages flipped through her fingers the gluedin programmes with her name in them the cuttings from papers mentioning her individually a few cassette inserts some magazine interviews and features and as the pages slipped and sped and fell through her hands she thought that the times the heavy pages covered had themselves gone just as fast just as suddenly and inevitably the years mounted up like a sentence she played and her modest fame grew she tried a few more times to board a plane from singleengine cessnas to s but could not ever suffer the doors to be closed she got as far as okinawa for a couple of holidays and went to korea for the olympics and a few concerts but pressure of work stopped her from making sea journeys that lasted any longer there was talk once by a greek ship owner impressed with her playing of her string quartet playing on board a luxury cruise ship for anything up to a year state rooms good money and a world cruise but she visited one of the cruise ships in yokohama and decided she didnt much like the people the decor or the idea of being expected to play the safe predictable music that seemed to be expected of her so it came to nothing she grew to know japan well the places she didnt go to with the orchestra she visited alone on her frequent vacations mr moriya fretted that she wasnt maximising her potential which she took to mean making all the money she could but then she scarcely knew what to do with what she did have she paid off the loan on the stradivarius bought a house in the hills above kamakura which cost a fortune and had long since paid the loan on her mothers little apartment but she didnt know what else to do driving didnt interest her she always had a small ronda but hated the crowded roads and was always relieved to get out of the machine she felt awkward and conspicuous in very expensive clothes and couldnt see the point of jewellery you worried about she saved for want of anything better to do and thought vaguely about founding a school in her later years mr moriya decided she was right to go for quality rather than quantity and renegotiated her contract with the orchestra she started to ration public appearances and only recorded when she absolutely had to western music critics who heard her made flattering comparisons she thought about going to europe but kept putting it off she was looking forward to travelling on the transsiberian railway but it seemed like something she should do only once each way to reduce it to some sort of absurdist commuter journey each year would seem like sacrilege and was anyway nervous of actually playing in europe at first she had worried that nobody would want to listen to her then when it became clear they did that shed been built up too highly and theyd be disappointed mr moriya to her surprise didnt try to pressure her into going he seemed content to let the offers mount up the venues increase in size and the proposed money inflate she fell into the music whenever she played it was real colourful her life for all the friends and holidays and for all the respect of other musicians and adulation of audiences seemed if not actually monochrome then missing some vital component as if one colour was missing one gun in the set misfiring so infecting the image with its absence one day she trudged through the woods north of fuji taking the old path shed first travelled as little more than a child struggling with her waterwarped and saltstained cello and case when she got to the bald summit of the hill the little clearing where shed watched fuji dance in the flames shed made she discovered it had become a picnic area half a dozen smiling chattering families sat at stout wooden tables unpacking boxes spreading dishes opening bottles taking their rubbish to cheerfully bright plastic bins which said thank you when you fed them childrens laughter filled the place and smoke from a portable barbecue wavered like some incipient genie in front of the view of fuji western pop music tinkled from a ghetto blaster hanging from a tree she turned and walked away and never went there again she was halfway across the kilometre of dark water between the nadia and the nakodo when the radio came alive in her trouser pocket the noise startled her made her let go of the throttle clutch at her thigh where the speech was coming from she pulled the radio out hey sucre she let the geminis engine idle looked round at the lights of the ships arturo arturo la nadia allo yo venceristas en la nadia muchachos it was dandridges voice chuckling despertad vosotros she heard other voices in the background more spanish too quick for her to follow eventually sucre anybody hello hello god damn it you guys hello hello hello jesus the radio went dead she looked round to the lights of the nakodo she switched the engine off it was very quiet she remembered the nightscope on the ak shed taken from sucres cabin lifted the gun and sighted the view of the nakodos hull was dim grey and grainy there was no movement on the deck or in the bridge though it was hard to tell in the bridge because the lights there were almost too bright for the nightsight she dropped the sight watched the pontoon and the steps down to it still nothing she kept watching and kept checking the radio thinking she had somehow turned it off then she heard something behind her she swung steadied the sight on the nadia she swept the ship stem to stern and found a gemini heading round from the rear of the ship making for the pontoon one man that was all she could see she put the gun down started the engine up again and swung the inflatable back towards the nadia she kept checking with the rifle nightsight in case whoever was in the gemini approaching the ship showed any signs of having heard or seen her but the inflatable just motored on slowing for the pontoon shed left a few minutes earlier she was a couple of hundred metres away from the nadia when the other boat docked one man got out she saw him raise one arm to his face here said the radio the man hefted a rifle started up the steps towards the nadias deck she kept on motoring towards the ship she was watching the single figure climb towards the top of the steps when he stopped he looked down towards the pontoon the view she had was made shaky by the progress of her own boat through the waves she let go the throttle the gemini coasted forward dropping and dying in the water the man brought something up from his waist wait said the radio the gemini the other one did anybody she saw him raise something else to his face to his eyes held like a pair of binoculars he looked down then out scanning looked straight towards her holy sh arturo hello who is she had to look to find the safety flicked it and resighted the rifle filled the world with sound the sight flared with the guns own flame holy sh the radio said again she had the impression of bullets flying and falling she brought the gun up kicking against her shoulder fire came back from the ship halfway up the steps to the deck she dropped the rifle hearing distant tinny echoes of firing coming back from behind her reflected from the boxy hull of the nakodo she found the heavy machinegun lifted it rattling from the bottom of the gemini she supported it as best she could fired the gun kicked against her shoulder almost throwing her over the stern of the boat lazy lines of tracer swung round heading towards the nadia spiralling into the night sky the gemini was turning forced round by the weight of flung metal arching away from her towards the distant ship return fire flickered from the ships hull she cursed dropped forward hearing splashy pops of bullets striking the water somewhere in front of her she steadied the big machinegun on the bulbous prow of the gemini swinging the inverted v of its barrelsupport into place on the taut rubber of the bows in the ships own glow she could make out enough of the steps and pontoon to see where to aim light glittered there by the time the noise arrived she was firing the tracer helped she swung the stuttered trail and raised it until the trail ended where the firing had been coming from the gemini was starting to swing again the belt of bullets clinked and clattered like a bottling plant beneath her the cartridges were thrown out to one side hissing as they hit the waters of the lake hey get ah son of a bitch the radio came alive again with dandridges voice she paused and through the radio heard clinks and slaps that died away and guessed those noises were her bullets hitting the hull of the ship get over here you motherfuckers ah shit the sound of something thumping and clattering she fired again the chain of bullets ripped its way up into the gun and finished she spun round grabbed the ammunition box found the end of the cartridge belt and snapped the gun open hauling the weight of articulated belt up fumbling with the first round until it clicked into place and she could close the breech mechanism again she fired once more having to angle out over the starboard bow of the inflatable as it twisted in the water swung by the recoil she put the guns stock down felt for the ak and studied the nightsight against the nadias hull a figure limped and fell down the last few steps to the pontoon threw itself behind the deflated corpse of the black gemini hey hey said the radio come on who is that we coming jefe she took the radio up clicked the button that fell beneath her thumb mr dandridge she said she leant forward took up the machinegun again shifting it to the side of the gemini aiming at the pontoon dimly seen against nadias hull whasheeit ms onoda dandridge coughed laughed our little yellow friend that you out there with the heavy weaponry she clicked the send button again hello she said jesus aitch i do believe it is you still alive no she said the gemini was still drifting she took up the ak again scanning the grey view the nakodo still showed no sign of life le cercle was hidden behind the stern of the nadia she listened for engines ha ms onoda the radio cut out came back dandridge wheezed dead and kicking huh who the hell taught you to shoot like that she didnt reply she checked the machinegun again put it down and went back to the stern of the boat restarted the outboard whatve you been doing lady what you been up to how come you got a radio she angled the inflatable parallel with the ship sent it in the direction of the nadias bows away from the course a boat from either of the other two ships would take dandridge had come from le cercle not the nakodo the ak sight still showed nothing happening on or near the nakodo ms onoda talk to me youre screwing things up here i think i deserve a little explanation lets talk did i hit you she asked putting down the assault rifle to talk into the radio just a scratch as we say in the trade dandridge laughed you dont cease to amaze me maam hell what you got against us he laughed again you comfortable mr dandridge she said hell never felt better how about you same here she was within fifty metres of the nadias port bow she swung the gemini round until it was pointing back towards the pontoon she let the throttle go killed the engine and went forwards to shift the machinegun to the inflatables bows again great well look we seem to have a minor disagreement here but im sure we can talk it out i just want you to know i personally dont bear you any ill will you know she heard him grunt imagined him shifting position on the pontoon she took another look through the nightsight no movement but this is a real stupid way to negotiate you know i realise you have your own point of view and all but i want to talk to you for a moment and i hope youll do me the honour of listening right there are aspects to what were trying to do here that i dont think you fully appreciate now you dont have to tell me that every umm aspect of these guys behaviour has been everything you might expect under the geneva convention and all but she held one of the little metal legs of the machinegun down on to the pliant rubber with her left hand squeezed the trigger with the index finger of the right the gun tried to leap it barked and rattled and hissed fire trailed out across the water calm enough to reflect it in places and raised white feathers of water around the pontoon she heard dandridge shout as she paused adjusted the gun pulsed against her shoulder again tracer bowing and falling she saw sparks then a ball of flame as the jerrycans on the pontoon ignited she looked up the little mushroom of fire rose rolling doughnutlike against the dark hull gathering itself under and through like a woman hoisting her skirts beneath it a neck of flame throbbed in and out and fire spilled over the deck of the pontoon spreading over the waters to either side she put the gun down hot damn ms onoda good shooting dandridge shouted from the radio outstanding just when i was starting to feel cold well thank you maam she felt back into the pile of weaponry in the bottom of the gemini found what she was looking for and lifted it she turned away from the distant light of the burning pontoon and used the cigarette lighter from her breast pocket to inspect the device jefe shut up maam you have me quite incredibly impressed you should be on our side and i mean that as a compliment i really do and thats what i want to talk to you about see theres things in all this i dont think you fully understand we are talking about the geopolitical situation here what i mean is you actually are on our side if you only knew it i mean that youre a mercantile nation this is about what matters to you too ah hell ms onoda its all about trade yes trade trade and spheres of influence and and opportunities the possibility of influence and power you still listening ms onoda keep talking she said absently wishing she knew more about the cyrillic alphabet good we have to keep talking thats very important i think thats very important dont you think thats important ms onoda she lifted the weight to her shoulder tried a couple of switches the device whined but the sight stayed dark she tried different sequences found a trigger guard and pushed it up and forward the whine altered its tone well im sure you do youre one sensible lady i can tell that very sensible and very clever and very sensitive i hope we can talk as equals and thats just what i intend to do see the great have to stoop sometimes ms onoda to stay great you have to stoop no ways round that you can try and distance yourself from the people who do the stooping i mean distance yourself from the cutting edge but it still remains your responsibility you have to do bad things in a bad world if you want to stay able to be good do you understand that i mean theres all these people think goodness and rightness is somehow indivisible but it isnt cant be in fact its a razors edge ms onoda a real razors edge you have to balance you have to keep working you know you try to stop you ever think you got it all taped so well you can just let things drift and youre dead not the next day not the next year even but soon and it starts as soon as you let go romans found that the spanish and the english too you got to remain dynamic or you fall down you sink into your own indulgence you get decadent free society free society like americas that sort of stuff is bubbling away under the surface all the time always people want to have a quiet life be hippies live in what they think is peace and damn it it might be for a little while but she clicked a button the sight came alive grainier than the rifles nightsight but the boiling stem of fire on the pontoon showed bright like a vivid tear in the night centring the whine became a guttural coughing noise a protesting damaged clock stuttering in her ear red symbols lit up above the display she squeezed the trigger there was a moment of hesitation and she almost put the missile launcher down preparing to look at it again but while she was still waiting just starting to wonder what shed done wrong this time and what shed have to do to make the thing work it happened the tube shook hammered her shoulder kicked against her neck and the side of her head the noise was not a noise it was the end of sound an editing mark that cut her off from the world beyond her suddenly deadened ears flame burst around her it swept narrowed funnelled while she was still trying to cope with the image of herself the backwash of light had thrown before her over the grey plastic of the geminis bows and the rippled lake beyond the spark roared across the waters dipping swinging spiralling it met the bloom of flame on the pontoon and burst the explosion seemed not to start she thought she must have blinked and missed the start it was suddenly there white yellow a jagged splayed froth of incandescence already falling collapsing dimming through orange and red the noise came through the ringing in her ears and was followed by its echo once sharply then more muffled versions fading and disappearing jeje she heard through the radio then allá the water jumped around the gemini the inflatable shuddered as she threw the sam launcher away and saw the flickering light of gunfire over to her right the gemini shook again and she heard a hissing noise sparks struck off the engine and the dying zinging noise of ricochets filled the air above as more white fountains leapt into the air in front of her the gemini bucked under her and the engine stopped suddenly she had one hand on the side of the inflatable and felt it go soft under her fingers the flickering light went on three or four ragged points of fire she threw herself backwards out of the boat into the water oneiric the water was strange and cloying insinuating through the fabric of the fatigues slicking the material against her skin she took a deep breath sounded struggling through the black water away from the gemini the bullets hitting the water made deep thrumming noises starting loud and violent quickly fading the high whine of the other inflatables outboard drilled through the water under the percussive bullet beats the boots were holding her back and dragging her down she came up for air twisting her head to look back at the inflatable still dishearteningly close she brought one foot then the other up hauling the loose boots off she hyperventilated as she watched the other boat was hidden by the one shed just jumped from but the noise of the firing swarmed through the air above her water burst whitely around the gemini she tore the remaining grenade from her breast and unbuckled the belt as she turned took a last deep breath and dived again heading away grenade and belt sank from her fingers into the dark lake she swam under water until she thought her mouth was about to open of its own accord and the darkness in front of her eyes had turned to a dreamy pulsing purple then she came up surfacing as quietly as she could still no sign of the other boat but the firing was much louder and the gemini shed been on was halfcollapsed in the water shaking and bouncing as shots tore into it sparks flew from the outboard casing and as she watched fire burst from the inflatable at the stern first as the outboards fuel tank finally gave way then along the length of the craft the jerry can must have ruptured she didnt know if the plastique would explode or not she gulped air sounded and angled away hearing and feeling a last few shots thump into the water then the firing stopped the note of the outboard was deepening slowing she waited for the blast and shock of the explosion but it didnt come then her lungs burned and she surfaced once again carefully she looked back the second inflatable was silhouetted against the endtoend flames of her gemini three or four men the outboard revved and the gemini curved away from the burning inflatable heading in the direction shed swum at first she went under just as the ammunition on the burning gemini started to detonate it made a series of frenzied booming bursts of noise all but obliterating the sound of the outboard she swam until she thought she was about to black out heading almost at right angles to the direction shed taken initially the outboard when she could hear it sounded distant the next time she looked the ammunition in the burning boat had reached the finale tracer erupted into the night sky like fireworks there was no sign of the other gemini she took another deep breath an explosion kicked her and she thought the plastique had blown but then another came and another and the outboard noise whined closer she wriggled away changing course realising they were using grenades when she had to come up she tried not to make any noise the gemini was twenty metres away lit by flames four men one with what looked like a set of stubby largelensed binoculars another threw something ahead and to port something splashed into the water ten or fifteen metres away from her she wanted to dive then but didnt she watched the man with the nightscope swing round towards her the grenade blew pounding her squeezing her she heard herself gasp with the pain of it though the noise was hidden in the roar of the water bursting and fluting out above the grenade just as the man scanning the waves came round to face her she sounded slipping under the surface the out board grumbled and spat this time close then it whined again roared past her another grenade close enough to hammer her ears but not as painful as the one before when she next surfaced they were a hundred metres away the light from the burning gemini was waning she heard the sound of the fire through the ringing that had reestablished itself in her ears like an old friend after a few more grenades the four men in the inflatable broke off and went to look at what was left of the nadias pontoon they cruised up and down that part of the ships hull tiny voices calling jefe jefe señor dandridge she swam a little closer wanting to see for herself the nadias own lights and the dregs of the flames licking round the gutted gemini shone upon the pontoon where dandridge had been a small fire burned there still in the ripped fragments of the pontoons wooden planks and empty oil drums one of the men in the boat was scanning the water with the nightscope another shone a torch the nadias dark hull rose behind them like a cliff glistening in the dying orange light of the foundering gemini they called dandridges name a few more times then one of them pointed at the water and shouted the outboard was silent but the boat surged forward white under the bow then fell and slowed again one of the men pulled something out of the water they shone a torch on it whatever it was it wasnt very big and none of them said anything it splashed when they threw it back the black gemini creased white from the surface of the lake curving round and taking them back to the pontoon two of them picked their way across the wreckage and went up the steps hisako looked back at the burning gemini lit by the flames on what was left of its own crumpled bows it slipped sternfirst into the waves she trod water moving a little all she time letting the waves break over her ducking her head under the water now and again torchlight swung haphazardly about the black gemini waiting at the ruined pontoon the men on the ship were gone some time once she sat in a train beneath the bottom of the sea the line from honshu to hokkaido had long since been completed the tunnel ran under the waters of the tsugarukaikyo for thirty kilometres beneath the autumn fogs and the winter storms from one island to the other she took the train rather than the ferry between late autumn and spring and whenever the weather forecast was bad one december day her train broke down ten kilometres from land under a raging sea people talked nervously theyd been told over the intercom a relief engine was on its way there was no danger the guard came down the carriages reassuring people personally conversations started between strangers children played in the aisle but she still sat looking out of the window into the stony darkness it had been black while they were moving it was black now theyd stopped she found you could ignore the reflections as long as nobody moved the strad occupied the seat next to her she wasnt afraid she thought some people were just because they were no longer moving because something had gone wrong and things might continue to go wrong and it all might end in disaster but she didnt think anything like that would happen what would happen would be a long boring wait then the journey resumed some of the conversations maintained some allowed to end finally everybodys own arrival along the line or in sapporo some met with smiles and helping hands some walking quickly away heads down breath steaming from their mouths and noses scattering for taxis cars buses and subway trains life was not exotic even disasters were almost welcome sometimes she put her elbow on the table in front of her her chin in her hand and studied her own dark reflection in the glass she was glad of the breakdown things could work too smoothly this was like a time out somehow even when there was time to think there was never time to think all her life was taken care of each month and week and day and hour ascribed a certain function filled with duties and performances or left precisely blank for the pan of her existence that was not encased by music for friends and relaxation and holidays holidays most of the people she knew hardly had any but she took days and weeks off all the time and could not understand how everybody else got by with so little she was meant to enjoy her work more than most but she kept trying to escape from it whatever this interlude stuck in a train in a tunnel at night beneath the sea bed while the cold waves rolled and the spray filled the gale seemed like a bonus a siding now unexpectedly she could take a step back from her life and think properly she felt she needed to sanae nantomi wanted to marry her the water was warm the fatigues trapped a layer at blood heat she felt strong and she knew she could tread water for hours it was practically resting the men on the ship came back to the rail she could hear the shock and anger in their voices even over that distance even without knowing the words muerto she heard over and again she knew what that meant could make that out all right muerto muerto muerto muerto muerto muerto muerto muerto the small fire on the pontoon guttered and went out the men rejoined the gemini and took the inflatable back to le cercle she followed it was a long swim theyd met at a reception his reception arranged by the orchestra in honour of his return to japan after ten almost unbroken years in europe first studying then composing and conducting then zooming to sudden fame as the glamorous new orchestral star of paris europe the world the cover of newsweek invitations everywhere documentaries on television a film made about his tour through the soviet union with the halle which had been surprisingly funny pleased the critics enough to win prizes at cannes and made money on general release dates with starlets and models a series of tv commercials for expensive parisian colognes plus a workload her conducting colleagues shook their heads over young as he was hed burn out shed seen the newsweek cover san as the gaijin had decided to call him even looked like a film star jetblack hair long and ringleted inherited from his eurasian mother wild around a bright pale hawkish face rarely photographed without a smile a grin a smirk when there was no smile on his face he just looked broodingly romantic he was still only thirty but he looked much less newsweek had made much of the number of pop idols ripped from teenage girls bedroom walls to be replaced by san grinning down at once rakish and shy head lowered eyes halfhidden behind a tangled black fringe shed been appalled the performances shed heard of his were good full of fire and drama without being brash innovative without being contemptuous of previous interpretations he could conduct certainly but why all the rest such wilful selfpromotion seemed vulgar egotistical shed already decided not to go to the reception even before the invitation arrived most of the others in the orchestra were excited at the thought of meeting him only a few of the older men didnt seem too impressed with the idea but she wouldnt go to his court she wouldnt pay homage to the boy wonder thirty she thought the child she suddenly remembered when thirty had seemed ancient she was thirtysix and had never felt old before then she thought shed have gone anyway if it was anybody else and besides there was a music journalist recently back from the states shed had her eye on for a while this would be an ideal opportunity to get talking to him she would go she just wouldnt ask to be introduced to the newsweek coverboy she went through about half her clothes before she decided on the right thing not too dowdy but not something that looked as though it was trying to catch the eye of the media star a westernlooking black suit jacket cut high like a male flamenco dancers slim skirt with a discreet slit there more for mobility than excitement white silk shirt and sheer black stockings flat black shoes because the journalist wasnt tall she went late in case they had some sort of formal receiving line set up at the start the journalist had a bad cold and left before she had time to do more than exchange pleasantries and check he wasnt there with anybody else she almost went then but didnt she wandered a little sampled the buffet was talked to variously she decided to go home and read a book as soon as the first bore even approached mr okamoto bowed to her as she turned away from the buffet table holding a little paper plate sanae naritomi stood at his side beaming at her dressed she thought rather in the style of a mississippi gambler he stuck one long white hand out to her as okamoto said naritomisan asked to be introduced to you she shifted the plate from one hand to the other he shook her hand bowed as well thank you mr okamoto ms onoda ive wanted to meet you for years i have all your recordings he flashed white teeth tossed his hair quite naturally and with a may i took a roll of salmon from her plate and popped it in his mouth okamoto had gone she hadnt noticed delicious naritomi said mmm i hope we can work together id count that a privilege well she said unsettled putting the plate down behind her on the table then taking it back up again in case he thought she was being rude and had only done it to stop him taking any more food she felt warm well she said again feeling foolish and tonguetied as he probably expected all women to be with him i do play with the orchestra as youre going to guest were bound to work together ah he snapped his fingers shook his head quickly i mean more closely than that id be honoured to accompany you sometime and i have some pieces probably not very good probably not much better than my barely competent piano playing shed heard his barely competent piano playing he could probably have had a career as a concert pianist if he hadnt chosen conducting but id be just he shook his head clapped his hands together softly she wondered if the scent she could smell was the same cologne he advertised delighted if youd play them ive always loved the cello and your playing especially im serious i really hope youll do this for me but hey he slapped one hand gently off his forehead mocking the theatricality of the gesture with a grin i shouldnt be coming on like this should i what happened to small talk first huh i should soften you up with more embarrassing praise and tell you how much i love being back in japan and yes it was a good flight and yes i do wear the stuff i advertise on television and no the gaijin dont really but now im rambling yes im just nervous these salmon things taste really good you know do you mind if i he stood smiling eating she realised she was smiling too even more broadly and wondered how long shed looked like that she nodded bit down on her lips a little to help control herself im sure we can arrange something she said they talked eventually he was dragged away to meet the sony top brass who were sponsoring some of the concerts dont try to escape without saying goodbye he called back to her she nodded throat dry face hot eyes wide and looked for a cooling calming drink he begged her to stay an extra halfhour to the end when she tried to leave there was a party in his suite in the new otani he insisted pleaded more talk at the party then the last halfdozen of them went to a gaijin club in roppongi in the small hours san played lightningfast backgammon with a onearmed australian yes he had fished for shark no a car accident exchanged jokes with a mountainous yakuza gangster with tattooed eyelids and then played piano in the bar he borrowed a waitresss little leather bag and stuck it on his head to do an impression of chico marx plinking the keyboard with one flicked pistollike finger at dawn he took the hired mercedes down to the docks at yokohama in the back seat the other two survivors an earlybalding television producer and a glamorous longlegged advertising exec had fallen asleep during the drive and sat slumped on the brown leather his shining head on her padded sequined shoulder san looked vaguely disappointed theyd given up the fight for fun he shrugged they got out san breathed in the dawn then stood looking at the sleeping couple in the back of the merc with a great grin on his face it was the smile people normally wore when gazing at tiny babies dont they look sweet he said then turned and walked down to the edge of the dock and stood looking out over the misty lengths of ships and warehouses to where the dim red sun rose above the masts cranes and derricks of the port horns sounded the air was cool and the breeze smelled of the ocean he put his jacket over a bollard for her and sat at her feet legs dangling over the edge of the empty dock looking down at the sluggish water where halfwaterlogged planks and windskittery grey lumps of polystyrene foam bobbed together on a film of oil he took out a silver cigarette case she hadnt seen him smoke then she smelled the hash do you he asked offering her the joint after a couple of tokes she took it he said ive kept you up thats ok had fun uhhuh she passed the joint back think we can get on i think we are didnt want to like me at first did you he looked up at her no she agreed surprised but i didnt hold out for long does everybody give in so quickly oh no he said some people never get to like me there was silence for a moment she heard the water lap watched steam plume from the funnel of a freighter half a mile away and heading for the sea and then heard its horn echoing off the warehouses and hulls around them announcing its farewell he handed her back the spliff did you sleep with all those film stars she asked him he laughed one or two he looked up at her im a man of easy virtue hisako easily led astray she nodded through the smoke feeling dizzy im afraid so he said stretching his arms up behind his back as though in a gesture of surrender then reaching in and scratching the back of his neck vigorously yeah she said studying the end of the joint same here he gave a sort of coughing laugh looked at her really really dangerous these days but she gave him the joint back yes of course but he nodded looked out to the departing ship in the distance he took a deep breath umm yes do you think yes i might be able to tempt yes you back to his voice slowed as he looked round at her yes my hotel he grinned yes she rounded the stern of the nadia struck out for le cercle the water stayed warm and the waves small she swam steadily trying to find a rhythm that suited her body and the water and felt halfhypnotised she thought she heard thunder a few times the wind did stiffen eventually and the water became more choppy the nadia fell slowly behind her the ship leaving for the open sea that misty dawn at yokohama years ago an ocean away had been a general cargo freighter she wondered vaguely what the chances were it had been the nadia le cercles pontoon was brightly lit the rest of the ship looked dark in comparison there was a man on the pontoon scanning the waters with a nightscope she angled away towards the tankers bows lightning flashed beyond the hills to the northwest and thunder rolled across the dark lake vague and long after rain was starting to patter down around her as she swam under the darkondark cliff of the ships port bow fairy tale she told her reflection in the dark train window too good to be true brilliant and handsome and now only a few months later he wanted them to be true only to each other and to be married and to live together hed stay in japan never fly again if she wanted she told him not to be crazy and worried that he might have been even halfserious and have children if she wanted he loved her wanted her was made whole by her sometimes he made her feel half her age sometimes twice it he could make her feel like a teenager impressed by anothers antics one second struck dumb by his devotion ardour indeed the next other times he seemed so energetically enthusiastic and excited and even innocent even naive she felt like a grandmother shaking her head over the wild excesses of youth knowing it would come to no good grumbling it would end in tears shed said shed go to see her mother think it over talk it over he wanted to come too but she wouldnt let him hed been subdued and sad at the station and only brightened when he saw a flower seller and bought so many roses she could hardly carry them shed left all but one with the guard too embarrassed to cart them through the train the one shed kept lay on the table in front of her its dark image on the table reflected in the rockbacked window glass she rolled the rose around on the table holding its stem and watching the velvet soft petals flatten and spring back as they took the flowers weight on the table surface then released it again she wondered what to tell her mother shed kept the whole affair secret from her as she always did she didnt know if her mother had heard anything through the gossip pages or not she didnt normally read them and hisako didnt think any of her mothers friends did either but well it would either come as a surprise or not there wasnt anything she could do about it now what would her mother say she felt a heaviness in her at the thought her mother would probably be delighted and encourage her she wondered what that heaviness meant she kept on rolling the rose to and fro to and fro how happy she might become she thought how happy and fulfilled and content she put her thumb on a thorn and pressed felt the pain and watched a tiny bright bead of red form on the pale surface she had spent she thought so much time playing music with the feeling that this was to compensate that she did it to add to life to make restitution she had lived quietly if not virtuously and if she took time off she always knew shed play better at the end of it shed kept her head down never tried too hard to enjoy herself beyond her own pleasure in the music the occasional lover and a small group of friends she wasnt supposed to make too much of life wasnt supposed to glory in her own existence too fully too vivaciously because after a while she stopped rolling the flower to and fro on the table and took the single red rose and shut it in the cello case she still hadnt made up her mind when distant clanking noises and a single rocking judder pulsing down the carriages announced the arrival of the relief engine people clapped as the train moved life resumed and she kept on thinking round and round she didnt deserve it but then how many people ever had just what they deserved happen to them it would be hell hed philander he was younger after all it would pass this sudden rush of enthusiasm or theyd grow together and he would always love what would always be there in her what he must love anyway because she wasnt half so attractive as all those film stars and models no it was too much shed make a fool of herself but life was short and something had to happen her mother was at the station bright and full of life looking younger than hisako could remember she was excited didnt mention the threehour wait she must know hisako thought wearily mrs onoda took her daughters arm she wanted hisako to be the first to know a new friend a wonderful man she was sorry shed kept it quiet but people talked and she had wanted to wait until it was official she just knew hisako would like him too she was so happy and think now you wont be a halforphan any more hisako smiled said she was very happy for her flushed the rose down the toilet that evening she found the buoy climbed up on to it the rain came down in big unseen drops cold and hard she rested a few minutes looking up at the inverted v the tankers bows made above her the shape was more imagined than seen the lights above were few and dim the rain came harder raking her face she sighed looked down then shrugged stood on the slightly tipped slick top surface of the buoy and took hold of the hawser sweeping up to the ship she gripped it wet but not oily she wrapped her legs round it too gripping it with her ankles tensing her legs she reached up and pulled with her arms no problem she went on up by the time she got to the top the rain was crashing down like pebbles off the back of a dumper truck thunder bellowed in the hills she peeped through the hawse pipe saw only dim greyblack deck and spattering rain she stuck her head through remembering the cameras they were pointed sternwards away from her she crawled through on to the deck and found cover behind a winch housing rain clattered around her she raised her head again looking down the pipecluttered length of deck to the island of superstructure she wondered what to do now why was she doing this because because she couldnt think of anything better to do she laughed quietly to herself and shivered inside the clinging fatigues they had the red lights on in the bridge she could see somebody moving there in the dry red warmth lightning lit the starboard side of the ship throwing electric blue shadows over the white cliff of the superstructure not a weapon to her name she thought not a thing to wield even the knife had gone when she took the belt off she saw movement and a uniform appeared in the rainscattered distance coming up from the steps to the pontoon from the blazing fan of rain under the lights into the shadow of the lower deck she watched the soldier as he was met by another tiny figure they disappeared into the ship shortly afterwards the remaining lights went out all over the tanker leaving only the red nightlights of the bridge burning she was surprised at first thinking that if they were really afraid of some sort of attack they ought to floodlight the vessel but then she remembered the nightscopes perhaps it made sense after all at first sight anyway she let her eyes adjust she could see them on the bridge far away there were several all watching through the nightscopes at first she could see a place to hide under a nearby pipe cluster so that if they turned on the lights again and used the television cameras or came out looking she could hide there were two soldiers looking out after a while then only one sitting on a stool near midships in the bridge sweeping from side to side and now and again getting up to look from each wing of the bridge the thunder crashed and the lightning flickered overhead lighting up the ships and hills and islands after one flash and while the man with the nightscope was looking out to port she jumped over the first breakwater she waited for the same conjunction before tackling the next breakwater then wriggled along the rainslicked deck to the shelter of the main trunk lines under the pipes she felt relatively safe and had a clear run or crawl along half the deck to the midships valvehead cluster where the pumps and switch gear were sited that accepted and discharged the cargo lightning flashed blue images of the pipe network above her across the deck catching a million falling raindrops in an instant of falling she started edging forward she scraped and slid and coasted along the wet deck blinking the rain out of her eyes she pulled with her hands and elbows pushed with her feet she tried to think about what she ought to do but nothing suggested itself she suspected shed had her share of luck that night and these rattled jumpy soldiers were not going to fall as easily as those on the nadia that had been a happy hunting ground this felt wrong her crotch itched she stopped and scratched raw and despite it all she ought to have taken the time to have a proper bath but there you were she hadnt had the time and suddenly without warning she was sick there was little enough in her stomach so it was mostly bile but she watched what there was come out and tried to do it as silently as possible while feeling the deepest surprise this was unexpected she hadnt felt sick she forced the last heave spat then rolled over under a welded collar between two lengths of pipe above her where the rain was dripping so hard and fast it was an almost unbroken stream she let the water splash into her mouth rinsing and spitting and rinsing and spitting and then swallowing and swallowing huh she said to herself she got back on her front and kept on crawling the rain would soon rinse the sickness away thered be no sign for them to find the lightning glare burst through the pipes above and threw black bars across her back she got to the valve cluster and paused looked up at the bridge again through the pounding lines of rain she watched for a while just the one man then two more came from behind they held what looked like a sam launcher one of them took the nightscope and stood scanning the deck she had to duck now and again but watched when she could it looked as though one of them was showing the man on the bridge how to work the launcher holding it up sighting letting the other man repeat the actions she ducked at each flash of lightning the lightning was closer now the thunder louder she stayed ducked after one flash thinking she looked around her checking the bow cameras but unable to see which way they were pointing through the driving rain she shivered again in the cool wash of water glueing the fatigues to her skin and ran her hand over the roughpainted surface of the valvehead controls her hand stopped invisible she patted the metal hatch cover the catches came undone easily and the hatch swung open she waited darkness for a long time then a brilliant flash leaving an afterimage it was difficult to decide whether the controls here were set out similarly to those on the bridge which she thought she could just about remember she remembered something else and decided she was sufficiently hidden from the bridge by the high thick pipes of the valve cluster she took out the cigarette lighter from the fatigues breast pocket it sputtered clicking she blew on it shook it hard then tried it again using her other hand as an umbrella the lighter hissed made a series of clicking noises at the same time then lit the clicking noises stopped still sheltering it she held the little yellow flame to the open white cavity of the pump controls the flame lessened shrank and the hiss decreased she shook the lighter but its light continued to fade running out never mind shed seen all she wanted she snapped the lighter off peeped at the bridge no sign of concern just the one man scanning the rain sang on the metal deck and pipes around her she waited the lightning preceded the thunder by ten seconds then by five then one or two she put her hands on the switches lightning flared and thunder bellowed all around the ship probably hit it she guessed she turned the switches the echoes of the thunder were still dying away as the pumps beneath her feet started up making the deck thrum red lights appeared in front of her eyes she heard hisses and gurgles then over the noise of the rain the rumble of the thick oil pouring out through the pipes and into the lake she wondered how long it would take them to realise she watched the bridge for a few seconds nothing same man same actions quite undisturbed she felt the deck tremble as the pumps pulled the oil from the tanks and threw it into the lake she watched the man on the red length of the bridge for a while longer her eyes screwed up trying to drill her sight through the waves of rain nothing nada hadnt even seen the damn stuff spewing out from the sides of the ship hadnt noticed the lights on the cargohandling board on the bridge she looked at the lighter in her hand thought about trying to set fire to the torrent of oil pouring from the pumps over the side of the boat and into the lake then looked up mouth opening into the night and with a last hurried look at the lighter put it away squatted on her haunches and thought she nodded once to herself then spent a long time looking through the rain through a small space between two pipes she reckoned would screen her from the nightscope and the lightning watching the man on the bridge she started to worry about the lightning after a while she got dizzy with tiredness the storm was departing the rain had settled to a steady downpour the lightning had become less dramatic and urgent the thunder less immediate and crackly she felt the deck resound beneath her and lay down in the pouring rain only halfsheltered by the thick pipes above she curled up and slept hisako onoda dreamed of a lake full of blood and a sky full of fire she watched from the depths of space and saw a great lever strike the world it rang false and shattered disintegrating into all the separate states and creeds beliefs and prejudices that had riven it over the years blowing like seeds from a flower she kept waking up thinking shed heard steps or voices or maybe she only thought she kept waking up she thought later blood and fire the dreams were always there waiting for her when she drifted off again when she did awake properly finally the rain was gone the first light of dawn was trying to burrow under the dark lid of the sky the deck still trembled beneath her the air smelled thick and the lake was full of blood the heart of the universe her father died three months before she was born she had never been held by him they told her she was lucky all the same she might have been born deformed it was years after the pikadon and maybe hed have died of cancer anyway that was the way it worked by statistics it came down to probabilities a cellular image of the jeopardising indeterminacies that lay beneath the physical world and were its absolute but absolutely uncertain foundations so maybe the bomb did kill him eventually or maybe it didnt theyd opened him up hoping to deal with the tumour in his belly but when they saw what was inside him they just closed the incision again he stayed in hospital went home for a while to be with his pregnant wife but after a few weeks the pain got so bad they took him back into the hospital once more hed been with his unit in kaita a town a few kilometres from the city suburbs when the pikadon came theyd seen the lone bomber from the barracks tiny in the sky one of the men claimed hed seen the bomb itself a dot falling they heard the sirens from the city went back to cleaning their rifles then another sun lit the parade ground and the barrack buildings they shielded their eyes felt the heat and watched dumbly while the light faded slowly and the vast cloud rose soundlessly into the sky like the leg of a giant boot that had stamped upon the city the noise came much later like continuous heavy thunder on the way to the city to help they met the burned people and once passed a group of soldiers young men like themselves but looking like black men stumbling along in a crocodile line down the dusty road each man with one hand on the shoulder of the man in front following the leader the soldier at the head of the strange silent column had one eye left the others were all blind they werent negroes they were japanese theyd been closer and watched the bomb all the way until it exploded in the air above the city and that was the last thing they were ever to see the light had melted their eyes the fluids were still wet on their charcoalblack cheeks through the increasing damage and the smoking wreckage to the stripped centre where the buildings had almost all gone wiped from the groundplan of the city as though by an immense scrubbing brush on the walls he saw the shadows that had been people his unit stayed in hiroshima in the ruins and dust for a few days they did what they could ten years later a quarter of the men whod been there with him were dead eleven years later so was he his widow went into labour just down the corridor from where hed died hisako got tangled in her own cord stuck and struggling and had to be removed by caesarean section pulled from her mothers womb by the same surgeon whod discovered the metastasising shadow of death in her father a season earlier sanae was the first lover shed ever told about it all she told him the night she told him she would not marry him and she cried as she told him thinking about her father and the man shed killed and about something else she hadnt told sanae about he looked hurt and meek and pleading like a beaten kid like a whipped dog she couldnt bear to look at him so said what she had to say to the cup of coffee before her they sat in a little kissaten in roppongi and he wanted to touch her to hold her hand to take her in his arms but she wouldnt let him couldnt risk him doing that and her dissolving giving in so she shrugged him off took her hand away shook her head he sat slumped and dejected on the stool while she told him but could not explain it just didnt feel right she wasnt ready shed hold him back he mustnt distract himself from his career she here she had to swallow hard fighting the tears again biting her lip hard squinting hot and angry into the brown dregs in the little white cup she didnt want to have children it was the truth but it was the hardest thing she could have said just then sanae left eventually in distress and despair unable to understand her tears collected in the bottom of the coffee cup turning the thick brown dregs watery again she had put off returning from sapporo and meeting him and telling him until the day before he left for los angeles for a month to do some studio work she had the abortion while he was away and the world went on hisako onoda woke to shouts and general consternation and felt annoyed that her sleep had been disturbed the deck was hard the morning was cold and she yawned awake aching and shivering and feeling like shit itching and pained and with the hangoverlike feeling that there was something very terrible shed have to remember soon and face the air stank of oil mist clung to the hills hovered in discreet little clouds over the islands elsewhere there was mist too over the broad waters of the lake not near by though save on the ship itself near by the lake was thick and brown and perfectly deathly calm wisps of vapour were still rising from the broad pipecluttered deck of the tanker just parting enough now to reveal the gush of oil from the valve cluster spreading in a dirty brown arc as it fell to the lake the ship sat under a stem of mist in a cauldron of clarity surrounded by cloud she sat up at once thrilled and appalled the oil stretched as far as the nearest islands as far as the nakodo almost as far as she could see the unsullied lake was just a blue sparkle beneath the mist in the distance a disc she thought a great grubby brown coin of thick glistening stinking oil floating on the waters of the lake like a vast wet bruise she looked to the bridge harder to see now the sun was up vague movements behind the tipped glass two soldiers leaning out of the open windows on the starboard wing of the bridge gesturing and shouting she checked the bow camera again but it was pointed away from her the pump controls were still set as shed left them and hadnt been shut off from the bridge she inspected them yawning and stretching no there wasnt anything she could do to make it any worse shed done all she could she checked the lighter but it was spent no hiss of gas and even the tiny clicks sounded tired now she put it back in her breast pocket she looked to the sky too much mist and low cloud to tell what the day would be like maybe cloudy maybe clear it could go both ways she realised that shed heard a weather forecast on the radio just the day before a day felt like a week a year forever whatever she couldnt remember the forecast wait and see she shivered again how stupid germs were she was probably going to die in the next few hours one way or the other and here she was maybe getting a cold what was the point the condemned man ate a hearty breakfast feast before seppuku she stretched again putting her arms out fists by shoulders then brought her hands to the back of her neck scratching vigorously you bastards she thought i remember sanae and i remember philippe but the last act ill take with me is yours squalid thrusting being egged on and waiting sneers of victory trying to judge the level of anguish and noise they wanted to cause so not too hysterical but not too placid a final acting a faking when in all her life shed never faked and had counted that strength made it a point of honour and theyd sullied everything a retrospective act casting a shadow all the way back to to hell this was a terrible thing that poor swede shed forgotten his name werner benny she thought you were meant never to forget the name of your first sanae was energetic and wild like a storm over her beneath her around her all gestures and noise still childlike in that adult act so selfabsorbed distracted and distracting almost funny philippe dived skin on skin in skin sweeping and plunging and such sweet encirclement concentric with his homed immersion quietly almost sadly studious in his abandoned absorption but if her life passed in front of her it would end with a gangbang and the applause would be the crackle of breaking bones and the spatter of spilled blood signature of her revenge well worse things happen at sea she thought and laughed out loud before shushing herself she was feeling almost happy resigned but oddly fulfilled and at peace at last when she thought of the dreams and the lake of blood in the past shed always coped shed put up with it with them dreams were dreams and took their cue from what had happened accessories after the act shed dismissed those shed been having recently as shed dismissed those shed always had but now they spoke of a lake of blood and it occurred to her that the brown slick of oil the great dumped flat platelet shed spread over the waters was a kind of blood blood of the planet blood of the human world the oilblood greased the world machine the bloodoil carried energy to the workings of the states and systems it welled and was pulled out bled to the surface was transfused and transported it was the messenger of soil and progress the refined lesson of its own development now a leech shed let it she was making the dream she hadnt meant to pretend to such authority hisako sat down heavily on her haunches staring out at the brown horizon of oil well she thought too late now she looked up at the sky she heard the shouts of the soldiers over the thunder of the pumps then stood again and peeped through the clutter of pipes watching the superstructure there was movement behind the glass of the bridge suddenly she heard clicks and buzzes to her left and leapt away from the pumpcontrol housing heart hammering dizzy with dread waiting for the shots there was nobody there the controls clicked again and the pumps whined down to silence the deck stilled she was tempted to switch the pumps back on again see who could overrule who with the controls but then they might guess she was there she left the controls alone and went back to watching through the square tangle of pipework after a few minutes three men appeared at the top of the steps which led down to the pontoon even from a distance the soldiers looked nervous and harried one was still pulling on his fatigue trousers they all held bags and rucksacks were weighed down with guns and missile launchers they looked as if they were arguing two disappeared down the steps to the pontoon the third seemed to be shouting back into the ship he dropped his rifle jumped picked the gun up quickly again looking round as though he expected to be attacked at any moment he shouted through the doorway again then he too ran for the steps the fourth man followed a minute later even more heavily laden than the rest he looked up the deck towards the bows and for a moment she was convinced he was looking straight at her he stayed in that position and her mouth went dry she wanted to duck but didnt the soldier was too far away and the gap she was looking through too small for him to be able to see her clearly at most she must be a slightly odd pale dot in the midst of the pipework he couldnt be sure the dot was a face only moving would settle the issue for him so she stayed still if he had binoculars shed just have to try and duck down as he brought them up to his eyes he moved turning to the gunwale and shouting down then going quickly to the steps disappearing down them she let her breath out she wondered if theyd use the outboard a military engine was probably safe to use on the oil in theory but she wasnt sure shed like to trust her life to it she crawled under and through the pipework towards the port rail when she was there she raised her head enough to glance over no sign of the gemini she was puzzled then afraid and glanced back at the top of the steps where they came through the gunwale fifty metres away shouts came from that direction but beneath where the pontoon was she edged closer to the rail craned her head out she found them the ship had risen so much that the steps which for months had ended virtually at water level now hung four or five metres above the pontoon which was itself near the end of its travel on the ropes attaching it to the ship it was canted at an angle of thirty degrees or more the hullside edge pointing up towards the dangling steps the soldiers were at the bottom of those steps lowering a wire ladder to the pontoon she edged back from the rail crawled to the centreline pipework and got up on the far side she kept duckeddown and ran sternwards towards the superstructure her naked feet slapped quietly the metal covering the halfempty tanks beneath her soles felt cool and still wet from the morning mists the soldiers were on the port side she entered the superstructure from starboard comparative silence le cercles donkey engine was still running creating that hardly audible subtly soothing whine shed grown used to in the nights aboard she crept to the nearest companionway listening glancing all around the galleys gleaming surfaces were cluttered with opened tins and unwashed plates lekkas she thought would have had a fit she took the biggest kitchen knife she could find and felt a little more comfortable the deck above was quiet too and the one above that she glanced into a couple of cabins but couldnt see any guns shed hoped they might have left a few behind she approached the bridge deck slowly and carefully then stole along it the bridge was silent a little messy and smelled of cigarette smoke from the port wing of the bridge she looked down to the lake surface there they were rowing slowly away through the sticky brown mass of the oil a man at each of the two stubby oars the other two were shouting encouragement perhaps they hadnt got very far two of them one rowing must have fallen in they were brown with the clinging oil she spared a few seconds for the view surveying her handiwork acres hectares a square kilometre perhaps it was hard to tell with the islands and the other two ships blocking the view of filthy brown dead flat glistening oil the boys at the nature reserve on barro colorado would probably have wrung her neck for this she took the flare gun from the chart room loaded and cocked it stuffed a few more rounds in her pockets and went to the radio room no fuses no power the bridge radios were out too she quickly searched the cabins no guns or grenades another check on the progress the men were making through the sludge of oil hardly out of the shadow of the ship she went outside to check the starboard lifeboat feeling a sneer on her face as she thought of the fools taking to the gemini each of the tankers lifeboats could hold the entire crew they were big bright orange and fully enclosed they were designed to survive high temperatures and would work and keep their occupants cool enough on a sea on fire with spilled oil if it came to it she came out on to the sunlit deck beneath the starboard lifeboat it had been wrecked they must have machinegunned it she looked at the ragged gap in the lifeboats bows at the bullet holes scattered around the main breach and the shards of orange hull material lying on the deck she ran back into the ship and across the bridge ducked down the gemini was still less than fifty metres away through the oil and saw what was left of the port lifeboat smashed a grenade she guessed hisako went back across the bridge out on to the starboard lifeboat deck again and climbed up into the wrecked boat through its bow hatch she held the kitchen knife in her teeth and couldnt help but laugh at herself inside the lifeboat she found the grey plastic flare container twisted the thick red plastic top off and rummaged through the big smokecanisters and the handheld flares until she found what she was looking for she took two just to be sure she stuffed the pistol from the chart room under one arm walked back to the bridge reading the instructions on the parachute flares through the bridge through the door on to the port lifeboat deck the gemini had been rowed another ten metres away she tore the cap off the base of the flare and hinged the trigger mechanism out like a heavyduty ringpull she stood behind a liferaft dispenser a sloped rack of three bright white plastic inflatable containers she stripped the sticky tape off the red top of the flare casing and removed the plastic cap looking over the top of the liferafts she could just see the gemini and the four men in it still rowing carefully through the brown sludge oars cloyed and dripping they hadnt seen her she put the kitchen knife down on the deck hey she screamed standing on tiptoes hey punks make my day dont push me that aint nice you laughin they looked the oars dipped paused two looked straight at her the pair in the stern of the inflatable turned stared back hisako waved the readied flare uncle saaam one of the rowers reached back started to stand bringing his gun up she heard shouting as she ducked grabbing the flare pistol as it fell from her armpit holding the parachute flare in the other hand she peeked round the liferaft cluster the gemini was rocking one of the men in the stern had stood up he was grappling with the soldier holding the gun she put the flare pistol on the deck stood stuck her finger through the ringpull the soldiers were shouting she pointed the flare into the sky and pulled the ring a moments hesitation enough in cartoonland for her to look puzzled turn the flare round and stare into the business end of the tube she waited the canister leapt back against her hands detonating echoes rang off the metal walls behind her the flare rocketed into the misty blue sky spiralling and arching with a firework hiss she ducked but still looked the men in the gemini were in tableau stood and sitting clean and oilsoaked all four staring up as the flare rose above and beyond them rasping into the air she threw the spent smoking container away rattling on the deck the rocket slowed wavered it had just started to drop when it puffed sent a tiny little white cloud to the top of its arc and suddenly blazed incandescently brilliant and swinging like a pendulum beneath a miniature parachute screams when they realised she dropped to the deck looked over the little metal flange beneath the deck rails one of the soldiers started rowing desperately yelling at the others the one holding the gun shook the man from the stern off leaving him teetering the gun fired she spread herself on the deck heard shouting and screaming through the percussive clatter of the machinegun in a few seconds the superstructure above her sang to the noise of the bullets hitting the deck rattled to one side a window in the bridge shattered the firing stopped she popped up for a look two rowing now though the gemini was still going in a circle one soldier was stabbing at the outboard trying to start it the fourth the fourth was overboard in the lake astern and to the side of the inflatable a brown shape screaming and thrashing inside the thick brown mass of oil the parachute flare dropped gently spiralling slowly down towards the oil a white hole in the sky the soldier at the stern stood up and screamed at the outboard slapping at it he crouched started tugging at the backup toggle which should start it even if the electric starter didnt pulled and pulled the man in the lake was only a couple of metres behind the black gemini reaching for it trying to swim through the oily sludge the other two were rowing mightily glancing behind them into the sky as they did so shouting incoherently the flare swung describing lazy bright circles in the air as it fell then one of the rowers shouted something while the man at the outboard tugged and pulled at the engines lanyard and took up a gun he stood and fired at her she ducked again flattening heard and felt shots slap and burst into the liferaft casings sending curved white shards of plastic raining about her bouncing over the deck pattering on to her back like heavy snowflakes making her flinch despite the relative weakness of each impact the firing went on changing in tone and the sounds around her ceased she risked another look the man was firing at the flare the other oarsman tried to stop him as the man at the outboard pulled again snapped the lanyard and fell over backwards into the other two and the man in the lake splashed heavily towards the stationary inflatable the three men fell in a heap into the bows gun still firing then cutting off the flare had been hit the holed parachute sank through the air ripped and fluttering the white blaze of the magnesium charge plummeted to the brown surface of the lake they stopped again frozen by the impending heat like a photograph three crumpled in the boat in the act of scrabbling back up again the one in the oil on the water like a dirty brown sculpture one arm raised all looking at the flare the flare sank diving met the oil and disappeared the tattered remnants of the parachute flopped into the greasy surface as the oil ignited she stood and watched the fire spread at a fast walk blossoming outwards from the point of its birth in an everwidening circle like a slow ripple on that thick brown tide the flames were yellow and orange and red the smoke dense and black one soldier went back to the outboard stabbing at it again the man in the lake did what looked like butterfly strokes towards the stern of the boat one just looked at the spreading field of flame the fourth one took up an oar again screamed at the man still standing and looking and with one foot kicked guns and missile launchers out of the bottom of the gemini sending them bouncing over the side sliding into the brown surface without a splash she ran a hand through her hair thinking how greasy it had become the boiling mass of yellow rolling flame expanded smoke cutting off the view of the nearest island the thick black billows rolled as high as the tankers bridge then its masts the man in the lake reached found one conical end of the inflatables double stern slipped off they were probably still yelling and shouting but the noise of the blaze was starting to take over roaring gradually gradually increasing in volume the smoke was way above she took up the flare pistol leant over the side and fired directly down the pistol jumping in her hand the flare burst upon the water to the stern of the canted pontoon bursting fire around the impact point the smoke was starting to blank out the horizon while the fire ate up the distance between it and the black gemini the man in the water reached between the stern hulls of the craft grabbing at the outboard engine just as it fired he was flicked round oil splashing brown metres into the air if he made a noise she didnt hear it the outboard died the man in the water floated broken behind the boat while the soldier at the geminis stern stabbed again at the engine casing and the other two rowed trying to angle the boat away from the flames but the fire was sweeping quickly round and past them closing in on their bows and the secondary wavefront was heading out towards the gemini from the ship itself sending billows of acrid stinging black smoke up in front of her blanking out the view she walked towards the stern of the lifeboat deck to see when the fire was almost on them one of the rowers took a pistol from his belt and put it in his mouth his head jerked back and he flopped over the bows of the inflatable just as the flames got there the smoke swam up in front of her hiding them it was hot and windy now even up where she was and fire was almost all she could see she went back along the deck ducking through the black clouds of smoke to the bridge philippes cabin nothing the store where they usually left the gear nothing sweating running and clattering down companionways in a daze she burst into the engine room through it to the engineering workshop am i praying she thought no im not she decided the workshop there she hefted the gear full tank by the time she got out on to the starboard deck the fire was closing round under the stern of le cercle swinging in like a bright wave of cavalry wheeling for the final attack she buckled in checked her valves and gauges glanced down it was a long drop she looked up at what there was of the still unsullied sky waited for her life to pass before her and decided that could wait then climbed up and over the rail she hung there for a moment gazing down at the flat shadow surface of the oilcarpeted lake she put the mask over her eyes and nose and held it there ah what the hell she thought and let go she dropped crouched foetal she heard the wind whistle increasing the impact slammed her made her think shed somehow dropped off the wrong side and hit something solid the pontoon a boat rock the mouthpiece burst from her as her breath flew out she was suddenly nowhere struggling and bereft and windless flailing for the metal and the rubber surrounded by coolness and pressure going tic tic tic she righted flapped round found the mouthpiece and rammed it in sucked and spat sucked again and found air opened her eyes the mask was still there but the view was black well what else tic tic tic she sank gathering herself light from one side slowly spreading she drew on the air in the mouthpiece then realised this was not her first breath she calmed swallowed a little water tasting oil but finding clean sweet air after it she was still sinking so swam up a little found a level and stroked out wishing for flippers the light spread over her she kept her level by the clicking noises in her skull unable to see the surface apart from the dimly burning orange light above and without a torch to inspect the depth gauge the current of air from the cylinders on her back was strong and sure and the water coursed past slower than with flippers but there and the fire above covered the surface of the lake she waited for whatever had been wrong with the gear when philippe had last used it to reassert itself to stop and choke her ha ha not just a faulty needle after all take that but it didnt happen the fire glowed overhead and she swam beneath it she even rolled over at one point and saw the burning oil above and could have laughed near to the edge where the ordinary light of day filtered down like a great gauzy curved curtain sheltering some vast and unseen stage hisako onoda looked back and saw the blind spot the black hole the eye of the storm at the heart of the universe the fire was complete it had covered all there was within its scope to cover the water pulsed around her and she guessed a tank on le cercle had blown or some of the armaments still left on the husk of the soldiers gemini had exploded and when the encircling arms of the blaze had joined and the whole brown coin of oil was alight there was no airspace left in or near its centre to feed any fire there and all there was was the oxygen at the limit of the slick round the circumference so of course only the fringes burned only the edge of the great circle could combust into the clear isthmian air of panama a kilometrewide ring of fire enfolding and enclosing a dark and lifeless heart hisako onoda watched for a moment then turned away and swam on towards the distant falls of light beneath a burning sky end
