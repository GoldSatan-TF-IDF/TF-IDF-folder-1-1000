raise the titanic by clive cussler foreword when dirk pitt salvaged the titanic from the pages of a typewriter set in a damp corner of an unfinished basement the legendary ocean liner was still ten years away from actual discovery the year was and raise the titanic became the fourth book in pitts underwater adventures then no one was inspired to spend the immense effort in time and money for a search operation but after the book was published and the movie produced a renewed tidal wave of interest swept america and europe at least five expeditions were launched to look for the wreck my original inspiration was based on fantasy and a desire to see the worlds most famous ship brought up from the seabed and towed into new york harbor completing her maiden voyage begun three quarters of a century before fortunately it was a fantasy shared by millions of her devoted fans now years after she slipped into the silence of the black abyss cameras have finally revealed her open grave fiction has become fact pitts description of her in the story pretty well matches what the robot cameras recorded shortly after she was found through the miracle of sidescan sonar aside from her structural damage sustained during her foot plunge to the bottom she suffers little from sea growth and corrosion even the wine bottles and silver service that spilled out on the silt appear pristine will the titanic ever be raised it is unlikely a total salvage operation would nearly equal the cost of the apollo manonthemoon project soon however we can expect to see manned submersibles circling her hulk in search of her treasure in artifacts while teams of american and british attorneys roll up their sleeves for long courtroom battles over her possession pitt has always looked in the future and found it full of excitement and adventure in the nineteen seventies he was a man of the eighties now he is a man of the nineties like a scout out for a wagon train pitt looks over the next hill and tells us whats there he sees what wed all like to see in our imaginations thats why no one could have been more delighted than i when it was announced that the titanic had been found i knew that pitt had seen her first april prelude the man on deck a stateroom tossed and turned in his narrow berth the mind behind his sweating face lost in the depths of a nightmare he was small no more than two inches over five feet with thinning white hair and a bland face whose only imposing feature was a pair of dark bushy eyebrows his hands lay entwined on his chest his fingers twitching in a nervous rhythm he looked to be in his fifties his skin had the color and texture of a concrete sidewalk and the lines under his eyes were deeply etched yet he was only ten days shy of his thirtyfourth birthday the physical grind and the mental torment of the last five months had exhausted him to the ragged edge of madness during his waking hours he found his mind wandering down vacant channels losing all track of time and reality he had to remind himself continually where he was and what day it was he was going mad slowly but irrevocably mad and the worst part of it was that he knew he was going mad his eyes fluttered open and he focused them on the silent fan that hung from the ceiling of his stateroom his hands traveled over his face and felt the twoweek growth of beard he didnt have to look at his clothes he knew they were soiled and rumpled and stained with nervous sweat he should have bathed and changed after hed boarded the ship but instead hed taken to his berth and slept a fearful obsessed sleep off and on for nearly three days it was late into sunday evening and the ship wasnt due to dock in new york until early wednesday morning slightly more than fifty hours hence he tried to tell himself he was safe now but his mind refused to accept it in spite of the fact that the prize that had cost so many lives was absolutely secure for the hundredth time he felt the lump in his vest pocket satisfied that the key was still there he rubbed a hand over his glistening forehead and closed his eyes once more he wasnt sure how long hed dozed something had jolted him awake not a loud sound or a violent movement it was more like a trembling motion from his mattress and a strange grinding noise somewhere far below his starboard stateroom he rose stiffly to a sitting position and swung his feet to the floor a few minutes passed and he sensed an unusual vibrationless quiet then his befogged mind grasped the reason the engines had stopped he sat there listening but the only sounds came from the soft joking of the stewards in the passageway and the muffled talk from the adjoining cabins an icy tentacle of uneasiness wrapped around him another passenger might have simply ignored the interruption and quickly gone back to sleep but he was within an inch of a mental breakdown and his five senses were working overtime at magnifying every impression three days locked in his cabin neither eating nor drinking reliving the horrors of the past five months served only to stoke the fires of insanity behind his rapidly degenerating mind he unlocked the door and walked unsteadily down the passageway to the grand staircase people were laughing and chattering on their way from the lounge to their staterooms he looked at the ornate bronze clock which was flanked by two figures in basrelief above the middle landing of the stairs the gilded hands read a steward standing alongside an opulent lamp standard at the bottom of the staircase stared disdainfully up at him obviously annoyed at seeing so shabby a passenger wandering the firstclass accommodations while all the others strolled the rich oriental carpets in elegant evening dress the engines theyve stopped he said thickly probably for a minor adjustment sir the steward replied a new ship on her maiden voyage and all theres bound to be a few bugs to iron out nothing to worry about shes unsinkable you know if shes made out of steel she can sink he massaged his bloodshot eyes i think ill take a look outside the steward shook his head i dont recommend it sir its frightfully cold out there the passenger in the wrinkled suit shrugged he was used to the cold he turned climbed one flight of stairs and stepped through a door that led to the starboard side of the boat deck he gasped as though hed been stabbed by a thousand needles after lying for three days in the warm womb of his stateroom he was rudely shocked by the thirtyonedegree temperature there was not the slightest hint of a breeze only a biting motionless cold that hung from the cloudless sky like a shroud he walked to the rail and turned up the collar of his coat he leaned over but saw only the black sea calm as a garden pond then he looked fore and aft the boat deck from the raised roof over the firstclass smoking room to the wheelhouse forward of the officers quarters was totally deserted only the smoke drifting lazily from the forward three of the four huge yellow and black funnels and the lights shining through the windows of the lounge and reading room revealed any involvement with human life the white froth along the hull diminished and turned black as the massive vessel slowly lost her headway and drifted silently beneath the endless blanket of stars the ships purser came out of the officers mess and peered over the side why did we stop weve struck something the purser replied without turning is it serious not likely sir if theres any leakage the pumps should handle it abruptly an earshattering roar that sounded like a hundred denver and rio grande locomotives thundering through a tunnel at the same time erupted from the eight exterior exhaust ducts even as he put his hands to his ears the passenger recognized the cause he had been around machinery long enough to know that the excess steam from the ships idle reciprocating engines was blowing off through the bypass valves the terrific blare made further speech with the purser impossible he turned away and watched as other crew members appeared on the boat deck a terrible dread spread through his stomach as he saw them begin stripping off the lifeboat covers and clearing away the lines to the davits he stood there for nearly an hour while the din from the exhaust ducts died slowly in the night clutching the handrail oblivious to the cold he barely noticed the small groups of passengers who had begun to wander the boat deck in a strange quiet kind of confusion one of the ships junior officers came past he was young in his early twenties and his face had the typically british milkywhite complexion and the typically british boredwithitall expression he approached the man at the railing and tapped him on the shoulder beg your pardon sir but you must get your life jacket on the man slowly turned and stared were going to sink arent we he asked hoarsely the officer hesitated a moment then nodded shes taking sea faster than the pumps can keep up how long do we have hard to say maybe another hour if the water stays clear of the boilers what happened there was no other ship nearby what did we collide with iceberg slashed our hull damnable bit of bloody luck he grasped the officers arm so hard the young man winced i must get into the cargo hold little chance of that sir the mail room on f deck is flooding and the luggage is already floating down in the hold you must guide me there the officer tried to shake his arm loose but it was held like a vise impossible my orders are to see to the starboard lifeboats some other officer can man the boats the passenger said tonelessly youre going to show me the way to the cargo hold it was then that the officer noticed two discomforting things first the twisted insane look on the passengers face and second the muzzle of the gun that was pressing against his genitals do as i ask the man snarled if you wish to see grandchildren the officer stared dumbly at the gun and then looked up something inside him was suddenly sick there was no thought of argument or resistance the reddened eyes that burned into his burned from within the depths of insanity i can only try then try the passenger snarled and no tricks ill be at your back all the way one stupid mistake and ill shoot your spine in two at the base discreetly he shoved the gun into a coat pocket keeping the barrel nudged against the officers back they made their way without difficulty through the milling throng of people who now cluttered the boat deck it was a different ship now no laughter or gaiety no class distinction the wealthy and the poor were joined by the common bond of fear the stewards were the only ones smiling and making small talk as they handed out ghostwhite life preservers the distress rockets soared into the air looking small and vain under the smothering blackness their burst of white sparkles seen by no one except those aboard the doomed ship it provided an unearthly backdrop for the heartrending goodbyes the forced expressions of hope in the mens eyes as they tenderly lifted their women and children into the lifeboats the terrible unreality of the scene was heightened as the ships eightpiece band assembled on the boat deck incongruous with their instruments and pale life jackets they began to play irving berlins alexanders ragtime band the ships officer prodded by the gun struggled down the main stairway against the wave of passengers who were surging up toward the lifeboats the low angle of the bow was becoming more pronounced going down the steps their stride was offbalance at b deck they commandeered an elevator and rode it down to d deck the young officer turned and studied the man whose strange whim had inexorably bound him tighter in the grip of certain death the lips were drawn back tightly over the teeth the eyes glassy with a faraway look the passenger glanced up and saw the officer staring at him for a long moment their eyes locked dont worry bigalow sir dont worry bigalow youll make it before she goes what section of the cargo hold do you want the ships vault in number one cargo hold g deck g deck must surely be under water by now well only know when we get there wont we the passenger motioned with the gun in his coat pocket as the elevator doors opened they moved out and pushed their way through the crowd bigalow tore off his life belt and ran around the staircase leading to e deck there he stopped and looked down and saw the water crawling upward inching its relentless path up the steps some of the lights still burned under the cold green water giving off a haunting distorted glow its no use you can see for yourself is there another way the watertight doors were closed right after the collision we might make it down one of the escape ladders then keep going the journey along the circuitous alleyways went rapidly through the unending steel labyrinth of passages and ladder tunnels bigalow halted and lifted a round hatch cover and peered into the narrow opening surprisingly the water on the cargo deck beneath was only two feet deep no hope he lied its flooded the passenger roughly shoved the officer to one side and looked for himself its dry enough for my purpose he said slowly he waved the gun at the hatch keep going the overhead electric lights were still burning in the hold as the two men sloshed their way toward the ships strong room the dim rays glinted off the brass of a giant renault town car blocked to the deck both of them stumbled and fell in the icy water several times numbing their bodies with the cold staggering like drunken men they reached the vault at last it was a cube in the middle of the cargo compartment it measured eight feet by eight feet its sturdy walls were constructed of twelve inchthick belfast steel the passenger produced a key from his vest pocket and inserted it in the slot the lock was new and stiff but finally the tumblers gave with an audible click he pushed the heavy door open and stepped into the vault then he turned and smiled for the first time thanks for your help bigalow youd better head topside theres still time for you bigalow looked puzzled youre staying yes im staying ive murdered eight good and true men i cant live with that it was said flatly the tone final its over and done with everything bigalow tried to speak but the words would not come the passenger nodded in understanding and began pulling the door closed behind him thank god for southby he said and then he was gone swallowed up in the black interior of the vault bigalow survived he won his race with the rising water and managed to reach the boat deck and throw himself over the side only seconds before the ship took her plunge as the bulk of the great ocean liner sank from sight her red pennant with the white star that had been hanging limply high on the aft mast peak under the dead calm of the night suddenly unfurled when it touched the sea as though in final salute to the fifteen hundred men women and children who were either dying of exposure or drowning in the frigid waters over the grave blind instinct clutched at bigalow and he reached out and seized the pennant as it slipped past before his mind could focus before he knew the full danger of his foolhardy act he found himself being pulled beneath the water yet he stubbornly held on refusing to release his grip he was nearly twenty feet below the surface when at last the pennants grommets tore from the halyard and the prize was his only then did he struggle upward through the liquid blackness after what seemed to him an eternity he broke into the night air again thankful that the expected suction from the sinking ship had not gotten him the twentyeightdegree water nearly killed him given another ten minutes in its freezing grip he would have simply been one more statistic of that terrible tragedy a rope saved him his hand brushed against and grabbed a trailing rope attached to a capsized boat with the last ounce of his ebbing strength he pulled his nearly frozen body on board and shared with thirty other men the numbing ache of the cold until they were rescued by another ship four hours later the pitiful cries of the hundreds who died would forever linger in the minds of those who survived but as he clung to the overturned partly submerged lifeboat bigalows thoughts were on another memory the strange man sealed forever in the ships vault who was he who were the eight men he claimed to have murdered what was the secret of the vault they were questions that were to haunt bigalow for the next seventysix years right up to the last few hours of his life the sicilian project july the president swiveled in his chair clasped his hands behind his head and stared unseeing out of the window of the oval office and cursed his lot he hated his job with a passion he hadnt thought possible he had known the exact moment the excitement had gone out of it he had known it the morning be had found it hard to rise from bed that was always the first sign a dread of beginning the day he wondered for the thousandth time since taking office why he had struggled so hard and so long for the damned thankless job anyway the price had been painfully his his political trail was littered with the bones of lost friends and a broken marriage and hed no sooner taken the oath of office when he had found his infant administration staggered by a treasury department scandal a war in south america a nationwide airlines strike and a hostile congress that had come to mistrust whoever resided in the white house he threw in an extra curse for congress its members had overridden his last two vetoes and the news didnt sit well with him thank god be would escape the bullshit of another election how hed managed to win two terms still mystified him he had broken all the political taboos ever laid down for a successful candidate not only was he a divorced man but he was not a churchgoer smoked cigars in public and sported a large mustache besides he had campaigned by ignoring his opponents and by hitting the voters solidly between the eyes with tough talk and they had loved it opportunely he had come along at a time when the average american was fed up with goodygoody candidates who smiled big and made love to the tv cameras and who spoke trite nothing sentences that the press couldnt twist or find hidden meanings to invent between the nouns eighteen more months and his second term in office would be over it was the one thought that kept him going his predecessor had accepted the post of head regent at the university of california eisenhower had withdrawn to his farm in gettysburg and johnson to his ranch in texas the president smiled to himself none of that elderstatesman onthesidelines crap for him his plans called for selfexile to the south pacific on a fortyfoot ketch there he would ignore every damned crisis that stirred the world while sipping rum and eyeing any pugnosed balloonchested native girls who wandered within view he closed his eyes and almost had the vision in focus when his aide eased open the door and cleared his throat excuse me mr president but mr seagram and mr donner are waiting the president swiveled back to his desk and ran his hands through a patch of thick silvertinted hair okay send them in he brightened visibly gene seagram and mel donner enjoyed immediate access to the president at any time day or night they were the chief evaluators for the meta section a group of scientists who worked in total secrecy researching projects that were as yet unheard ofprojects that attempted to leapfrog current technology by twenty to thirty years meta section was the presidents own brainchild he had conceived it during his first year in office connived and manipulated the unlimited secret funding and personally recruited the small group of brilliant and dedicated men who comprised its core he took great unadvertised pride in it even the cia and the national security agency knew nothing of its existence it had always been his dream to back a team of men who could devote their skills and talents to impossible schemes fantasy schemes with one chance in a million for success the fact that meta section was still batting zero five years after its inception bothered his conscience not at all there was no hand shaking only cordial hellos then seagram unlatched a battered leather briefcase and withdrew a folder stuffed with aerial photographs he laid the pictures on the presidents desk and pointed at several circled areas that were marked on transparent overlays the mountain region on the upper island of novaya zemlya north of the russian mainland all indications from our satellite sensors pinpoint this area as a slim possibility damn the president muttered softly every time we discover something like this it has to sit in the soviet union or in some other untouchable location he scanned the photographs and then turned his eyes to donner the earth is a big place surely there must be other promising areas donner shook his head im sorry mr president but geologists have been searching for byzanium ever since alexander beesley discovered its existence in to our knowledge none has ever been found in quantity its radioactivity is so extreme seagram said it has long vanished from the continents in anything more than very minute trace amounts the few bits and pieces weve gathered on this element have been gleaned from small artificially prepared particles cant you build a supply through artificial means the president asked no sir seagram replied the longestlived particle we managed to produce with a highenergy accelerator decayed in less thaw two minutes the president sat back and stared at seagram how much of it do you need to complete your program seagram looked to donner then at the president of course you realize mr president were still in a speculative stage how much do you need the president repeated i should judge about eight ounces i see thats only the amount required to test the concept fully donner added it would take an additional two hundred ounces to set up the equipment on a fully operational scale at strategic locations around the nations borders the president slumped in his chair then i guess we scrap this one and go on to something else seagram was a tall lanky man with a quiet voice and a courteous manner and except for a large flattened nose he could almost have passed as an unbearded abe lincoln donner was just the opposite of seagram he was short and seemed almost as broad as he was tall he had wheat colored hair melancholy eyes and his face always seemed to be sweating he began talking at a machinegun pace project sicilian is too close to reality to bury and forget i strongly urge that we push on wed be playing for the inside straight to end inside straights but if we succeed my god sir the consequences are enormous im open to suggestions the president said quietly seagram took a deep breath and plunged in first wed need your permission to build the necessary installations second the required funds and third the assistance of the national underwater and marine agency the president looked questioningly at seagram i can understand the first two requests but i dont grasp the significance of numa where does it fit in were going to have to sneak expert mineralogists into novaya zemlya since its surrounded by water a numa oceanographic expedition nearby would make the perfect cover for our mission how long will it take you to test construct and install the system donner didnt hesitate sixteen months one week how far can you proceed without byzanium right up to the final stage donner answered the president tilted back in his chair and gazed at a ships clock that sat on his massive desk he said nothing for nearly a full minute finally he said as i see it gentlemen you want me to bankroll you into building a multimillion dollar unproven untested complex system that wont operate because we lack the primary ingredient which we may have to steal from an unfriendly nation seagram fidgeted with his briefcase while donner merely nodded suppose you tell me the president continued how i explain a maze of these installations stretching around the countrys perimeters to some tightfisted liberal in congress who gets it in his head to investigate thats the beauty of the system said seagram its small and its compact the computers tell us that a building constructed along the lines of a small power station will do the job nicely neither the russian spy satellites nor a farmer living next door will detect anything out of the ordinary the president rubbed his chin why do you want to jump the gun on the sicilian project before youre one hundredpercent ready were gambling sir said donner were gambling that in the next sixteen months we can either make a breakthrough and produce byzanium in the laboratory or find a deposit we can extract somewhere on earth even if it takes us ten years seagram blurted the installations would be in and waiting our only loss would be time the president stood up gentlemen ill go along with your sciencefiction scheme but on one condition you have exactly eighteen months and ten days thats when the new man whoever he may be takes over my job so if you want to keep your sugar daddy happy until then get me some results the two men across the desk went limp at last seagram managed to speak thank you mr president somehow some way the team will bring in the mother lode you can count on it good now if youll excuse me i have to pose in the rose garden with a bunch of fat old daughters of the american revolution he held out his hand good luck and remember dont screw up your undercover operations i dont want another eisenhower u spy mission to blow up in my face understood before seagram and donner could answer he had turned and walked out a side door donners chevrolet was passed through the white house gates he eased into the mainstream of traffic and headed across the potomac into virginia he was almost afraid to look in the rear view mirror for fear that the president might change his mind and send a messenger to chase them down with a rejection he rolled down the window and breathed in the humid summer air we came off lucky seagram said i guess you know that youre telling me if hed known wed sent a man into russian territory over two weeks ago the fertilizer would have hit the windmill it still might seagram mumbled to himself it still might if numa cant get our man out sid koplin was sure he was dying his eyes were closed and the blood from his side was staining the white snow a burst of light whirled around in koplins mind as consciousness gradually returned and a spasm of nausea rushed over him and he retched uncontrollably had he been shot once or was it twice he wasnt sure he opened his eyes and rolled up onto his hands and knees his head pounded like a jackhammer he put his hand to it and touched a congealed gash that split his scalp above the left temple except for the headache there was no exterior sensation the pain had been dulled by the cold but there was no dulling of the agonizing burn on his left side just below his rib cage where the second bullet had struck and he could feel the syrup like stickiness of the blood as it trickled under his clothing over his thighs and down his legs a volley of automatic weapons fire echoed down the mountain koplin looked around but all he could see was the swirling white snow that was whipped by the vicious arctic wind another burst tore the frigid air he guessed that it came from only a hundred yards away a soviet patrol guard must be firing blindly through the blizzard in the random hope of hitting him again all thought of escape had vanished now it was finished he knew he could never make it to the cove where hed moored the sloop nor was he in any condition to sail the little twentyeightfoot craft across fifty miles of open sea to a rendezvous with the waiting american oceanographic vessel he sank back in the snow the bleeding had weakened him beyond further physical effort the russians must not find him that was part of the bargain with meta section if he must die his body must not be discovered painfully he began scraping snow over himself soon he would be only a small white mound on a desolate slope of bednaya mountain buried forever under the constantly building ice sheet he stopped a moment and listened the only sounds he heard were his own gasps and the wind he listened harder cupping his hands to his ears just audible through the howling wind he heard a dog bark oh god he cried silently as long as his body was still warm the sensitive nostrils of the dog were sure to pick up his scent he sagged in defeat there was nothing left for him but to lie back and let his life ooze away but a spark deep inside him refused to dim and be extinguished merciful god he thought deliriously he couldnt just lie there waiting for the russians to take him he was only a professor of mineralogy not a trained secret agent his mind and fortyyearold body werent geared to stand up under intensive interrogation if he lived they could tear the whole story from him in a matter of hours he closed his eyes as the sickness of failure overcame all physical agony when he opened them again his field of vision was filled with the head of an immense dog koplin recognized him as a komondor a mighty beast standing thirty inches at the shoulder covered by a heavy coat of matted white hair the great dog snarled savagely and would have ripped koplins throat open if it hadnt been kept in check by the gloved hand of a soviet soldier there was an indifferent look about the man he stood there and stared down at his helpless quarry gripping the leash in his left hand while he steadied a machine pistol with his right he looked fearsome in his huge greatcoat that came down to booted ankles and the pale expressionless eyes showed no compassion for koplins wounds the soldier shouldered his weapon and reached down and pulled koplin to his feet then without a word the russian began drawing the wounded american toward the islands security post koplin nearly passed out from the pain he felt as though hed been dragged through the snow for miles when actually it was only a distance of fifty yards that was as far as theyd got when a vague figure appeared through the storm it was blurred by the wall of swirling white through the dim haze of near unconsciousness koplin felt the soldier stiffen a soft plop sounded over the wind and the massive komondor fell noiselessly on its side in the snow the russian dropped his hold on koplin and frantically tried to raise his gun but the strange sound was repeated and a small hole that gushed red suddenly appeared in the middle of the soldiers forehead then the eyes went glassy and he crumpled beside the dog something was terribly wrong this shouldnt be happening koplin told himself but his exhausted mind was too far gone to draw any valid conclusions he sank to his knees and could only watch as a tall man in a gray parka materialized from the white mist and gazed down at the dog a damned shame he said tersely the man presented an imposing appearance the oak tanned face looked out of place for the arctic and the features were firm almost cruel yet it was the eyes that struck koplin he had never seen eyes quite like them they were a deep seagreen and radiated a penetrating kind of warmth a marked contrast from the hard lines etched in the face the man turned to koplin and smiled dr koplin i presume the tone was soft and effortless the stranger pushed a handgun with silencer into a pocket knelt down to eye level and nodded at the blood spreading through the material of koplins parka id better get you to where i can take a look at that then he picked koplin up as one might a child and began trudging down the mountain toward the sea who are you koplin muttered my name is pitt dirk pitt i dont understand where did you come from koplin never heard the answer at that moment the black cover of unconsciousness abruptly lifted up and he fell gratefully under it seagram finished off a margarita as he waited in a little garden restaurant just off capitol street to have lunch with his wife she was late never in the eight years they had been married had he known her to arrive anywhere on time he caught the waiters attention and gestured for another drink dana seagram finally entered and stood in the foyer a moment searching for her husband she spotted him and began meandering between the tables in his direction she wore an orange sweater and a brown tweed skirt so youthfully it made her seem like a coed in graduate school her hair was blond and tied with a scarf and her coffeebrown eyes were funny and gay and quick been waiting long she said smiling eighteen minutes to be precise he said about two minutes ten seconds longer than your usual arrivals im sorry she replied admiral sandecker called a staff meeting and it dragged on later than id figured whats his latest brainstorm a new wing for the maritime museum hes got the budget and now hes making plans to obtain the artifacts artifacts seagram asked bits and pieces salvaged from famous ships the waiter came with seagrams drink and dana ordered a daiquiri its amazing how little is left a life belt or two from the lusitania a ventilator from the maine here an anchor from the bounty there none of it housed decently under one roof i should think there are better ways of blowing the taxpayers money her face flushed what do you mean collecting old junk he said diffidently enshrining rusted and corroded bits of nonidentifiable trash under a glass case to be dusted and gawked at its a waste the battle flags were raised the preservation of ships and boats provides an important link with mans historical past danas brown eyes blazed contributing to knowledge is an endeavor an asshole like you cares nothing about spoken like a true marine archaeologist he said she smiled crookedly it still frosts your balls that your wife made something of herself doesnt it the only thing that frosts my balls sweetheart is your lockerroom language why is it every liberated female thinks its chic to cuss youre hardly one to provide a lesson in savoirfaire she said five years in the big city and you still dress like an omaha anvil salesman why cant you style your hair like other men that ivy league haircut went out years ago im embarrassed to be seen with you my position with the administration is such that i cant afford to look like a hippie of the sixties lord lord she shook her head wearily why couldnt i have married a plumber or a tree surgeon why did i have to fall in love with a physicist from the farm belt its comforting to know you loved me once i still love you gene she said her eyes turning soft this chasm between us has only opened in the last two years we cant even have lunch together without trying to hurt each other why dont we say to hell with it and spend the rest of the afternoon making love in a motel im in the mood to feel deliciously sexy would it make any difference in the long run its a start i cant your damned dedication to duty again she said turning away dont you see our jobs have torn us apart we can save ourselves gene we can both resign and go back to teaching with your phd in physics and my phd in archaeology along with our experience and credentials we could write our own ticket with any university in the country we were on the same faculty when we met remember those were our happiest years together please dana i cant quit not now why im on an important project every project for the last five years has been important please gene im begging you to save our marriage only you can make the first move ill go along with whatever you decide if we can get out of washington this town will kill any hope of salvaging our life together if we wait much longer i need another year even another month will be too late i am committed to a course that makes no conditions for abandonment when will these ridiculous secret projects ever end youre nothing but a tool of the white house i dont need that bleedingheart liberal crap from you gene for gods sake give it up its not for gods sake dana its for my countrys sake im sorry if i cant make you understand give it up she repeated tears forming in her eyes no one is indispensable let mel donner take your place he shook his head no he said firmly i created this project from nothing my gray matter was its sperm i must see it through to completion the waiter reappeared and asked if they were ready to order dana shook her head im not hungry she rose from the table and looked down at him will you be home for dinner ill be working late at the office there was no stopping her tears now i hope whatever it is youre doing is worth it she murmured because its going to cost you a terrible price unlike the russian intelligence officer so often stereotyped in american motion pictures captain andre prevlov had neither bullshoulders nor shaven head he was a well proportioned handsome man who sported a layered hairstyle and a modishly trimmed mustache his image built around an orange italian sports car and a plushly furnished apartment overlooking the moscow river didnt sit too well with his superiors in the soviet navys department of foreign intelligence yet despite prevlovs irritating leanings there was little possibility of his being purged from his high position in the department the reputation he had carefully constructed as the navys most brilliant intelligence specialist and the fact that his father was number twelve man in the party combined to make captain prevlov untouchable with a practiced casual movement he lit a winston and poured himself a shot glass of bombay gin then he sat back and read through the stack of files that his aide lieutenant pavel marganin had laid on his desk its a mystery to me sir marganin said softly how you can take so easily to western trash prevlov looked up from a file and gave marganin a cool disdainful stare like so many of our comrades you are ignorant of the world at large i think like an american i drink like an englishman i drive like an italian and i live like a frenchman and do you know why lieutenant marganin flushed and mumbled nervously no sir to know the enemy marganin the key is to know your enemy better than he knows you better than he knows himself then do unto him before he has a chance to do unto you is that a quote from comrade new tshetsky prevlov shrugged in despair no you idiot im bastardizing the christian bible he inhaled and blew a stream of smoke through his nostrils and sipped the gin study the western ways my friend if we do not learn from them then our cause is lost he turned back to the files now then why are these matters sent to our department no reason other than that the incident took place on or near a seacoast what do we know about this one prevlov snapped open the next file very little a soldier on guard patrol at the north island of novaya zemlya is missing along with his dog hardly grounds for a security panic novaya zemlya is practically barren an outdated missile station a guard post a few fishermenwe have no classified installations within hundreds of miles of it damned waste of time to even bother sending a man and a dog out to patrol it the west would no doubt feel the same way about sending an agent there prevlovs fingers drummed the table as he squinted at the ceiling finally he said an agent nothing there nothing of military interest yet he broke off and flicked a switch on his intercom bring me the national underwater and marine agencys ship placements of the last two days marganins brows lifted they wouldnt dare send an oceanographic expedition near novaya zemlya thats deep within soviet waters we do not own the barents sea prevlov said patiently it is international waters an attractive blond secretary wearing a trim brown suit came into the room handed a folder to preview and then left closing the door softy behind her prevlov shuffled through the papers in the folder until he found what he was looking for here we are the numa vessel first attempt last sighted by one of our trawlers three hundred and twentyfive nautical miles southwest of franz josef land that would put her close to novaya zemlya marganin said odd prevlov muttered according to the united states oceanographic ship operating schedule the first attempt should have been conducting plankton studies off north carolina at the time of this sighting he downed the remainder of the gin mashed out the butt of his cigarette and lit another a very interesting concurrence what does it prove marganin asked it proves nothing but it suggests that the novaya zemlya patrol guard was murdered and the agent responsible escaped most likely rendezvoused with the first attempt it suggests that the united states is up to something when a numa research ship deviates from her planned schedule without explanation what could they possibly be after i havent the foggiest notion prevlov leaned back in his chair and smoothed his mustache have the satellite photos enlarged of the immediate area at the time of the event in question the evening shadows were darkening the streets outside the office windows when lieutenant marganin spread the photo blowups on prevlovs desk and handed him a high powered magnifying glass your perceptiveness paid off sir we have something interesting here prevlov intently studied the pictures i see nothing unusual about the ship typical research equipment no militarydetection hardware in evidence marganin pointed at a wideangle photo that barely revealed a ship as a small white mark on the emulsion please note the small shape about two thousand meters from the first attempt in the upperright corner prevlov peered through the glass for almost a full half minute a helicopter yes sir thats why i was late with the enlargements i took the liberty of having the photos analyzed by section r one of our army security patrols i imagine no sir prevlovs brows raised are you suggesting that it belong to the american vessel thats their guess sir marganin placed two more pictures in front of prevlov they examined earlier photos from another reconnaissance satellite as you can see by comparing them the helicopter is flying on a course away from novaya zemlya toward the first attempt they judged its altitude at ten feet and its speed at less than fifteen knots obviously avoiding our radar security prevlov said do we alert our agents in america said marganin no not yet i dont want to risk their cover until we are certain what it is the americans are after he straightened the photographs and slipped them neatly into a folder then looked at his omega wristwatch ive just time for a light supper before the ballet do you have anything else lieutenant only the file on the lorelei current drift expedition the american deepsea submersible was last reported in fifteen thousand feet of water off the coast of dakar prevlov stood up took the file and shoved it under his arm ill study it when i get a chance probably nothing in it that concerns naval security still it should make good reading leave it to the americans to come up with strange and wonderful projects damn damn double damn dana hissed look at the crowsfeet coming in around my eyes she sat at her dressing table and stared dejectedly at her reflection in the mirror who was it who said old age is a form of leprosy seagram came up behind her pulled back her hair and kissed the soft exposed neck thirtyone on your last birthday and already youre running for senior citizen of the month she stared at him in the mirror bemused at his rare display of affection youre lucky men dont have this problem men also suffer from the maladies of age and crowsfeet what makes women think we dont crack at the seams too the difference is you dont care were more prone to accept the inevitable he said smiling speaking of the inevitable when are you going to have a baby you bastard you never give up do you she threw a hairbrush on the dressing table knocking a regiment of evenly spaced bottles of artificial beauty about the glass top weve been through all this a thousand times i wont subject myself to the indignities of pregnancy i wont swish crapladen diapers around in a toilet bowl ten times a day let someone else populate the earth im not about to split off my soul like some damned amoeba those reasons are phony you dont honestly believe them yourself she turned back to the mirror and made no reply a baby could save us dana he said gently she dropped her head in her hands i wont give up my career any more than youll give up your precious project he stroked her soft golden hair and gazed at her image in the mirror your father was an alcoholic who deserted his family when you were only ten your mother worked behind a bar and brought men home to earn extra drinking money you and your brother were treated like animals until you were both old enough to run away from the garbage bin you called home he turned crook and started holding up liquor stores and gas stations a nifty little occupation that netted him a murder conviction and life imprisonment at san quentin god knows im proud of how you lifted yourself from the sewer and worked eighteen hours a day to put yourself through college and grad school yes you had a rotten childhood dana and youre afraid of having a baby because of your memories youve got to understand your nightmare doesnt belong to the future you cant deny a son or daughter their chance at life the stone wall remained unbreached she shook off his hands and furiously began plucking her brows the discussion was closed she had shut him out as conclusively as if she had caused him to vanish from the room when seagram emerged from the shower dana was standing in front of a fulllength closet mirror she studied herself as critically as a designer who was seeing a finished creation for the first time she wore a simple white dress that clung tightly to her torso before falling away to the ankles the décolletage was loose and offered a more than ample view of her breasts youd better hurry she said casually it was as though the argument had never happened we dont want to keep the president waiting there will be over two hundred people there no one will stick a black star on our attendance chart for being tardy i dont care she pouted we dont receive an invitation to a white house party every night of the week id at least like to create a good impression by arriving on time seagram sighed and went through the ticklish ritual of tying a bow tie and then attaching his cuff links clumsily with one hand dressing for formal parties was a chore he detested why couldnt washingtons social functions be conducted with comfort in mind it might be an exciting event to dana but to him it was a pain in the rectum he finished buffing his shoes and combing his hair and went into the living room dana was sitting on the couch going over reports her briefcase open on the coffee table she was so engrossed she didnt look up when he entered the room im ready be with you in a moment she murmured could you please get my stole its the middle of summer what in hell do you want to sweat in a fur for she removed her hornedrimmed reading glasses and said i think one of us should show a little class dont you he went into the hall picked up the telephone and dialed mel donner answered in the middle of the first ring donner any word yet seagram asked the first attempt is that the numa ship that was supposed to pick up koplin yeah she bypassed oslo five days ago my god why koplin was to jump ship and take a commercial flight stateside from there no way of knowing the ship is on radio silence per your instructions it doesnt look good it wasnt in the script thats for sure ill be at the presidents party till around eleven if you hear anything call me you can count on it have fun seagram was just hanging up when dana came out of the living room she read the thoughtful expression on his face bad news im not sure yet she kissed him on the cheek a shame we cant live like normal people so you could confide your problems to me he squeezed her hand if only i could government secrets what a colossal bore she smiled slyly well well what arent you going to be a gentleman im sorry i forgot he pulled her stole from the closet and slipped it over her shoulders a bad habit of mine ignoring my wife her lips spread in a playful grin for that you will be shot at dawn christ he thought miserably a firing squad might not be too farfetched at that if koplin screwed up at novaya zemlya the seagrams settled behind the crowd gathered at the entrance to the east room and waited their turn in the receiving line dana had been in the white house before but she was still impressed by it the president was standing smartly and devilishly handsome he was in his early fifties and was definitely a very sexy man the latter was supported by the fact that standing next to him greeting every guest with the fervor of discovering a rich relative was ashley fleming washingtons most elegant and sophisticated divorcee oh shit dana gasped seagram frowned at her irritably now whats your problem the broad standing beside the president that happens to be ashley fleming i know that dana whispered trying to hide behind seagrams reassuring bulk look at her gown seagram didnt get it at first and then it hit him and it was all he could do to suppress a boisterous laugh by god youre both wearing the same dress its not funny she said grimly where did you get yours i borrowed it from annette johns that lesbian model across the street it was given to her by claude dorsini the fashion designer seagram took her by the hand if nothing else it only goes to prove what good taste my wife has before she could reply the line joggled forward and they suddenly found themselves standing awkwardly in front of the president gene how nice to see you the president smiled politely thank you for inviting us mr president you know my wife dana the president studied her his eyes lingering on her cleavage of course charming absolutely charming then he leaned over and whispered in her ear danas eyes went wide and she flushed scarlet the president straightened and said may i introduce my lovely hostess miss ashley fleming ashley mr and mrs gene seagram its a great pleasure to meet you at last miss fleming seagram murmured he might as well have been talking to a tree ashley flemings eyes were cutting apart danas dress it seems apparent mrs seagram ashley said sweetly one of us will be searching for a new dress designer first thing in the morning oh i couldnt switch dana replied innocently ive been going to jacques pinneigh since i was a little girl ashley flemings penciled brows raised questioningly jacques pinneigh ive never heard of him hes more widely known as j c penney dana smiled sweetly his downtown store is having a clearance sale next month wouldnt it be fun if we shopped together that way we wouldnt wind up as lookalikes ashley flemings face froze in a mask of indignation as the president went into a coughing spasm seagram nodded weakly grabbed danas arm and quickly hustled her away into the mainstream of the crowd did you have to do that he growled i couldnt resist it that woman is nothing but a glorified hooker then danas eyes looked up at him in bewilderment he propositioned me she said unbelieving the president of the united states propositioned me warren g harding and john f kennedy were rumored to be swingers this one is no different hes only human a lecher for a president its disgusting are you going to take him up on it seagram grinned dont be ridiculous she snapped back may i join the battle the request came from a little man with flaming red hair nattily dressed in a blue dinner jacket he had a precisely trimmed beard that matched the hair and complemented his piercing hazel eyes to seagram the voice seemed vaguely familiar but he drew a blank on the face depends whose side youre on seagram said knowing your wifes fetish for womens lib the stranger said id be only too happy to join forces with her husband you know dana i should im her boss seagram stared at him in amazement then you must be admiral james sandecker dana cut in laughing director of the national underwater and marine agency admiral may i introduce my easily flustered husband gene an honor admiral seagram extended his hand ive often looked forward to the opportunity of thanking you in person for that little favor dana looked puzzled you two know each other sandecker nodded weve talked over the telephone weve never met facetoface dana slipped her hands through the mens arms my two favorite people consorting behind my back what gives seagram met sandeckers eyes i once called the admiral and requested a bit of information thats all there was to it sandecker patted danas hand and said why dont you make an old man eternally grateful and find him a scotch and water she hesitated a moment then kissed sandecker lightly on the cheek and obediently began worming her way through the scattered groups of guests milling around the bar seagram shook his head in wonder you have a way with women if i had asked her to get me a drink shed have spit in my eye i pay her a salary sandecker said you dont they made their way out on the balcony and seagram lit a cigarette while sandecker puffed to life an immense churchill cigar they walked in silence until they were alone beneath a tall column in a secluded corner any word on the first attempt from your end seagram asked quietly she docked at our navys submarine base in the firth of clyde at thirteen hundred hours our time this afternoon thats nearly eight hours ago why wasnt i notified your instructions were quite clear sandecker said coldly no communications from my ship until your agent was safely back on us soil then how my information came from an old friend in the navy he phoned me only a half an hour ago madder than hell demanding to know where my skipper got off using naval facilities without permission theres been a screwup somewhere seagram said flatly your ship was supposed to dock at oslo and let my man come ashore just what in hell is she doing in scotland sandecker gave seagram a hard stare lets get one thing straight mr seagram numa is not an arm of the cia fbi or of any other intelligence bureau and i dont take kindly to risking my peoples lives just so you can poke around communist territory playing espionage games our business is oceanographic research next time you want to play james bond get the navy or the coast guard to do your dirty work dont con the president into ordering out one of my ships do you read me mr seagram i apologize for your agencys inconvenience admiral i meant nothing derogatory you must understand my uneasiness id like to understand there was a slight softening in the admirals face but youd make things a damned sight simpler if you would take me into your confidence and tell me what it is youre after seagram turned away im sorry i see sandecker said why do you suppose the first attempt bypassed oslo seagram said my guess is that your agent felt it was too dangerous to catch a civilian plane out of oslo and decided on a military flight instead our nuclear sub base on the firth of clyde has the nearest airfield so he probably ordered the captain of my research vessel to skip norway and head there i hope youre right whatever the reason im afraid that the deviation from our set plan can only spell trouble sandecker spied dana standing in the balcony doorway with a drink in one hand she was searching for them he waved and caught her eye and she started to move toward them youre a lucky man seagram your wife is a bright and lovely gal suddenly mel donner appeared rushed past dana and reached them first he excused himself to admiral sandecker a naval transport landed twenty minutes ago with sid koplin on board donner said softly hes been taken to walter reed why walter reed hes been shot up pretty badly good god seagram groaned ive got a car waiting we can be there in fifteen minutes okay give me a moment he spoke quietly to sandecker and asked the admiral to see that dana got home and to make his regrets to the president then he followed donner to the car im sorry but he is under sedation and i cannot allow any visitors at this time the aristocratic virginia voice was quiet and courteous but there was no hiding the anger that clouded the doctors gray eyes is he able to talk donner asked for a man who regained consciousness only minutes ago his mental faculties are remarkably alert the cloud remained behind the eyes but dont let that fool you he wont be playing any tennis for a while just how serious is his condition seagram asked his condition is just that serious the doctor who operated on him aboard the numa vessel did a beautiful job the bullet wound in his left side will heal nicely the other wound however left a neat little hairline crack in the skull your mr koplin will be having headaches for some time to come we must see him now seagram said firmly as ive told you im sorry but no visitors seagram took a step forward so that he was eye to eye with the doctor get this into your head doctor my friend and i are going into that room whether you like it or not if you personally try to stop us well put you on one of your own operating tables if you yell for attendants well shoot them if you call the police they will respect our credentials and do what we tell them seagram paused and his lips curled in a smug grin now then doctor the choice is yours koplin lay flat on the bed his face as white as the pillowcase behind his head but his eyes were surprisingly bright before you ask he said in a low rasp i feel awful and thats true but dont tell me i look good because thats a gross lie seagram pulled a chair up to the bed and smiled we dont have much time sid so if you feel up to it well jump right in koplin nodded to the tubes connected to his arm these drugs are fogging my mind but ill stay with you as long as i can donner nodded we came for the answer to the billion dollar question i found traces of byzanium if thats what you mean you actually found it are you certain my field tests were by no stroke of the imagination as accurate as lab analysis might have been but im ninety ninepercent positive it was byzanium thank god seagram sighed did you come up with an assay figure he asked i did how much how many pounds of byzanium do you reckon can be extracted from bednaya mountain with luck maybe a teaspoonful at first seagram didnt get it then it sunk in donner sat frozen and expressionless his hands clenched over the armrests of the chair a teaspoonful seagram mumbled gloomily are you certain you keep asking me if im certain koplins drawn face reddened with indignation if you dont buy my word for it send somebody else to that asshole of creation just a minute donners hand was on koplins shoulder novaya zemlya was our only hope you took more punishment than we had any right to expect were grateful sid truly grateful all hope isnt lost yet koplin murmured his eyelids drooped seagram didnt hear he leaned over the bed what was that sid youve not lost yet the byzanium was there donner moved closer what do you mean the byzanium was there gone mined youre not making sense i stumbled over the tailings on the side of the mountain koplin hesitated a moment dug into them are you saying someone has already mined the byzanium from bednaya mountain seagram asked incredulously yes dear god donner moaned the russians are on the same track no no koplin whispered seagram placed his ear next to koplins lips not the russians seagram and donner exchanged confused stares koplin feebly clutched seagrams hand the the coloradans then his eyes closed and he drifted into unconsciousness they walked through the parking lot as a siren whined in the distance what do you suppose he meant donner asked it doesnt figure seagram answered vaguely it doesnt figure at all whats so important that you have to wake me on my day off prevlov grunted without waiting for an answer he shoved open the door and motioned marganin into the apartment prevlov was wearing a silk japanese robe his face was drawn and tired as he followed prevlov through the living room into the kitchen marganins eyes traveled professionally over the furnishings and touched each piece to someone who lived in a tiny sixbyeightfoot barracks room the decor the vastness of the apartment seemed like the interior east wing of peter the greats summer palace it was all there the crystal chandeliers the floor to ceiling tapestries the french furniture his eyes also noted two glasses and a halfempty bottle of chartreuse on the fireplace mantel and on the floor beneath the sofa rested a pair of womens shoes expensive western by the look of them he palmed a strand of hair and found himself staring at the closed bedroom door she would have to be extremely attractive captain prevlov had high standards prevlov leaned into the refrigerator and lifted out a pitcher of tomato juice care for some marganin shook his head mix it with the right ingredients prevlov muttered as the americans do and you have an excellent cure for a hangover he took a sip of the tomato juice and made a face now then what do you want kgb received a communication from one of their agents in washington last night they had no clues as to its meaning and hoped that perhaps we might throw some light on it marganins face reddened the sash on prevlovs robe had loosened and he could see that the captain wore nothing beneath it very well prevlov sighed continue it said americans suddenly interested in rock collecting most secret operation under code name sicilian project prevlov stared at him over his bloody mary what sort of drivel is that he finished the glass in one gulp and slammed it down on the sink counter has our illustrious brother intelligence service the kgb become a house of fools the voice was the dispassionate efficient voice of the official prevlovcold and devoid of all inflection except bored irritation and you lieutenant why do you bother me with this childish riddle now why couldnt this have waited until tomorrow morning when im back in the office i i thought perhaps it was important marganin stammered naturally prevlov smiled coldly every time the kgb whistles people jump but veiled threats dont interest me facts my dear lieutenant facts are what count what do you feel is so important about this sicilian project it seemed to me the reference to rock collecting might tie in with the novaya zemlya files perhaps twenty seconds elapsed before prevlov spoke possible just possible still we cant be certain of a connection i i only thought please leave the thinking to me lieutenant he tightened the sash on his robe now if you have run out of herebrained witch hunts i would like to filet back to bed but if the americans are looking for something yes but what prevlov asked dryly what mineral is so precious to them that they must look for it in the earth of an unfriendly country marganin shrugged you answer that and you have the key prevlovs tone hardened almost imperceptibly until then i want solutions any peasant bastard can ask stupid questions marganins face reddened again sometimes the americans have hidden meanings to their code names yes prevlov said with mock solemnity they do have a penchant for advertising marganin plunged forward i researched the american idioms that refer to sicily and the most prevalent seems to be their obsession with a brotherhood of hooligans and if you had done your homework prevlov yawned youd have discovered its called the mafia there is also a musical ensemble that refer to themselves as the sicilian stilettos prevlov offered marganin a glacial stare then there is a large food processor in wisconsin who manufactures a sicilian salad oil enough prevlov held up a protesting hand salad oil indeed i am not up to such stupidity so early in the morning he gestured at the front door i trust you have other projects at our office that are more stimulating than rock collecting in the living room he paused before a table on which was a carved ivory chess set and toyed with one of the pieces tell me lieutenant do you play chess marganin shook his head not in a long time i used to play a little when i was a cadet at the naval academy does the name isaak boleslavski mean anything to you no sir isaak boleslavski was one of our greatest chess masters prevlov said as if lecturing a schoolboy he conceived many great variations of the game one of them was the sicilian defense he casually tossed the black king at marganin who deftly caught it fascinating game chess you should take it up again prevlov walked to the bedroom door and cracked it then he turned and smiled indifferently to marganin now if you will excuse me you may let yourself out good day lieutenant once outside marganin made his way around the rear of prevlovs apartment building the door to the garage was locked so he glanced furtively up and down the alley and then tapped a side window with his fist until it splintered carefully he picked out the pieces until his hand could grope inside and unlatch the lock one more look down the alley and he pushed up the window climbed the sill and entered the garage a black american ford sedan was parked next to prevlovs orange lancia quickly marganin searched both cars and memorized the numbers on the fords embassy license plate to make it look like the work of a burglar he removed the windshield wipersthe theft of which was a national pastime in the soviet unionand then unlocked the garage door from the inside and walked out he hurried back to the front of the building and he had only to wait three minutes for the next electric bus he paid the driver and eased into a seat and stared out the window then he began to smile it had been a most profitable morning the sicilian project was the furthest thing from his mind the coloradans august mel donner routinely checked the room for electronic eavesdropping equipment and set up the tape recorder this is a test for voice level he spoke into the microphone without inflection one two three he adjusted the controls for tone and volume then nodded to seagram were ready sid seagram said gently if it becomes tiring just say so and well break off until tomorrow the hospital bed had been adjusted so that sid koplin sat nearly upright the mineralogist appeared much improved since their last meeting his color had returned and his eyes seemed bright only the bandage around his balding head showed any sign of injury ill go until midnight he said anything to relieve the boredom i hate hospitals the nurses all have icy hands and the color on the goddamned tv is always changing seagram grinned and laid the microphone in koplins lap why dont you begin with your departure from norway very uneventful koplin said the norwegian fishing trawler godhawn towed my sloop to within two hundred miles of novaya zemlya as planned then the captain fed the condemned man a hearty meal of roast reindeer with goatcheese sauce generously provided six quarts of aquavit cast off the towhawser and sent yours truly merrily on his way across the barents sea any weather problems noneyour meteorological forecast held perfect it was colder than a polar bears left testicle but i had fine sailing weather all the way koplin paused to scratch his nose that was a sweet little sloop your norwegian friends fixed me up with was she saved seagram shook his head id have to check but im certain it had to be destroyed there was no way to take it on board the numa research vessel and it couldnt be left to drift into the path of a soviet ship you understand koplin nodded sadly too bad i became rather attached to her please continue seagram said i raised the north island of novaya zemlya late in the afternoon of the second day i had been at the helm for over forty hours dozing off and on and i began to find it impossible to keep my eyes open thank god for the aquavit after a few swigs my stomach was burning like an outofcontrol forest fire and suddenly i was wide awake you sighted no other boats none ever showed on the horizon koplin answered then he went on the coast proved to be a seemingly unending stretch of rocky cliffs i saw no point in attempting a landingit was beginning to get dark so i turned out to sea hove to and sneaked a few hours sleep in the morning i skirted the cliffs until i picked out a small sheltered cover and then went in on the auxiliary diesel did you use your boat for a base camp for the next twelve days i made two sometimes three field trips a day on crosscountry skis prospecting before returning for a hot meal and a good nights rest in a warm up to now you had seen no one i kept well clear of the kelva missile station and the kama security post i saw no sign of the russians until the final day of the mission how were you discovered a russian soldier on patrol his dog must have crossed my trail and picked up my scent small wonder i hadnt bathed in almost three weeks seagram dropped a smile donner picked up the questioning more coldly aggressively lets get back to your field trips what did you find i couldnt cover the whole island on crosscountry skis so i concentrated on the promising areas that had been pinpointed by the satellite computer printouts he stared at the ceiling the north island the outer continuation of the ural and yugorski mountain chains a few rolling plains plateaus and mountainsmost of which are under a permanent ice sheet violent winds much of the time the chill factor is murderous i found no vegetation other than some rock lichen if there were any warmblooded animals they kept to themselves lets stick to the prospecting donner said and save the travel lecture for another time just laying the groundwork koplin shot donner a disapproving stare his tone icy if i may continue without interruption of course seagram said he pulled his chair strategically between the bed and donner its your game sid well play by your rules thank you koplin shifted his body geographically the island is quite interesting a description of the faulting and uplifting of rocks that were once sediments formed under an ancient sea could fill several textbooks mineralogically the magmatic paragenesis is barren would you mind translating that koplin grinned the origin and geological occurrence of a mineral is called its paragenesis magma on the other hand is the source of all matter a liquid rock heated under pressure which turns solid to form igneous rock perhaps better known as basalt or granite fascinating donner said dryly then what youre stating is that novaya zemlya is void of minerals you are singularly perceptive mr donner koplin said but how did you find traces of byzanium seagram asked on the thirteenth day i was poking around the north slope of bednaya mountain and ran onto a waste dump waste dump a pile of rocks that had been removed during the excavation of a mine shaft this particular dump happened to have minute traces of byzanium ore the expressions on his interrogators faces suddenly went sober the shaft entrance was cunningly obscured koplin continued it took me the better part of the afternoon to figure which slope it was on one minute sid seagram touched koplins arm are you saying the entrance to this mine was purposely concealed an old spanish trick the opening was filled until it was even with the natural slope of the hill wouldnt the waste dump have been on a direct line from the entrance donner asked under normal circumstances yes but in this case they were spaced over a hundred yards apart separated by a gradual arc that ran around the mountains slope to the west but you did discover the entrance donner went on the rails and ties for the ore cars had been removed and the track bed covered over but i managed to trace its outline by moving off about fifteen hundred yards and studying the mountains slope through binoculars what you couldnt see when you were standing on top of it became quite clear from that distance the exact location of the mine was then easy to determine who would go to all that trouble to hide an abandoned mine in the arctic seagram asked no one in particular theres no method or logic to it youre only half right gene koplin said the logic i fear remains an enigma but the method was brilliantly executed by professionalscoloradans the word came slowly almost reverently they were the men who excavated the bednaya mountain mine the muckers the blasters the jiggers the drillers the cornishmen the irishmen germans and swedes not russians but men who emigrated to the united states and became the legendary hardrock miners of the colorado rockies how they came to be on the icy slopes of bednaya mountain is anybodys guess but these were the men who came and mined the byzanium and then vanished into the obscurity of the arctic the sterile blankness of total incomprehension flooded seagrams face he turned to donner and was met by the same expression it sounds crazy absolutely crazy crazy koplin echoed maybe but no less true you seem pretty confident donner muttered granted i lost the tangible proof during my pursuit by the security guard you have only my word on it but why doubt it as a scientist i only report facts and i have no devious motive behind a lie so if i were you gentlemen i would simply accept my word as genuine as i said its your game seagram smiled faintly you mentioned tangible evidence donner was calm and coldly efficient after i penetrated the mine shaftthe loose rock came away in my hands and i had only to scoop out a threefoot tunnelthe first thing my head collided with in the darkness was a string of ore cars the strike of my fourth match illuminated an old pair of oil lamps they both had fuel and lit on the third try the faded blue eyes seemed to stare at something beyond the hospital room wall it was an unnerving scene that danced under the lamps glow mining tools neatly stacked in their racks empty ore cars standing on rusting eightgauge rails drilling equipment ready to attack the rockit was as though the mine was waiting for the incoming shift to sort the ore and run the waste to the dump could you say whether it looked as if someone left in a hurry not at all everything was in its place the bunks in a side chamber were made the kitchen was cleared up all the utensils were still on the shelves even the mules used to haul the ore cars had been taken to the working chamber and efficiently shot their skulls each had a neat round hole in its center no id say the departure was very methodical you have not yet explained your conclusion as to the coloradans identity donner said flatly im coming to it now koplin fluffed a pillow and turned gingerly on his side the indications were all there of course the heavier equipment still bore the manufacturers trademarks the ore cars had been built by the guthrie and sons foundry of pueblo colorado the drilling equipment came from the thor forge and ironworks of denver and the small tools showed the names of the various blacksmiths who had forged them most had come from central city and idaho springs both mining towns in colorado seagram leaned back in his chair the russians could have purchased the equipment in colorado and then shipped it to the island possibly koplin said however there were a few other bits and pieces that also led to colorado such as the body in one of the bunks for one seagrams eyes narrowed a body with red hair and a red beard koplin said casually nicely preserved by the subzero temperature it was the inscription on the wood above the bunk supports that proved most intriguing it said in english i might add here rests jake hobart born a damn good man who froze in a storm february seagram rose from his chair and paced around the bed a name that at least is a start he stopped and looked at koplin were there any personal effects left lying around all clothing was gone oddly the labels on the food cans were french but then there were about fifty empty wrappers milehi chewing tobacco scattered on the ground the last piece of the puzzle though the piece that definitely ties it to the coloradans was a faded yellow copy of the rocky mountain news dated november it was this part of the evidence that i lost seagram pulled out a pack of cigarettes and shook one loose donner held a lighter for him and seagram nodded then there is a chance the russians may not have possession of the byzanium he said there is one more thing koplin said quietly the topright section of page three of the newspaper had been neatly snipped out it may mean nothing but on the other hand a check of the publishers old files might tell you something it might at that seagram regarded koplin thoughtfully thanks to you we have our work laid out for us donner nodded ill reserve a seat on the next flight to denver with luck i should come up with a few answers make the newspaper your first stop then try and trace jake hobart ill make a check on old military records from this end also contact a local expert on western mining history and run down the names of the manufacturers sid gave us however unlikely one of them might still be in business seagram stood up and looked down at koplin we owe you more than we can ever repay he said softly i figure those old miners dug nearly half a ton of highgrade byzanium from the guts of that bitch mountain koplin said rubbing his hand through a months growth of beard that ore has got to be stashed away in the world somewhere then again if it hasnt emerged since it may be lost forever but if you find it make that when you find it you can say thanks by sending me a small sample for my collection consider it done and while youre at it get me the address of the fellow who saved my life so i can send him a case of vintage wine his name is dirk pitt you must mean the doctor on board the research vessel who operated on you l mean the man who killed the soviet patrol guard and his dog and carried me off the island donner and seagram looked at each other thunderstruck donner was the first to recover killed a soviet patrol guard it was more statement than question my god that tears it but thats impossible seagram finally managed to blurt when you rendezvoused with the numa ship you were alone who told you that well no one we naturally assumed im not superman koplin said sarcastically the patrol guard picked up my trail closed to within two hundred yards and shot me twice i was hardly in any condition to outrun a dog and then sail a sloop over fifty miles of open sea where did this dirk pitt come from i havent the vaguest idea the guard was literally dragging me off to his security post commander when pitt appeared through the blizzard like some vengeful norse god and calmly as if he did it every day before breakfast shot the dog and then the guard without so much as a howdoyoudo the russians will make propaganda hay with this donner groaned how koplin demanded there were no witnesses the guard and his dog are probably buried under five feet of snow by now they may never be found and if they are so what whos to prove anything you two are pushing the panic button over nothing it was a hell of a risk on that characters part seagram said good thing he took it koplin muttered or instead of me lying here safe and snug in my sterile hospital bed id be lying in a sterile russian prison spilling my guts about meta section and byzanium you have a valid point donner admitted describe him seagram ordered face build clothing koplin did so his description was sketchy in some areas but in others his recollection of detail was remarkably accurate did you talk with him during the trip to the numa couldnt i blacked out right after he picked me up and didnt come to until i found myself here in washington in the hospital donner gestured to seagram wed better get a make on this guy quick seagram nodded ill start with admiral sandecker pitt must have been connected with the research vessel perhaps someone in numa can identify him i cant help wondering how much he knows donner said staring at the floor seagram didnt answer his mind had strayed to a shadowy figure on a snowcovered island in the arctic dirk pitt he repeated the name in his mind somehow it seemed strangely familiar the telephone rang at am sandecker popped open one eye and stared at it murderously for several moments finally he gave in and answered it on the eighth ring yes what is it he demanded gene seagram here admiral did i catch you in bed oh hell no sandecker yawned i never retire before i write five chapters on my autobiography rob at least two liquor stores and rape a cabinet members wife okay what are you after seagram something has come up forget it im not endangering any more of my men and ships to bail your agents out of enemy territory he used the word enemy as though the country were at war its not that at all then what i need a line on someone why come to me in the dead of night i think you might know him whats the name pitt dirk the last name is pitt probably spelled pitt just to humor an old mans curiosity what makes you think i know him i have no proof but im certain he has a connection with numa i have over two thousand people under me i cant memorize all their names could you check him out its imperative that i talk to him seagram sandecker grunted irritably youre a monumental pain in the ass did it ever occur to you to call my personnel director during normal working hours my apologies seagram said i happened to be working late and okay if i dig up this character ill have him get in touch with you id appreciate it seagrams tone remained impersonal by the way the man your people rescued up in the barents sea is getting along nicely the surgeon on the first attempt did a magnificent job of bullet removal koplin wasnt it yes he should be up and around in a few days that was a near thing seagram if the russians had cottoned onto us wed have a nasty incident on our hands about now what can i say seagram said helplessly you can say good night and let me get back to sleep sandecker snarled but first tell me how this pitt figures into the picture koplin was about to be captured by a russian security guard when this guy appears out of a blizzard and kills the guard carries koplin across fifty miles of stormy water not to mention stemming the blood flow from his wounds and somehow deposits him on board your research vessel ready for surgery what do you intend to do when you find him thats between pitt and myself i see sandecker said well good night mr seagram thank you admiral goodby sandecker hung up and then sat there a few moments a bemused expression on his face killed a russian security guard and rescued an american agent dirk pitt you sly son of a bitch uniteds early flight touched down at denvers stapleton airfield at eight in the morning mel donner passed quickly through the baggage claim and settled behind the wheel of an avis plymouth for the fifteenminute drive to west colfax avenue and the rocky mountain news as he followed the westbound traffic his gaze alternated between the windshield and a street map stretched open beside him on the front seat he had never been in denver before and he was mildly surprised to see a pall of smog hanging over the city he expected to be confronted with the dirty brown and gray cloud over places like los angeles and new york but denver had always conjured up visions in his mind of a city cleansed by crystal clean air nestled under the protective shadow of purple mountain majesties even these were a disappointment denver sat naked on the edge of the great plains at least twentyfive miles from the nearest foothills he parked the car and found his way to the newspapers library the girl behind the counter peered back at him through tearshaped glasses and smiled an uneventoothed friendly smile can i help you do you have an issue of your paper dated november oh my that does go back she twisted her lips i can give you a photocopy but the original issues are at the state historical society i only need to see page three if you care to wait itll take about fifteen minutes to track down the film of november and run the page you want through the copy machine thank you by the way would you happen to have a business directory for colorado we certainly do she reached under the counter and laid a booklet on the smudged plastic top donner sat down to study the directory as the girl disappeared to search out his request there was no listing of a guthrie and sons foundry in pueblo he thumbed to the ts nothing there either for the thor forge and ironworks of denver it was almost too much to expect he reasoned for two firms still to be in business after nearly eight decades the fifteen minutes came and went and the girl hadnt returned so he idly leafed through the directory to pass the time with the exception of kodak martin marietta and gates rubber there were very few companies hed heard of then suddenly he stiffened under the j listings his eyes picked out a jensen and thor metal fabricators in denver he tore out the page stuffed it in his pocket and tossed the booklet back on the counter here you are sir the girl said thatll be fifty cents donner paid and quickly scanned the headline in the upperrighthand corner of the old newsprints reproduction the article covered a mine disaster is it what you were looking for the girl asked it will have to do he said as he walked away jensen and thor metal fabricators was situated between the burlingtonnorthern rail yards and the south platte river a massive corrugated monstrosity that would have blotted any landscape except the one that surrounded it inside the work shed overhead cranes shuffled enormous lengths of rusty pipe from pile to pile while stamping machines pounded away with an intolerable clangor that made donners eardrums cringe from the attack the main office sat off to one side behind soundproofed aggregate concrete walls and tall arched windows an attractive largebreasted receptionist escorted him down a shagcarpeted hall to a spacious paneled office carl jensen jr came around the desk and shook hands with donner he was young no more than twentyeight and wore his hair long he had a neatly trimmed mustache and wore an expensive plaid suit he looked for all the world like a ucla graduate donner couldnt see him as anything else thank you for taking the time to see me mr jensen jensen smiled guardedly it sounded important a big man on the washington campus and all how could i refuse as i mentioned over the telephone im checking on some old records jensens smile thinned youre not from the internal revenue i hope donner shook his head nothing like that the governments interest is purely historical if you still keep them id like to check over your sales records for july through november of youre putting me on jensen laughed i assure you its a straight request jensen stared at him blankly are you sure youve got the right company i am donner said brusquely if this is a descendant of the thor forge and ironworks my greatgrandfathers old outfit jensen admitted my father bought up the outstanding stock and changed the name in would you still have any of the old records jensen shrugged we threw out the ancient history some time ago if wed saved every receipt of sale since great granddaddy opened his doors back in wed need a warehouse the size of bronco stadium just to store them donner pulled out a handkerchief and wiped the beads of sweat from his face he sagged in his chair however jensen continued and you can thank the foresight of carl jensen sr we have all our past records down on microfilm microfilm the only way to fly after five years we film everything efficiency personified thats us donner couldnt believe his luck then you can provide me with sales for the last six months of jensen didnt answer he leaned over the desk spoke into his intercom and then tilted back in his executive chair while we wait can i get you a cup of coffee mr donner id prefer something with a little more snap spoken like a man from the big city jensen stood up and walked over to a mirrored bar from which he produced a bottle of chivas regal youll find denver quite gauche a bar in an office is generally frowned upon here the locals idea of entertaining visiting firemen is to treat them to a large cocacola and a lavish lunch at the wienerschnitzel fortunately for our esteemed outoftown customers i spent my business apprenticeship on madison avenue donner took the offered glass and downed it jensen looked at him appraisingly and then refilled the glass tell me mr donner just what is it you expect to find nothing of importance donner said come now the government wouldnt send a man across half the country to itemize seventysixyearold sales records strictly for laughs the government often handles its secrets in a funny way a classified secret that goes back to jensen shook his head in wonder truly amazing lets just say were trying to solve an ancient crime whose perpetrator purchased your greatgrandfathers services jensen smiled and courteously accepted the lie a blackhaired girl in long skirt and boots swiveled into the room threw jensen a seductive look laid a xerox paper on his desk and retreated jensen picked up the paper and examined it june to november must have been a recession year for my ancestor sales for those months were slim any particular entry youre interested in mr donner mining equipment yes this must be it drilling tools ordered august tenth and picked up by the buyer on november first jensens lips broke into a wide grin it would seem sir the laugh is on you i dont follow the buyer or as youve informed me the criminal jensen paused for effect was the us government the meta section headquarters was buried in a nondescript old cinder block building beside the washington navy yard a large sign its painted letters peeling under the double onslaught of the summers heat and humidity humbly advertised the premises as the smith van storage company the loading docks appeared normal enough packing crates and boxes were piled in strategic locations and to passing traffic on the suitland parkway the trucks parked around the yard behind a fifteenfoothigh chainlink fence looked exactly as moving vans should look only a closer inspection would have revealed old derelicts with missing engines and dusty unused interiors it was a scene that would have warmed the soul of a motionpicture set designer gene seagram read over the reports on the realestate purchases for the sicilian projects installations there were fortysix in all the northern canadian border numbered the most followed closely by the atlantic seaboard the pacific coast had eight designated areas while only four were plotted for the border above mexico and the gulf of mexico the transactions had gone off smoothly the buyer in each case had gone under the guise of the department of energy studies there would be no cause for suspicion the installations were designed to all outward appearances to resemble small relay power stations to even the most wary of minds there was nothing to suspect on the surface he was going over the construction estimates when his private phone rang out of habit he carefully put the reports back in their folder and slipped it in a desk drawer then picked up the phone this is seagram hello mr seagram whos this major mcpatrick army records bureau you asked me to call you at this number if i came up with anything on a miner by the name of jake hobart yes of course im sorry my mind was elsewhere seagram could almost envision the man on the other end of the line a west pointer under thirtythat much was betrayed by the clipped verbs and the youngish voice probably make general by the time he was fortyfive providing he made the right contacts while commanding a desk at the pentagon what do you have major ive got your man his full name was jason cleveland hobert born january in vinton iowa at least the year checks occupation too he was a miner what else he enlisted in the army in may of and served with the first colorado volunteer regiment in the philippines you did say colorado correct sir mcpatrick paused and seagram could hear the riffling of papers over the line hobart had an excellent war record got promoted to sergeant he suffered serious wounds fighting the philippine insurrectionists and was decorated twice for meritorious conduct under fire when was he discharged they called it mustering out in those days mcpatrick said knowledgeably hobart left the army in october of is that your last record of him no his widow is still drawing a pension hold on seagram interrupted hobarts widow is still living she cashes her fifty dollars and forty cents pension check every month like clockwork she must be over ninety years old isnt that a little unusual paying a pension to the widow of a spanish american war veteran youd think most of them would be pushing up tombstones by now oh hell no we still carry nearly a hundred civil war widows on the pension rolls none were even born when grant took richmond may and december marriages between sweet young things and old toothless grand army of the republic vets were quite ordinary in those days i thought a widow was eligible for pension only if she was living at the time her husband was killed in battle not necessarily mcpatrick said the government pays widows pensions under two categories one is for serviceoriented death that of course includes death in battle or fatal sickness or injury inflicted while serving between certain required dates as set by congress the second is nonservice death take yourself for example you served with the navy during the vietnam war between the required dates set for that particular conflict that makes your wife or any future wife eligible for a small pension should you be run over by a truck forty years from now ill make a note of that in my will seagram said uneasy in the knowledge that his service record was where any desk jockey in the pentagon could lay his hands on it getting back to hobart now we come to an odd oversight on the part of army records oversight hobarts service forms fail to mention reenlistment yet he is recorded as died in the service of his country no mention of the cause only the date november seagram suddenly straightened in his chair i have it on good authority that jake hobart died a civilian on february like i said theres no mention of cause of death but i assure you hobart died a soldier not a civilian on november i have a letter in his file dated july from henry l stimson secretary of war under president taft ordering the army to award sergeant jason hobarts wife full widows pension for the rest of her natural life how hobart rated the personal interest of the secretary of war is a mystery but it leaves little doubt of our mans status only a soldier in high standing would have received that kind of preferential treatment certainly not a coal miner he wasnt a coal miner seagram snapped well whatever do you have an address for mrs hobart i have it here somewhere mcpatrick hesitated a moment mrs adeline hobart b calle aragon laguna hills california shes in that big senior citizens development down the coast from la that about covers it seagram said i appreciate your help in this matter major i hate to say this mr seagram but i think weve got two different men here i think perhaps youre right seagram replied it looks as though i might be on the wrong track if i can be of any further help please dont hesitate to call me ill do that seagram grunted thanks again after he hung up he dropped his head in his hands and slouched in the chair he sat that way not moving for perhaps two full minutes then he laid his hands on the desk and smiled a wide smug grin two different men very well could have existed with the same surname and birth year who worked in the same state at the same occupation that part of the puzzle might have been a coincidence but not the connection the glorious tol longshot connection that mysteriously tied the two men together and made them one hobarts recorded death and the old newspaper found by sid koplin in the bednaya mountain mine bore the same date november he pushed the intercom switch for his secretary barbara put through a call to mel donner at the brown palace hotel in denver any message if he isnt in just leave word for him to call me on my private line when he returns shall do and one more thing book me on uniteds early morning flight tomorrow to los angeles yes sir he clicked the switch to off and leaned back in the chair thoughtfully adeline hobart over ninety years old he hoped to god she wasnt senile donner didnt normally stay in a downtown hotel he preferred the more inconspicuous setting of a garden variety motel closer to the suburbs but seagram had insisted on the grounds that local cooperation comes more easily to an investigator when he lets it be known that he has a room in the citys oldest and most prestigious building investigator the word nauseated him if one of his fellow professors on the university of southern california campus had told him five years ago that his doctorate in physics would lead him to play such a clandestine role hed have choked laughing donner wasnt laughing now the sicilian project was far too vital to the countrys interests to risk a leak through outside help he and seagram had designed and created the project on their own and it was agreed that theyd take it as far as they could alone he left his rented plymouth with the parking attendant and walked across tremont place through the hotels oldfashioned revolving doors and into the pleasantly ornate lobby where the young mustachioed assistant manager gave him a message without so much as a smile donner took it without so much as a thank you then made his way to the elevators and his room he slammed the door and threw the room key and seagrams message on the desk and turned on the television it had been a long and tiresome day and his bodily systems were still operating on washington dc time he dialed room service and ordered dinner then kicked off his shoes loosened his tie and sagged onto the bed for perhaps the tenth time he began going over the photocopy of the old newspaper page it made very interesting reading if that is donners interest lay in advertisements for piano tuners electric belts for rupture and strange malady remedies along with editorials on the denver city councils determination to clear suchandsuch street of sinful houses of entertainment or intriguing little inserts guaranteed to make feminine readers of the early s gasp in innocent horror coroners report last week the habitués of the paris morgue were greatly puzzled by a curious indiarubber leg that lay exposed for recognition on one of the slabs it appears that the body of an elegantly dressed woman apparently aged about had been found in the seine but the body was so decomposed that it could not be kept it was remarked however that the left leg amputated at the thigh had been replaced by an ingeniously constructed indiarubber leg which was exhibited in the hope that it might lead to the identification of the owner donner smiled at the quaint piece of history and turned his attention to the upperrighthand section of the page the part that koplin had said was missing from the paper hed discovered on novaya zemlya disaster at the mines tragedy struck like a vengeful wraith early this morning when a dynamite blast set off a cavein at the little angel mine near central city trapping nine men of the first shift including the wellknown and respected mining engineer joshua hays brewster the weary and haggard rescue crews report that hope of finding the men alive is black indeed bull mahoney the intrepid foreman of the satan mine made a herculean effort to reach the trapped miners but was turned back by a wall of tidal water that inundated the main shaft them poor fellows is goners sure mahoney stated to reporters at the disaster scene the water has gushed up near two levels above where they was working they surely was drowned like rats before they knew what hit them the silent and sorrowful throng milling around the mine entrance woefully bemoaned the chilling likelihood that this is one time when the bodies of the lost men will not be recovered and brought to the grass for decent burial it is reliably known that it was mr brewsters intent to reopen the little angel mine which had been closed since friends and business associates say that brewster often boasted that the original digging had missed the highgrade lode and with luck and fortitude he was going to be the discoverer when reached for comment mr ernest bloeser now retired and former owner of the little angel mine said on the front porch of his home in golden that mine was dogged by bad luck from the day i opened it all it ever turned out to be was a lowgrade ore shoot which never did turn a profit mr bloeser further stated i think brewster was dead wrong there was never any indication of the mother lode i am astounded that a man of his reputation could think so in central city the last message proclaimed that if the situation is in the eternal graces of the almighty the opening will be sealed as a tomb and the missing men will rest in blackness through the ages never again to see the grass or sunlight the grim reapers list of the men caught up in this most terrible of disasters is as follows joshua hays brewster denver alvin coulter fairplay thomas price leadville charles p widney cripple creek vernon s hall denver john caldwell central city walter schmidt aspen warner e odeming denver jason c hobart boulder may god watch over these brave toilers of the mountains no matter how many times donners eyes traveled over the old news type they always came back to the last name among the missing miners slowly like a man in a trance he laid the paper in his lap picked up the phone and dialed long distance the monte cristo harry young exclaimed delightedly i heartily endorse the monte cristo the roquefort dressing is also excellent but first id like a martini very dry with a twist monte cristo sandwich and roquefort on your salad yes sir the young waitress repeated bending over the table so that her short skirt rode up to reveal a pair of white panties and you sir ill take the same donner nodded only ill start with a manhattan on the rocks young peered over the top of his glasses as the waitress hurried to the kitchen if only someone would give me that for christmas he said smiling young was a skinny little man in decades past he would have been called an overdressed silly old fool now he was an alert eagerfaced seventyeightyearold bon vivant with a practiced eye for beauty he sat across the booth table from donner in a blue turtleneck and patterned doubleknit sportscoat mr donner he said happily this is indeed a pleasure the broker is my favorite restaurant he waved his hand at the walnutpaneled walls and booths this was once a bank vault you know so i noticed when i had to duck through the fiveton door you should come here for dinner they give you an enormous tray of shrimp for an appetizer he fairly beamed at the thought ill bear that in mind on my next visit well sir young looked at him steadily whats on your mind i have a few questions youngs eyebrows raised above his glasses oh my now you have tickled my curiosity youre not with the fbi are you over the phone you simply said you were with the federal government no im not with the fbi and im not on the payroll of internal revenue either my department is welfare its my job to track down the authenticity of pension claims then how can i help you my particular project at the moment is the investigation of a seventysixyearold mining accident that took the lives of nine men one of the victims descendants has filed for a pension im here to check the validity of the claim your name mr young was recommended to me by the state historical society which glowingly described you as a walking encyclopedia on western mining history a bit of an exaggeration young said but im flattered nonetheless the drinks arrived and they sipped them for a minute donner took the time to study the pictures of turnofthecentury colorado silver kings that hung on the walls their faces all projected the same intense stare as if they were trying to melt the camera lens with their wealthfortified arrogance tell me mr donner how can anyone file a pension claim on a seventysixyearold accident it seems the widow didnt receive all she was entitled to donner said skating onto unsure ice her daughter is demanding the back pay so to speak i see young said he stared across the table speculatively and then began idly tapping his spoon against a plate which of the men who were lost in the little angel disaster are you interested in my compliments donner said avoiding the stare and unfolding his napkin selfconsciously you dont miss a trick its nothing really a seventysixyearold mining accident nine men missing it could only be the little angel disaster the mans name was brewster young stared at him an extra moment then stopped the platetapping and banged his spoon against the table top joshua hays brewster he murmured the name born to william buck brewster and hettie masters in sidney nebraska on april or was it april donners eyes opened wide how could you possibly know all that oh i know that and much more young smiled mining engineers or the laceboot brigade as they were once known are a rather cliquish group its one of the few professions where sons follow fathers and also marry sisters or daughters of other mining engineers are you about to say that you were related to joshua hays brewster my uncle young grinned the ice parted and donner fell through you look like you could stand another drink mr donner young signaled to the waitress for another round needless to say there is no daughter who is seeking a claim to a pension my mothers brother died a childless bachelor liars never prosper donner said with a thin smile im sorry if ive embarrassed you by foolishly painting myself into a corner can you enlighten me i would prefer not to you are from the government young asked donner showed him his credentials then may i ask why youre investigating my longdead uncle i would prefer not to donner repeated not at this time at any rate what do you wish to know whatever you can tell me about joshua hays brewster and the little angel accident the drinks came along with the salad donner agreed that the dressing was excellent they ate in silence when young had finished and wiped his tiny white mustache he took a deep breath and relaxed against the backrest of the booth my uncle was typical of the men who developed the mines in the early nineteen hundreds white eager and middle class and except for his small sizehe stood only five feet twohe could easily have passed for what the novelists of the day vividly depicted as a gentlemanly twofisted devilmaycare adventurous mining engineer complete with shining boots jodhpurs and a smokeythebear ranger hat you make him sound like a hero from an old saturday matinee serial a fictional hero could never have measured up young said the field is highly specialized today of course but an engineer of the old school had to be as tough as the rock he mined and he had to be versatilemechanic electrician surveyor metallurgist geologist lawyer arbitrator between pennypinching management and musclebrained workers this was the kind of man it took to run a mine this was joshua hays brewster donner kept silent slowly swirling the liquor around in his glass after my uncle graduated from the school of mines young continued he followed his profession in the klondike australia and russia before returning to the rockies in to manage the sour rock and buffalo a pair of mines at leadville owned by a group of french financiers in paris who never laid eyes on colorado the french owned mining claims in the states yes their capital flowed heavily throughout the west gold and silver cattle sheep real estate you name it they had a finger in it what possessed brewster to reopen the little angel thats a strange story in itself young said the mine was worthless the alabama burrow three hundred yards away coughed up two million dollars in silver before the water in the lower levels began running ahead of the pumps that was the shaft that hit the highgrade lode the little angel never came close young paused to sip at his drink and then stared at it as though he were seeing a vague image in the ice cubes when my uncle advertised his intentions to reopen the mine to anyone who would listen people who knew him well were shocked yes mr donner shocked joshua hays brewster was a cautious man a man of painstaking detail his every move was carefully calculated in terms of success he never played the odds unless they were steeply in his favor for him to publicly announce such a harebrained scheme was unthinkable the mere act was considered by all to be that of a madman maybe he found some clue the others had missed young shook his head ive been a geologist for over sixty years mr donner and a damned good one ive reentered and examined the little angel down to the flooded levels and analyzed every accessible inch of the alabama burrow and im telling you positively and unequivocally there is no untapped vein of silver down there now nor was there one in the monte cristo sandwiches came and the salad plates were whisked away are you suggesting your uncle went insane the possibility has occurred to me brain tumors were generally undiagnosed in those days so were nervous breakdowns young wolfed the first quarter of his sandwich and drained his second martini how is your monte cristo mr donner donner forced a few bites excellent and yours grandly delicious would you like my private theory dont bother to be polite you can laugh without embarrassment everyone else does when they hear it i promise you i wont laugh donner said his tone dead serious be sure to dip your monte cristo in the grape jam mr donner it heightens the pleasure now then as ive mentioned my uncle was a man of great detail a keen observer of his work his surroundings and accomplishments ive collected most of his diaries and notebooks they fill a goodly portion of my studys bookshelves his remarks concerning the sour rock and the buffalo mines for example take up five hundred and twentyseven pages of exacting sketches and neatly legible handwriting the pages in the notebook that come under the heading of the little angel mine however are totally blank he left nothing behind regarding the little angel not even a letter perhaps young shrugged and shook his head it was as though there was nothing to record it was as though joshua hays brewster and his eightman crew went down into the bowels of the earth never intending to return what are you suggesting ridiculous as it seems young admitted the thought of mass suicide once darted through my mind extensive research showed me that all nine men were either bachelors or widowers most were itinerant loners who drifted from digging to digging looking for any excuse to move on when they became bored or disenchanted with the foreman or mine management they had little to live for once they became too old to work the mines but jason hobart had a wife donner said what whats that youngs eyes widened i found no record of a wife for any of them take my word for it god in heaven if my uncle had known that hed never have recruited hobart why is that dont you see he needed men he could trust implicitly men who had no close friends or relatives to ask questions should they vanish youre not making sense donner said flatly simply put the reopening of the little angel mine and the subsequent tragedy was a sham a pretext a hoax im convinced my uncle was going mad how or what caused his mental illness will never be known his character altered drastically even to the point of producing a different man a split personality exactly his moral values changed his warmth and love for friends disappeared when i was younger i talked to people who remembered him they all agreed on one thing the joshua hays brewster they all knew and loved died months before the little angel disaster how does this lead to a hoax insanity aside my uncle was still a mining engineer sometimes he could tell within minutes whether a mine would pay or not the little angel was a bust he knew that he never had any intention of finding a highgrade lode i dont have the vaguest idea of what his game was mr donner but one thing im certain of whoever pumps the water from the lower levels of that old shaft will find no bones donner finished off his manhattan and looked quizzically at young so you think the nine men who went into the mine escaped young smiled nobody actually saw them enter mr donner it was assumed and reasonably so that they died down there in the black waters because they were never heard from again not enough evidence donner said oh i have more lots more young replied enthusiastically im listening item one the little angels lowest working chamber was a good hundred feet above the mean water level at worst the walls leaked only moderately from surface accumulations the lower shaft levels were already flooded because the water had gradually built up during the years the mine was originally shut down therefore there was no way a dynamite blast could have unleashed a tidal wave of water over my uncle and his crew item two the equipment supposedly found in the mine after the accident was old used junk those men were professionals mr donner theyd never have gone below the surface with secondrate machinery item three though he made it known to everyone that he was reopening the mine my uncle never once consulted or discussed the project with ernest bloeser the man who owned the little angel in short my uncle was claim jumping an unthinkable act to a man of his moral reputation item four the first warning of possible disaster didnt come until the next afternoon when the foreman of the satan mine one bill mahoney found a note under his cabin door that said help little angel mine come quick a most strange method to sound an alarm dont you think naturally the note was unsigned item five the sheriff in central city stated that my uncle had given him a list of the crews names with the request that he give it to the newspapers in case of a fatal accident an odd premonition to say the least it was as if uncle joshua wanted to be certain there was no mistaking the victims identities donner pushed back his plate and drank a glass of water i find your theory intriguing but not fully convincing ah but finally perhaps above all mr donner i have saved the piece de resistance until last item six several months after the tragedy my mother and father who were on a tour through europe saw my uncle standing on the boattrain platform in southampton england my mother often related how she went up to him and said god in heaven joshua is it really you the face that stared back at her was bearded and deathly white the eyes glassy forget me he whispered and then turned and ran my father chased him down the platform but soon lost him in the crowd the logical answer is a simple case of mistaken identity a sister who doesnt know her own brother young said sarcastically come now mr donner surely you could pick your brother out of a crowd fraid not i was an only child a shame you missed one of lifes great joys at least i didnt have to share my toys the check arrived and donner threw a credit card on the tray so what youre saying is that the little angel disaster was a coverup thats my theory young patted his mouth with his napkin no way of proving it of course but ive always had a haunting feeling that the societe des mines de lorraine was in back of it who were they they were and still are to france what krupp is to germany what mitsubichi is to japan what anaconda is to the united states where does the societewhatever you call itfit in they were the french financiers who hired joshua hays brewster as their engineermanager of exploration they were the only ones with enough capital to pay nine men to vanish off the face of the earth but why where is the motive young gestured helplessly i dont know he leaned forward and his eyes seemed to burn but i do know that whatever the price whatever the influence it took my uncle and his eightman crew to some unnamed hell outside the country until the bodies are recovered whos to say youre wrong young stared at him you are a courteous man mr donner i thank you for what a free lunch at the governments expense for not laughing young said softly donner nodded and said nothing the man across the table had just spliced one tiny strand of the frayed puzzle to the redbearded bones in the bednaya mountain mine there was nothing to laugh about nothing to laugh about in the least seagram returned the farewell smile from the stewardess stepped off the united jet and prepared himself for the quartermile trip to the street entrance of the los angeles international airport he finally reached the front lobby and unlike donner who had rented his car from no seagram preferred dealing with no and signed out a lincoln from hertz he turned onto century boulevard and within a few blocks entered the onramp south to the san diego freeway it was a cloudless day and the smog was surprisingly light allowing a hazy view of the sierra madre mountains he drove leisurely in the righthand lane of the freeway at sixty miles an hour while the mainstream of local traffic sped by the lincoln doing seventyfive and eighty with routine indifference to the posted fiftyfive miles an hour limit he soon left the chemical refineries of torrance and the oil derricks around long beach behind and entered the vastness of orange county where the terrain suddenly flattened out and gave way to a great unending sea of tract homes it took him a little over an hour to reach the turnoff for leisure world it was an idyllic setting golf courses swimming pools stables neatly manicured lawns and park areas goldentanned senior citizens on bicycles he stopped at the main gate and an elderly guard in uniform checked him through and gave him directions to b calle aragon it was a picturesque little duplex tucked neatly on the slope of a hill overlooking an immaculate park seagram parked the lincoln against the curb walked through a small courtyard patio filled with rose bushes and poked the doorbell the door opened and his fears vanished adeline hobart was definitely not the senile type mr seagram the voice was light and cheerful yes mrs hobart please come in she extended her hand the grip was as firm as a mans goodness nobodys called me that in over seventy years when i received your longdistance call regarding jake i was so surprised i almost forgot to take my geritol adeline was stout but she carried her extra pounds easily her blue eyes seemed to laugh with every sentence and her face carried a warm gentle look she was everyones idea of a sweet little old snowhaired lady you dont strike me as the geritol type he said she patted his arm if that is meant as flattery ill buy it she motioned him to a chair in a tastefully furnished living room come and sit down you will stay for lunch wont you id be honored if its no trouble of course not bert is off chasing around the golf course and i appreciate the company seagram looked up bert my husband but i was under the impression i was still jake hobarts widow she finished his sentence smiling innocently the truth of the matter is i became mrs bertram austin sixtytwo years ago does the army know oh heavens yes wrote letters to the war department notifying them of my marital status a long time ago but they simply sent polite noncommittal replies and kept mailing the checks even though youd remarried adeline shrugged im only human mr seagram why argue with the government if they insist on sending money whos to tell them theyre crazy a lucrative little arrangement she nodded i wont deny it particularly when you include the ten thousand dollars i received at jakes death seagram leaned forward his eyes narrowed the army paid you a tenthousanddollar indemnity wasnt that a bit steep for you couldnt be half as surprised as i was then she said yes that amount of money was a small fortune in those days was there any explanation none she replied i can still see the check after all these years all it said was widows payment and it was made out to me thats all there was to it perhaps we can start at the beginning when i met jake seagram nodded her eyes looked beyond him for a few moments i met jake during the terrible winter of it was in leadville colorado and i had just turned sixteen my father was on a business trip to the mining fields to investigate possible investment in several claims and since it was close to christmas and i had a few days vacation from school he relented and took mother and me along the train barely made it into leadville station when the worst blizzard in forty years struck the high country of colorado it lasted for two weeks and believe me it was no picnic especially when you consider that the altitude of leadville is over ten thousand feet it must have been quite an adventure for a sixteenyearold girl it was dad paced the hotel lobby like a trapped bull while mother just sat and worried but i thought it was marvelous and jake one day mother and i were struggling across the street to the general storean ordeal when you are lashed by fiftymileanhour winds at twenty degrees below zero when out of nowhere this giant brute of a man picks each of us up under one arm and carries us through the snowdrifts and deposits us on the doorstep of the store just as sassy as you please it was jake yes she said distantly it was jake what did he look like he was a large man over six feet barrelchested hed worked in the mines in wales when he was a boy anytime you saw a crowd of men a mile away you could easily pick jake out he was the one with the bright red hair and heard who was always laughing red hair and beard yes he was quite proud of the fact that he stood out from the rest all the world loves a man who laughs she smiled broadly it certainly wasnt love at first sight on my part i can tell you to me jake looked like a big uncouth bear he was hardly the type to tickle a young girls fancy but you married him she nodded he courted me all during the blizzard and when the sun finally broke through the clouds on the fourteenth day i accepted his proposal mother and dad were distraught of course but jake won them over too you couldnt have been married long i saw him for the last time a year later the day he and the others were lost in the little angel it was more statement than question yes she said wistfully she avoided his stare and looked nervously toward the kitchen my goodness id better fix us some lunch you must be starving mr seagram but seagrams businesslike expression faded and his eyes came alight with sudden excitement you heard from jake after the little angel accident didnt you mrs austin she seemed to retreat into the cushions of her chair apprehension spread across her gentle face i dont know what you mean i think you do he said softly no no youre mistaken why are you afraid her hands were trembling now ive told you all i can theres more much more mrs austin he reached over and took her hands why are you afraid he repeated im sworn to secrecy she murmured can you explain she said hesitantly youre with the government mr seagram you know what it is to keep a secret who was it jake did he ask you to remain silent she shook her head then who please believe me she pleaded i cant tell you i cant tell you anything seagram stood up and looked down on her she seemed to have aged the wrinkles etched more deeply in her ancient skin she had withdrawn into a shell it would take a mild form of shock treatment to get her to open up may i use your telephone mrs austin yes of course youll find the nearest extension in the kitchen it was seven minutes before the familiar voice came through the earpiece quickly seagram explained the situation and made his request then he turned back to the living room mrs austin can you come here a moment timidly she approached him he handed her the receiver here is someone who wishes to speak to you cautiously she took it from his hands hello she muttered this is adeline austin for a brief instant an expression of confusion was mirrored in her eyes then it was slowly transformed and froze into genuine astonishment she kept nodding saying nothing as though the detached voice over the line was standing before her finally at the end of the onesided conversation she managed to utter a few words yes sir i will goodby slowly she replaced the receiver and stood in a trancelike bewilderment was was that really the president of the united states it was you can verify it if you wish call long distance and ask for the white house when they answer talk to gregg collins hes the presidents chief aide it was he who passed along my call just imagine the president asked me to help him she shook her head dazedly i cant believe it really happened it happened mrs austin believe me any information you can give us concerning your first husband and the strange circumstances surrounding his death would be of great benefit to the nation i know that sounds like a trite way of stating it but who can turn down a president the sweet smile was back the tremor was gone from adelines hands she was back on balance outwardly at least seagram took her arm and gently guided her back to her chair in the living room now then tell me about jake hobarts relationship with joshua hays brewster jake was an explosives specialist a blaster one of the best in the fields he knew dynamite like a blacksmith knew his forge and since mr brewster insisted on only the top men to make up his mining crews he often hired jake to handle the blasting did brewster know jake was married odd you should ask that we had a little house in boulder away from the mining camps because jake didnt want it known he had a wife he claimed that mine foremen wouldnt hire a blaster who was married so naturally brewster unaware of jakes marital status paid him to blast in the little angel mine i know what was printed in the newspapers mr seagram but jake never set foot in the little angel mine nor did the rest of the crew seagram pulled his chair closer so that they were almost touching knees then the disaster was a hoax he said hoarsely she looked up you know you know that we suspected but have no proof if its proof you want mr austin ill get it for you she rose to her feet shrugging off seagrams attempts to help her and disappeared into another room she returned carrying an old shoebox which she proceeded to open reverently the day before he was to enter the little angel jake took me down to denver and we went on a shopping spree he bought me fancy clothes jewelry and treated me to champagne at the finest restaurant in town we spent our last night together in the honeymoon suite of the brown palace hotel do you know of it i have a friend staying there right now in the morning he told me not to believe what i heard or read in the newspapers about his death in a mining accident and that he would be gone for several months on a job somewhere in russia when he returned he said we would be rich beyond our wildest dreams then he mentioned something ive never understood what was that he said the frenchies were taking care of everything and that when it was all over we would live in paris her face took on a dreamlike quality in the morning he was gone on his pillow was a note that simply said i love you ad and an envelope containing five thousand dollars do you have any idea where the money came from none we only had about three hundred dollars in the bank at the time and that was the last you heard from him no she handed seagram a faded postcard with a tinted photograph of the eiffel tower on the front this came in the mail about a month later dear ad the weather is rainy here and the beer awful am fine and so is the other boys dont fret as you can tell i aint dead by a long shot you know who the handwriting was obviously from a heavy hand the postmark on the card was dated paris december it was followed in a week by a second card adeline said as she handed it to seagram it depicted sacra coeur but was postmarked le havre dearad were headin for the arctic this will be my last message for some time be brave the frenchies are treating us right good food good ship you know who youre certain its jakes handwriting seagram asked absolutely i have other papers and old letters of jakes you can compare them if you wish that wont be necessary ad she smiled when she heard her nickname was there any further communication she nodded the third and last jake must have stocked up on picture postcards of paris this one shows the saintechapelle but it was mailed from aberdeen scotland on april dearad this is a frightful place the cold is fearsome we dont know if we will survive if i can somehow get this to you you will be taken care of god bless jake along the side another hand had written in dear mrs hobart we lost jake in a storm we gave him a christian readin were sorry vh seagram took out the list of the crews names that donner had read him over the phone vh must have been vernon hall he said yes vern and jake were good friends what happened after that who swore you to secrecy about two months later i think it was early in june a colonel patman or patmorei cant remember which came to the house in boulder and told me it was imperative that i never reveal any contact from jake after the little angel mine affair did he give any reason she shook her head no he simply said it was in the interest of the government to remain silent and then he handed me the check for ten thousand dollars and departed seagram sagged in his chair as though a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders it didnt seem possible that this little ninetythreeyearold woman should have the key to a lost billiondollar ore cache but she did seagram looked at her and smiled that offer of lunch is beginning to sound awfully good about now she grinned back and he could see the mischief in her eyes as jake would have said to hell with lunch lets have a beer first the crimson rays of the sunset were still lingering on the western horizon when the first rumble of distant thunder signaled the approach of a lightning storm the air was warm and the gentle offshore breeze felt good on seagrams face as he sat on the terrace of the balboa bay club and sipped his afterdinner cognac it was eight oclock the hour when the fashionable residents of newport beach began their evening socializing seagram had taken a dip in the club pool and then eaten early he sat there listening to the grumbling of the nearing storm the air became thick and charged with electricity but there was no sign of rain or wind in the photographic flash of the lightning he could see pleasure boats cruising up the bay showing red and green navigation lights their white paint giving them the appearance of silent gliding ghosts lightning stabbed the night air again a jagged fork splitting the clouded sky he watched it strike somewhere behind the balboa island rooftops and in almost the same instant the roar of the thunder thrust against his eardrums like a cannon barrage everyone else had nervously moved inside the dining room and seagram soon found the terrace deserted he stayed enjoying mother natures display of fireworks he finished off the cognac and leaned back in his chair watching for the next flash of lightning it soon came and illuminated a figure standing beside his table in that instant of light he made out a tall man with black hair and rugged features staring down at him through cool piercing eyes then the stranger blended into the darkness again as the thunder rumbled away a seemingly disembodied voice asked are you gene seagram seagram hesitated waiting for his eyes to readjust themselves to the dark that followed the flash i am i believe youve been looking for me at the moment you have the advantage my apologies im dirk pitt the skies lit up again and seagram was relieved to see a smiling face it would seem mr pitt that dramatic entrances are a habit with you did you also conjure up this electrical storm pitts answering laugh came to the accompaniment of a clap of thunder i havent mastered that feat yet but i am making progress at parting the red sea seagram gestured to an empty chair wont you sit down thank you id offer you a drink but my waiter apparently has a fear of lightning the worst of it is passing pitt said looking skyward the voice was quiet and controlled how did you find me seagram asked a stepbystep process pitt replied i called your wife in washington and she said you were on a business trip to leisure world since its only a few miles from here i checked with the guard at the gate he told me he had admitted a gene seagram who was okayed for entry by a mrs bertram austin she in turn mentioned she had recommended the balboa bay club when you stated a desire to postpone your flight back to washington and lay over until tomorrow the rest was easy i should feel flattered by your persistent style pitt nodded all very elementary a fortunate circumstance that we happened to be in the same neck of the woods seagram said i always like to take a few days off and go surfing about this time of year my parents have a house just across the hay i could have contacted you sooner but admiral sandecker said there was no hurry you know the admiral i work for him then youre with numa yes im the agencys special projects director i thought your name sounded vaguely familiar my wife has mentioned you dana yes have you worked with her only once i flew in supplies to pitcairn island last summer when she and her numa archaeological team were diving for artifacts from the bounty seagram looked at him so admiral sandecker told you there was no hurry to contact me pitt smiled from what i gather you rubbed him wrong with a middleofthenight phone call the black clouds had rolled seaward and the lightning was stabbing at catalina across the channel now that you have me in your sights pitt said what can i do for you you can begin by telling me about novaya zemlya not much to tell pitt said casually i was in charge of the expedition to pick up your man when he didnt show on schedule i borrowed the ships helicopter and made a reconnaissance flight toward the russian island you took a chance soviet radar might have picked you up on their scopes i took that possibility into consideration i stayed within ten feet of the water and kept my air speed down to fifteen knots even if i had been spotted my radar blip would have read as a small fishing boat what happened after you reached the island i cruised the shoreline until i found koplins sloop moored in a cove i set the copter down on the beach nearby and began searching for him it was then i heard shots through a wall of swirling snow that had been kicked up by a gust of wind how was it possible to run onto koplin and the russian patrol guard finding them in the middle of a snowstorm is akin to stumbling on a needle in a frozen haystack needles dont bark pitt answered i followed the sound of a dog on the hunt it led me to koplin and the guard the latter of course you murdered seagram said i suppose a prosecuting attorney might suggest that pitt gestured airily on the other hand it seemed the thing to do at the time what if the guard had been one of my agents also comradesinarms dont sadistically drag each other through the snow by the scruff of the neck especially when one of them is seriously wounded and the dog did you have to kill the dog the thought occurred to me that left to his own devices he might have led a search patrol back to his masters body as it is chances are neither will be discovered ever do you always carry a gun with a silencer this wasnt the first time admiral sandecker called upon me for a dirty job outside my normal duties pitt said before you flew koplin to your ship i take it you destroyed his sloop seagram said rather cleverly i think pitt replied there was no inflection of conceit in his tone i bashed a hole in the hull raised the sail and sent her on her way i should judge that she found a watery grave about three miles from shore you were far too confident seagram said testily you dared to meddle in something that didnt concern you you taunted russian vigilance by taking a grave risk without authority and you coldbloodedly murdered a man and his animal if we were all like you mr pitt this would be a sorry nation indeed pitt rose and leaned across the table until he was eyeball to eyeball with seagram you dont do me justice he said his eyes cold as glaciers you left out the best parts it was i who gave your friend koplin two pints of blood during his operation it was i who ordered the ship to bypass oslo and lay a course for the nearest us military airfield and it was i who talked the base commander out of his private transport plane for koplins flight back to the states in conclusion mr seagram bloodthirsty maddog pitt pleads guilty guilty of salvaging the broken pieces of your sneaky little spy mission in the arctic i didnt expect a tickertape parade down broadway or a gold medal a simple thank you would have done nicely instead your mouth flows with a diarrheal discharge of rudeness and sarcasm i dont know what your fangup is seagram but one thing comes through loud and clear you are a gradea asshole and as kindly as i can put it you can go fuck yourself with that pitt turned and walked into the shadows and was gone professor peter barshov pushed a leathery hand through his graying hair and pointed the stem of his meerschaum pipe across the desk at prevlov no no let me assure you captain that the man i sent to novaya zemlya is not subject to hallucinations but a mine tunnel prevlov muttered incredulously an unknown unrecorded mine tunnel on russian soil i wouldnt have thought it possible but nonetheless a fact barshov replied indications of it first appeared on our aerial contour photos according to my geologist who gained entrance the tunnel was very old perhaps between seventy and eighty years where did it come from not where captain the question is who who excavated it and why you say the leongorod institute of geology has no record of it prevlov asked barshov shook his head not a word however you might find a trace of it in the old okhrana files okhrana oh yes the secret police of the czars prevlov paused a moment no not likely their sole concern in those days was revolution they wouldnt have bothered with a clandestine mining operation clandestine you cant be sure of that prevlov turned and gazed out the window forgive me professor but in my line of work i attach machiavellian motives to everything barshov removed the pipe from between his stained teeth and tamped its bowl i have often read of ghost mines in the western hemisphere but this is the first such mystery ive heard of in the soviet union it is almost as if this quaint phenomenon was a gift of the americans why do you say that prevlov turned and faced barshov again what have they got to do with it perhaps nothing perhaps everything the equipment found inside the tunnel was manufactured in the united states hardly proof positive prevlov said skeptically the equipment could merely have been purchased from the americans and used by other parties barshov smiled a valid assumption captain except for the fact that the body of a man was discovered in the tunnel i have it on reliable authority that his epitaph was written in the american vernacular interesting prevlov said i apologize for not providing you with more indepth data barshov said my remarks you understand are purely secondhand you will have a detailed report on your desk in the morning concerning our findings at novaya zemyla and my people will be at your disposal for any further investigation the navy is grateful for your cooperation professor the leongorod institute is always at the service of our country barshov rose and gave a stiff bow if that is all for now captain i will get back to my office there is one more thing professor yes you didnt mention whether your geologists found any trace of minerals nothing of value nothing at all trace elements of nickel and zinc plus slight radioactive indications of uranium thorium and byzanium im not familiar with the last two thorium can be converted into nuclear fuel when bombarded by neutrons barshov explained its also used in the manufacture of different magnesium alloys and byzanium very little is known about it none has ever been discovered in enough quantity to conduct constructive experiments barshov tapped his pipe in an ashtray the french are the only ones who have shown interest in it over the years prevlov looked up the french they have spent millions of francs sending geological expeditions around the world looking for it to my knowledge none of them was successful it would seem then that they know something our scientists do not barshov shrugged we do not lead the world in every scientific endeavor captain if we did we and not the americans would be driving autos over the moons surface thank you again professor i look forward to your final report four blocks from the naval department building lieutenant pavel marganin relaxed on a park bench casually reading a book of poems it was noontime and the grassy areas were crowded with office workers eating their lunch beneath the evenly spaced rows of trees every so often he looked up and cast an appraising eye on the occasional pretty girl who wandered by at half past twelve a fat man in a rumpled business suit sat down on the other end of the bench and began unwrapping a small roll of black bread and a cup of potato soup he turned to marganin and smiled broadly will you share a bit of bread sailor the stranger said jovially he patted his paunch i have more than enough for two my wife always insists on feeding me too much and keeping me fat so the young girls wont chase after me marganin shook his head no and went back to his reading the man shrugged and seemed to bite off a piece of the bread he began chewing vigorously but it was an act his mouth was empty what have you got for me he murmured between jaw movements marganin stared into his book raising it slightly to cover his lips prevlov is having an affair with a woman who has black hair shortly cropped wears expensive size six lowheeled shoes and is partial to chartreuse liqueur she drives an american embassy car license number usaonefoursix are you sure of your facts i dont create fiction marganin muttered while nonchalantly turning a page i suggest you act on my information immediately it may be the wedge we have been looking for i will have her identified before sunset the stranger began slurping his soup noisily anything else i need data on the sicilian project i never heard of it marganin lowered the book and rubbed his eyes keeping a hand in front of his lips its a defense project connected somehow with the national underwater and marine agency they may prove fussy about leaks on defense projects tell them not to worry it will be handled discreetly six days from now the mens toilet of the borodino restaurant sixforty in the evening marganin closed his book and stretched the stranger slurped another spoonful of soup in acknowledgment and totally ignored marganin who rose and strolled off in the direction of the soviet naval building the presidents secretary smiled courteously and got up from behind his desk he was tall and young and had a friendly eager face mrs seagram of course please step this way he led dana to the white house elevator and stood aside for her to enter she put on a show of indifference staring straight ahead if he knew or suspected anything hed be mentally stripping her to the skin she sneaked a quick glance at the secretarys face his eyes remained inscrutably locked on the blinking floorlights the doors opened and she followed him down the hall and into one of the thirdfloor bedrooms there it is on the mantel the secretary said we found it in the basement in an unmarked crate a beautiful piece of work the president insisted we bring it up where it can be admired danas eyes narrowed as she found herself looking at the model of a sailing ship that rested in a glass case above the fireplace he was hoping you might be able to shed some light on its history the secretary continued as you can see there is no indication of a name either on the hull or the dust case she moved uncertainly toward the fireplace for a closer look she was confused this was hardly what she had expected over the telephone earlier that morning the secretary had simply said the president wonders if it would be convenient for you to drop by the white house about two oclock a strange sensation passed through her body she wasnt sure if it was a feeling of letdown or relief earlyeighteenthcentury merchantman by the look of her she said id have to make some sketches and compare them with old records in the naval archives admiral sandecker said if anybody could identify her you could admiral sandecker yes it was he who recommended you to the president the secretary moved toward the doorway there is a pad and pencil on the nightstand beside the bed i have to get back to my desk please feel free to take as much time as you need but wont the president hes playing golf this afternoon you wont be bothered just take the elevator down to the main floor when youre finished then before dana could reply the secretary turned and left dana sat heavily on the bed and sighed she had rushed home after the phone call taken a perfumed bath and carefully donned a girlish virginal white dress over black lingerie and it had all been for nothing the president didnt want sex he simply wanted her to put the make on some damned old ships model utterly defeated she went into the bathroom and checked her face when she came out the bedroom door was closed and the president was standing by the fireplace looking tanned and youthful in a polo shirt and slacks danas eyes flew wide for a moment she couldnt think of anything to say youre supposed to be golfing she finally said stupidly thats what it says in my appointment book then this model ship business the brig roanoke out of virginia he said nodding at the model her keel was laid in and she went on the rocks off nova scotia in my father built the model from scratch about forty years ago you went to all this trouble just to get me alone she said dazedly thats obvious isnt it she stared at him he met her eyes steadily and she blushed you see he went on i wanted to have a little informal chat just the two of us without interference or interruption from the hassles of my office the room reeled about her you you just want to talk he looked at her curiously for a moment and then he began to chuckle you flatter me mrs seagram it was never my intent to seduce you i fear my reputation as a ladies man is somewhat exaggerated but at the party i think i understand he took her by the hand and led her to a chair when i whispered i must meet you alone you took it as a proposition from a lecherous old man forgive me that was not my intent dana sighed i wondered what a man who could have any one of a hundred million women just by snapping his fingers could possibly see in a drab married thirtyone year old marine archaeologist you dont do yourself justice he said suddenly serious you are really quite lovely again she found herself blushing no man has made a pass at me in years perhaps it is because most honorable men do not make passes at married women id like to think so he pulled up a chair and sat opposite her she sat primly her knees pressed together hands in lap the question when it came caught her totally unprepared tell me mrs seagram are you still in love with him she stared at him incomprehension written in her eyes who your husband of course gene yes gene he said smiling unless you have another spouse hidden away somewhere why must you ask that she said gene is cracking at the seams dana looked puzzled he works hard but i cant believe he is on the verge of a mental breakdown not in the strict clinical sense no the presidents expression was grim he is however under enormous pressure if he is faced with serious marital problems on top of his workload he might fall over the brink i cannot allow that to happen not yet not until he completes a highly secret project that is vital to the nation its that very damned secret project thats come between us she burst out angrily that and a few other problemssuch as your refusal to bear children she looked at him thunderstruck how could you possibly know all this the usual methods it makes no difference how what matters is that you stick with gene for the next sixteen months and give him all the tender loving care you can find in your soul to give nervously she folded and unfolded her hands its that important she asked in a faint voice its that important he said will you help me she nodded silently good he patted her hands between us maybe we can keep gene on the track ill try mr president if it means so much ill try i can promise no more i have complete confidence in you but i draw the line at having a baby she said defiantly he grinned the famous grin so often captured by photographers i can order a war and i can order men to die but not even the president of the united states has the power to order a woman to become pregnant for the first time she laughed it seemed so strange talking intimately with a man who wielded such incredible power power was indeed an aphrodisiac and she began to feel the bitter disappointment of not being taken to bed the president rose and took her arm i must go now i have a meeting with my economic advisers in a few minutes he began guiding her toward the door then he stopped and drew her face to his and she felt the firmness of his lips when he let her go he looked into her eyes and said you are a very desirable woman mrs seagram dont you forget that he escorted her to the elevator dana was waiting on the concourse when seagram departed his plane what gives he eyed her questioningly you havent met me at the airport in ages an overwhelming impulse of affection she smiled he claimed his luggage and they walked to the parking lot she held his arm tightly the afternoon seemed a faraway dream now she had to keep reminding herself that another man had found her alluring and had actually kissed her she took the wheel and drove onto the highway the last of the rushhour traffic had faded away and she made good time through the virginia countryside do you know dirk pitt he asked breaking the silence yes hes admiral sandeckers special projects director why im going to burn the bastards ass he said she glanced at him in astonishment whats your connection with him he screwed up an important part of the project her hands tightened on the wheel youll find him a tough ass to burn she said why do you say that hes considered a legend around numa his list of achievements since he joined the agency is second only to his outstanding war record so so hes admiral sandeckers fairhaired boy you forget i carry more weight with the president than admiral sandecker more weight than senator george pitt of california she said flatly he turned and looked at her theyre related father and son he slouched in a morose silence for the next several miles dana put her right hand on his knee when she stopped at a red light she leaned over and kissed him what was that for thats a bribe how much is it going to cost me he grumbled i have this great idea she announced why dont we take in that new brando film and afterward we can have a scrumptious lobster dinner at the old potomac inn then go home turn out the lights and take me to the office he said i have work to do please gene dont push yourself she pleaded theres time for your work tomorrow no now he said the chasm between them was uncrossable and from now on things would never be the same again seagram looked down at the metal attaché case on his desk then up at the colonel and the captain who were standing across from him theres no mistake on this the colonel shook his head researched and verified by the director of defense archives sir that was fast work thank you the colonel made no attempt to leave sorry sir i am to wait and return to the department of defense with the file on my person by whose orders the secretary the colonel answered defense department policy dictates that all material classified as code five confidential must be kept under surveillance at all times i understand seagram said may i study the file alone yes sir my aide and i will wait outside but i must respectfully request that no one be allowed to enter or leave your office while the file is in your possession seagram nodded all right gentlemen make yourselves comfortable my secretary will be at your service for coffee and refreshments thank you for your courtesy mr seagram and one more thing seagram said and smiled faintly i have my own private bathroom so dont expect to see me for a while seagram sat motionless for several moments after the door closed the final vindication of five years work lay before his eyes or did it maybe the documents within the case would only lead to another mystery or worse yet a dead end he inserted the key into the case and opened it inside there were four folders and a small notebook the labels on the folders read cdc report on the scientific and monetary value of the rare element byzanium cdc correspondence between secretary of war and joshua hays brewster examining the possible acquirement of byzanium cdc memorandum by secretary of war to the president regarding funds for secret army plan r cdc report of closed investigation into the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of joshua hays brewster the notebook was simply entitled journal of joshua hays brewster logic dictated that seagram study the folders first but logic was set aside as he settled back in his chair and opened the journal four hours later he stacked the book neatly on top of the folders and pushed a button on the side of his intercom almost immediately a recessed panel in a side wall swung open and a man in a white technicians coat entered how soon can you copy all this the technician thumbed through the book and peeked in the folders give me fortyfive minutes seagram nodded okay get right on it theres someone in my outer office whos waiting for the originals after the panel closed seagram pushed himself wearily from his chair and staggered into the bathroom he closed the door and leaned against it his face twisted in a grotesque mask oh god no he moaned its not fair its not fair the he leaned over the sink and vomited the president shook hands with seagram and donner in the doorway of his study at camp david sorry to ask you up here at seven in the morning but its he only time i could squeeze you in no problem mr president said donner im usually out jogging about this time anyway the president stared at donners rotund frame with mused eyes who knows i may have saved you from a coronary he laughed at donners woeful expression and motioned them into the study come come sit down and make yourselves at home ive ordered a light breakfast they grouped themselves about on a sofa and chair in front of a spacious picture window overlooking the maryland hills coffee came with a tray of sweet rolls and the president passed them around well gene i hope the news is good for a change the sicilian project is our only hope of stopping this crazy arms race with the russians and chinese the president rubbed his eyes wearily it has to be the greatest display of stupidity since the dawn of man particularly when you consider the tragic and absurd fact that we can each blow the others country to ashes at least five times over he gestured helplessly so much for the sad facts of life suppose you tell me where we stand seagram looked blearyeyed across the coffee table holding the copy of the defense archive file you are of course mr president aware of our progress to date yes ive studied the reports of your investigation seagram handed the president a copy of brewsters journal i think youll find this an absorbing account of earlytwentiethcentury intrigue and human suffering the first entry is dated july and opens with joshua hays brewsters departure from the taimyr mountains near the north coast of siberia there he spent nine months opening a lead mine under contract with his employer the societe des mines de lorraine for the czar of russia he then goes on to tell how his ship a small coastal steamer bound for archangel became lost in fog and ran aground on the upper island of novaya zemlya fortunately the ship held together and the survivors managed to exist within its freezing steel hull until they were rescued by a russian naval frigate nearly a month later it was during this sojourn that brewster spent his time prospecting the island sometime during the eighteenth day he stumbled on an outcropping of strange rock on the slopes of bednaya mountain he had never seen that type of composition before so he took several samples back with him to the united states finally reaching new york sixtytwo days after he left the taimyr mine so now we know how the byzanium was discovered the president said seagram nodded and continued brewster turned all his samples over to his employer save one that he kept purely as a souvenir some months later having heard nothing he asked the united states director of the societe des mines de lorraine what had become of his bednaya mountain ore samples he was told they had assayed out as worthless and had been thrown away suspicious brewster took the remaining sample to the bureau of mines in washington for analysis he was astounded when he learned it was byzanium hitherto a virtually unknown element seen only rarely through a highpowered microscope had brewster informed the societe as to the location of the byzanium outcropping the president asked no he played it shrewd and merely gave them vague directions to the site in fact he even suggested that it lay on the lower island of novaya zemlya many miles to the south why the subterfuge a common tactic among prospectors donner answered by withholding the exact location of a promising find the discoverer can negotiate a higher percentage of the profits against the day the mine becomes operational makes sense the president murmured but what cited the french to secrecy back in what could they possibly have seen in byzanium that no one else saw for the next seventy years its similarity to radium for one thing seagram said the societe des mines passed brewsters samples on to the radium institute in paris where their scientists found that certain properties of byzanium and radium were identical and since it cost fifty thousand dollars to process one gram of radium donner added the french government suddenly saw a chance to corner the worlds only known supply of a fantastically expensive element given enough time they could have realized hundreds of millions of dollars on a few pounds of byzanium the president shook his head in disbelief my god if i remember my weights and measures correctly there are about twentyeight grams to the ounce thats right sir one ounce of byzanium was worth one million four hundred thousand dollars and thats at prices the president slowly stood up and gazed out the window what was brewsters next move he turned over his information to the war department seagram pulled out the folder on the funds for secret army plan r and opened it if they knew the full story the boys over at cia would be proud of their ancestor organization once the generals of the old army intelligence bureau saw what brewster was onto they dreamed up the grandest doublecross of the century brewster was ordered to inform the societe des mines that he had identified the ore samples and bluff them into thinking he was going to form a mining syndicate and go after the byzanium on his own he had the frenchies by the balls and they knew it by this time theyd figured that his directions to the outcropping were off the mark no brewster no byzanium it was that simple they had no choice but to sign him on as chief engineer for a piece of the profits why couldnt our own government have backed a mining operation the president asked why let the french into the picture two reasons seagram replied first since the byzanium was on foreign soil the mine would have to be operated in secret if the miners were caught by the russians the french government would get the blame not the americans second the congress in those days penny pinched the army to death there were simply not enough funds to include a mining venture in the arctic regardless of the potential profit it would seem the french were playing against a stacked deck it was a twoway street mr president there was no doubt in brewsters mind that once he opened the bednaya mountain mine and began shipping the ore he and his crew of men would be murdered by paid assassins of the societe des mines de lorraine that was obvious from the societys fanatical insistence on secrecy and one other little matter it was the french and not brewster who masterminded the little angel mine tragedy you have to give them credit for playing a good game said donner the little angel hoax was the perfect cover for eventually killing off brewster and his entire crew after all how could anyone be accused of murdering nine men in the arctic when it was a matter of public record that they had all died six months earlier in a colorado mining accident seagram continued were reasonably certain that the societe des mines spirited our heroes to new york in a private railroad car from there they probably took passage on a french ship under assumed names one question i wish youd clear up the president said in reading over your report donner here stated that the mining equipment found at novaya zemlya was ordered through the us government that piece doesnt fit again a cover story by the french seagram replied the jensen and thor files also showed that the drilling equipment was paid for by a check drawn on a washington dc bank the account as it turns out was under the name of the french ambassador it was simply one more ruse to cloud the true operation they didnt miss a trick did they seagram nodded they planned well but for all their insight they had no idea they were being led down the garden path after paris then what the president persisted the coloradans spent two weeks at the societe office ordering supplies and making final preparations for the dig when at last all was in readiness they boarded a french naval transport in le havre and slipped into the english channel it took twelve days for the ship to pick its way through the barents sea ice floes before it finally anchored off novaya zemlya after the men and equipment were safely ashore brewster shifted the secret army plan into first gear and ordered the captain of the supply ship not to return for the ore until the first week in june nearly seven months away the plan being that the coloradans and the byzanium would be long gone by the time the societe des mines ship returned exactly they beat the deadline by two months it took only five months for the gang to pry the precious element from the bowels of that icy hell it was bodybreaking work drilling blasting and digging through solid granite while stabbed by fiftydegreebelowzero temperatures never during the long winter months high along the continental divide of the rockies had they ever experienced anything like the frigid winds that howled down across the sea from the great polar ice cap to the north winds that paused only long enough to deposit the terrible cold and replenish bednaya mountains permanent ice sheet before sweeping on toward the russian coast just over the horizon to the south it took a frightful toll on the men jake hobart died from exposure when he became lost in a snowstorm and the others all suffered terribly from fatigue and frostbite in brewsters own words it was a frozen purgatory not fit to waste good spit on its a miracle they didnt all die the president said good old hardy guts saw them through seagram said in the end they beat the odds they had wrested the worlds rarest mineral from that wasteland and they had pulled off the job without detection it had been a classic operation of stealth and engineering skill they escaped the island with the ore then yes mr president seagram nodded brewster and his crew covered over the waste dump and orecar tracks and concealed the entrance to the mine then they hauled the byzanium to the beach where they loaded it on board a small threeroasted steamer dispatched by the war department under the guise of a polar expedition the ship was under the command of a lieutenant pratt of the united states navy how much ore did they take according to sid koplins estimates about half a ton of extremely highgrade ore and when processed a rough guess at best would put it in the neighborhood of five hundred ounces more than enough to complete the sicilian project the president said more than enough donner acknowledged did they make it back to the states no sir somehow the french had figured the game and were patiently waiting for the americans to do the dangerous dirty work before stepping on the stage and snatching the prize a few miles off the southern coast of norway before lieutenant pratt could set a course east onto the shipping lane for new york they were attacked by a mysterious steam cutter that bore no national flag no identification no international scandal the president said the french covered every avenue seagram smiled except this time if youll pardon the pun they missed the boat like most europeans they underestimated good old yankee ingenuity our war department had also covered every contingency before the french could pump a third shot into the american ship lieutenant pratts crew had dropped the sides on a phony deckhouse and were blasting back with a concealed fiveinch gun good good the president said as teddy roosevelt might have said bully for our side the battle lasted until almost dark seagram went on then pratt got a shot into the frenchmans boiler and the cutter burst into flames but the american vessel was hurt too her holds were taking water and pratt had one killed and four of his crew seriously wounded after a consultation brewster and pratt decided to head for the nearest friendly port set the injured men ashore and ship the ore on to the states from there by dawn they limped past the breakwater at aberdeen scotland why couldnt they have simply transported the ore to an american warship surely that would have been safer than shipping it by commercial means i cant be certain seagram replied apparently brewster was afraid the french might then demand the ore through diplomatic channels thereby forcing the americans into admitting the theft and giving up the byzanium as long as he kept it in his possession our government could claim ignorance of the whole affair the president shook his head brewster must have been a lion of a man oddly enough donner said he was only fivefeettwo still an amazing man a great patriot to go through all that hell with no personal profit motive in mind you cant help but wish to god hed made it home free sadly his odyssey wasnt finished seagrams hands began to tremble the french consulate in the port city blew the whistle on the coloradans one night before they could unload the byzanium onto a truck the french agents struck without warning from the shadows of the landing dock no shots were fired it was fists and knives and clubs the hardrock men from the legendary towns of cripple creek leadville and fairplay were no strangers to violence they gave better than they took tossing six bodies into the black waters of the harbor before the rest of their assailants melted into the night but it was only the beginning crossroad after crossroad from one village to the next on city streets and from behind every tree and doorway it seemed the piratical attacks continued until the running flight across britain had bloodied the landscape with a score of dead and wounded the battles took on the aspects of a war of attrition the men from colorado were up against a massive organization which threw in five men for every two the miners eliminated the attrition began to tell john caldwell alvin coulter and thomas price died outside of glasgow charles widney fell at newcastle walter schmidt near stafford and warner odeming at birmingham one by one the tough old miners were whittled away their gore staining the cobblestone streets far from home only vernon hall and joshua hays brewster lived to set the ore on the ocean dock at southampton the president clenched his lips and tightened his fists then the french won out no mr president the french never touched the byzanium seagram picked up brewsters journal and thumbed to the back ill read the last entry its dated april the deed is only a eulogy now for i am but dead praise god the precious ore we labored so desperately to rape from the bowels of that cursed mountain lies safely in the vault of the ship only vernon will be left to tell the tale for i depart on the great white star steamer for new york within the hour knowing the ore is secure i leave this journal in the care of james rodgers assistant united states consul in southampton who will see that it reaches the proper authorities in the event i am also killed god rest the men who have gone before me how i long to return to southby a cold silence fell on the study the president turned from the window and settled in his chair once more he sat there a moment saying nothing then he spoke can it mean the byzanium is in the united states is it possible that brewster im afraid not sir seagram murmured his face pale and beaded with sweat explain yourself the president demanded seagram took a deep breath because mr president the only white star steamship that departed southampton england on april the tenth was the rms titanic the titanic the president looked as if he had been shot the truth had suddenly hit him it fits he said tonelessly it would explain why the byzanium has been lost all these years fate dealt the coloradans a cruel hand donner muttered they bled and died only to send the ore on a ship that was destined to sink in the middle of the ocean another silence deeper even than the one that had gone before the president sat granitefaced what do we do now gentlemen there was a pause of perhaps ten seconds then seagram rose unsteadily to his feet and stared down at the president the strain of the past days plus the agony of defeat swept over him there was no other door open to them they had no choice but to see it through to the finish he cleared his throat we raise the titanic he mumbled the president and donner looked up yes by god seagram said his voice suddenly hard and determined we raise the titanic the black abyss september the forbidding beauty of pure absolute black pressed against the viewport and blotted out all touch with earthly reality the total absence of light albert giordino judged took only a few minutes to shift the human mind into a state of confused disorder he had the impression of falling from a vast height with his eyes closed on a moonless night falling through an immense black void without the tiniest fragment of sensation finally a bead of sweat trickled over his brow and dropped into his left eye stinging it he shook off the spell wiped a sleeve across his face and gently eased a hand over the control panel immediately in front of him touching the various and familiar protrusions until his probing fingers reached their goal then he flicked the switch upward the lights attached to the hull of the deepsea submersible flashed on and cut a brilliant swath through the eternal night although the narrow sides of the beam abruptly turned a blackishblue the tiny organisms floating past the direct glare reflected the light for several feet above and below the area around the viewport turning his face so as not to fog the thick plexiglas giordino expelled a heavy sigh and then leaned back against the soft padding of the pilots chair it was nearly a full minute before he bent over the control console and began bringing the silent craft to life again he studied the rows of dials until the wavering needles were calibrated to his satisfaction and he scanned the circuit lights making certain they all blinked out their green message of safe operation before he reengaged the electrical systems of the sappho i he swung the chair and gazed idly down the center passageway toward the stern it might have been the newest and largest research submersible in the world to the national underwater and marine agency but to al giordino the first time he set eyes on it the general design looked like a giant cigar on an ice skate the sappho i wasnt built to compete with military submarines she was functional scientific survey of the ocean bottom was her game and her every square inch was utilized to accommodate a sevenman crew and two tons of oceanographic research instruments and equipment the sappho i would never fire a missile or cut through the sea at seventy knots but then she could operate where no other submarine had ever dared to go feet below the oceans surface yet giordino was never totally at ease he checked the depth gauge wincing at the reading of almost feet the pressure of the sea increases at the rate of fifteen pounds per square inch for every thirty feet he winced again when his mental gymnastics gave him an approximate answer of nearly pounds per square inch the pressure which at that moment was pushing against the red paint on the sappho is thick titanium skin how about a cup of fresh sediment giordino looked up into the unsmiling face of omar woodson the photographer on the mission woodson was carrying a steaming mug of coffee the chief valveand switchpusher should have had his brew exactly five minutes ago said giordino sorry some idiot turned out the lights woodson handed him the mug everything check out okay across the board giordino answered i gave the aft battery section a rest well juice off the center section for the next eighteen hours lucky we didnt drift into a rock outcropping when we shut down surely you jest giordino slid down in his seat squinted his eyes and yawned with effortless finesse sonar hasnt picked out anything larger than a baseballsize rock in the last six hours the bottom here is as flat as my girl friends stomach you mean chest woodson said ive seen her picture woodson was smiling which was rare for him nobodys perfect giordino conceded however considering the fact her father is a wealthy liquor distributor i can overlook her bad points he broke off as rudi gunn the commander of the mission leaned into the pilots compartment he was short and thin and his wide eyes magnified by a pair of hornrimmed glasses peered intently over a large roman nose giving him the look of an undernourished owl about to strike yet his appearance was deceiving rudi gunn was warm and kind every man who ever served under his command respected him enormously you two at it again gunn smiled tolerantly woodson looked solemn the same old problem hes getting horny for his girl again after fiftyone days on this drifting closet even his grandmother would forgive the gleam in his eye gunn leaned over giordino and gazed through the viewport for a few seconds only a dim blue filled his eyes then gradually just below the sappho i he could make out the reddish ooze of the top layer of bottom sediment for a brief moment a bright red shrimp barely over an inch long floated across the beam of the light before it vanished into the darkness damned shame we cant get out and walk around gunn said as he stepped back no telling what we might find out there same thing youd find in the middle of the mojave desert giordino grunted absolutely zilch he reached up and tapped a gauge colder temperature though i read a rousing thirtyfourpointeight degrees fahrenheit a great place to visit woodson said but you wouldnt want to spend your golden years there anything show on sonar gunn asked giordino nodded at a large green screen in the middle of the panel the reflected pattern of the terrain was flat nothing ahead or to the sides the profile hasnt wavered for several hours gunn wearily removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes okay gentlemen our mission is as good as ended well give it another ten hours then we surface almost as a reflex action he looked up at the overhead panel is mother still with us giordino nodded mother is hanging in there he needed only to glance at the fluctuating needle on the transducer instrument to know that the mother ship a surface support tender was continuously tracking the sappho i on sonar make contact gunn said and signal mother that well begin our ascent at ohnine hundred hours that should leave them plenty of time to load us aboard and take the sappho i in tow before sunset ive almost forgotten what a sunset looks like woodson murmured its off to the beach to recapture a suntan and ogle all those gorgeous bikiniclad honeys for papa woodson no more of these deepsea funny farms for me thank god the end is in sight giordino said another week cooped up in this overgrown wiener and ill start talking to the potted plants woodson looked at him we dont have any potted plants you get the picture gunn smiled everybody deserves a good rest you men have put on a fine show the data weve compiled should keep the lab boys busy for a long time giordino turned to gunn gave him a long look and spoke slowly this has been one hell of a weird mission rudi i dont get your meaning gunn said a poorly cast drama is what i mean take a good look at your crew he gestured to the four men working in the aft section of the submersibleben drummer a lanky southerner with a deep alabama drawl rick spencer a short blondhaired californian who whistled constantly through clenched teeth sam merker as cosmopolitan and citified as a wall street broker and henry munk a quiet droopyeyed wit who clearly wished he were anywhere but on the sappho i those clowns aft you woodson and myself were all engineers nutsandbolts mechanics there isnt a phd in the lot the first men on the moon werent intellectuals either gunn countered it takes the nutsandbolts mechanics to perfect the equipment you guys have proven the sappho i youve demonstrated her capabilities let the next ride go to the oceanographers as for us this mission will go down in the books as a great scientific achievement i am not giordino declared pontifically cut out to be a hero neither am i pal woodson added but youve got to admit it beats hell out of selling life insurance the drama of it all escapes him gunn said think of the stories you can tell your girl friends think of the enraptured looks on their pretty faces when you tell them how you unerringly piloted the greatest undersea probe of the century unerringly giordino said then suppose you tell me why im running this scientific marvel around in circles five hundred miles off our scheduled course gunn shrugged orders giordino stared at him were supposed to be under the labrador sea instead admiral sandecker changes our course at the last minute and makes us chase all over the abyssal plains below the grand banks of newfoundland it doesnt make sense gunn smiled a sphinxlike smile for several moments none of the men spoke but gunn didnt require a concentrated dose of esp to know the questions that were running through their minds they were he was certain thinking what he was thinking like himself they were three months back in time and two thousand miles in distance at the headquarters of the national underwater and marine agency in washington dc where admiral james sandecker chief director of the agency was describing the most incredible undersea operation of the decade god damn admiral sandecker had thundered id give up a years salary if i could join you men a figure of speech giordino reflected next to sandecker ebenezer scrooge spent money like a drunken sailor giordino relaxed in a deep leather sofa and tuned into the admirals briefing while idly blowing smoke rings between puffs on a giant cigar lifted from a box on sandeckers immense desk when everyones attention was focused on a wall map of the atlantic ocean well there she is sandecker rapped the pointer loudly on the map for the second time the lorelei current shes born off the western tip of africa follows the midatlantic ridge north then curves easterly between baffin island and greenland and then dies in the labrador sea giordino said i dont hold a degree in oceanography admiral but it would seem that the lorelei converges with the gulf stream not hardly the gulf stream is surface water the lorelei is the coldest heaviest water in the worlds oceans averaging fourteen thousand feet in depth then the lorelei crosses under the gulf stream spencer said softly it was the first time in the briefing he had spoken that seems reasonable sandecker paused smiled benevolently then continued the ocean is basically made up of two layersa surface or upper layer heated by the sun and thoroughly churned by winds and a cold very dense layer consisting of intermediate deep and bottom water and the two never mix sounds very dull and forbidding munk said the mere fact that some character with a black sense of humor named the current after a rhine nymph who lured sailors onto the rocks makes it the last place id want to visit a grim smile crawled slowly over sandeckers griffin face get used to the name gentlemen because deep in the loreleis gut is where were going to spend fifty days where youre going to spend fifty days doing what woodson asked defiantly the lorelei current drift expedition is exactly what it sounds like you men will descend in a deepwater submersible five hundred miles northwest of the coast of dakar and begin a submerged cruise in the current your main job will be to monitor and test the sub and its equipment if there are no malfunctions that would necessitate cutting short the mission you should surface around the middle of september in the approximate center of the labrador sea merker cleared his throat softly no submersible has stayed that long that deep you want to back out sam well no this is a volunteer expedition nobody is twisting your arm to go why us admiral ben drummer uncoiled his lean frame from the floor where he had been comfortably stretched ahm a marine engineer spencer here is an equipment engineer and merker is a systems expert ah cant see where we fit in youre all professionals in your respective capacities woodson is also a photographer the sappho i will be carrying a number of photographic systems munk is the best instrumentcomponent man in the agency and youll all be under the command of rudi gunn who has captained at one time or another every research ship in numa that leaves me giordino said sandecker glared at the cigar jutting from giordinos mouth recognized it as one from his private brand and gave him a withering look that was completely ignored as assistant projects director for the agency youll be in overall charge of the mission you can also make yourself useful by piloting the craft giordino smiled devilishly and stared back my pilots license authorizes me to fly airplanes not submarines the admiral stiffened ever so slightly youll just have to trust my judgment wont you sandecker said coldly besides what matters most is that youre the best crew ive got on hand at the moment you all worked together on the beaufort sea expedition you are men with heavy experience and records of ability and ingenuity you can operate every instrument every piece of oceanographic equipment yet inventedwell let the scientists analyze the data you bring backand as i mentioned naturally youre all volunteers naturally giordino echoed his face deadpan sandecker went back behind his desk you will assemble and begin procedure training at our key west port facility the day after tomorrow the pelholme aircraft company has already run extensive diving tests on the submersible so you need only concern yourselves with familiarization of the equipment and instruction on the experiments youll conduct during the expedition spencer whistled through his teeth an aircraft company holy god what do they know about designing a deepsea submersible for your peace of mind sandecker said patiently pelholme turned its aerospace technology toward the sea ten years ago since then theyve constructed four underwater environmental laboratories and two extremely successful submersibles for the navy theyd best have built this one good merker said id be most distressed to find that it leaked at fourteen thousand feet scared shitless you mean giordino mumbled munk rubbed his eyes then stared at the floor as though he saw the bottom of the sea in the carpet when he spoke his words came very slowly is this trip really necessary admiral sandecker nodded solemnly it is oceanographers need a picture of the structure of the loreleis flow pattern to improve their knowledge of deepocean circulation believe me this mission is as important as the first manned orbit around the earth besides testing the worlds most advanced submersible youll be visually recording and mapping an area never before seen by man forget your doubts the sappho i has every safety feature built into her hull that science can devise you have my personal guarantee of a safe and comfortable voyage thats easy for him to say giordino thought idly he wont be there henry munk shifted his muscular frame to a different position on a long vinyl pad stifled a yawn and continued to stare out the sappho is aft viewport the flat unending sediment was about as interesting as a book without printed pages but munk took delight in the knowledge that every tiny mound every rock or occasional denizen of the deep that passed beneath the thick plexiglas had never before been seen by man it was a small but satisfying reward for the long boring hours hed spent scanning an array of detection instruments mounted on both sides above the pad reluctantly he forced his eyes from the viewport and focused them on the instruments the stsvd sensor had been operating constantly during the mission measuring the outside salinity temperature sound velocity and depth pressure on a magnetic tape the subbottom profiler that acoustically determined the depth of the top sediments and provided indications of the underlying structure of the sea floors surface the gravimeter that ticked off the gravity readings every quarter mile the current sensor that kept its sensitive eye on the speed of the lorelei current and direction and the magnetometer a sensor for measuring and recording the bottoms magnetic field including any deviations caused by localized metal deposits munk almost missed it the movement of the stylus on the magnetometers graph was so slight barely a tiny millimeter of a squibble that he would have missed it completely if his eyes hadnt locked on the recording mark at exactly the right moment quickly he threw his face against the viewport and peered at the sea floor then he turned and yelled at giordino who sat at the pilots console only ten feet away all stop giordino spun around and stared aft all he could see were munks legs the rest of him was buried among the instruments what do you read we just passed over something thats metallic back her up for a closer look easing her back giordino said loudly so munk could hear he engaged the two motors mounted on each side of the hull amidships and set them at halfspeed in reverse for ten seconds the sappho i caught in the twoknot force of the current hung suspended reluctant to move on her own then she began to forge backward very slowly against the relentless flow gunn and the others crowded around munks instrument tunnel make out anything gunn asked not sure munk answered theres something sticking up from the sediment about twenty yards astern i can only see a vague shape under the stern lights everyone waited it seemed an eternity before munk spoke again okay ive got it gunn turned to woodson activate the two stereo bottom cameras and strobes we should have this on film woodson nodded and moved off toward his equipment can you describe it spencer asked it looks like a funnel sticking upright in the ooze munks voice came through the instrument tunnel disembodied but even the reverberated tone could not disguise the excitement behind it gunns expression went skeptical funnel drummer leaned over gunns shoulder what kind of funnel a funnel with a hollow cone tapering to a point that you pour stuff through you dumb rebel munk replied irritably its passing under the starboard hull now tell giordino to hold the boat stationary the second it appears under the bow viewports gunn stepped over to giordino can you hold our position ill give it a go but if the current starts swinging us broadside i wont be able to keep precise control and well lose visual contact with whatever that thing is out there gunn moved to the bow and lay down on the rubber sheathed floor he stared out of one of the four forward viewports together with merker and spencer they all saw the object almost immediately it was as munk had described it simply an inverted bellshaped funnel about five inches in diameter its tip protruding from the bottom sediment surprisingly its condition was good the exterior surface of the metal was tarnished to be sure but it appeared to be sound and solid with no indication of flaking or heavy rust layers holding steady giordino said but i cant guarantee for how long without turning from the viewport gunn motioned to woodson who was bent over a pair of cameras zooming their lenses toward the object on the sea floor omar focused and shooting merker twisted around and looked at gunn lets make a grab for it gunn remained silent his nose almost touching the port he seemed lost in concentration merkers eyes narrowed questioningly what about it rudi i say lets grab it the words finally penetrated gunns thoughts yes yes by all means he mumbled vaguely merker unhooked a metal box that was attached to the forward bulkhead by a fivefoot cable and positioned himself at the center viewport the box contained a series of toggle switches that surrounded a small circular knob it was the control unit for the manipulator a fourhundredpound mechanical arm that hung grotesquely from the lower bow of the sappho i merker pushed a switch that activated the arm then he deftly moved his fingers over the controls as the mechanism hummed and the arm extended to its full sevenfoot reach it was eight inches shy of the funnel in the sediment outside i need another foot merker said get ready giordino replied the forward movement may break my position the funnel seemed to pass with agonizing slowness under the manipulators stainlesssteel claw merker gently eased the pincers over the lip of the funnel and then he pressed another switch and they closed but his timing was off the current clutched the submersible and began swinging it broadside the claw missed by no more than an inch and its pincers came together empty shes breaking to port giordino yelled i cant hold her quickly merkers fingers danced over the control box he would have to try for a second grab on the fly if he missed again it would be next to impossible to relocate the funnel under the limited visibility sweat began erupting on his brow and his hands grew tense he bent the arm against its stop and turned the claw six degrees to starboard compensating for the opposite swing of the sappho he flipped the switch again and the claw dropped and the pincers closed in almost the same motion the lip of the funnel rested between them merker had it now he eased the arm upward gradually easing the funnel from its resting place in the sediment the sweat was rolling into his eyes now but he kept them open there could be no hesitating one mistake and the object would be lost on the sea floor forever then the slimy ooze relinquished its hold and the funnel came free and rose up toward the viewports my god woodson whispered thats no funnel it looks like a horn merker said gunn shook his head its a cornet how can you be sure giordino had left the pilots console and was peering over gunns shoulder through the port i played one in my highschool band the others recognized it now too they could readily make out the flaring mouth of the bell and behind it the curved tubes leading to the valves and mouthpiece judging from the look of it merker said id say it was brass thats why munks magnetometer barely picked it up on the graph giordino added the mouthpiece and the valve pistons are the only parts that contain iron ah wonder how long its been down here drummer asked no one in particular itd be more intriguing to know where it came from said merker obviously thrown overboard from a passing ship giordino said carelessly probably by some kid who hated music lessons maybe its owner is somewhere down here too merker spoke without looking up spencer shivered theres a chilling thought for you the interior of the sappho i fell silent the antique ford trimotor aircraft famed in aviation history as the tin goose looked too awkward to fly and yet she banked as gracefully and majestically as an albatross when she lined up for her final approach to the runway of the washington national airport pitt eased back the three throttles and the old bird touched down with all the delicacy of an autumn leaf kissing high grass he taxied over to one of the numa hangars at the north end of the airport where his waiting maintenance crew chocked the wheels and made the routine throatcutting sign flipping off the ignition switches he watched the silverbladed propellers gradually slow their revolutions and come to rest gleaming in the late afternoon sun then he removed the headphones draped them on the control column undid the latch on his side window and pushed it open a bewildered frown slowly creased pitts forehead and hung there in the tanned leathery skin a man was standing on the asphalt below frantically waving his hands may i come aboard gene seagram shouted ill come down pitt yelled back no please stay where you are pitt shrugged and leaned back in his seat it took seagram only a few seconds to climb aboard the trimotor and push open the cockpit door he wore a stylish tan suit with vest but his welltailored appearance was diluted by a sea of wrinkles that creased the material making it obvious that he hadnt seen a bed for at least twentyfour hours where did you ever find such a gorgeous old machine seagram asked i ran across it at keflavik iceland pitt replied managed to buy it at a fair price and have it shipped back to the states shes a beauty pitt motioned seagram to the empty copilots seat you sure you want to talk in here in a few minutes the sun will make this cabin feel like the inside of an incinerator what i have to say wont take long seagram eased into the seat and let out a long sigh pitt studied him he looked like a man who was unwilling and trapped a proud man who had placed himself in an uncompromising position seagram did not face pitt when he spoke but stared nervously through the windshield i suppose youre wondering what im doing here he said the thought crossed my mind i need your help that was it no mention of the harsh words from the past no preliminaries only a straighttothegut request pitts eyes narrowed for some strange reason i had the feeling that my company was about as welcome to you as a dose of syphilis your feelings my feelings they dont matter what does matter is that your talents are in desperate demand by our government talents desperate demand pitt did not disguise his surprise youre putting me on seagram believe me i wish i was but admiral sandecker assures me that youre the only man who stands a remote chance of pulling off a ticklish job what job salvaging the titanic of course nothing like a salvage operation to break the monotony of pitt broke off in midsentence his deep green eyes widened and the blood rose to his face what ship did you say his voice came in a hoarse murmur this time seagram looked at him with an amused expression the titanic surely youve heard of it perhaps ten seconds ticked by in utter silence while pitt sat there stunned then he said do you know what youre proposing absolutely it cant be done pitts expression was incredulous his voice still the same hoarse murmur even if it were technically possible and it isnt it would take hundreds of millions of dollars and then theres the unending legal entanglement with the original owners and the insurance companies over salvage rights there are over two hundred engineers and scientists working on the technical problems at this moment seagram explained financing will be arranged through secret government funding and as far as legal rights go forget it under international law once a vessel is lost with no hope of recovery it becomes fair game for anybody who wishes to spend the money and effort on a salvage operation he turned and stared out the windshield again you cant know pitt how important this undertaking is the titanic represents much more than treasure or historic value there is something deep within its cargo holds that is vital to the security of our nation youll forgive me if i say that sounds a bit farfetched perhaps but underneath the flagwaving the facts hold true pitt shook his head youre talking sheer fantasy the titanic lies in nearly two and a half miles of water the pressure at those depths runs several thousand pounds to the square inch mr seagram not square foot or square yard but square inch the difficulties and barriers are staggering no one has ever seriously attempted to raise the andrea doria or the lusitania from the bottom and they both lie only three hundred feet from the surface if we can put men on the moon we can bring the titanic up to the sunlight again seagram argued theres no comparison it took a decade to set a fourton capsule on lunar soil lifting fortyfive thousand tons of steel is a different proposition it may take months just to find her the search is already under way i heard nothing about a search effort seagram finished not likely that you should until the operation becomes unwieldy in terms of security it will remain secret even your assistant special projects director albert giordano giordino yes giordino thank you he is at this very moment piloting a search probe across the atlantic sea floor in total ignorance of his true mission but the lorelei current expedition the sappho is original mission was to trace a deep ocean current a timely coincidence admiral sandecker was able to order the submersible into the area of the titanics last known position barely hours before the sub was scheduled to surface pitt turned and stared at a jet airliner that was lifting from the airports main runway why me what have i done to deserve an invitation to what has to be the biggest harebrained scheme of the century you are not simply to be a guest my dear pitt you are to command the overall salvage operation pitt regarded seagram grimly the question still stands why me not a selection that excites me i assure you seagram said however since the national underwater and marine agency is the nations largest acknowledged authority on oceanographic science and since the leading experts on deepwater salvage are members of their staff and since you are the agencys special projects director you were elected the fog begins to lift its a simple case of my being in the wrong occupation at the wrong time read it as you will seagram said wearily i must admit i found your past record of bringing incredibly difficult projects to successful conclusions most impressive he pulled out a handkerchief and dabbed his forehead another factor that weighed heavily in your favor i might add is that you are considered somewhat of an expert on the titanic collecting and studying titanic memorabilia is a hobby with me nothing more it hardly qualifies me to oversee her salvage nonetheless mr pitt admiral sandecker tells me you are to use his words a genius at handling men and coordinating logistics he gazed over at pitt his eyes uncertain will you take the job you dont think i can pull it off do you seagram frankly no but when one dangles over the cliff by a thread one has little say about who comes to the rescue a faint smile edged pitts lips your faith in me is touching well pitt sat lost in thought for several moments finally he gave an almost imperceptible nod and looked squarely into seagrams eyes okay my friend im your boy but dont count youre chickens until that rusty old hulk is moored to a new york dock there isnt a betmaker in las vegas whod waste a second computing odds on this crazy escapade when we find the titanic if we find the titanic her hull nay be too far gone to raise but then nothing is absolutely impossible and though i cant begin to guess what it is thats so valuable to the government that warrants the effort ill try seagram beyond that i promise nothing pitt broke into a wide grin and climbed from the pilots seat end of speech now then lets get out of this hot box and find a nice cool airconditioned cocktail lounge where you can buy me a drink its the least you can do after pulling off the con job of the year seagram just sat there too drained to do anything except shrug in helpless acquiescence at first john vogel treated the cornet as simply another restoration job there was no rarity suggested by its design there was nothing exceptional about its construction that would excite a collector at the moment it could excite nobody the valves were corroded and frozen closed the brass was discolored by an odd sort of accumulated grime and a foul fishlike odor emanated from the mud that clogged the interior of its tubes vogel decided the cornet was beneath him he would turn it over to one of his assistants for the restoration the exotics those were the instruments that vogel loved to bring back to their original newness the ancient chinese and roman trumpets with the long straight tubes and the earpiercing tones the battered old horns of the early jazz greats the instruments with a piece of history attachedthese vogel would repair with the patience of a watchmaker toiling with exacting craftsmanship until the piece gleamed like new and played brilliantly clear tones he wrapped the cornet in an old pillowcase and set it against the far wall of his office the executone on his desk uttered a soft bong yes mary what is it admiral james sandecker of the national underwater and marine agency is on the phone his secretarys voice scratched over the intercom like fingernails over a blackboard he says its urgent okay put him on vogel lifted the telephone john vogel here mr vogel this is james sandecker the fact that sandecker had dialed his own call and didnt bluster behind his title impressed vogel yes admiral what can i do for you have you received it yet have i received what an old bugle ah the cornet vogel said i found it on my desk this morning with no explanation i assumed it was a donation to the museum my apologies mr vogel i should have forewarned you but i was tied up a straightforward excuse how can i help you admiral id be grateful if you could study the thing and tell me what you know about it date of manufacture and so on im flattered sir why me as chief curator for the washington museums hall of music you seemed the logical choice also a mutual friend said that the world lost another harry james when you decided to become a scholar my god vogel thought the president score another point for sandecker he knew the right people thats debatable vogel said when would you like my report as soon as its convenient for you vogel smiled to himself a polite request deserved extra effort the dipping process to remove the corrosion is what takes time with luck i should have something for you by tomorrow morning thank you mr vogel sandecker said briskly im grateful is there any information concerning how or where you found the cornet that might help me id rather not say my people would like your opinions entirely without prompting or direction on our part you want to compare my findings with yours is that it sandeckers voice carried sharply through the earpiece we want you to confirm our hopes and expectations mr vogel nothing more i shall do my best admiral goodby good luck vogel sat for several minutes staring at the pillowcase in the corner his hand resting on the telephone then he pressed the executone mary hold all calls for the rest of the day and send out for a medium pizza with canadian bacon and a half gallon of gallo burgundy you going to lock yourself in that musty old workshop again marys voice scratched back yes vogel sighed its going to be a long day first vogel took several photos of the cornet from different angles then he noted the dimensions general condition of the visible parts and the degree of tarnish and foreign matter that coated the surfaces recording each observation in a large notebook he regarded the cornet with an increased level of professional interest it was a quality instrument the brass was of good commercial grade and the small bores of the bell and the valves told him that it was manufactured before he discovered that what he had thought to be corrosion was only a hard crust of mud that flaked away under light pressure from a rubber spoon next he soaked the instrument in diluted calgon water softener gently agitating the liquid and changing the tank every so often to drain away the dirt by midnight he had the cornet completely disassembled then he started the tedious job of swabbing the metal surfaces with a mild solution of chromic acid to bring out the shine of the brass slowly after several rinsings an intricate scroll pattern and several ornately scripted letters began to appear on the bell by god vogel blurted aloud a presentation model he picked up a magnifying glass and studied the writing when he set the glass down and reached for a telephone his hands were trembling at precisely eight oclock john vogel was ushered into sandeckers office on the top floor of the tenstory solarglassed building that housed the national headquarters of numa his eyes were bloodshot and he made no effort to conceal a yawn sandecker came out from behind his desk and shook vogels hand the short banty admiral had to lean backward and look up to meet the eyes of his visitor vogel was six foot five a kindly faced man with puffs of unbrushed white hair edging a bald head he gazed through brown santa claus eyes and flashed a warm smile his coat was neatly pressed but his pants were rumpled and stained with a myriad of blotches below the knees he smelled like a wino well sandecker greeted him its a pleasure to meet you the pleasure is mine admiral vogel set a black trumpet case on the carpet im sorry i appear so slovenly i was going to say sandecker answered it seems youve had a difficult night when one loves ones work time and inconvenience have little meaning true sandecker turned and nodded to a little gnomelike man who was standing in one corner of the office mr john vogel may i present commander rudi gunn of course commander gunn vogel said smiling i was one of the many millions who followed your lorelei current expedition every day in the newspapers youre to be congratulated commander it was a great achievement thank you gunn said sandecker gestured to another man sitting on the couch and my special projects director dirk pitt vogel nodded at the swarthy face that crinkled into a smile mr pitt pitt rose and nodded back mr vogel vogel sat down and pulled out a battered old pipe mind if i smoke not at all sandecker lifted one of his churchill cigars out of a humidor and held it up ill join you vogel puffed the bowl into life and then sat back and said tell me admiral was the cornet discovered on the bottom of the north atlantic yes just south of the grand banks off newfoundland he stared at vogel speculatively how did you guess that elementary deduction what can you tell us about it a considerable amount actually to begin with it is a highquality instrument crafted for a professional musician then its not likely it was owned by an amateur player gunn said remembering giordinos words on the sappho i no vogel said flatly not likely could you determine the time and place of manufacture pitt asked the approximate month was either october or november the exact year was and it was manufactured by a very reputable and very fine old british firm by the name of booseyhawkes there was respect written in sandeckers eyes youve done a remarkable job mr vogel quite frankly we doubted whether we would ever know the country of origin much less the actual manufacturer no investigative brilliance on my part i assure you vogel said you see the cornet was a presentation model a presentation model yes any metal product that takes a high degree of craftsmanship to construct and is highly prized as a possession is often engraved to commemorate an unusual event or outstanding service a common practice among gunmakers pitt commented and also creators of fine musical instruments in this instance it was presented to an employee by his company in recognition of his service the presentation date the manufacturer the employee and his company are all beautifully engraved on the cornets bell you can actually tell who owned it gunn asked the engraving is readable oh my yes vogel bent down and opened the case here you can read it for yourself he set the cornet on sandeckers desk the three men stared at it silently for a long timea gleaming instrument whose golden surface reflected the morning sun that was streaming in the window the cornet looked brandnew every inch was buffed to a high shine and the intricate engraving of sea waves that curled around the tube and bell were as clear as the day they were etched sandecker gazed over the cornet at vogel his brows lifted in doubt mr vogel i think you fail to see the seriousness of the situation i dont care for jokes i admit vogel snapped back that i fail to see the seriousness of the situation what i do see is a moment of tremendous excitement and believe me admiral this is no joke i have spent the best part of the last twentyfour hours restoring your discovery he threw a bulky folder on the desk here is my report complete with photographs and my stepbystep observations during the restoration procedure there are also envelopes containing the different types of residue and mud that i removed and also the parts that i replaced i overlooked nothing i apologize sandecker said yet it seems inconceivable that the instrument we sent you yesterday and the instrument on the desk are one and the same sandecker paused and exchanged glances with pitt you see we thought the cornet had rested on the sea bottom for a long time vogel finished the sentence im fully aware of what youre driving at admiral and i confess im at a loss as to the instruments remarkable condition too ive worked on any number of musical instruments which have been immersed in salt water for only three to five years that were in far worse shape than this one im not an oceanographer so the solution to the puzzle eludes me however i can tell you to the day how long that cornet has been beneath the sea and how it came to be there vogel reached over and picked up the horn then he slipped on a pair of rimless glasses and began reading aloud presented to graham farley in sincere appreciation for distinguished performance in the entertainment of our passengers by the grateful management of the white star line vogel removed his glasses and smiled benignly at sandecker when i discovered the words white star line i got a friend out of bed early this morning to do a bit of research at the naval archives he called only a half hour before i left for your office vogel paused to remove a handkerchief from his pocket and blew his nose it seems graham farley was a very popular fellow throughout the white star line he was solo cornetist for three years on one of their vessels i believe it was called the oceanic when the companys newest luxury liner was about to set sail on her maiden voyage the management selected the outstanding musicians from their other passenger ships and formed what was considered at the time the finest orchestra on the seas graham of course was one of the first musicians chosen yes gentlemen this cornet has rested under the atlantic ocean for a very long time because graham farley was playing it on the morning of april when the waves closed over him and the titanic the reactions to vogels sudden revelation were mixed sandeckers face turned halfsomber halfspeculative gunns went rigid while pitts expression was one of casual interest the silence in the room became intense as vogel stuffed his glasses back in a breast pocket titanic sandecker repeated the word slowly like a man savoring a beautiful womans name he gazed penetratingly at vogel wonder mingled with doubt still mirrored in his eyes its incredible a fact nonetheless vogel said casually i take it commander gunn that the cornet was discovered by the sappho i yes near the end of the voyage it would appear that your undersea expedition stumbled on a bonus a pity you didnt run onto the ship herself yes a pity gunn said avoiding vogels eyes im still at a loss as to the instruments condition sandecker said i hardly expected a relic sunk in the sea for seventyfive years to come up looking little the worse for wear the lack of corrosion does pose an interesting question vogel replied the brass most certainly would weather well but strangely the parts containing ferrous metals survived in a remarkable virgin state the original mouthpiece as you can see is nearperfect gunn was staring at the cornet as if it was the holy grail will it still play yes vogel answered quite beautifully i should think you havent tried it no i have not vogel ran his fingers reverently over the cornets valves up to now i have always tested every brass instrument my assistants and i have restored for its brilliance of tone this time i cannot i dont understand sandecker said this instrument is a reminder of a small but courageous act performed during the worst sea tragedy in mans history vogel replied it takes very little imagination to envision graham farley and his fellow musicians while they soothed the frightened ships passengers with music sacrificing all thought of their own safety as the titanic settled into the cold sea the cornets last melody came from the lips of a very brave man i feel it would border on the sacrilegious for anyone else ever to play it again sandecker stared at vogel examining every feature of the old mans face as if he were seeing it for the first time autumn vogel was murmuring almost rambling to himself autumn an old hymn that was the last melody graham farley played on his cornet not nearer my god to thee gunn spoke slowly a myth said pitt autumn was the final tune that was heard from the titanics band just before the end you seem to have made a study of the titanic vogel said the ship and her tragic fate is like a contagious disease pitt replied once you become interested the fever is tough to break the ship itself holds little attraction for me but as a historian of musicians and their instruments the saga of the titanics band has always gripped my imagination vogel set the cornet in the case closed the lid and passed it across the desk to sandecker unless you have more questions admiral id like to grab a fattening breakfast and fall into bed it was a difficult night sandecker stood were in your debt mr vogel i was hoping you might say that the santa claus eyes twinkled slyly there is a way you can repay me which is donate the cornet to the washington museum it would be the prize exhibit of our hall of music as soon as our lab people have studied the instrument and your report ill send it over to you on behalf of the museums directors i thank you not as a gift donation however vogel stared uncertainly at the admiral i dont follow sandecker smiled lets call it a permanent loan that will save hassle in case we ever have to borrow it back temporarily agreed one more thing sandecker said nothing has been mentioned to the press about the discovery id appreciate it if you went along with us for the time being i dont understand your motives but of course ill comply the towering curator bid his farewells and departed damn gunn blurted out a second after the door closed we must have passed within spitting distance of the titanics hulk you were certainly in the ball park pitt agreed the sapphos sonar probed a radius of two hundred yards the titanic must have rested just outside the fringe of your range if only wed had more time if only wed known what in hell we were looking for you forget sandecker said that testing the sappho i and conducting experiments on the lorelei current were your primary objectives and on that you and your crew did one hell of a job oceanographers will be sifting the data you brought back on deepwater currents for the next two years my only regret is that we couldnt let you in on what we were up to but gene seagram and his security people insist that we keep a tight lid on any information regarding the titanic until were far along on the salvage operation we wont be able to keep it quiet for long pitt said all the news media in the world will soon smell a story on the greatest historical find since the opening of king tuts tomb sandecker rose from behind his desk and walked over to the window when he spoke his words came very softly sounding almost as if they were carried over a great distance by the wind graham farleys cornet sir graham farleys cornet sandecker repeated wistfully if that old horn is any indication the titanic may be sitting down there in the black abyss as pretty and preserved as the night she sank to a chance observer standing on the shore or to anyone out for a leisurely cruise up the rappahannock river the three men slouched in a dilapidated old rowboat looked like a trio of ordinary weekend fishermen they were dressed in faded shirts and dungarees and sported hats festooned with the usual variety of hooks and flies it was a typical scene down to the sixpack of beer trapped in a fishnet dangling in the water beside the boat the shortest of the three a redhaired pinchedfaced man lay against the stern and seemed to be dozing his hands loosely gripped around a fishing pole that was attached to a red and white cork bobbing a bare two feet from the boats waterline the second man simply slouched over an open magazine while the third fisherman sat upright and mechanically went through the motions of casting a silver lure he was large with a wellfed stomach that blossomed through his open shirt and he gazed through lazy blue eyes set in a jovial round face he was the perfect image of everyones kindly old grandfather admiral joseph kemper could afford to look kindly when you wielded the almost incredible authority that he did you didnt have to squint through hypnotic eyes or belch fire like a dragon he looked down and offered a benevolent expression to the man who was dozing it strikes me jim that youre not deeply into the spirit of fishing this has to be the most useless endeavor ever devised by man sandecker replied and you mr seagram you havent dropped a hook since we anchored seagram peered at kemper over the magazine if a fish could survive the pollution down there admiral hed have to look like a mutant out of a lowbudget horror movie and taste twice as bad since it was you gentlemen who invited me here kemper said im beginning to suspect a devious motive sandecker neither agreed nor disagreed just relax and enjoy the great outdoors joe forget for a few hours that youre the navys chief of staff thats easy when youre around youre the only one i know who talks down to me sandecker grinned you cant go through life with the whole world kissing your ass simply look upon me as good therapy kemper sighed i had hoped id gotten rid of you once and for all when you retired from the service now it seems youve come back to haunt me as a goddamned feather merchant i understand they were dancing in the corridors of the pentagon when i left lets just say there were no tears shed at your departure kemper slowly reeled his lure in okay jim ive known you too many years not to smell a squeeze play what do you and mr seagram have on your minds were going after the titanic sandecker replied casually kemper went on reeling indeed indeed kemper cast again what for to take a few photographs for publicitys sake no to raise her to the surface kemper stopped reeling he turned and stared at sandecker you did say the titanic i did jim my boy youve really slipped your moorings this time if you expect me to believe this isnt a fairy tale seagram interrupted the authority for the salvage operation comes straight from the white house kempers eyes studied seagrams face then am i to assume that you represent the president yes sir that is correct kemper said i must say you have a rather strange way of doing business mr seagram if you will give me the courtesy of an explanation thats why were here admiral to explain kemper turned to sandecker are you in the game too jim sandecker nodded lets just say that mr seagram speaks softly and carries one hell of a big stick okay seagram the podium is yours why the subterfuge and why the urgency to raise an old derelict first things first admiral to begin with i am head of a highly secret department of the government called meta section never heard of it kemper said we are not listed in any journal on federal offices not even the cia the fbi nor the nsa has any records of our operation an undercover thinktank sandecker said curtly we go beyond the ordinary thinktank seagram said our people devise futuristic concepts and then attempt to construct them into successful functioning systems that would cost millions of dollars kemper said modesty forbids me to mention the exact amount of our budget admiral but ego compels me to admit that i have slightly over ten figures to play with my lord kemper muttered under his breath over a billion dollars to play with you say an organization of scientists that nobody knows exists you stir my interest mr seagram mine too sandecker said acidly up until now youve sought numas assistance through white house channels by passing yourself off as a presidential aide why the machiavellian routine because the president ordered strict security admiral in the event of a leak to capitol hill the last thing his administration needed was a congressional witch hunt into meta sections finances kemper and sandecker looked at each other and nodded they looked at seagram waiting for the rest of it now then he continued meta section has developed a defense system with the code name of the sicilian project the sicilian project we named it after a chess strategy known as the sicilian defense the project is devised around a variant of the maser principle for example if we push a sound wave of a certain frequency through a medium containing excited atoms we can then stimulate the sound to an extremely high state of emission similar to a laser beam kemper commented to some degree seagram answered except a laser emits a narrow beam of light energy while our device emits a broad fanlike field of sound waves besides breaking a bevy of eardrums sandecker said what purpose does it serve as you recall from your elementaryschool studies admiral sound waves spread in circular waves much like ripples in a pond after a pebble is dropped in it in the instance of the sicilian project we can multiply the sound waves a million times over then when this tremendous energy is released it spreads out into the atmosphere pushing air particles ahead of its unleashed force condensing them until they combine to form a solid impenetrable wall hundreds of square miles in diameter seagram paused to scratch his nose i wont bore you with equations and technical details concerning the actual instrumentation the particulars are too complicated to discuss here but you can easily see the potential any enemy missile launched against america coming into contact with this invisible protective barrier would smash itself into oblivion long before it entered the target area is is this system for real kemper asked hesitantly yes admiral i assure you it can work even now the required number of installations to stop an allout missile attack are under construction jesus sandecker burst out the ultimate weapon the sicilian project is not a weapon it is purely a scientific method of protecting our country its hard to visualize kemper said just imagine a sonic boom from a jet aircraft amplified ten million times kemper seemed lost by it all but the soundwouldnt it destroy everything on the ground no the energy force is aimed into space and builds during its journey to someone standing at sea level it would merely have the same harmless impact of distant thunder what does all this have to do with the titanic the element required to stimulate the optimum level of sound emission is byzanium and therein lies the grabber gentlemen because the worlds only known quantity of byzanium ore was shipped to the united states back in on board the titanic i see kemper nodded then salvaging the ship is your lastditch attempt at making your defense system operational byzaniums atomic structure is the only one that will work by programming its known properties into our computers we were able to project a thirtythousandtoone ratio in favor of success but why raise the entire ship kemper asked why not just tear out its bulkheads and bring up the byzanium wed have to blast our way into the cargo hold with explosives the danger of destroying the ore forever is too great the president and i agree that the added expense of raising the hull far outweighs the risk of losing it kemper tossed out his lure again youre a positive thinker seagram i grant you that but what makes you think the titanic is in any condition to be brought up in one piece after seventyfive years on the bottom she may be nothing but an immense pile of rusty junk my people have a theory on that said sandecker he put his fishing pole aside opened his tackle box and pulled out an envelope take a look at these he handed kemper several fourbyfive photographs looks like so much underwater trash kemper commented exactly sandecker answered every so often the cameras on our submersibles stumble on debris tossed overboard from passing ships he pointed to the top photo this is a galley stove found at four thousand feet off bermuda next is an automobile engine block photographed at sixtyfive hundred feet off the aleutians no way to date either of these now here is a grumman ff world war ii aircraft discovered at ten thousand feet near iceland we dug up a record on this one the plane was ditched in the sea without injury by a lieutenant strauss when he ran out of fuel on march kemper held out the next photo at arms length what in hell is this thing that was taken at the moment of discovery by the sappho i daring the lorelei current expedition what at first looked like an ordinary kitchen flannel turned out to be a horn he showed kemper a shot of the instrument taken after vogels restoration thats a cornet kemper corrected him you say the sappho i brought this up yes from twelve thousand feet it had been lying on the bottom since kempers eyebrows raised are you going to tell me it came from the titanic i can show you documented evidence kemper sighed and handed the pictures back to sandecker his shoulders sagged the weary fatigued droop of a man no longer young a man who had been carrying a heavy burden for too long a time he pulled a beer from the fish net and popped the tab what does any of this prove sandeckers mouth tightened into a slight grin it was right in front of us for two yearsthats how long ago the aircraft was discoveredbut we completely overlooked the possibilities oh sure there were remarks about the planes excellent condition yet none of my oceanographers really grasped the significance it wasnt until the sappho i brought up the horn that the true implications came home im not following you kemper said tonelessly first of all sandecker continued ninety per cent of that ff is made out of aluminum and as you know salt water eats the hell out of aluminum yet that plane after sitting down there in the sea for over forty years looks like the day it came out of the factory same with the horn its been underwater crowding eighty years and it shined up like a newborn babys ass have you any explanation kemper asked two of numas ablest oceanographers are now running data through our computers the general theory at the moment is that its a combination of factors the lack of damaging sea life at great depths the low salinity or salt content of bottom water the freezing temperatures of the deep and a lower oxygen content that would slow down oxidation of metal it could be any one or all of these factors that delays deterioration of deepbottom wrecks well know better if and when we get a look at the titanic kemper thought for a moment what do you want from me protection seagram answered if the soviets get wind of what were up to theyll try everything short of war to stop us and grab the byzanium for themselves put your mind at rest on that score kemper said his voice suddenly hard the russians will think twice before they bloody their noses on our side of the atlantic your salvage operations on the titanic will be protected mr seagram you have my ironclad guarantee on that a faint grin touched sandeckers face while youre in a generous mood joe whatre the chances of borrowing the modoc the modoc kemper repeated shes the finest deepwater salvage vessel the navys got we could also use the crew that comes with her sandecker pushed on kemper rolled the beer cans cool surface across his sweating forehead okay youve got yourselves the modoc and her crew plus whatever extra men and equipment you need seagram sighed thank you admiral im grateful youre straddling an interesting concept kemper said but one fraught with problems nothing comes easy seagram replied whats your next step sandecker answered that one we send down television cameras to locate the hull and survey the damage god only knows what youll find kemper stopped abruptly and pointed at sandeckers jerking bobber by god jim i believe youve caught a fish sandecker leaned lazily over the side of the boat so i have he said smiling lets hope the titanic is just as cooperative i am afraid that that hope may prove to be an expensive incentive kemper said and there was no answering smile on his lips pitt closed joshua hays brewsters journal and looked across the conference table at mel donner thats it then the whole truth and nothing but the truth donner said but wouldnt this byzanium or whatever you call it lose its properties after being immersed in the sea all these years donner shook his head whos to say no one has ever had a sufficient quantity in their hands to know for sure how it reacts under any conditions then it may be worthless not if its locked securely in the titanics vault our research indicates that the strong room is watertight pitt leaned back and stared at the journal its a hell of a gamble were aware of that its like asking a gang of kids to lift a patton tank out of lake erie with a few ropes and a raft were aware of that donner repeated the cost alone of raising the titanic is beyond comprehension pitt said name a figure back in the cia paid out over three hundred million dollars just to raise the bow of a russian submarine i couldnt begin to fathom what it would run to salvage a passenger liner that grosses fortysix thousand tons from twelve thousand feet of water take a guess then who bankrolls the operation meta section will handle the finances donner said just look upon me as your friendly neighborhood banker let me know what you think it will take to get the salvage operation off the ground and ill see to it the funds are secretly transferred into numas annual operating budget two hundred and fifty million ought to start the ball rolling thats somewhat less than our estimates donner said casually i suggest that you not limit yourself just to be on the safe side ill arrange for you to receive an extra five five million no donner smiled five hundred million after the guard passed him out through the gate pitt pulled up at the side of the road and gazed back through the chainlink fence at the smith van and storage company i dont believe it he said to no one i dont believe any of it then slowly with much difficulty as if he were fighting the commands of a hypnotist pitt dropped the shift lever into drive and made his way back to the city it had been a particularly grueling day for the president there were seemingly endless meetings with opposition party congressmen meetings in which he had struggled vainly in most cases to persuade them to support his new bill for the modification of incometax regulations then there had been a speech at the convention of near hostile state governors followed later in the afternoon by a heated session with his aggressive overbearing secretary of state now just past ten oclock with one more unpleasant involvement to reckon with he sat in an overstuffed chair holding a drink in his right hand while his left scratched the long ears of his sadeyed basset hound warren nicholson the director of the cia and marshall collies his chief kremlin security adviser sat opposite him on a large sectional sofa the president took a sip from the glass and then stared grimly at the two men do either of you have the vaguest notion of what youre asking of me collies shrugged nervously quite frankly sir we dont but this is clearly a case of the end justifying the means i personally think nicholson here has one hell of a scheme going the payoff in terms of secret information could be nothing less than astonishing it will cost a heavy price the president said nicholson leaned forward believe me sir the cost is worth it thats easy for you to say the president said neither of you has the slightest hint as to what the sicilian project is all about collies nodded no argument there mr president its secret is well kept thats why it came as a shock when we discovered its existence through the kgb instead of our own security forces how much do you think the russians know we cant be absolutely certain at this point nicholson answered but the few facts we have in hand indicate the kgb possesses only the code name damn the president muttered angrily how could it have possibly leaked out id venture to guess that it was an accidental leak collies said my people in moscow would smell something if soviet intelligence analysts thought they were onto an ultrasecret american defense project the president looked at collies what makes you sure it has to do with defense if security surrounding the sicilian project is as tight as you suggest then a new military weapon emerges as the obvious theory and there is no doubt in my mind that the russians will soon come up with the same conclusion i would have to go along with collies line of thinking nicholson concurred all of which plays right into our hands go on we feed soviet naval intelligence data on the sicilian project in small doses if they take the bait nicholsons hands gestured like the closing of a trap then we literally own one of the soviets top intelligencegathering services bored by the human talk the presidents basset hound stretched out and peacefully dozed off the president looked thoughtfully at the animal for several moments weighing the odds the decision was a painful one he felt as though he was stabbing all his friends from meta section in the back ill have the man who is heading the project draw up an initial report he said finally you nicholson will tell me where and how you want it delivered so the russians do not suspect the deception you will go through me and only me for any further information concerning the sicilian project is that clear nicholson nodded i will arrange the channels myself the president seemed to wither and shrink into the chair i dont have to impress upon you gentlemen he said wearily the sorry fact that if were found out well all be branded as traitors sandecker leaned over a large contoured map of the north atlantic ocean floor his hand toying with a small pointer he looked at gunn then at pitt standing on the other side of the miniaturized seascape i cant understand it he said after a moments silence if that horn is any indication the titanic doesnt lie where shes supposed to gunn took a felttipped pen and made a tiny mark on the map her last reported position just before she sank was here at nw and you found the horn where gunn made another mark the exact position of the sappho is mother ship on the surface at the time we discovered farleys cornet put us here about six miles to the southeast a sixmile discrepancy how is that possible there was a conflict of evidence concerning the position of the titanic when she went down pitt said the skipper of one of the rescue ships the mount temple put the liner much farther to the east and his reading was based on a sunsighting far more accurate than the deadreckoning position figured by the titanics fourth officer right after she struck the iceberg but the ship that picked up the survivors the carpathia i believe it was sandecker said steamed on a course toward the position given by the titanics wireless operator and came in direct contact with the lifeboats within four hours there is some doubt that the carpathia actually traveled as far as her captain assumed pitt replied if so the sighting of the wreckage and the lifeboats could have occurred several miles southeast of the titanics wirelessed position sandecker idly tapped the pointer against the map railing this puts us between the devil and the deep blue sea so to speak gentlemen shall we conduct our search efforts in the exact area of nw or do we bet our money on graham farleys horn six miles to the southeast if we lose god only knows how many acres of atlantic ocean real estate well have to drag underwater television cameras over before we stumble on the wreck what do you say rudi gunn did not hesitate since our search pattern with the sappho i failed in and around the titanics advertised position i say we drop the tv cameras in the vicinity where we picked up farleys cornet and you dirk pitt was silent a few moments then he spoke my vote goes for a delay of fortyeight hours sandecker stared across the map speculatively we cant afford one hour much less fortyeight pitt stared back at him i suggest that we skip the tv cameras and leapfrog to the next step which is we send down a manned submersible sandecker shook his head no good a tv camera sled towed by a surface vessel can cover five times the area in half the time it would take a slowmoving submersible not if we pinpoint the gravesite in advance sandeckers expression darkened and how do you propose to pull off that minor miracle we gather every shred of knowledge concerning the titanics final hoursglean all records for speed conflicting position reports water currents the angle she slid beneath the waves throw in the cornets resting place everything and program it through numas computers with luck the readout data should point directly to the titanics front yard its the logical approach gunn admitted in the meantime sandecker said we lose two days we lose nothing sir we gain pitt said earnestly admiral kemper has loaned us the modoc shes docked at norfolk right now fitted out and ready to sail of course gunn blurted the sea slug precisely pitt replied the sea slug is the navys latestmodel submersible designed and constructed especially for deepwater salvage and rescue and shes sitting on the modocs afterdeck in two days rudi and i can have both vessels over the general area of the wreck ready to begin the search operation sandecker rubbed the pointer across his chin and then if the computers do their job i feed you the corrected position of the wreck site is that the picture yes sir thats the picture sandecker moved away from the map and eased into a chair then he looked up into the determined faces of pitt and gunn okay gentlemen its your ball game mel donner leaned on the doorbell of seagrams house in chevy chase and stifled a yawn seagram opened the door and stepped out onto the front porch they nodded silently without the usual early morning pleasantries and walked to the curb and donners car seagram sat and gazed dully out the side window his eyes ringed with dark circles donner slipped the car into gear you look like frankensteins monster before he came alive donner said how late did you work last night actually came home early seagram replied bad mistake should have worked late simply gave dana and me more time to fight shes been so damned condescending lately it drives me up the wall i finally got pissed and locked myself in the study fell asleep at my desk i ache in places i didnt know existed thank you donner said smiling seagram turned puzzled thank you for what for adding another brick under my determination to remain single they were both silent while donner eased through washingtons rushhour traffic gene donner said at last i know this is a touchy subject put me on your shit list if you will but youre beginning to come across like a selftortured cynic there was no reaction from seagram so donner forged ahead why dont you take a week or two off and take dana to a quiet sunny beach somewhere get away from washington for a while the defenseinstallation construction is going off without a hitch and theres nothing we can do about the byzanium except sit back and pray that sandeckers boys at numa salvage it from the titanic im needed now more than ever seagram said flatly youre only kidding yourself into an ego trip at the moment everything is out of our hands a grim smile touched seagrams lips youre closer to the truth than you can imagine donner glanced at him what do you mean its out of our hands seagram repeated vacantly the president ordered me to leak the sicilian project to the russians donner pulled over to the curb and looked at seagram dumbfounded my god why warren nicholson over at cia has convinced the president that by feeding bits of hard data on the project to the russians he can get control of one of their top intelligence networks i dont believe a word of it donner said it makes no difference what you believe seagram said brusquely if what you say is true what good will the russians get out of bits and scraps without the necessary detailed equations and calculations it would take them at least two years to put a workable theory on paper and without byzanium the whole concept is worthless they could build a working system within thirty months if they get their hands on the byzanium first impossible admiral kemper would never permit it hed send the russians packing in a hurry if they tried to pirate the titanic suppose seagram murmured softly just suppose kemper was ordered to lay back and do nothing donner leaned over the wheel and rubbed his forehead in disbelief are you asking me to believe the president of the united states is working with the communists seagram shrugged wearily and said how can i ask you to believe anything when i dont know what to believe myself pavel marganin tall and authoritative in his white naval uniform took a deep breath of the evening air and turned into the ornate lobby of the borodino restaurant he gave his name to the maitre d and followed him to prevlovs customary table the captain sat there reading a thick sheath of papers bound in a file folder his eyes came up briefly and acknowledged marganin with a bored glance before they flicked back to the contents of the file may i sit down captain unless you wish to place a towel over your arm and clear away the dishes prevlov said still engrossed in his reading by all means marganin ordered a vodka and waited for prevlov to initiate the conversation after nearly three full minutes the captain finally laid the file aside and lit a cigarette tell me lieutenant have you followed the lorelei current drift expedition not in detail i merely scanned the report before passing it along to your attention a pity prevlov said loftily think of it lieutenant a submersible capable of moving fifteen hundred miles along the ocean floor without surfacing once in almost two months soviet scientists would do well to be half as imaginative frankly sir i found the report rather dull reading dull reading indeed if you had studied it during one of your rare fits of conscientious dedication you would have discerned a strange course deviation during the expeditions final days i fail to see a hidden meaning in a simple course change a good intelligence man looks for the hidden meaning in everything marganin properly rebuked marganin nervously checked his watch and stared in the direction of the mens room i think we should investigate whatever it is the americans find so interesting off the newfoundland grand banks prevlov continued since that novaya zemlya business i want a close look into every operation undertaken by the national underwater and marine agency beginning six months ago my intuition tells me the americans are up to something that spells trouble for mother russia prevlov motioned to a passing waiter and pointed at his empty glass he leaned back and sighed things are never what they seem are they we are in a strange and baffling business when you consider that every comma every period on a scrap of paper can possess a vital blueprint to an extraordinary secret it is the least obvious direction that holds the answers the waiter came with prevlovs cognac and he emptied the glass swishing the liquor around in his mouth before downing it in one swallow will you excuse me a moment sir prevlov looked up and marganin nodded in the direction of the mens room of course marganin stepped into the highceilinged tiled bathroom and stood in front of the urinal he was not alone a pair of feet with the trousers draped about the ankles showed under a toilet stall he stood there taking his time until he heard the toilet flush then he moved over to the washbasin and rinsed his hands slowly watching in the mirror as the same fat man from the park bench hitched up his belt and approached him pardon me sailor the fat man said you dropped this on the floor he handed marganin a small envelope marganin took it without hesitation and slipped it into his tunic oh how careless of me thank you the fat man then leaned over the basin as marganin turned away for a towel you have explosive information in that envelope said the fat man softly do not treat it lightly it will be handled delicately the letter was resting neatly centered on seagrams desk in the study he turned on the lamp sagged into the chair and began reading dear gene i love you it must seem like a banal way to begin but it is true i still love you with all my heart i have tried desperately to understand and comfort you during these months of stress how i have suffered waiting for you to accept my love and attention hoping for nothing in return except a small sign of your affection i am strong in many respects gene but i do not have the strength and patience to fight indifferent neglect no woman does i long for our early days the gentle days when our concern for one another far outweighed the demands of our professional lives it was simpler then we taught our classes at the university we laughed and made love as though each time were our last perhaps i drove the wedge between us for not wanting children perhaps a son or a daughter might have bound us tighter together i dont know i can only regret the things i did not do i only know that it will be best for both of us if i set time and space between us for a while for at present our living under the same roof seems to bring out a meanness and selfishness neither of us knew we possessed i have moved in with marie sheldon a marine geologist with numa she has been kind enough to loan me a spare room in her georgetown house until i can untangle my mental cobwebs please do not try to contact me it would only result in more ugly words give me time to work things out gene i implore you they say time heals all wounds let us pray this is so i do not mean to desert you gene when you feel you need me most i believe it will relieve one more burden from the heavy pressures of your position forgive my feminine frailty but from the other side of the coin my side it is as though you drove me away let us hope the future will allow our love to endure again i love you dana seagram reread the letter four times his eyes refusing to turn from the neatly scripted pages finally he clicked off the light and sat there in the darkness dana seagram stood in front of her closet going through the feminine ritual of deciding what to wear when a knock sounded on the bedroom door dana you almost ready come on in marie marie sheldon opened the door and leaned into the bedroom good lord sweetie youre not even dressed yet maries voice came from deep within her throat she was a small thin vital woman with vivid blue eyes a pert bobbed nose and a mass of bleached blond hair shaped in a shag style she might have been very provocative except for her squarecut chin i go through this every morning dana said irritably if only i could get organized and lay things out the night before but i always wait until the last moment marie moved beside dana how about the blue skirt dana slipped the skirt off the hanger and then threw it down on the carpet damn i sent the matching blouse to the cleaners if youre not careful youll start foaming at the mouth i cant help it dana said nothing seems to go right lately since you walked out on your husband you mean the last thing i need now is a sermon settle down sweetie if you want to take out your wrath on somebody then stand in front of a mirror dana stood tense as a toy doll whose spring has been wound too tightly marie could see an emotional crying jag coming on and beat a strategic retreat relax take your time ill go down and warm up the car dana waited until maries footsteps died before she went into the bathroom and downed two librium capsules as soon as the tranquilizer began to take effect she calmly slipped on a turquoise linen dress straightened her hair pulled on a pair of flatheeled shoes and headed downstairs on the way to numa headquarters dana sat bright and perky while tapping her foot to the music from the car radio one pill or two marie said casually umm i said one pill or two its a safe bet that when you instantly transform from a bitch into a miss goody twoshoes youve been popping pills i meant it about the sermon okay but a warning old roommate if i find you flaked out on the floor some dark night from an overdose im going to quietly fold my tent and silently steal off into the night i cant stand traumatic death scenes youre exaggerating marie looked at her am i youve been hitting that stuff like a health nut gobbles vitamins im all right dana said defiantly like hell you are youre a classic case of an emotionally depressed and frustrated female the worst kind i might add it takes time for the ragged edges to dull ragged edges my ass you mean it dulls your guilt i wont delude myself into believing i did the best thing by leaving gene but im convinced i did the right thing dont you think he needs you i used to hope he would reach out to me yet every time were together we fight like alley cats hes closed me out marie its the same old tired story when a man like gene becomes a slave to the demands of his work he throws up a wall that cant be breached and the stupid reason the incredibly stupid reason is because he imagines that sharing his problems automatically throws me on the firing line too a man accepts the thankless burden of responsibility we women do not to us life is a game we play one day at a time we never plan ahead like men her face became sad and drawn i can only wait and come back after gene falls wounded in his private battle then and only then am i certain hell welcome a return of my company it may be too late marie said from your description of him gene sounds like a prime candidate for a mental breakdown or a massive coronary if you had an ounce of guts youd stick it out with him dana shook her head i cant cope with rejection until we can get together peacefully again im going to make another life does that include other men platonic love only dana forced a smile im not about to play the liberated female and jump onto every penis that wanders across my path marie grinned slyly its one thing to be picky and pay lip service to high standards sweetie but quite another matter in actual practice you forget this is washington dc we outnumber the men eight to one theyre the lucky ones who can afford to be choosy if something happens then something happens im not going out and look for an affair besides im out of practice ive forgotten how to flirt seducing a man is like riding a bicycle marie said laughing once learned never forgotten she parked in the vast open lot of the numa headquarters building they walked up the steps into the lobby where they joined the stream of other staff members who were hurrying down the halls and up the elevators to their offices how about meeting me for lunch marie said fine ill bring a couple of male friends for you to exercise your latent charms on before dana could protest marie had melted into the crowd as she stood in the elevator dana noted with a curious sense of detached pleasure that her heart was thumping sandecker pulled his car into the parking lot of the alexandria college of oceanography climbed out from under the wheel and walked over to a man standing beside an electric golf cart admiral sandecker yes dr murray silverstein the round balding little man stuck out his hand glad you could come admiral i think weve got something that will prove helpful sandecker settled into the cart were grateful for every scrap of useful data you can give us silverstein took the tiller and guided them down an asphalt lane weve run an extensive series of tests since last night i cant promise anything mathematically exact mind you but the results are interesting to say the least any problems a few the main snag that throws our projections from the precise side of the scale to the approximate is a lack of solid facts for instance the direction of the titanics bow when she went down was never established this unknown factor alone could add four square miles to the search area i dont understand wouldnt a fortyfivethousandton steel ship sink in a straight line not necessarily the titanic corkscrewed and slid under the water at a depressed angle of roughly seventyeight degrees and as she sank the weight of the sea filling her forward compartments pulled her into a headway of between four and five knots next we have to consider the momentum caused by her tremendous mass and the fact that she had to travel two and a half miles before she struck bottom no im afraid she landed on a horizontal line a fair distance from her original starting point on the surface sandecker stared at the oceanographer how could you possibly know the precise angle of descent when the titanic sank the survivors descriptions were on the whole unreliable silverstein pointed to a huge concrete tower off to his right the answers are in there admiral he stopped the cart at the front entrance of the building come along and ill give you a practical demonstration of what im talking about sandecker followed him through a short hallway and into a room with a large acrylic plastic window at one end silverstein motioned for the admiral to move closer a diver wearing scuba equipment waved from the other side of the window sandecker waved back a deepwater tank silverstein said matteroffactly the interior walls are made of steel and rise two hundred feet high with a diameter of thirty feet there is a main pressure chamber for entering and exiting the bottom level and five air locks stationed at intervals along the side to enable us to observe our experiments at different depths i see sandecker said slowly youve been able to simulate the titanics fall to the sea floor yes let me show you silverstein lifted a telephone from a shelf under the observation window oven make a drop in thirty seconds you have a scale model of the titanic not exactly a prize exhibit for a maritime museum of course silverstein said but for a scaleddown version of the ships general configuration weight and displacement its a nearperfect balanced replica the potter did a damned fine job the potter ceramics silverstein said waving his hand in a vague gesture we can mold and fire twenty models in the time it would take us to fabricate a metal one he laid a hand on sandeckers arm and pulled him toward the window here she comes sandecker looked up and saw an oblong shape about four feet in length falling slowly through the water preceded by what looked to be a shower of marbles he could see that there had been no attempt to authenticate detail the model looked like a smooth lump of unglazed clay rounded at one end narrowed at the other and topped by three tubes representing the titanics smokestacks he heard a distinct clink through the observation window as the models bow struck the bottom of the tank wouldnt your calculations be thrown off by a flaw in the models configuration sandecker asked yes a mistake could make a difference silverstein looked at him but i assure you admiral we missed nothing sandecker pointed at the model the real titanic had four funnels yours has only three just before the titanics final plunge silverstein said her stern rose until she was completely perpendicular the strain was too much for the guy wires supporting the number one funnel they snapped and it toppled over the starboard side sandecker nodded my compliments doctor i should have known better than to question the thoroughness of your experiment its nothing really it gives me a chance to show off my expertise he turned and motioned a thumbsup sign through the window the diver tied the model onto a line that traveled toward the top of the tank ill run the test again and explain how we arrived at our conclusions you might begin by explaining the marbles they act the role of the boilers silverstein said the boilers perfect simulation too you see while the titanics stern was pointing at the sky her boilers broke loose from their cradle mounts and hurtled through the bulkheads toward the bow massive things they weretwentynine all told some of them were nearly sixteen feet in diameter and twenty feet long but your marbles fell outside the model yes our calculations indicate that at least nineteen of the boilers smashed their way through the bow and dropped to the bottom separately from the hull how can you be sure because if their fall had been contained the tremendous shift in ballast caused by their journey from amidships to the forward section of the ship would have pulled the titanic on a ninetydegree course straight downward however the reports of the survivors watching from the lifeboatsfor once most all tend to agreestate that soon after the earsplitting rumble from the boilers crazy stampede had died away the ship settled back a bit at the stern before sliding under this fact indicates to me at any rate that the titanic vomited her boilers and once free of this superincumbency righted herself slightly to attain the seventyeightdegree slant i mentioned previously and the marbles bear out this theory to the letter silverstein picked up the telephone again ready whenever you are owen he replaced the receiver on its cradle owen dugan my assistant above about now hell be setting the model in the water directly over that plumb line you see in the water off to one side of the tank as the water begins coming in through holes drilled strategically in the bow of the model shell begin to go down by the head at a certain angle the marbles will roll to the bow and a springloaded door will allow them to fall free as if on cue the marbles began falling to the floor of the tank followed closely by the model it struck about twelve feet from the plumb line the diver made a tiny mark on the bottom of the tank and held up his thumb and index finger indicating one inch there you have it admiral a hundred and ten drops and shes never touched down outside a fourinch radius sandecker stared into the tank for a long moment then turned to silverstein so where do we search after a few dazzling computations by our physics department said silverstein their best guess is thirteen hundred yards south of east from the point the sappho i discovered the cornet but at that its still a guess how can you be certain the horn didnt fall on an angle too silverstein feigned a hurt look you underestimate my genius for perfection admiral our evaluations here would be worthless without a clearcut picture of the cornets path to the sea floor included in my expense vouchers you will find a receipt from moes pawnshop for two cornets after a series of tests in the tank we took them two hundred miles off cape hatteras and dropped them in twelve thousand feet of water i can show you the charts from our sonar they each landed within fifty yards of their vertical departure line no offense sandecker said equably i have a sinking feeling if youll pardon the pun that my lack of faith is going to cost me a case of robert mondavi chardonnay silverstein said grinning if theres one thing i cant stand its a schmuck with good taste think how common the world would be without us sandecker made no reply he moved up to the window and stared inside the tank at the ceramic model of the titanic silverstein moved up behind him shes a fascinating subject no doubt of it strange thing about the titanic sandecker said softly once her spell strikes you can think of nothing else but why what is there about her that grips the imagination and wont let go because shes the wreck that puts all the others to shame sandecker said shes modern historys most legendary yet elusive treasure a simple photograph of her is enough to pump the adrenaline knowing her story the crew who sailed her the people who walked her decks in the few short days she lived thats what fires the imagination silverstein the titanic is a vast archive of an era well never see again god only knows if it is within our power to bring the grand old dame into daylight again but by heaven were going to try the submersible sea slug looked aerodynamically clean and smooth from her outside but to pitt as he contorted his sixfoottwo frame into the pilots chair the interior seemed a claustrophobic nightmare of hydraulic plumbing and electrical circuitry the craft was twenty feet long and tubular in shape with rounded ends like its lethargic namesake it was painted bright yellow and had four large portholes set in pairs on its bow while mounted along the top like small radar domes were two powerful high intensity lights pitt completed the checklist and turned to giordino who sat in the seat to his right shall we make a dive giordino flashed a toothy smile yes lets how about it rudi gunn looked up from his prone position behind the lower viewports and nodded ready when you are pitt spoke into a microphone and watched the small television screen above the control panel as it showed the modocs derrick lift the sea slug from her deck cradle and gently swing her over the side and into the water as soon as a diver had disconnected the lift cable pitt cracked the ballast valve and the submersible began to sink slowly under the rolling deeptroughed waves lifesupport timer on giordino announced an hour to the bottom ten hours for the search two hours for surfacing leaving us a reserve of five hours just in case well use the reserve time for the search pitt said giordino knew well the facts of the situation if the unthinkable happened an accident at twelve thousand feet there would be no hope of rescue a quick death would be the only prayer against the appalling suffering of slow asphyxiation he found himself actually amused at wishing he was back on board the sappho i enjoying the uncramped comfort of open space and the security of her eightweek lifesupport system he sat back and watched the water darken as the sea slug buried her hull in the depths his thoughts drifting to the enigmatic man who was piloting the craft giordino went back with pitt to their highschool days when they had built and raced hot rods together down the lonely farm roads behind newport beach california he knew pitt better than any man alive any woman for that matter pitt possessed in a sense two separate inner identities neither directly related to the other there was the congenial dirk pitt who rarely deviated from the middle of the road and was humorous unpretentious and radiated an easygoing friendliness with everyone he met then there was the other dirk pitt the coldly efficient machine who seldom made a mistake and who often withdrew into himself remote and aloof if there was a key that would unlock the door between the two giordino had yet to discover it giordino turned his attention back to the depth gauge its needle indicated twelve hundred feet soon they passed the twothousandfoot mark and entered a world of perpetual night from this point downward as far as the human eye was concerned there was only pure blackness giordino pushed a switch and the outside lights burst on and sliced a reassuring path through the darkness what do you think our chances are of finding her on the first try he asked if the computer data admiral sandecker sent us holds true the titanic should lie somewhere within a hundredandtendegree arc thirteen hundred yards southeast of the spot where you reclaimed the cornet oh great giordino mumbled sarcastically that narrows it down from looking for a toenail in the sands of coney island to searching for an albino boll weevil in a cotton field there he goes again gunn said offering his negative thought for the day maybe if we ignore him pitt laughed hell go away giordino grimaced and motioned into the watery void oh sure just drop me off at the next corner well find the old girl pitt said resolutely he pointed illuminated clock on the control panel lets see its ohsixforty now i predict well be over the titanics decks before lunch say about elevenforty giordino gave pitt a sideways look the great soothsayer has spoken a little optimism never hurts gunn said he adjusted the exterior camera housings and triggered the strobe it flashed blindingly for an instant like a shaft of lightning reflecting millions of planktonic creatures that hung in the water ten thousand feet and forty minutes later pitt reported to the modoc giving the depth and the water temperature thirtyfive degrees the three men watched fascinated as a small angler fish ugly in its stubby appearance slowly swept past the viewpoints the tiny luminous bulb that protruded from the top of its head glowed like a lonely beacon at feet the sea floor came into view moving up to meet the sea slug as though she were standing still pitt turned on the propulsion motors and adjusted the altitude angle gently stopping the sea slugs descent and turning her on a level course across the bleak red clay that carpeted the ocean floor gradually the ominous silence was broken by the rhythmic hum that came from the sea slugs electric motors at first pitt had difficulty distinguishing rises and gradual drops on the bottom there was nothing to indicate a threedimensional scale his eyes saw only a flatness that stretched beyond the reach of the lights there was no life to be seen and yet evidence proved otherwise scattering tracks from the depths habitants meandered and zigzagged in every direction through the sediment one might have guessed that they were made only recently but the sea can be misleading the footprints from deepdwelling sea spiders sea cucumbers or starfish might have been made several minutes ago or hundreds of years past because the microscopic animal and plant remains that comprise the deepocean ooze filters down from above at the rate of only one or two centimeters every thousand years theres a lovely creature giordino said pointing pitts eye followed giordinos finger and picked out a strange blueblack animal that seemed a cross between a squid and an octopus it had eight tentacles linked together like the webbed foot of a duck and it stared back at the sea slug through two large globular eyes that formed nearly a third of its body a vampire squid gunn informed them ask her if shes got relatives in transylvania giordino grinned you know pitt said that thing out there sort of reminds me of your girl friend gunn jumped in you mean the one with no boobs youve seen her rave on envious rabble giordino grumbled shes mad about me and her father keeps me floating in quality booze some quality pitt snorted old cesspool bourbon attila the hun gin tijuana vodka who the hell ever heard of those labels throughout the next few hours the wit and the sarcasm bounced off the walls of the sea slug actually it was put on a defense mechanism to relieve the gnawing pangs of monotony unlike romanticized fiction wreckhunting in the depths can be a grueling and tedious job add to that the aggravated discomfort of the cramped quarters the high humidity and chilling temperatures inside the submersible and you have the ingredients for provoking an accident through human error that could prove both costly and fatal pitts hands stayed rocksteady as they handled the controls guiding the sea slug a scant four feet above the bottom giordinos concentration was nailed to the life support systems while gunn kept his eyes skinned on the sonar and magnetometer the long hours of planning were over it was now a case of patience and persistence mixed with that peculiar blend of eternal optimism and love of the unknown shared by all treasure seekers looks like a pile of rocks up ahead pitt said giordino stared up through the viewports theyre just sitting there in the ooze i wonder where they came from perhaps ballast thrown overboard from an old windjammer more likely came from icebergs gunn said many rocks and bits of debris are carried over the sea and then dropped to the floor when the icebergs melt gunn broke off in the middle of his lecture hold on im getting a strong response on the sonar now the magnetometer is picking it up too where away pitt asked on a heading of onethreeseven onethreeseven it is pitt repeated he swept the sea slug into a graceful bank as though she was an airplane and headed on the new course giordino peered intently over gunns shoulder at the green circles of light on the sonarscope a small dot of pulsating brightness indicated a solid object three hundred yards beyond their range of vision dont get your hopes up gunn said quietly the target reads too small for a ship what do you make of it hard to say no more than twenty or twentyfive feet in length about two stories high might be anything or it might be one of the titanics boilers pitt cut in the sea floor should be littered with them you move to the head of the class gunn said excitement creeping into his tone i have an identical reading bearing oneonefive and here comes another at onesixzero the last has an indicated length of approximately seventy feet sounds like one of her smokestacks pitt said lord gunn murmured hoarsely its beginning to read like a junkyard down here suddenly in the gloom at the outer edge of the blackness a rounded object became visible haloed in the eerie light like an immense tombstone soon the three pairs of eyes inside the submersible could distinguish the furnace gratings of the great boiler and then the row upon row of rivets along the iron seams and the torn jagged tentacles of what was left of its steam tubing how would you like to have been a stoker in those days and fed that baby giordino muttered ive picked up another one gunn said no wait the pulse is getting stronger here comes the length one hundred feet two keep coming sweetheart pitt prayed five hundred seven eight hundred feet we got her weve got her what course pitts mouth was as dry as sand bearing zeronineseven gunn replied in a whisper they spoke no more for the next few minutes as the sea slug closed the distance their faces were pale and strained with anticipation pitts heart was pounding painfully in his chest and his stomach felt as if it had a great iron weight in it and a huge hand crushing it from the outside he became aware that he was allowing the submersible to creep too close to the ooze he pulled back the controls and kept his eyes trained through the viewport what would they find a rusty old hulk far beyond hope of salvaging a shattered broken hull buried to its superstructure in the muck and then his straining eyes caught sight of a massive shadow looming up ominously in the darkness christ almighty giordino mumbled in awe weve struck her fair on the bow as the range narrowed to fifty feet pitt slowed the motors and turned the sea slug on a parallel course with the illfated liners waterline the mere size of the wreck when viewed from alongside her steel plates was a staggering sight even after nearly eighty years the sunken ship proved to be surprisingly free of corrosion the gold band that encompassed the foot black hull glistened under the highintensity lights pitt eased the submersible upward past the eightton portside anchor until they could all clearly make out the threefoothigh golden letters that still proudly proclaimed her as the titanic spellbound pitt picked up the microphone from its cradle and pressed the transmit button modoc modoc this is sea slug do you read the radio operator on the modoc answered almost immediately this is modoc sea slug we read you over pitt adjusted the volume to minimize the background crackle modoc notify numa headquarters that we have found the big t repeat we have found the big t depth twelve thousand three hundred and forty feet time elevenfortytwo hours elevenfortytwo giordino echoed you cocky bastard you only missed by two minutes regenesis the titanic lay cloaked by the eerie stillness of the black deep and bore the grim scars of her tragedy the jagged wound from her collision with the iceberg stretched from the starboard forepeak to the no boiler room nearly three hundred feet down her hull while the gaping holes in her bow below the waterline betrayed the shattering impact made by her boilers when they tore from her bowels and smashed their way through bulkhead after bulkhead until they plunged free into the sea she sat heavily in the ooze with a slight list to port her forecastle set on a southerly course as if she were still pathetically struggling to reach out and touch the waters of a port she had never known the lights from the submersible danced over her ghostlike superstructure casting long spectral shadows across her long teak decks her portholes some open some closed marched in orderly rows along the broad expanse of her sides she presented an almost modern streamlined appearance now that her funnels were gone the forward three were nonexistent two probably having been carried away by her dive to the bottom while number four lay fallen across the after boat deck and except for the scattered strands of rusty disconnected funnel rigging that snaked over the railings her boat deck showed only a few hulking air vents standing silent guard above the vacant welin davits that had once held the great liners lifeboats there was a morbid beauty about her the men inside the submersible could almost see her dining saloons and staterooms flooded with lights and crowded with hundreds of lighthearted and laughing passengers they could visualize her libraries stacked with books her smoking rooms filled with the blue haze of gentlemens cigars and hear the music of her band playing turnofthecentury ragtime the passengers walked her decks the wealthy the famous men in immaculate evening dress women in colorful anklelength gowns nannies with children clutching favorite toys the astons the guggenheims and the strauses in first class the middleclass the school teachers the clergymen the students and the writers in second the immigrants the irish farmers and their families the carpenters the bakers the dressmakers and the miners from remote villages of sweden russia and greece in steerage then there were the almost nine hundred crew members from the ships officers to the caterers the stewards the lift boys and the engineroom men great opulence lay in the darkness beyond the doors and portholes what would the swimming pool the squash court and the turkish baths look like was there a rotten remnant of the great tapestry still hanging in the reception room what of the bronze clock on the grand staircase or the crystal chandeliers in the elegant cafe parisien or the delicately ornate ceiling above the firstclass dining saloon would perhaps the bones of captain edward j smith remain somewhere within the shadows of the bridge what mysteries were there to be discovered within this once colossal floating palace if and when she ever greeted the sun again the strobe light on the submersibles cameras seemed to flash endlessly as the tiny intruder circled the immense hulk a large twofoot rattailed fish with huge eyes and a heavy armored head skittered over the slanting decks showing total unconcern for the exploding beams of light after what seemed like hours the submersible the faces of its crew still glued to the viewports rose over the firstclass lounge roof hovered for a few moments then deposited a small electronicsignal capsule its low frequency impulses would now provide a traceable guideline for future dives to the wreck then the submersible made a gliding turn upward her lights blinked out and she melted back into the darkness from whence she had come except for the few sparks of marine life that had somehow managed to adapt to survival in the black bittercold environment the titanic was alone once more but soon other submersibles would come and she would feel the tools of man working on her steel skin again as she had so many years ago at the great slipways of the harland and wolff shipbuilding firm in belfast then just perhaps she would make her first port after all the titanic may in a measured and precise manner the soviet general secretary georgi antonov lit his pipe and surveyed the other men seated around the long mahogany conference table to his right sat admiral boris sloyuk director of soviet naval intelligence and his aide captain prevlov opposite them were vladimir polevoi chief of the foreign secrets department of the kgb and vasily tilevitch marshal of the soviet union and chief director of soviet security antonov came straight to the point well now it seems the americans are determined to raise the titanic to the surface he studied the papers sitting before him a few moments before continuing an extensive effort by the look of it two supply ships three tenders four deepsea submersibles he looked up at admiral sloyuk and prevlov do we have an observer in the area prevlov nodded the oceanographic research vessel mikhail kurkov under the command of captain ivan parotkin is cruising the salvage perimeter i know parotkin personally sloyuk added he is a good seaman if the americans are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in an attempt to salvage a seventysixyearold piece of scrap antonov said there must be a logical motivation there is a motivation admiral sloyuk said gravely a motivation that threatens our very security he nodded to prevlov who began passing out a red folder marked sicilian project to antonov and the men across the table that is why i requested this meeting my people have discovered outline plans for a new secret american defense system i think you will find it a shocking if not terrifying study antonov and the others opened the folders and began reading for perhaps five minutes the soviet general secretary read occasionally glancing in sloyuks direction antonovs face went through a wide range of expressions beginning with professional interest to frank bewilderment to astonishment and finally stunned realization this is incredible admiral sloyuk absolutely incredible is such a defense system possible marshal tilevitch asked i have put the same question to five of our most respected scientists they all agreed theoretically that such a system is feasible provided a strong enough power source is available and you assume this source lies in the cargo holds of the titanic tilevitch put to him we are certain of it comrade marshal as i mentioned in the report the vital ingredient needed for the completion of the sicilian project is a littleknown element called byzanium we now know the americans stole the worlds only supply from russian soil seventysix years ago fortunately for us they had the ill luck to transport it on a doomed ship antonov shook his head in utter incomprehension if what you say in your report is true then the americans have the potential to knock down our intercontinental missiles as effortlessly as a goatherd swats flies sloyuk nodded solemnly i am afraid that is the fearful truth polevoi leaned across the table his face a mask of suspicious consternation you state here that your contact is a highlevel aide in the united states department of defense that is correct prevlov nodded respectfully he became disillusioned with the american government during the watergate affair and has since sent me whatever material he deems important antonov stared piercingly into prevlovs eyes do you think they can do it captain prevlov raise the titanic antonov nodded prevlov stared back if you will recall the central intelligence agencys successful recovery of one of our soviet nuclear submarines in seventeen thousand feet of water off hawaii in i believe the cia referred to it as project jenniferthere is little doubt that the americans have the technical capability to put the titanic in new york harbor yes comrade antonov i firmly believe they will do it i do not share your opinion said polevoi a vessel the size of the titanic is a far cry from a submarine i have to throw in my lot with captain prevlov sloyuk argued the americans have an annoying habit of accomplishing what they set out to do and what of this sicilian project polevoi persisted the kgb has received no detailed data concerning its existence except the code name how do we know the americans have not created a mythical project to play a bluffing hand at the negotiations to limit strategic nuclear delivery systems antonov rapped his knuckles on the tabletop the americans do not bluff comrade khrushchev found that out twentyfive years ago during the cuban missile crisis we cannot ignore any possibility however remote that they are on the verge of making this defense system operational as soon as they salvage the byzanium from the hull of the titanic he paused to suck on his pipe stem i suggest that our next thoughts be directed toward a course of action quite obviously we must see to it that the byzanium never reaches the united states marshal tilevitch said polevoi drummed his fingers on the sicilian project file sabotage we must sabotage the salvage operation there is no other way there must be no incident with international repercussions antonov said firmly there can be no suggestion of interference through overt military action i do not want sovietunited states relations jeopardized during yet another bad crop year is that clear we can do nothing unless we penetrate the salvage area tilevitch persisted polevoi stared across the table at sloyuk what steps have the americans taken to protect the operation the nuclearpowered guidedmissile cruiser juneau is patrolling within sight of the salvage ships on a twentyfourhour basis may i speak prevlov asked almost condescendingly he did not wait for an answer with due consideration comrades the penetration has already taken place antonov looked up please explain yourself captain prevlov took a side glance at his superior admiral sloyuk acknowledged him with a faint nod we have two undercover operatives working as members of the numa salvage crew prevlov elucidated an exceptionally talented team they have been relaying important american oceanographic data to us for two years good good your people have done well sloyuk antonov said but there was no warmth in his tone his gaze came back to prevlov are we to assume captain that you have devised a plan i have comrade marganin was in prevlovs office when he returned casually sitting behind the captains desk there was a change about him no longer did he seem like the common bootlicking aide that prevlov had left only a few hours ago there was something about him that was more certain more selfassured it seemed to be in his eyes those insecure eyes now mirrored the confident look of a man who knew what he was about how did the conference go captain marganin asked without rising i think i can safely say the day will soon come when you will be addressing me as admiral i must confess marganin said coolly your fertile mind is surpassed only by your ego prevlov was caught off guard his face paled with controlled anger and when he spoke it required no acute sense of hearing or imagination to detect the emotion in his voice you dare to insult me why not you undoubtedly sold comrade antonov on the fact that it was your genius that arrived at the purpose of the sicilian project and the titanic salvage operation when in reality it was my source who passed along the information and you also most likely told them about your wonderful plan to wrest the byzanium from the americans hands again stolen from me in short prevlov you are nothing but an untalented thief that will do prevlov was pointing a finger at marganin his tone glacial suddenly he stiffened and was completely under control again intent urbane the true professional you will burn for your insubordination marganin he said pleasantly i will see to it that you burn a thousand deaths before this month is through marganin said nothing he only smiled a smile that was as cold as a tomb so much for secrecy seagram said dropping a newspaper on sandeckers desk thats this mornings paper i picked it up from a newsstand not fifteen minutes ago sandecker turned it around and looked at the front page he didnt have to look farther it was all there numa to raise titanic he read aloud well at least we dont have to pussyfoot around any more multimillion dollar effort to salvage illfated liner you have to admit it makes for fascinating reading informed sources said today that the national underwater and marine agency is conducting an allout salvage attempt to raise the rmstitanic which struck an iceberg and sank in the midatlantic on april with a loss of over fifteen hundred lives this tremendous undertaking heralds a new dawn in deepsea salvage that is without parallel in the history of mans search for treasure a multimilliondollar treasure hunt seagram frowned darkly the president will love that even has a picture of me sandecker said not a good likeness must be a stock photo from their files taken maybe five or six years ago it couldnt have come at a worse time seagram said three more weeks pitt said he would try to lift her in three more weeks dont hold your breath pitt and his crew have been at it for nine months nine grueling months of battling every winter storm the atlantic could throw at them tackling every setback and technical adversity as it came up its a miracle theyve accomplished so much in so little time and yet a thousand and one things can still go wrong there may be hidden structural cracks that might split the hull wide open when it breaks from the sea floor or then again the enormous suction between the keel and the bottom ooze might never release its grip if i were you seagram i wouldnt get a glow on until you see the titanic being towed past the statue of liberty seagram looked wounded the admiral grinned at his stricken expression and offered him a cigar it was refused on the other hand sandecker said comfortingly she may rise to the surface as pretty as you please thats what i like about you admiral your onagain offagain optimism i like to prepare myself for disappointments it helps to ease the pain seagram didnt reply he was silent for a minute then he said so we worry about the titanic when the time comes but we still have the problem of the press to consider how do we handle it simple sandecker said airily we do what any redblooded grassroots politician would do when his shady record is laid bare by scandalhungry reporters and that is seagram asked warily we call a press conference thats madness if congress and the public ever got wind of the fact that weve poured over threequarters of a billion dollars into this thing theyll be on us like a kansas tornado so we play liars poker and slice the salvage costs in half for publication whos to know theres no way the true figure can be uncovered i still dont like it seagram said these washington reporters are master surgeons when it comes to dissecting a speaker at a press conference theyll carve you up like a thanksgiving turkey i wasnt thinking of me sandecker said slowly then who certainly not me im the little man who isnt here remember i had someone else in mind someone who is ignorant of our behindthescenes skullduggery someone who is an authority on sunken ships and whom the press would treat with the utmost courtesy and respect and where are you going to find this paragon of virtue im awfully glad you used the word virtue sandecker said slyly you see i was thinking of your wife dana seagram stood confidently at the lectern and deftly fielded the questions put to her by the eightyodd reporters seated in the numa headquarters auditorium she smiled continuously with the happy look of a woman who is enjoying herself and who knows she would be approved of she wore a terracotta color wrap skirt and a deeply vd sweater neatly accented by a small mahogany necklace she was tall appealing and elegant an image that immediately put her inquisitors at a disadvantage a whitehaired woman on the left side of the room rose and waved her hand dr seagram dana nodded gracefully dr seagram the readers of my paper the chicago daily would like to know why the government is spending millions to salvage an old rusty ship why wouldnt the money be better spent elsewhere say for welfare or badly needed urban renewal ill be happy to clear the air for you dana said to begin with raising the titanic is not a waste of money two hundred and ninety million dollars have been budgeted and so far we are well below that figure and i might add ahead of schedule dont you consider that a lot of money not when you consider the possible return you see the titanic is a veritable storehouse of treasure estimates run over three hundred million dollars there are many of the passengers jewels and valuables still on board a quarter of a million dollars worth in one stateroom alone then there are the ships fittings as well as the furnishings and the precious decor some of which may have survived a collector would gladly pay anywhere from five hundred to a thousand dollars for one piece of china or a crystal goblet from the firstclass dining room no ladies and gentlemen this is one time when a federal project is not if youll pardon the expression a taxpayer ripoff we will show a profit in dollars and a profit in historical artifacts of a bygone era not to mention the tremendous wealth of data for marine science and technology dr seagram this from a tall pinchfaced man in the rear of the auditorium we havent had time to read the press release you passed out earlier so could you please enlighten us as to the mechanics of the salvage im glad you asked me that dana laughed seriously i apologize for the old cliche but your question sir is the cue for a brief slide presentation that should help explain many of the mysteries regarding the project she turned to the wings of the stage lights please the lighting dimmed and the first slide marched onto a wide screen above and behind the lectern we begin with a composite of over eighty photographs pieced together to show the titanic as she rests on the sea floor fortunately shes sitting upright with a light list to port which conveniently puts the hundredyardlong gash she received from the iceberg in an accessible position to seal how is it possible to seal an opening that size at that enormous depth the next slide came on and showed a man holding what looked like a large blob of liquid plastic in answer to that question dana said this is dr amos stannford demonstrating a substance he developed called wetsteel as the name suggests wetsteel though pliable in air hardens to the rigidity of steel ninety seconds after coming in contact with water and it can bond itself to a metal object as though it were welded this last statement was followed by a wave of murmurs throughout the room ballshaped aluminum tanks ten feet in diameter that contain wetsteel have been dropped at strategic spots around the vessel dana continued they are designed so that a submersible can attach itself to the tank not unlike the docking procedure of a shuttle rocket with a space laboratory and then proceed to the working area where the crew can aim and expel the wetsteel from a specially designed nozzle how is the wetsteel pumped from the tank to illustrate with another comparison the great pressure at that depth compresses the aluminum tank much like a tube of toothpaste squeezing the sealant through the nozzle and into the opening to be covered she signaled for a new slide now here we see a cutaway drawing of the sea depicting the supply tenders on the surface and the submersibles clustered around the wreck on the bottom there are four manned underwater vehicles involved in the salvage operation the sappho i which you may recall was the craft used on the lorelei current drift expedition is currently engaged in patching the damage caused by the iceberg along the starboard side of the hull and also the bow where it was shattered by the titanics boilers the sappho ii a newer and more advanced sister ship is sealing the smaller openings such as the air vents and portholes the navys submersible the sea slug has the job of cutting away unnecessary debris including the masts rigging and the aft funnel which fell across the after boat deck and finally the deep fathom a submersible belonging to the uranus oil corporation is installing pressure relief valves on the titanics hull and superstructure could you please explain the purpose of the valves dr seagram certainly dana replied when the hulk begins its journey to the surface the air that has been pumped into her interior will begin to expand as the pressure of the sea lessens against her exterior unless this inside pressure is continuously bled the titanic could conceivably blow herself to pieces the valves of course are there to prevent this disastrous occurrence then numa intends to use compressed air to lift the derelict yes the support tender capricorn has two compressor units capable of displacing the water in the titanics hull with enough air to raise her dr seagram came another disembodied voice i represent science today and i happen to know that the water pressure where the titanic lies is upwards of six thousand pounds per square inch i also know that the largest available air compressor can only put out four thousand pounds how do you intend to overcome this differential the main unit on board the capricorn pumps the air from the surface through a reinforced pipe to the secondary pump which is stationed amidships of the wreck in appearance this secondary pump looks like a radial aircraft engine with a series of pistons spreading from a central hub again we utilized the seas great abyssal pressures to activate the pump which is also assisted by electricity and the air pressure coming from above i am sorry i cant give you an indepth description but i am a marine archaeologist not a marine engineer however admiral sandecker will be available later in the day to answer your technical questions in greater detail what about suction the voice of science today persisted after sitting imbedded in the silt all these years wont the titanic be fairly well glued to the bottom she will indeed dana gestured for the lights they came on and she stood blinking in the glare for a few moments until she could distinguish her inquirer he was a middleaged man with long brown hair and large wire rimmed glasses when it is calculated that the ship has enough air to lift her mass toward the surface the air pipe will be disconnected from the hull and converted to inject an electrolyte chemical processed by the myerslentz company into the sediment surrounding the titanics keel the resulting reaction will cause the molecules in the sediment to break down and form a cushion of bubbles that will erase the static friction and allow the great hulk to wrest herself free from the suction another man raised his hand if the operation is successful and the titanic begins floating toward the surface isnt there a good chance she could capsize two and a half miles is a long way for an unbalanced object of fortyfive thousand tons to remain upright youre right there is the possibility she might capsize but we plan to leave enough water in her lower holds to act as ballast and offset this problem a young mannishlooking woman rose and waved her hand dr seagram i am connie sanchez of female eminence weekly and my readers would be interested in learning what defense mechanisms you have personally developed for competing on a daytoday basis in a profession dominated by egotistic male pigheads the audience of reporters greeted the question with uneasy silence god dana thought to herself it had to come sooner or later she stepped alongside the lectern and leaned on it in a negligent almost sexy attitude my reply ms sanchez is strictly off the record then youre copping out said connie sanchez with a superior grin dana ignored the jab first i find that a defense mechanism is hardly necessary my masculine colleagues respect my intelligence enough to accept my opinions i dont have to go braless or spread my legs to get their attention second i prefer standing on my own home ground and competing with members of my own sex not a strange stance when you consider the fact that out of five hundred and forty scientists on the staff of numa a hundred and fourteen are women and third ms sanchez the only pigheads its been my misfortune to meet during my life have not been men but rather the female of the species for several moments a stunned silence gripped the room then suddenly shattering the embarrassed quiet a voice burst from the audience atta girl doc yelled the little whitehaired lady from the chicago daily thats putting her down a sea of applause rippled and then roared sweeping the auditorium in a storm of approval the battlehardened washington correspondents offered her their respect with a standing ovation connie sanchez sat in her seat and stared coldly in flushed anger dana saw connies lips form the word bitch and she returned a smug derisive kind of smile that only women do so well adulation dana thought how sweet it is since early morning the wind had blown steadily out of the northeast by later afternoon it had increased to a gale of thirtyfive knots which in turn threw up mountainous seas that pitched the salvage ships about like paper cups in a dishwasher the tempest carried with it a numbing cold borne of the barren wastes above the arctic circle the men dared not venture out onto the icy decks it was no secret that the greatest barrier against keeping warm was the wind a man could feel much colder and more miserable at twenty degrees above zero fahrenheit with a thirtyfiveknot wind than at twenty degrees below zero with no wind the wind steals the body heat as quickly as it can be manufactureda nasty situation known as chill factor joel farquar the capricorns weatherman on loan from the federal meteorological services administration seemed unconcerned with the storm snapping outside the operations room as he studied the instrumentation that tied into the national weather satellites and provided four space pictures of the north atlantic every twentyfour hours what does your prognosticating little mind see for our future pitt asked bracing his body against the roll shell start easing in another hour farquar replied by sunrise tomorrow the wind should be down to ten knots farquar didnt look up when he spoke he was a studious little redfaced man with utterly no sense of humor and no trace of friendly warmth yet he was respected by every man on the salvage operation because of his total dedication to the job and the fact that his predictions were uncannily accurate the best laid plans pitt murmured idly to himself another day lost thats four times in one week weve had to cast off and buoy the air line god can make a storm farquar said indifferently he nodded toward the two banks of television monitors that covered the forward bulkhead of the capricorns operations room at least theyre not bothered by it all pitt looked at the screens which showed the submersibles calmly working on the wreck twelve thousand feet below the relentless sea their independence from the surface was the saving grace of the project with the exception of the sea slug which only had a downtime of eighteen hours and was now securely tied on the modocs deck the other three submersibles could be scheduled to stay down on the titanic for five days at a stretch before they returned to the surface to change crews he turned to al giordino who was bent over a large chart table whats the disposition of the surface ships giordino pointed at the tiny twoinch models scattered about the chart the capricorn is holding her usual position in the center the modoc is dead ahead and the bomberger is trailing three miles astern pitt stared at the model of the bomberger she was a new vessel constructed especially for deepwater salvage tell her captain to close up to within one mile giordino nodded toward the bald radio operator who was moored securely to the slanting deck in front of his equipment you heard the man curly tell the bomberger to come up to one mile astern how about the supply ships pitt asked no problem there this weather is duck soup to big tentonners the likes of these two the alhambra is in position to port and the monterey park is right where shes supposed to be to starboard pitt nodded at a small red model i see our russian friends are still with us the mikhail kurkov giordino said he picked up a blue replica of a warship and placed it next to the red model yeah but she cant be enjoying the game the juneau that navy guidedmissile cruiser hangs on like glue and the wreck buoys signal unit serenely beeping away eighty feet beneath the uproar giordino announced only twelve hundred yards give or take a hair bearing zerofivenine southwest that is thank god we havent been blown off the homestead pitt sighed relax giordino grinned reassuringly you act like a mother with a daughter out on a date after midnight every time theres a little breeze the motherhen complex becomes worse the closer we get pitt admitted ten more days al if we can get ten calm days we can wrap it up thats up to the weather oracle giordino turned to farquar what about it o great seer of meteorological wisdom twelve hours advance notice is all youll get out of me farquar grunted without looking up this is the north atlantic shes the most unpredictable of any ocean in the world hardly one day is ever the same now if your precious titanic had gone down in the indian ocean i could give you your ten day prediction with an eighty percent chance of accuracy excuses excuses giordino replied i bet when you make love to a woman you tell her going in that theres a fortypercent chance shell enjoy it forty per cent is better than nothing farquar said casually pitt caught a gesture by the sonar operator and moved over to him what have you got a strange pinging noise over the amplifier the sonar man replied he was a palefaced man about the size and shape of a gorilla ive picked it up off and on during the last two months strange sort of sound kind of like somebody was sending messages make anything of it no sir i had curly listen to it but he said it was pure gibberish most likely a loose object on the wreck thats being rattled about by the current or maybe its a ghost the sonar man said you dont believe in them but youre afraid of them is that it fifteen hundred souls went down with the titanic the sonar man said its not unlikely that at least one came back to haunt the ship the only spirits im interested in giordino said from the chart table are the kind you drink the interior cabin camera of sappho ii just blacked out this from the sandyhaired man seated at the tv monitors pitt was immediately behind him staring at the blackened monitor is the problem at this end no sir all circuits here and on the buoys relay panel are operable the problem must be on the sappho ii it just seemed like somebody hung a cloth over the camera lens pitt swung to face the radio operator curly contact sappho ii and ask them to check their cabin tv camera giordino picked up a clipboard and checked the crew schedule omar woodson is in command of the sappho ii this shift curly pressed the transmit switch sappho ii hello sappho ii this is capricorn please reply then he leaned forward pressing his headset tighter to his ears the contact is weak sir lots of interference the words are very broken i cant make them out turn on the speaker pitt ordered a voice rattled into the operations room muffled behind a wave of static something is jamming the transmission said curly the relay unit on the airline buoy should be picking them up loud and clear give your volume everything its got maybe we can make some sense out of woodsons reply sappho ii could you repeat please we cannot read you over as soon as curly turned up the speaker the explosion of earsplitting crackle made everyone jump corn we ou lear ver pitt grabbed the microphone omar this is pitt your cabin tv camera is out can you repair we will await your reply over every eye in the operations room locked on the speaker as though it were alive five interminable minutes dragged by while they patiently waited for woodsons report then woodsons fragmented voice hammered through the loudspeaker again hen munk est peron sur giordino twisted his face puzzled something about henry munk the rest is too garbled to comprehend theyre back on monitor not every eye had been aimed at the speaker the young man at the tv monitors had never taken his off sappho iis screen the crew looks like theyre grouped around someone lying on the deck like spectators at a tennis match every head turned in unison to the tv monitor figures were moving to and fro in front of the camera while in the background three men could be seen bent over a body stretched grotesquely on the submersibles narrow cabin deck omar listen to me pitt snapped into the microphone we do not understand your transmissions you are back on tv monitor i repeat you are back on tv monitor write your message and hold it up to the camera over they watched one of the figures detach itself from the rest and lean over a table for a few moments writing and then approach the tv camera it was woodson he held up a scrap of paper whose rough printing read henry munk dead request permission to surface good god giordinos expression was one of pure astonishment henry munk dead it cant be true omar woodson isnt noted for playing games pitt said grimly he began to transmit again negative omar you cannot surface there is a thirtyfiveknot gale up here the sea is turbulent i repeat you cannot surface woodson nodded that he understood then he wrote something else looking over his shoulder furtively every so often the note said i suspect munk murdered even farquars usually inscrutable face had gone pale youll have to let them surface now he whispered i will do what i have to do pitt shook his head decisively my feelings will have to look elsewhere there are five men still alive and breathing inside sappho ii i wont risk bringing them up only to lose them all under a thirtyfoot wave no gentlemen we will just have to sit it out until sunrise to see what there is to see inside the sappho ii pitt had the capricorn home in on the signalrelay buoy as soon as the wind dropped to twenty knots once again they connected the air line running from the ships compressor to the titanic and then waited for the sappho iis emergence from the deep the eastern sky was beginning to brighten when final preparations were made to receive the submersible divers made ready to drop in position around the sappho ii and secure safety lines to prevent her from capsizing in the heavy seas the winches and cables were set to haul her from the water and into the open stern of the capricorn down in the galley the cook began making an urn of coffee and a hearty breakfast to greet the crew of the submersible when they arrived when all was in readiness the scientists and engineers stood quietly shivering in the early morning cold wondering about henry munks death it was when the submersible popped into the marching swells one hundred yards off the port stern of the capricorn a line was run out by boat and within twenty minutes the sappho ii was winched onto the stern ramp of her tender as soon as she was blocked and secured into place the hatch was opened and woodson pulled himself out followed by the four surviving members of his crew woodson climbed to the top deck where pitt was waiting for him his eyes were red with sleeplessness and his face stubblebearded and gray but he managed a thin smile as pitt shoved a steaming mug of coffee into his hand i dont know which im happier to see you or the coffee he said your message mentioned murder pitt said ignoring any word of greeting woodson sipped at the coffee for a moment and looked back at the men who were gently lifting munks body through the submersibles hatch not here he said quietly pitt motioned toward his quarters once the door was closed he wasted no time okay lets have it woodson dropped heavily onto pitts bunk and rubbed his eyes not much to tell we were hovering about sixty feet above the sea floor sealing off the starboard ports on c deck when i got your message about the tv camera i went aft to check it out and found munk lying on the deck with his left temple caved in any sign of what caused the blow as plain as the nose on pinocchios face woodson answered bits of skin blood and hair were stuck on the corner of the alternator housing cover im not that familiar with the sappho iis equipment how is it mounted on the starboard side about ten feet from the stern the housing cover is raised about six inches off the deck so the alternator below is easily accessible for maintenance then it might have been an accident munk could have stumbled and fallen striking his head on the edge he could have except his feet were facing the wrong way what do his feet have to do with it they were pointed toward the stern so dont you get it woodson said impatiently munk must have been walking toward the bow when he fell the fuzzy picture in pitts mind began to clear and he saw the piece of the puzzle that didnt belong the alternator housing is on the starboard side so it should have been munks right temple that was smashed not his left you got it what caused the tv camera to malfunction no malfunction somebody hung a towel over the lens and the crew where was each member positioned i was working the nozzle while sam merker acted as pilot munk had left the instrument panel to go to the head which is located in the stern we were the second watch the first watch included jack donovan a young blond fellow the structural engineer from oceanic tech right and lieutenant leon lucas the salvage technician on assignment from the navy and ben drummer all three men were asleep in their bunks it doesnt necessarily follow that any one of them killed munk pitt said what was the reasoning you dont just kill someone in an unescapable situation twelve thousand feet under the sea without one hell of a motive woodson shrugged youll have to call in sherlock holmes i only know what i saw pitt continued to probe munk could have twisted as he fell not unless he had a rubber neck that could turn a hundred and eighty degrees backward lets try another puzzler how do you kill a twohundredpound man by knocking his head against a metal corner thats only six inches off the floor swing him by the heels like a sledgehammer woodson threw out his hands in a helpless gesture okay so maybe i got carried away and began seeing homicidal maniacs where none exist god knows that wreck down there gets to you after a while its weird there are times i could have sworn i even saw people walking the decks leaning over the rails and staring at us he yawned and it was evident that he was fighting to keep his eyes open pitt made for the door and then turned you better get some sleep well go over this later woodson needed no further urging he was peacefully gone to the world before pitt was halfway to the sick bay dr cornelius bailey was an elephant of a man broad shouldered and had a thrusting square jawed face his sandy hair was down to his collar and the beard on the great jaw was cut in an elegant van dyke he was popular among the salvage crews and could out drink any five of them when he felt in the mood to prove it his hamlike hands turned henry munks body over on the examining table as effortlessly as if it was a stick doll which indeed it very nearly was considering the advanced stage of rigor mortis poor henry he said thank god he wasnt a family man healthy specimen all i could do for him on his last examination was clean out a little wax from his ears what can you tell me about the cause of death pitt asked thats obvious bailey said first it was due to massive damage of the temporal lobe what do you mean by first just that my dear pitt this man was more or less killed twice look at this he pulled back munks shirt exposing the nape of the neck there was a large purplish bruise at the base of the skull the spinal cord just below the medulla oblongata has been crushed most likely by a blunt instrument of some kind then woodson was right munk was murdered murdered you say oh yes of course no doubt of it bailey said calmly as though homicide were an everyday shipboard occurrence then it would seem the killer struck munk from behind and then rammed his head against the alternator housing to make it look like an accident thats a fair assumption pitt laid a hand on baileys shoulder id appreciate it if you kept your discovery quiet for a while doc mums the word my lips are sealed and all that crap dont waste another thought on it my report and testimony will be here when you need it pitt smiled at the doctor and left the sick bay he made his way aft to where the sappho ii sat dripping salt water on the stern ramp climbed up the hatch ladder and dropped down inside an instrument technician was checking the tv camera how does it look pitt asked nothing wrong with this baby the technician replied as soon as the structural crew checks out the hull you can send her back down the sooner the better pitt said he moved past the technician to the after end of the submersible the gore from munks injuries had already been cleaned from the deck and the corner of the alternator housing pitts mind was whirling only one thought broke away and uncoiled not a thought really rather an unreasoning certainty that something would point an accusing finger toward munks murderer he figured it would take him an hour or more but the fates were kind he found what he knew he must find within the first ten minutes let me see if i understand you sandecker said glaring across his desk one of the members of my salvage crew has been brutally murdered and youre asking me to sit idle and do nothing about it while the killer is allowed to roam loose warren nicholson shifted uneasily in his chair and avoided sandeckers blazing eyes i realize that its difficult to accept thats putting it mildly sandecker snorted suppose he takes it in his head to kill again thats a calculated risk we have considered we have considered sandecker echoed its simple for you to sit up there at cia headquarters and say that youre not down there nicholson trapped in a submersible thousands of feet below the sea wondering whether the man standing next to you is going to bash your brains out i am certain it wont happen again nicholson said impassively what makes you so sure because professional russian agents do not commit murder unless it is absolutely necessary russian agents sandecker stared at nicholson in startled and total disbelief what in gods name are you talking about just that henry munk was killed by an operative working for the soviet naval intelligence department you cant be positive there is no proof not one hundred per cent no it might have been someone else with a grudge against munk but the facts point to a sovietpaid operative but why munk sandecker asked he was an instrument specialist what possible threat could he have been to a spy i suspect that munk saw something he shouldnt have and had to be silenced nicholson said and thats only the half of it in a manner of speaking you see admiral there happen to be not one but two russian agents who have infiltrated your salvage operation i dont buy that were in the business of espionage admiral we find out these things who are they sandecker demanded nicholson shrugged helplessly im sorry thats all i can give you our sources reveal that they go under the code names of silver and gold but as to their true identities we have no idea sandeckers eyes were grim and if my people discover who they are i hope you will cooperate at least for the time being and order them to remain silent and take no action those two could sabotage the entire salvage operation were banking heavily on the assumption that their orders do not include destruction its madness pure madness sandecker murmured do you have any idea of what youre asking of me the president put the same question to me some months ago and my answer is still the same no i dont im aware that your efforts go beyond mere salvage but the president has not seen fit to make me privy to the real reason behind your show sandeckers teeth were clenched and if i should go along with you what then i will keep you posted as to any new developments and when the time comes i will give you the green light to take the soviet agents into custody the admiral sat silently for a few moments and when he finally spoke nicholson noted his deadly serious tone okay nicholson ill string along but god help you if there is a tragic accident or another murder down there the consequences will be more terrible than you can possibly imagine mel donner came through marie sheldons front door his suit splattered from a spring rain i guess this will teach me to carry an umbrella in the car he said taking out a handkerchief and brushing away the dampness marie closed the front door and stared up at him curiously any port in a storm is that it handsome i beg your pardon from the look of you marie said her voice soft and slurry you needed a roof until the rain let up and the fates kindly led you to mine donners eyes narrowed for a moment but only a moment then he smiled im sorry my name is mel donner im an old friend of danas is she at home i knew a strange man begging on my doorstep was too good to be true she smiled im marie sheldon sit down and make yourself comfortable while i call dana and get you a cup of coffee thank you the coffee sounds like a winner donner appraised maries backside as she swiveled toward the kitchen she wore a short white tennis skirt a sleeveless knit top and her feet were bare the taut swing of her hips flipped the skirt to and fro in a pert seductive sort of way she returned with a cup of coffee dana is lazy on weekends she seldom rolls out of the sack before ten ill go upstairs and speed things up while he waited donner studied the books on the shelves beside the fireplace it was a game he often practiced book titles seldom failed to unlock the door to their owners personality and tastes the selections ran the usual gamut for the single female there were several books of poetry the prophet the new york times cookbook and the usual sprinkling of gothics and best sellers but it was the arrangement that interested donner interwoven among physics of intercontinental laval flows and geology of underwater canyons he found explanation of sexual fantasies of the female and the story o he was just reaching for the latter when he heard the sound of feet coming down the stairs he turned as dana entered the room she came forward and embraced him mel how wonderful to see you you look great he said the months of strain and anguish had been erased she seemed more at ease and she smiled without tenseness hows the swinging bachelor she asked which line are you using on poor innocent girls this week the brain surgeon or the astronaut he patted his paunch ive retired the astronaut story until i can shed a few pounds actually because of the publicity you people are getting on the titanic i can do no wrong by telling the little lovelies crowded around the washington singles bars that im a deepsea diver why dont you simply tell the truth after all as one of the countrys leading physicists you have nothing to be ashamed of i know but somehow playing the real me takes the fun out of it besides women love a lover whos phony she nodded at his cup can i get you more coffee no thanks he smiled and then his expression became serious you know why im here i guessed im worried about gene so am i you could go back to him dana met mels eyes evenly you dont understand when we are together it only makes things worse hes lost without you she shook her head his job is his mistress i was only a whipping post for his frustrations like most wives im not geared to take the anguish that goes hand in hand with a husbands insensibility when hes overburdened with onthejob stress dont you see mel i had to leave gene before we destroyed each other dana turned and held her face in her hands then quickly composed herself if only he could quit and go back to teaching then things would be different i shouldnt be telling you this donner said but the project will be completed in another month if all goes according to plan then gene will have nothing to keep him in washington hell be free to return to the university but what about your contacts with the government finished we enlisted for a specific project and when its finished so are we then all of us take a bow and head back to whatever campus we originally came from he may not even want me i know gene donner said hes a onewoman man hell be waiting unless of course youre involved with another man she looked up surprised why do you say that i happened to be in websters restaurant last wednesday night oh god dana thought one of her few dates since leaving gene had come back to haunt her already it had been a foursome with marie and two biologists from the numa marine sciences laboratory a friendly comfortable evening that was all nothing had happened she stood up and glared down at donner you marie and yes even the president all expect me to go crawling back to gene like some damned old security blanket he cant sleep without but not one of you has even bothered to ask how i feel what emotions and frustrations do i face well to hell with all of you i am my own woman to do with my life as i please ill go back to gene if and when i damnwell feel like it and if i feel in the mood to go out with other men and get laid so be it she spun and left donner sitting there stunned and embarrassed up the stairs and into the bedroom where she threw herself on the bed she had mouthed nothing but mere words there would never be another man in her life but gene seagram and some day soon she was sure she would return to him but now the tears came until there were none left imbedded in one of the mirrored walls a phonograph record watched over by a female disc jockey thundered through four huge quad speakers the postagestamp dance floor was jammed and a thick haze of cigarette smoke filtered the brightly colored lights that exploded on the ceiling of the discotheque donner sat at the table alone idly watching the couples gyrate to the blaring music a petite blonde wandered up to him and suddenly stopped the rainmaker donner looked up he laughed and got to his feet miss sheldon marie she said pleasantly are you alone no im the third wheel with a married couple donners eyes followed her gesture but it was impossible to tell who she meant amid the jumbled bodies on the dance floor he pulled back a chair for her consider yourself escorted a cocktail waitress happened by and donner shouted an order above the din he turned to find marie sheldon studying him approvingly you know mr donner for a physicist youre not a badlooking man damn i had hoped to be a cia agent tonight she grinned dana told me about a few of your escapades leading poor innocent girls astray for shame dont believe all you hear actually im shy and introverted when it comes to women oh really scouts honor he lit her cigarette wheres dana tonight very sly of you you tried to zing one over on me not really i just its none of your prying business of course but dana is on a ship somewhere in the north atlantic ocean about now a vacation will do her good you do have a way of milking a poor girl for information marie said just for the record so you can inform your pal gene seagram shes not on holiday but playing den mother to a regiment of news correspondents who demanded to be on the scene when the titanic is raised next week i guess i asked for that good im always impressed by a man who admits the folly of his ways she tilted her eyes at him in a kind of mocking amusement now that thats settled why dont you propose to me donners brows knitted isnt the coy maiden the one whos supposed to say but sir i hardly know you she took his hand and stood up come on then may i ask where to your place she said with a mischievous grin my place events were clearly moving too fast for donner sure we have to make love dont we how else can two people who are engaged to be married get to know each other pitt slouched in his train seat and idly watched the devon countryside glide past the window the tracks curved along the coastline at dawlish in the channel he could see a small fleet of fishing trawlers heading out for the mornings catch soon a misting rain streaked the glass and blurred his view so he turned once more to the magazine on his lap and thumbed the pages without really seeing them if they had told him two days ago that hed take a temporary leave from the salvage operation hed have thought them stupid and if theyd suggested that hed travel to teignmouth devonshire population a small picturesque resort town on the southeast coast of england to interview a dying old man hed have thought them downright insane he had admiral james sandecker to thank for this pilgrimage and that is exactly what the admiral had called it when he had ordered pitt back to numa headquarters in washington a pilgrimage to the last surviving crew member of the titanic theres no use in arguing the matter any further sandecker said unequivocally youre going to teignmouth none of this adds up pitt was pacing the floor nervously his equilibrium struggling to forget the months of endless pitching and rolling of the capricorn you order me ashore during a crucial moment of the salvage and tell me i have two russian agents identities unknown who have carte blanche to go about murdering my crew under the personal protection of the cia and then in the same breath you calmly order me to england to take down the deathbed testimony of some ancient limey that ancient limey happens to be the only member of the titanics crew who hasnt been buried but what of the salvage operation pitt persisted the computers indicate the titanics hull might break loose from the bottom any time after the next seventytwo hours relax dirk you should be back on the decks of the capricorn by tomorrow evening plenty of time before the main event meanwhile rudi gunn can handle any problems that come up during your absence you dont offer me much choice pitt gestured in defeat sandecker smiled benevolently i know what youre thinking that youre indispensable well ive got news for you thats the best salvage crew in the world out there i feel confident that somehow theyll struggle through the next thirtysix hours without you pitt smiled but there was no humor in his face when do i leave there is a lear jet waiting at the numa hangar at dulles it will take you to exeter you can catch a train from there for teignmouth afterward shall i report to you back here in washington no you can report to me aboard the capricorn pitt looked up the capricorn certainly just because youre relaxing in the english countryside you dont expect me to miss out on seeing the titanics regenesis in case she decides to come up ahead of schedule do you sandecker grinned satanically he could afford that as it was all he could do to keep from laughing at the aggrieved and crestfallen expression on pitts face pitt climbed into a cab at the railroad station and rode along a narrow road beside the river estuary to a small cottage overlooking the sea he paid the cab driver went through a vinecovered gate and up a walk bordered by rose bushes his knock was answered by a girl with absorbing violet eyes framed by neatly brushed red hair and a soft voice that was touched by a scots accent good morning sir good morning he said with a slight nod my name is dirk pitt and oh yes admiral sandeckers cable said you were coming please come in the commodore is expecting you she was dressed in a neatly pressed white blouse and a green wool sweater and matching skirt he followed her into the living room of the cottage it was cozy and comfortable a fire was burning brightly in the fireplace and if pitt had not known that the owner was a retired mariner he could have easily guessed it by the decor ships models filled every available shelf while framed prints of famous sailing vessels graced all four walls a great brass telescope was mounted in front of the window facing the channel and a ships wheel its wood gleaming from hours of handwaxed care stood in one corner of the room as if awaiting a momentary turn from some longforgotten helmsman you look like youve had a very uncomfortable night the girl said would you like some breakfast courtesy urges me to decline but my stomach rumbles for me to accept americans are famous for hearty appetites i would have been disappointed if you had shattered the myth then ill do my best to uphold yankee tradition miss please forgive me im sandra ross the commodores greatgranddaughter you look after him i take it when i can im a flight attendant with bristol airlines a village lady sees to him when i have a flight she motioned him down a hallway while youre waiting for a bit to eat youd best talk to grandfather hes very very old but hes dying to hearhes anxious to hear all about your efforts to raise the titanic she knocked lightly on a door and opened it a crack commodore mr pitt is here to see you well get him in here a voice rasped back before i founder on the reef she stood aside and pitt entered the bedroom commodore sir john l bigalow kbe rd rnr retired sat propped up in a bunklike bed and studied pitt through deep blue eyes eyes that had the dreamlike quality of another age the few strands of hair on his head were pure white as was his beard and his face showed the ruddy weathered look of a seafaring man he wore a tattered turtleneck sweater over what looked to be a dickensstyle nightshirt he held out a leathery hand that was as steady as a rock pitt took it and marveled at the firm grip this is indeed an honor commodore i have often read of your heroic escape from the titanic so much rot he grumbled i was torpedoed and cast adrift in both world wars and all anybody ever asks me about is the night of the titanic he motioned to a chair dont stand there like a beardless lad on his first trip to sea sit down sit down pitt did as he was told now tell me about the ship what does she look like after all these years i was a young man when i served on her but i still remember her every deck pitt reached into the breast pocket of his coat and handed bigalow an envelope of photographs perhaps these can give you some idea of her present condition they were taken by one of our submersibles just a few weeks ago commodore bigalow slipped on a pair of reading glasses and studied the pictures several minutes ticked off a ships clock beside the bed while the old mariner became lost in the memories of another time then he looked up wistfully she was in a class all by herself she was i know i sailed them all the olympic aquitania queen mary sure they were elaborate and modern for their time but they couldnt touch the care and craftsmanship that went into the titanics furnishings her wonderful paneling and her marvelous staterooms aye she still casts a heavy spell she does she grows ever more bewitching with the years pitt agreed here here bigalow said as he pointed excitedly to a photo by the port ventilator on the roof over the officers quarters this is where i was standing when she sank beneath my feet and i was washed into the sea the long decades seemed to melt away from his face oh but the sea was cold that night four degrees below freezing it was for the next ten minutes he talked of swimming in the icy water miraculously finding a rope that led to an overturned lifeboat the awful mass of struggling people the pitiful cries that pierced the night air and then slowly died out the long hours spent clutching the keel of the boat huddled against the cold with thirty other men the excitement when the cunard liner carpathia hove into view and made the rescue finally he sighed and peered over the tops of his glasses at pitt am i boring you mr pitt not in the least pitt answered listening to someone who actually lived the event seems almost like living it myself then im going to give you another story to try on for size bigalow said until now i never told a soul about my last minutes before the ship went down i never mentioned a word in any of my interrogations about the sinking not to the united states senate inquiry or to the british court of inquiry nor did i ever breathe a syllable to the newspaper reporters or writers who were forever researching books on the tragedy you sir are the first and will be the last to hear it from my lips three hours later pitt was on the train back to exeter neither tired nor worn he did feel a kind of excitement the titanic along with the strange enigma locked within the vault of cargo hold no g deck beckoned to him now more than ever southby he wondered how did southby fit in the picture for perhaps the fiftieth time he looked down at the package that commodore bigalow had given him and he was not sorry that he had come to teignmouth dr ryan prescott chief of the numa hurricane center in tampa florida had had every intention of getting home on time for once and spending a quiet evening with his wife playing cribbage but at ten minutes before midnight he was still at his desk staring tiredly at the satellite photos spread before him just when we think weve learned all there is to know about storms he said querulously one pops out of nowhere and breaks the mold a hurricane in the middle of may his female assistant replied between yawns its one for the record book all right but why the hurricane season normally extends from july to september what caused this one to materialize two months early beats me the woman answered where do you figure our pariah is headed too early to predict with any certainty prescott said her birth followed the normal patterns true enough vast lowpressure area fed by moist air swirling counterclockwise due to the earths rotation but here the difference ends it usually takes days sometimes weeks for a storm fourhundred miles wide to build up this baby pulled off the trick in less than eighteen hours prescott sighed rose from his desk and walked to a large wall chart he consulted a pad covered with scribbles noting the known position atmospheric conditions and speed then he began drawing a predicted track westerly from a point a hundred and fifty miles northeast of bermuda a track that gradually curved northward toward newfoundland until she gives us a hint of her future course thats the best i can do he paused as if waiting for confirmation when none came he asked is that how you see it still receiving no reply he turned to repeat the question but the words never came his assistant had fallen asleep her head cradled in her arms upon the desk gently he shook her shoulder until the green eyes fluttered open theres nothing more we can do here he said softly lets go home and get some sleep he glanced warily back at the wall chart chances are its a thousandtoone fluke that will dissipate before morning and lapse into a minor localized storm he spoke with some authority but there was no conviction in his tone what he did not notice was that the line on the chart representing his predicted course for the hurricane traveled precisely over north by west commander rudi gunn stood on the bridge of the capricorn and watched a tiny blue speck far to the west materialize out of the diamondclear sky for a few minutes it seemed to hang there neither changing shape nor growing larger a dark blue dot suspended above the horizon and then almost all at once it enlarged and took on the shape of a helicopter he made his way to the landing pad aft of the superstructure and stood waiting as the craft approached and hovered above the ship thirty seconds later the skids kissed the flight pad the whine of the turbines died away and the blades slowly idled to a stop gunn moved in closer as the righthand door opened and pitt stepped out good trip gunn asked interesting pitt replied pitt read the strain in gunns face the lines around the little mans eyes were set tight and his face was grim you look like a kid who just had his christmas presents stolen rudi whats the problem the uranus oil sub the deep fathom shes trapped on the wreck pitt was silent for a moment then he asked simply admiral sandecker he set up his headquarters on the bomberger since it was the deep fathoms tender he thought it would be better to conduct the rescue mission from there until you returned you say was as if the sub is as good as lost it doesnt look good come topside and ill fill you in on the details there was an air of tension and despair in the capricorns operations room the usually gregarious giordino simply nodded at pitts arrival totally bypassing any word of greeting ben drummer was on the microphone talking to the crew of the deep fathom encouraging them with a show of forced cheer and optimism that was betrayed by the dread in his eyes rick spencer the salvage operations equipment engineer was gazing in mute concentration at the tv monitors the other men in the room went about their business quietly their faces pensive gunn began explaining the situation two hours before she was to ascend and change crews the deep fathom manned by engineers joe kiel tom chavez and sam merker merker was with you on the lorelei current expedition pitt interrupted so was munk gunn nodded solemnly it would seem were a cursed crew go on they were in the midst of installing a pressure bleed valve on the starboard side of the titanics forecastle deck bulkheads when their stern brushed against a forward cargo crane the corroded mounts broke loose and the derrick section fell across the subs buoyancy tanks rupturing them more than two tons of water poured through the opening and pinned her hull to the wreck how long ago did it happen pitt asked about three and a half hours ago then why all the gloom you people act as if there wasnt a prayer the deep fathom carries enough oxygen in her reserve system to support a crew of three for over a week plenty of time for sappho i and ii to seal the air tanks and pump clear the water its not all that simple gunn said six hours is all weve got how do you figure a sixhour margin i left the worst part for last gunn stared bleakly at pitt the impact from the falling crane cracked a welded scam on the deep fathoms hull its only a tiny pinhole but the tremendous pressure at that depth is forcing the sea into the cabin at the rate of four gallons a minute its a miracle the seam hasnt burst collapsing the hull and crushing those guys to jelly he tilted his head toward the clock over the computer panel six hours is all theyve got before the water fills the cabin and they drown and theres not a damned thing we can do about it why not plug the leak from the outside with wetsteel easier said than done we cant get at it the section of the hulls seam that contains the leak is jammed against the titanics forecastle bulkhead the admiral sent down the other three submersibles in the hope that their combined power could move the deep fathom just enough to reach and repair the damage it was nogo pitt sat down in a chair picked up a pencil and began making notations on a pad the sea slug is equipped with cutting equipment if she could attack the derrick negative gunn shook his head in frustration during the tugging operation the sea slug broke her manipulator arm shes back on the modocs deck now and the navy boys say its impossible to repair the arm in time gunn slammed his fist down on the chart table our last hope was the winch on the bomberger if it was possible to attach a cable to the derrick we might have pulled it free of the sub end of rescue pitt said the sea slug is the only submersible weve got thats equipped with a heavyduty manipulator arm and without it there is no way of making a hookup with the cable gunn rubbed his eyes wearily after thousands of manhours poured into the planning and construction of every backup safety system conceivable and the calculating of concise emergency procedures for every predictable contingency the unforeseen rose up and smacked us below the belt with a beyondtheboundsofprobability milliontoone accident the computers didnt count on computers are only as good as the data fed into them pitt said he moved over to the radio and took the microphone from drummers hand deep fathom this is pitt over nice to hear your cheery voice again merker came over the speaker as calmly as if he were on the telephone lying at home in bed why dont you drop down and make up a fourth for bridge not my game pitt answered matteroffactly how much time left before the water reaches your batteries at the rate shes rising approximately another fifteen to twenty minutes pitt turned to gunn and said what needed no saying when their batteries go theyll be out of communication gunn nodded the sappho ii is standing by to keep them company thats about all we can do pitt pressed the mike button again merker how about your lifesupport system what lifesupport system that crapped out half an hour ago were existing on bad breath ill send you down a case of certs better make it fast chavez has a malignant case of halitosis then a trace of doubt surfaced in merkers tone if the worst happens and we dont see you guys again at least well be surrounded by good company down here merkers abrupt reference to the titanics dead left every man in the operations room a shade paler every man that is except pitt he touched the transmit button just see to it you leave a clean ship we may want to use it again pitt out it was interesting to see the reaction to pitts seemingly callous remark giordino gunn spencer and the others just stared at him only drummer displayed an expression of anger pitt touched curly the radio operator on the shoulder patch me into the admiral on the bomberger but use a different frequency curly looked up you dont want those guys on the deep fathom to hear what they dont know wont hurt them said pitt coldly now hurry it up moments later sandeckers voice boomed over the speaker capricorn this is admiral sandecker over pitt here admiral sandecker wasted no time on niceties youre aware of what were up against gunn has briefed me pitt replied then you know we have exhausted every avenue no matter how you slice it time is the enemy if we could stall the inevitable for another ten hours wed have a fighting chance of saving them theres one other way pitt said the odds are high but mathematically its possible im open to suggestions pitt hesitated to begin with we forget the deep fathom for the moment and turn our energies in another direction drummer came close to him what are you saying pitt what goes on here forget the deep fathom he shouted through twitching lips are you mad pitt smiled a disarming smile the last desperate roll of the dice drummer you people failed and failed miserably you may be gods gift to the world of marine salvage but as a rescue force you come off like a bunch of amateurs bad luck compounded your mistakes and now you sit around whining that all is lost well all is not lost gentlemen were going to change the rules of the game and put the deep fathom on the surface before the sixhour deadline which if my watch serves me is now down to five hours and fortythree minutes giordino looked at pitt do you really think it can be done i really think it can be done the structural engineers and the marine scientists huddled around in small circles mumbling to themselves as they frantically shoved their slide rules back and forth every so often one of them would break away and walk over to the computers and check the readout sheets admiral sandecker who had just arrived from the bomberger sat behind a desk gripping a mug of coffee and shaking his head this will never be written into the textbooks on salvage he murmured blowing a derelict off the bottom with explosives god its insane what other choice do we have pitt said if we can kick the titanic out of the mud the deep fathom will be carried up with her the whole idea is crazy gunn muttered the concussion will only expand the cracked seam in the submersibles hull and cause instant implosion maybe maybe not pitt said but even if that occurs its probably best that merker kiel and chavez die instantly from the seas crush than suffer the prolonged agony of slow suffocation and what about the titanic gunn persisted we could blow everything weve worked for all these months all over the abyssal landscape score that as a calculated risk pitt said the titanics construction is of a greater strength than most ships afloat today her beams girders bulkheads and decks are as sound as the night she sank the old girl can take whatever we dish out make no mistake about it do you honestly think it will work sandecker asked i do i could order you not to do this thing you know that i know that pitt replied im banking on you to keep me in the ball game until the final inning sandecker rubbed his hand across his eyes then shook his head slowly as if to clear it finally he said okay dirk its your baby pitt nodded and turned away there were just five hours and ten minutes to go two and a half miles below the three men in the deep fathom cold and alone in a remote uncharitable environment watched the water creep up the cabin walls inch by inch until it flooded the main circuitry and shorted out the instruments throwing the interior of the cabin into blackness then they began to feel the sting of the thirtyfourdegree water in earnest as it swirled around their legs standing there shivering under the torment of certain death they still nurtured the spark to survive as soon as we get topside kiel murmured im going to take a day off and i dont care who knows it come again chavez said in the darkness they can fire me if they want to but im sleeping in tomorrow chavez groped for and found kiels arm gripping it roughly what are you babbling about take it easy merker said with the lifesupport system gone the carbondioxide buildup is getting to him im beginning to feel a bit giddy myself foul air on top of everything else chavez grumbled if we dont drown we get crushed when the hull bursts and if we dont get mashed like eggshells we suffocate on our own air our future looks none too bright you left out exposure merker added sardonically if we dont climb above this freezing water we wont get a chance at the other three kiel said nothing but limply allowed chavez to shove him into the uppermost sleeping bunk then chavez followed and sat on the edge his feet dangling over the side merker struggled through the crotchdeep water to the forward viewport and looked out he could see only the haloed outline of the sappho ii through the blinding glare of her lights even though the other craft hovered only ten feet away there was nothing she could do for the stricken deep fathom while they were both surrounded by the relentless pressure of the hostile deep as long as she is still there merker thought they havent written us off he took no small consolation in the fact that they were not alone it wasnt much to lean on but it was all they had on board the supply ship alhambra camera crews from the three major networks swept up in the swirling tide of expectation feverishly struggled to get their equipment into action along every available foot of starboarddeck railing wireservice reporters peered through binoculars in hypnotic concentration at the capricorn floating two miles away while photographers aimed their telephoto lenses on the surface of the water between the ships trapped in one corner of a makeshift pressroom dana seagram pulled a foulweather jacket tightly around her shoulders and gamely stood up to the dozen news people armed with tape recorders who were pushing microphones toward her face as though they were lollipops is it true ms seagram that attempting to raise the titanic three days ahead of schedule is in reality a lastditch attempt to save the lives of the men trapped below it is only one of several solutions dana replied are we to understand that all other attempts have failed there have been complications dana admitted inside one of the jackets pockets dana nervously twisted a handkerchief until her fingers turned sore the long months of giveandtake with the men and women of the press were beginning to tell since the loss of communications with the deep fathom how can you know for certain whether the crew is still alive computer data assure us that their situation will not turn critical for another four hours and forty minutes how does numa intend to bring up the titanic if the electrolyte chemical is not fully injected into the silt around the hull i cant answer that dana said mr pitts last message prom the capricorn only stated that they were going to raise the wreck in the next few hours he did not offer details regarding the method what if its too late what if kiel chavez and merker are already dead danas expression went rigid they are not dead she said with eyes blazing and the first one of you who reports such a cruel and inhuman rumor before its a proven fact will get their ass kicked off this ship credentials and nielsen ratings be damned do you understand the reporters stood there a moment in mute surprise at danas sudden display of anger and then slowly and silently they began to lower the microphones and melt toward the deck outside rick spencer unrolled a large piece of paper on the chart table and anchored it down with several halfempty coffee mugs it was an overhead drawing that depicted the titanic and her position in relation to the sea floor he began pointing a pencil at various spots about the hulk that were marked with tiny crosses heres the way it shapes up he explained according to the computer data we set eighty charges each containing thirty pounds of explosives at these key points in the sediment along the titanics hull sandecker leaned over the drawing his eyes scanning the crosses i see that youve staggered them in three rows on each side thats right sir spencer said the outside rows are set sixty yards away the middle forty and the inner rows are just twenty yards from the ships plates well detonate the starboard outer row first then eight seconds later we fire the port outer row another eight seconds and we repeat the procedure with the middle rows and so on kind of like rocking a car back and forth thats stuck in the mud giordino volunteered spencer nodded you might say thats a fair comparison why not jolt her out of the silt with one big bang giordino asked its possible a sudden shock might do it but the geologists are in favor of separate overlapping shock waves its vibration were after have we the explosives pitt asked the bomberger carries nearly a ton for seismic research purposes spencer replied the modoc has four hundred pounds in her stores for underwater salvage blasting will it do the trick border line spencer admitted another three hundred pounds would have given us a more acceptable margin for success we could have it flown from the mainland by jet and airdropped sandecker suggested pitt shook his head by the time the explosives arrived and were loaded in a sub and planted on the sea floor it would be two hours too late then wed best get on with it sandecker said brusquely we have a tight deadline to meet he turned to gunn how soon can the explosives be set in place four hours gunn said unhesitatingly sandeckers eyes narrowed thats cutting it pretty thin that only leaves a leeway of fourteen minutes well make it gunn said however there is one condition what is it sandecker snapped impatiently it will take every operational submersible weve got that means pulling the sappho ii from its station beside the deep fathom pitt said those poor bastards down there will think were deserting them theres no other way gunn said helplessly theres simply no other way merker had lost all track of time he stared at the luminous dial on his watch but his eyes couldnt focus on the glowing numbers how long since the derrick had fallen across their buoyancy tanks he wondered five hours ten was it yesterday his mind was sluggish and confused he could only sit there without moving a muscle breathing shallowly and slowly each breath seemingly taking a lifetime gradually he became aware of a movement he reached out and touched kiel and chavez in the darkness but they made no sound no response they had fallen into a lethargic stupor then he became aware of it again a minute but perceptible something that was not where it was supposed to be his mind turned over as though it were immersed in syrup but at last he had it except for the relentless rise of the water there was no change no sign of physical motion inside the flooding cabin it was the angle of the sappho iis light beam through the forward viewports that had dimmed he dropped off the bunk into the waterit came up to his chest nowand almost as if in a nightmare he struggled toward the upper front ports and peered into the depths outside suddenly his numbed senses were gripped by a fear such as he had never known before his eyes widened and glazed his hands clenched in futility and despair oh godl he cried aloud theyre leaving us theyve given us up sandecker twisted the huge cigar he had just lit and continued to pace the deck the radio operator raised his hand and the admiral turned in midstep and came up behind him the sappho i reporting sir curly said shes finished positioning her charges tell her to head topside as fast as her buoyancy tanks will take her the higher she goes the less pressure on her hull when the explosives detonate the admiral swung and faced pitt who was keeping a watchful eye on the four monitors whose cameras and floodlights were mounted in strategic spots around the titanics superstructure how does it look so far so good pitt answered if the wetsteel pressure seals hold up against the concussions well stand a fighting chance sandecker stared at the color images and his brow furrowed as he perceived great streams of bubbles issuing from the liners hulk shes losing a lot of air he said excess pressure escaping through the bleeder valves pitt said tonelessly we switched from the electrolyte pumps back to the compressors in order to cram as much extra air as we can into the upper compartments he paused to finetune a picture and then continued the capricorns compressors put out ten thousand cubic feet of air an hour so it didnt take long to raise the pressure inside the hull another ten pounds per inch just enough to pop the bleeder valves drummer ambled over from the computers and checked off a series of notations on a clipboard as near as we can figure ninety per cent of the ships compartments are unwatered he said the main problem as i see it is that we have more lift than the computers say is necessary if and when the suction gives way shell come up like a kite the sea slug just dropped her last charge curly reported ask her to make a swing by the deep fathom before she starts for the surface pitt said and see if she can make visual contact with merker and his crew eleven minutes to go giordino announced what in hell is keeping the sappho ii sandecker asked no one in particular pitt looked across the room to spencer are the charges ready to fire spencer nodded each row is tuned to a different transmitter frequency all we have to do is turn a dial and theyll go off in their proper sequence what do you bet we see first the bow or the stern theres no contest the bow is buried twenty feet deeper in the sediment than the rudder im counting on the stern breaking free and then using its buoyant leverage to pull up the rest of the keel she should rise on very nearly the same angle she sankproviding shes agreeable and rises at all last charge secured droned curly sappho ii is making her getaway anything from the sea slug she reports no visual contact with deep fathoms crew okay tell her to hightail it toward the surface pitt said we fire the first row of charges in nine minutes theyre dead drummer suddenly cried his voice breaking were too late theyre all dead pitt took two steps and gripped drummer by the shoulders cut the hysterics the last thing we need is a premature eulogy drummer dropped his shoulders his face ashen and frozen in a stonelike expression of dread then he silently nodded and walked unsteadily back to the computer console the water must only be a couple of feet from the subs cabin ceiling by now giordino said it came out about half an octave higher than his normal tone if pessimism sold by the pound you guys would all be millionaires pitt said dryly the sappho i has reached the safety zone at six thousand feet this from the sonar operator one down two to go murmured sandecker there was nothing left to do now but wait for the other submersibles to rise above the danger level of the approaching concussion waves eight minutes passed eight interminable minutes that saw the sweat begin to ooze on two dozen foreheads sappho ii and sea slug now approaching safety zone sea and weather pitt demanded fourfoot swells clear skies wind out of the northeast at five knots answered farquar the weatherman you couldnt ask for better conditions for several moments no one spoke then pitt said well gentlemen the time has come his voice was level and relaxed and no trace of apprehension showed in his tone or manner okay spencer count it down spencer began repeating the announcements with clocklike regularity thirty seconds fifteen seconds five seconds signal transmitting mark then he unhesitatingly went right into the next firing order eight seconds four seconds signal transmitting mark everyone clustered around the tv monitors and the sonar operator their only contacts now with the bottom the first explosion barely caused a tremor through the decks of the capricorn and the volume of sound came to their ears like that of faraway thunder the cloud of anxiety could be slashed with a sword every single eye was trained straight ahead on the monitors on the quivering lines that distorted the images when the charges went off tense strained numb with the expectant look of men who feared the worst but hoped for the best they stood there immobile as spencer droned on with his countdowns the shudders from the deck became more pronounced as shock wave followed shock wave and broke on the surface of the ocean then abruptly the monitors all flickered in a kaleidoscope of fused light and went black damn sandecker muttered weve lost picture contact the concussions must have jolted loose the main relay connector gunn surmised their attention quickly turned to the sonar scope but few of them could see it the operator had drawn himself up so close to the glass that his head obscured it finally spencer straightened up he sighed deeply to himself pulled a handkerchief from his hip pocket and rubbed his face and neck thats all she wrote he said hoarsely there isnt any more still stationary said the sonar operator the big t is still stationary go baby giordino pleaded get your big ass up oh god dear god drummer mumbled the suction is still holding her to the bottom come on damn you sandecker joined in lift lift if it was humanly possible for the mind to will tons of steel to release its hold on the grave it had occupied for seventysix long years and return to the sunlight the men crowded around the sonarscope would have surely made it so but there was to be no psychokinetic phenomenon this day the titanic stayed stubbornly clutched to the sea floor a dirty rotten break farquar said drummer held his hands over his face turned away and stumbled from the room woodson on the sappho ii requests permission to descend for a looksee said curly pitt shrugged permission granted slowly wearily admiral sandecker sank into a chair what price failure he said the bitter taste of hopelessness flooded the room swept by the grim tide of total defeat what now giordino asked staring vacantly at the deck what we came here to do answered pitt tiredly we go on with the salvage operation tomorrow well begin again to shes moved no one reacted immediately she moved the sonar operator repeated his voice had a quiver to it are you sure sandecker whispered stake my life on it spencer was too stunned to speak he could only stare at the sonarscope with an expression of abject incredulity then his lips began working the aftershocks he said the aftershocks caused a delayed reaction rising the sonar operator shouted banging his fist on the arm of his chair that gorgeous old bucket of bolts has broken free shes coming up at first everybody was too dumbstruck to move the moment they had prayed for had spent eight tortuous months struggling for had sneaked up behind them and somehow they couldnt accept it as actually happening then the electrifying news began to sink in and they all began shouting at the same time like a crowd of mission control space engineers during a rocket liftoff go baby go sandecker shouted as joyfully as a schoolboy move you mother giordino yelled move move keep coming you big beautiful rusty old floating palace you spencer murmured suddenly pitt rushed across to the radio and clutched curlys shoulder in a viselike grip quick contact woodson on the sappho ii tell him the titanic is on her way up and to get the hell out of the way before hes run over still on a surface course the sonar operator said speed of ascent accelerating we havent weathered the storm yet pitt said a hundred and one things can still go wrong before she breaks surface if only yeah giordino cut in like if only the wetsteel maintains its bond or if only the bleeder valves can keep up with the sudden drop in water pressure or if the hull doesnt take it in its mind to go snap crackle and pop if its a mighty big word still coming and coming fast the sonar operator said staring at his scope six hundred feet in the last minute pitt swung to giordino al find doc bailey and the pilot of the helicopter and get in the air like a mad bull was on your ass then as soon as the titanic stabilizes herself drop down on her forecastle deck i dont care how you do itrope ladder winch and bucket chaircrashland the copter if you have to but you and the good doctor drop down fast and pop the deep fathoms hatch cover and lift those men out of that hellhole were halfway there giordino grinned he was already out the door before pitt could issue his next order to spencer rick stand by to hoist the portable diesel pumps on board the derelict the sooner we can get ahead of any leaks the better well need cutting torches to get inside her spencer said his eyes wide with excitement then see to it pitt turned back to the sonar panel rate of ascent eight hundred and fifty feet a minute the sonar operator called back too fast pitt said its what we didnt want sandecker muttered through his cigar her interior compartments are overfilled with air and shes soaring to the surface out of control and if weve miscalculated the amount of ballast water left in her lower holds she could rocket twothirds her length out of the water and capsize pitt added sandecker looked him in the eye and that would spell finish to the deep fathoms crew then without another word the admiral turned and led the exodus from the operations room to the deck outside where everyone began scanning the restless swells in heartpounding anticipation only pitt hung back what depth is she this to the sonar operator passing the eightthousandfoot mark woodson reporting in curly intoned he says the big t just went by the sappho ii like a greased pig acknowledge and tell him to surface relay the same message to the sea slug and sappho i there was nothing left to do here so he stepped out the door and up the ladder to the port bridge wing where he joined gunn and sandecker gunn picked up the bridge phone sonar this is the bridge sonar can you give me an approximate fix on where shell appear she should break water about six hundred yards off the port quarter time there was a pause time gunn repeated is now soon enough for you commander at that very moment a huge wave of bubbles spread across the sea and the fantail of the titanic burst up into the afternoon sun like a gigantic whale for a few seconds it seemed as though there was no stopping her soaring flight from the depthsher stern kept crowding into the sky until she came free of the water up to the boiler casing where her no funnel had once stood it was a staggering sight the inside air bleeding down sent great torrents of spray shooting through the pressurerelief valves shrouding the great ship in bit blowing rainbowed clouds of vapor she hung poised for several moments clawing at the crystal blue heavens and then slowly at first began to settle until her keel smacked the sea with a tremendous splash that sent a tenfoot wave surging toward the surrounding fleet of ships she heeled down as if she had no intention of recovering a thousand onlookers held their breath as she careened ever farther onto her starboard beam ends thirty forty fortyfive fifty degrees and there she hung for what seemed like a dreadful eternity everyone was halfexpecting her to continue the roll over onto her superstructure but then with agonizing sluggishness the titanic slowly began the struggle to right herself gradually foot by foot until her hull reached a starboard list of twelve degrees and there she stayed nobody could speak they all just stood there too stunned too mesmerized by what they had just seen to do anything but breathe sandeckers weathered face looked ghostly pale even in the bright sun pitt was the first to find his voice shes up he managed in a barely audible whisper shes up gunn acknowledged softly then the spell was broken by the pulsing blades of the capricorns helicopter as it headed into the wind and angled over the debrisladen forecastle of the resurrected ship the pilot held the craft on a level position a few feet above the deck and almost instantly two tiny specks could be seen dropping out of a side door giordino scrambled up the access ladder and found himself staring at the hatch cover of the deep fathom thank god for small miracles the hull was still sound cautiously he maneuvered his body on top of the rounded slippery deck and tried the handwheel the spokes felt like ice but he gripped firm and gave a heavy twist the handwheel refused to cooperate stop dawdling and open the damned thing dr bailey boomed behind him every second counts giordino took a deep breath and heaved with every ounce the muscles of his oxlike body could give it moved an inch he tried again and this time forced half a turn and then finally it began spinning easily as the air inside the sub hissed out and the pressure against the seal relaxed when the handwheel halted at the end of its threads giordino swung the hatch open and peered into the darkness below a stale rancid smell rose up and attacked his nostrils his heart sank when after his eyes became accustomed to the darkness inside he saw the water sloshing only eighteen inches from the upper bulkhead dr bailey pushed past and lowered his immense hulk through the hatch and down the interior ladder the icy water stung his skin he pushed off the rungs and dogpaddled toward the after part of the submersible until hip hand touched something soft in the dim light it was a leg following it over the knee he felt his way toward the torso his hand came out of the water at shoulder level and he touched a face bailey moved closer until his nose was a bare inch from the face in the darkness he tried to feel for a pulse but his fingers were too numb from the cold water and he detected nothing that indicated life or death then suddenly the eyes fluttered open the lips trembled and a voice whispered go away i told you im not working today bridge curlys voice scratched through the speaker this is the bridge answered gunn ready to patch in the helicopter go ahead there was a pause and then a strange voice cracked onto the bridge capricorn this is lieutenant sturgis this is commander gunn lieutenant i have you loud and clear over dr bailey has entered the deep fathom please stand by the brief respite gave everyone a chance to study the titanic she looked uncompromisingly utilitarian and downright naked without her towering funnels and masts the steel plates of her sides were blotched and stained with rust but the black and white paint of her hull and superstructure still shone through she looked a mess like a hideous old prostitute who dwelt in dreams of better days and longlost beauty the portholes and windows were covered with the unsightly gray of the wetsteel and her onceimmaculate teak decks were rotted and cluttered with miles of corroded cable the empty lifeboat davits seemed to reach out in wraithlike pleading for a return of their longlost contents the overall effect of the ocean liners presence came across the water like an eerie subject in a surrealistic painting and yet there was an inexplicable serenity about her that could not be described capricorn this is sturgis over gunn here come in mr giordino has just given me three fingers and a thumbsup sign merker kiel and chavez are still alive a strange quiet followed then pitt walked over to the emergency equipment panel and pressed the siren button the earsplitting sound whooped across the water then the modocs whistle blared in reply and pitt saw the normally reserved sandecker laugh and throw his cap in the air the monterey park joined in and the alhambra and finally the bomberger until the sea around the titanic was one huge cacophony of sirens and whistles not to be outdone the juneau moved up and punctuated the mad din with a thunderous salute from her eightinch gun mount it was a moment that none of those present would ever live again for the first time in all the years he could remember pitt felt the trickle of warm tears on his cheeks the lateafternoon sun was just touching the tops of the trees as gene seagram sat slouched on a bench in east potomac park and contemplated the colt revolver in his lap serial number he thought youre about to serve the purpose you were manufactured for almost lovingly he ran his fingers over the barrel the cylinder and the grips suicide it seemed the ideal solution to end his flight into black depression he marveled that he hadnt thought of it before no more uncontrollable crying in the middle of the night no more sensations of worthlessness or the gnawing inside his guts that his life had been a transparent sham his mind envisioned the past few months as reflected in the cracked and distorted mirror of acute despair the two things he had cherished most were his wife and the sicilian project now dana was gone his marriage a shambles and the president of the united states had taken what seemed to seagram to be a needless risk in leaking his precious project to the sworn enemy of democracy sandecker had revealed to him the presence of the two soviet agents on the titanics salvage fleet and the fact that the cia had warned the admiral not to interfere with their espionage activities only served to drive what seemed to seagram another nail into the coffin of the sicilian project already one of numas engineers had been murdered and just this morning the daily report from sandeckers staff to meta section told of the trapped submersible and the apparent hopelessness of rescuing its crew it had to be sabotage there could be no doubt of it the mismatched pieces of the puzzle were forced into unfitting slots by seagrams confused brain the sicilian project was dead and he now made up his mind to die with it he was in the act of releasing the guns safety catch when a shadow fell across him and a voice spoke in a friendly tone its much too nice a day to rip off your life dont you think officer peter jones had been walking his beat along the path beside ohio drive when he noticed the man on the park bench at first glance jones thought seagram was simply a winesodden derelict soaking up the sun he considered running him in but dismissed it as a waste of time a booked bum would be back on the streets inside twentyfour hours jones figured it was hardly worth the effort of filling out the endless reports but then something about the man didnt fit the stereotyped lost soul jones moved casually inconspicuously around a large leafing elm tree and doubled back slightly to the side of the bench on closer inspection his suspicions were confirmed true the reddened unseeing eyes and the vacant look of the alcoholic were there as was the listless uncaring droop of the shoulders but so were small bits and pieces that didnt belong the shoes were shined the suit expensive and pressed the face neatly shaven and the fingernails trimmed and then there was the gun seagram slowly looked up into the face of a black police officer instead of meeting a determined look of wariness he found himself gazing into an expression of genuine compassion arent you jumping to conclusions seagram said man if i ever saw a classic case of suicidal depression youre it jones made a sitting gesture may i share your bench its city property seagram said indifferently jones carefully sat down an arms length from seagram and languidly stretched out his legs and leaned against the backrest keeping his hands in plain sight and away from his holstered service revolver now me ld pick november he said softly april is when the flowers pop and the trees go green but november thats when the weather turns nasty the winds chill you to the bone and the skies are always cloudy and dreary yeah thats the month id pick all right to do away with myself seagram clutched the colt tighter eyeing jones in apprehension waiting for him to make his move i take it you consider yourself something of an expert on suicide not really jones said in fact youre the first one i ever got to watch in the act most of the time i come on the scene long after the main event now take drownings theyre the worst bodies all bloated up and black eyeballs mush in their sockets after the fish have nibbled at them then theres the jumpers i saw a fella one time who had leaped off a thirtystory building lit on his feet his shin bones came out his shoulders i dont need this seagram snarled i dont need a nigger cop feeding me horror stories anger flickered in joness eyes for an instant and then quickly passed sticks and stones he said he took out a handkerchief and leisurely wiped the sweatband of his cap tell me mister ah seagram you might as well know it wont make any difference later tell me mr seagram how do you intend on doing it a bullet in the temple the forehead or in the mouth what does it matter the results are the same not necessarily jones said conversationally i dont recommend the temple or forehead at least not with a smallcaliber gun lets see what have you got there yeah looks like a thirtyeight it might do a messy job okay but i doubt if it would kill you proper i knew one guy who fired a fortyfive into his temple scrambled his brains and shoved out his left eye but he didnt die lived for years like a turnip cant you picture him lying there his bowels running all over the sheets and him begging to be put out of his misery yeah if i was you id stick the barrel in my mouth and blow off the back of the head thats the safest bet if you dont shut up seagram snapped pointing the colt at jones ill kill you too kill me jones said you havent got the balls youre not a killer seagram its written all over you every man is capable of committing murder i agree murder is no big deal anybody can do it but only a psychopath ignores the consequences now youre beginning to sound like a philosopher us dumb nigger cops oftentimes like to fool white people with our smarts routine i apologize for my poor choice of words jones shrugged you think you got problems mr seagram id love to have your problems look at yourself youre white obviously a man of means you probably have a family and a nice position in life howd you like to trade places with me change the color of your skin be a black cop with six kids and a ninetyyearold frame house with a thirtyyear mortgage on it tell me about it seagram tell me about how tough your world really is you could never understand whats there to understand nothing under the sun is worth killing yourself over oh sure your wife will shed a few tears at first but then shell give your clothes to the salvation army and six months from now shell be in bed with another man while youll be nothing but a picture in a scrapbook look around you its a beautiful spring day hell think what youll be missing didnt you watch the president on tv the president he came on at four oclock and talked about all the great things that were happening manned flights to mars are only three years away theres been a breakthrough on the control of cancer and he showed pictures of some old sunken ship the government salvaged from almost three miles below the ocean seagram stared at jones with unbelieving eyes what was that you said a ship salvaged what ship i dont remember the titanic seagram asked in a whisper was it the titanic yeah that was the name it rammed an iceberg and sank a long time ago come to think of it i remember seeing a movie about the titanic on television barbara stanwyck and clifton webb were in jones broke off at the look of incredulity then shock then twisted confusion that showed in seagrams face seagram handed his gun to the uncomprehending jones and leaned back against the bench thirty days thirty days would be all hed need once he had the byzanium to test the sicilian projects system and then see it through to operational status it had been a narrow thing if a wandering cop hadnt intruded when he did thirty seconds would have been all seagram had left to see anything ever again forever i assume you have weighed the staggering consequences of your accusations marganin looked at the softspoken little man with the cold blue eyes admiral boris sloyuk seemed more the baker around the corner than the shrewd head of the soviet unions secondlargest intelligencegathering network i fully realize comrade admiral that i am jeopardizing my naval career and risking a prison sentence but i place duty to the state above my personal ambitions very noble of you lieutenant sloyuk said without expression the charges you have brought are extremely damaging to say the least however you have not produced concrete evidence that indicates captain prevlov is a traitor to our country and without it i cannot condemn a man on his subordinates word alone marganin nodded but he had planned his confrontation with the admiral carefully bypassing prevlov and the normal chain of command to approach sloyuk had been a risky business indeed but the trap had been exactingly set and timing was critical calmly he reached into his pocket and produced an envelope which he passed across the desk to sloyuk here are transaction records of account number azf sevensixohnine at the banque de lausanne in switzerland you will note sir that it receives large deposits on a regular basis from one v volper a clumsy anagram derived from the name prevlov sloyuk studied the bank records and then shot marganin a very skeptical look you must forgive my suspicious nature lieutenant marganin but this has all the earmarks of trumpedup material marganin passed across another envelope this one contains a secret communication from the american ambassador here in moscow to the defense department in washington in it he states that captain andre prevlov has been a vital source of soviet naval secrets the ambassador has also included the plans for our fleet deployment in the event of a first nuclear strike against the united states marganin felt satisfaction surge through him as the admirals normally impassive face wrinkled in uncertainty i think the picture is clear there is nothing trumped up here a lowranking officer in my position could not possibly obtain such highly classified fleet orders captain prevlov on the other hand enjoys the confidence of the soviet naval strategy committee the barriers were down and the road was open sloyuk had no option but to acquiesce he shook his head in perplexity the son of a great party leader who betrays his country for money i find it impossible to accept if one takes into consideration captain prevlovs extravagant lifestyle it is not difficult to see the excessive demands made his financial resources i am well aware of captain prevlovs tastes are you also aware that he is having an affair with a woman who passes herself off as the wife of the american ambassadors chief aide an annoyed look crossed sloyuks face you know about her he asked guardedly prevlov led me to believe that he was using her to obtain secrets from her husband at the embassy not so marganin said in fact she is a divorcée and an agent of the central intelligence agency marganin paused and then drove the point home the only secrets that pass through her hands are those provided by captain prevlov it is he who is her source sloyuk was silent for a few moments then he locked marganin with a penetrating gaze how did you come by all this i would rather not divulge my informants identity comrade admiral i mean no disrespect but i have nurtured and developed his trust for nearly two years and i gave him a solemn oath that his name and position with the american government would remain known only to me sloyuk nodded he accepted it you realize of course that this puts us in a very grave situation the byzanium exactly sloyuk said tersely if prevlov told the americans of our plan it could prove disastrous once the byzanium is in their hands and the sicilian project is operational the balance of power would be theirs for the next decade perhaps captain prevlov has not leaked our plan yet marganin said perhaps he was waiting until the titanic was raised she has risen sloyuk said not more than three hours ago captain parotkin of the mikhail kurkov reported that the titanic is on the surface and ready to be taken in tow marganin looked up surprised but our agents silver and gold assured us the raising would not be attempted for another seventytwo hours sloyuk shrugged the americans are always in a hurry then we must cancel captain prevlovs plan to seize the byzanium in favor of one with credence prevlovs planmarganin had to suppress a grin when he said it the shrewd captains colossal ego would be his downfall from here on in marganin thought confidently the drama would have to be played out very very carefully it is too late to change our strategy now sloyuk said slowly the men and ships are in place we will go ahead as scheduled but what about captain prevlov surely you will order his arrest sloyuk looked at marganin coldly no lieutenant he will remain at his duties he cannot be trusted marganin said desperately you have seen the evidence i have seen nothing that cannot be manufactured sloyuk snapped brusquely your little package comes too neatly wrapped too meticulously tied with ribbon to be bought at first glance what i do see is a young upstart who is stabbing his superior in the back in order to reach the next rung on the ladder of promotion purges went out before you were born lieutenant you played a dangerous game and you lost i assure you enough sloyuks tone was hard as granite i am secure in the knowledge that the byzanium will be safely on board a soviet ship no later than three days from now an event that will prove captain prevlovs loyalty and your guilt the titanic lay motionless and dead against the unending onslaught of the waves as they swirled around her huge mass then closed ranks again and swept onward toward some as yet unknown and distant shore she lay there and drifted with the current her sodden wooden decks steaming under the fading evening sun she was a dead ship that had returned among the living a dead ship but not an empty ship the compass tower on the raised deck over her firstclass lounge had been quickly cleared away to accommodate the helicopter and soon a steady stream of men and equipment was being ferried on board to begin the arduous task of correcting the list and preparing her for the long tow to new york harbor for a few short minutes after the halfdead crew of the deep fathom were airlifted to the capricorn giordino had had the titanic all to himself the fact that he was the first to set foot on her decks in seventysix years never entered his head and though it was still broad daylight he shied away from any exploring each time he gazed down the foot length of the ship he felt as if he was staring at an empty crypt nervously he lit a cigarette sat on a wet capstan and waited for the invasion that wasnt long in coming pitt experienced no pangs of uneasiness when he came on board but rather a feeling of reverence he walked to the bridge and stood alone absorbed in the legend of the titanic god only knew hed wondered a hundred times what it was like that sunday night nearly eight decades ago when captain edward j smith stood on the very same spot and realized that his great command was slowly and irreversibly sinking beneath his feet what were his thoughts knowing the lifeboats could hold only people while on the maiden voyage the ship was carrying passengers and crew then he wondered what the venerable old captain would have thought had he known the decks of his ship would one day be walked again by men as yet unborn in his time after what seemed hours but was in reality only a minute or two pitt broke out of his reverie and moved aft along the boat deck past the sealed door of the wireless cabin where first operator john g phillips had sent historys first sos past the empty davits of lifeboat no in which mrs j j brown of denver later achieved enduring fame as the unsinkable molly brown past the entrance to the grand stairway where graham farley and the ships band had played to the end past the spot where millionaire benjamin guggenheim and his secretary had stood calmly waiting for death dressed in the finery of their evening clothes so that they could go down like gentlemen it took him almost a quarter of an hour to reach the elevator house at the far end of the boat deck pitt climbed over the hand railing and dropped to the promenade deck below here he found the aft mast protruding from the rotted planking like a forelorn stump ending abruptly at a height of eight feet where it had been cut short by sea slugs underwater torch pitt reached inside his jacket and pulled out the package given him by commodore bigalow and tenderly unwrapped it he had forgotten to carry a line or cord but he made do with the twine from the wrapping when he was through he stepped back from the stub of the once tall mast and stared up at his makeshift handiwork it was old and it was faded but the red pennant of the white star line that bigalow had snatched from oblivion so long ago proudly flew once more over the unsinkable titanic the morning sun was just probing its rays above the eastern horizon when sandecker jumped from the helicopters cockpit door and ducked under the whirling blades clutching his cap portable lights still blazed over the derelicts superstructure and crates of machinery were scattered about the decks in various stages of assembly pitt and his crew had slaved through the night struggling like madmen to organize the salvage efforts rudi gunn greeted him under a rustcankered ventilator welcome aboard the titanic admiral gunn said grinning it seemed as if everybody in the salvage fleet was grinning this morning whats the situation stable for the moment as soon as we get the pumps operating we should be able to correct her list wheres pitt in the gymnasium sandecker stopped in midstride and stared at gunn the gymnasium did you say gunn nodded and pointed at an opening in a bulkhead whose ragged edges suggested the work of an acetylene torch through here the room measured about fifteen feet wide by forty feet deep and was inhabited by a dozen men who were all involved in their individual assignments and who were seemingly oblivious to the weird assortment of antiquated and rustworn mechanisms mounted on what had once been a colorful linoleumblock floor there were ornate rowing machines funnylooking stationary bicycles that were attached to a large circular distance clock on the wall several mechanical horses with rotting leather saddles and what sandecker could have sworn looked like a mechanical camel which as he discovered later was exactly that already the salvage crew had equipped the room with a radio transmitter and receiver three portable gasdriven electrical generators a small forest of spotlights on stands a compact little rube goldberglike galley a clutter of desks and tables made out of collapsible aluminum tubing and packing crates and several folding cots pitt was huddled with drummer and spencer as sandecker moved toward them they were studying a large cutaway drawing of the ship pitt looked up and waved a salute welcome to the big t admiral he said warmly how are merker kiel and chavez safely bedded down in the capricorns sick bay sandecker answered ninetypercent recuperated and begging dr bailey to return them to duty a request i might add that fell on deaf ears bailey insisted that they remain under observation for twentyfour hours and there is simply no budging a man of his size and determination sandecker paused to sniff the air and then wrinkled his nose god whats that smell rot drummer replied it fills every nook and cranny theres no escaping it and its only a matter of time before the dead marine life that came up with the wreck begins to stink sandecker gestured about the room a cozy place youve got here he said but why set up operations in the gym rather than the bridge a break from tradition for practical reasons pitt replied the bridge serves no useful function on a dead ship the gym on the other hand sits amidships and offers us equal access to either bow or stern it also adjoins our improvised helicopter pad over the firstclass lounge roof the closer to our supplies we are the more efficiently we can operate i had to ask sandecker said heavily i should have known you didnt pick this museum of mechanical monstrosities just to launch a physicalfitness program something in a pile of wreckage that lay in a soggy heap against the forward wall of the gymnasium caught the admirals eyes and he walked over to it he stood and stared grimly for several moments at the skeletal remains of what had once been a passenger or crew member of the titanic i wonder who this poor devil was well probably never know pitt said any dental records from have no doubt been destroyed long ago sandecker leaned down and examined the pelvic section of the bones good lord it was a woman either one of the firstclass passengers who elected to remain behind or one of the women from the steerage quarters who arrived on the boat deck after all the lifeboats had been launched have you found any other bodies weve been too busy to do any extensive exploring pitt said but one of spencers men reported another skeleton wedged against the fireplace in the lounge sandecker nodded toward an open doorway whats through there that opens onto the grand staircase lets take a look they walked onto the landing above the a deck lobby and looked down several rotting chairs and sofas were scattered haphazardly on the steps where they had fallen when the ship sank by the bow the graceful flowing lines of the bannisters were still sound and undamaged and the hands of the bronze clock could be seen frozen at they made their way down the siltcoated stairs and entered one of the passageways leading to the staterooms without the benefit of outside light the scene was an eerie one room after room was filled with rotted and fallen paneling interspersed with overturned and jumbled furniture it was too dark to discern any detail and after penetrating about thirty feet they found their way blocked by a wall of debris so they turned and headed back to the gymnasium just as they came through the doorway the man hunched over the radio turned from his set it was al giordino i wondered where you two went the uranus oil people want to know about their submersible tell them they can retrieve the deep fathom off the titanics foredeck just as soon as we make dry dock in new york pitt said giordino nodded and turned back to the radio leave it to the commercial business interests to bitch about their precious property on such a momentous occasion sandecker said with a gleam in his eye and speaking of momentous occasions would any of you gentlemen care to celebrate with a touch of spirits did you say spirits giordino looked up expectantly sandecker reached under his coat and produced two bottles do not let it be said that james sandecker ever fails to look out for the best interests of his crew beware of admirals bearing gifts giordino murmured sandecker shot him a weary glance what a pity walking the plank became passé and keelhauling drummer added i promise never to dig our leader ever again providing of course he keeps me in booze giordino said a small price to pay sandecker sighed choose your poison gentlemen you see before you a fifth of cutty sark scotch for the city slickers and a fifth of jack daniels for the farm boys round up some glasses and be my guests it took giordino all of ten seconds to find the required number of styrofoam cups in their mickey mouse allelectric galley when the liquor had been poured sandecker raised his cup gentlemen heres to the titanic may she never again rest in peace to the titanic hear hear sandecker then relaxed on a folding chair sipped at his scotch and idly wondered which of the men in that soggy room were on the payroll of the soviet government soviet general secretary georgi antonov sucked on his pipe with short violent puffs and regarded prevlov with a pensive gaze i must say captain i take a dim view of the whole undertaking we have carefully considered every avenue and this is the only one left open to us prevlov said its fraught with danger i fear the americans will not take the theft of their precious byzanium lying down once it is in our hands comrade secretary it will make no difference how loudly the americans scream the door will have been slammed in their faces antonov folded and unfolded his hands a large portrait of lenin floated on the wall behind him there must be no international repercussions it must look to the world as though we were entirely within our rights this time the american president will have no recourse international law is on our side it will mean the end of what used to be called détente antonov said heavily it will also mean the beginning of the end of the united states as a superpower a cheerful conjecture captain i appreciate that his pipe had gone out and he relit it filling the room with a sweet aromatic odor however should you fail the americans will be in the same position to say the same of us we will not fail words antonov said a good lawyer plans the prosecutors case as well as his own what measures have you taken in the event of an unavoidable mishap the byzanium will be destroyed prevlov said if we cannot possess it then neither can the americans does that include the titanic as well it must by destroying the titanic we destroy the byzanium it will be accomplished in such a way that another recovery operation will be totally out of the question prevlov fell silent but antonov was satisfied he had already given his approval for the mission he studied prevlov carefully the captain looked like a man who was not used to failure his every movement every gesture seemed thoughtfully planned in advance even his words carried an air of confident forethought yes antonov was satisfied when do you leave for the north atlantic he asked with your permission comrade secretary at once a longrange reconnaissance bomber is on standby at gorki airfield it is imperative that i be standing on the bridge of the mikhail kurkov within twelve hours good fortune has sent us a hurricane and i will make full use of its force as a diversion for what will seem our perfectly legal seizure of the titanic then i will not keep you antonov stood and embraced prevlov in a great bear hug the hopes of the soviet union go with you captain prevlov i beg you do not disappoint us the day began going badly for pitt right after he wandered away from the salvage activity and made his way down to no cargo hold on g deck the sight that met his eyes in the darkened compartment was one of utter devastation the vault containing the byzanium was buried under the collapsed forward bulkhead he stood there for a long time staring at the avalanche of broken and twisted steel that prevented any easy attempt to reach the precious element it was then that he sensed someone standing behind him it looks like weve been dealt a bum hand sandecker said pitt nodded at least for the moment perhaps if we it would take weeks for our portable cutting equipment to clear a path through that jungle of steel theres no other way a giant dopplemann crane could clear the debris in a few hours then what youre saying is that we have no choice but to stand by and wait patiently until we reach the drydock facilities in new york pitt looked at him in the dim light and sandecker could see the look of frustration that cracked his rugged features there was no need for an answer removing the byzanium to the capricorn would have been a break in our favor pitt said itd certainly have saved us a lot of grief maybe we could fake a transfer our friends who work for the soviets would smell a hoax before the first crate went over the side assuming theyre both on board the titanic of course ill know this time tomorrow i take it you have a line on who they are ive got one of them pegged the one who killed henry munk the other is purely an educated guess id be interested in knowing who youve ferreted out sandecker said my proof would never convince a federal prosecutor much less a jury give me a few more hours admiral and ill lay them both silver and gold or whatever their stupid code names are right in your lap sandecker stared at him then said youre that close im that close sandecker passed a weary hand across his face arid tightened his lips he looked at the tons of steel covering the vault i leave it with you dirk ill back your play to the last hand i dont really have much choice pitt had other worries too the two navy tugs that admiral kemper promised to send were still hours away and sometime during the late morning for no apparent reason the titanic took it into her mind to increase her starboard list to seventeen degrees the ship rode far too low in the water the crests of the swells lapped at the sealed portholes along e deck just ten feet below the scuppers and although spencer and his pumping crew had managed to drop suction pipes down the loading hatches into the cargo holds they had not been able to fight their way through the debris crowding the companionways to reach the engine and boiler rooms where the greatest volume of water still layremote and inaccessible drummer sat in the gymnasium dirty and exhausted after working around the clock he sipped at a mug of cocoa after almost eighty years of submersion and rot he said the wood paneling in the passageways has fallen and jammed them worse than a path in a georgia junkyard pitt sat where hed been all afternoon bent over a drafting table next to the radio transmitter he stared out of red rimmed eyes at a transverse drawing of the titanics superstructure cant we thread our way down the main staircase or the elevator shafts the staircase is filled with tons of loose junk once you get down past d deck spencer declared and there isnt a prayer of penetrating the elevator shafts gunn added theyre crammed with jumbled masses of corroded cables and wrecked machinery if that wasnt bad enough all the watertight doublecylinder doors in the lower compartments are frozen solid in the closed position they were shut automatically by the ships first officer immediately after she struck the iceberg pitt said at that moment a short bull of a man covered from head to toe with oil and grime staggered into the gym pitt looked up and faintly smiled that you al giordino hauled himself over to a cot and collapsed like a sack of wet cement id appreciate it if none of you lit any matches around me he murmured im too young to die in a fiery blaze of glory any luck asked sandecker i made it as far as the squash court on f deck god its blacker than sin down there fell down a companionway it was flooded with oil that had seeped up from the engine room stopped cold there was no way down a snake might make it to the boiler rooms drummer said but its for sure a man aint gonna at least not until he spends a week clearing a passage with dynamite and a wrecking crew there has to be a way sandecker said somewhere down there shes taking water if we dont get ahead of it by this time tomorrow shell roll belly up and head back to the bottom the thought of losing the titanic after she was sitting pretty and upright again on a smooth sea had never entered their minds but now everyone in the gym began to feel a sickening ache deep in their stomachs the ship had yet to be taken in tow and new york was twelve hundred sea miles away pitt sat there staring at the ships interior diagrams they were woefully inadequate no set of detailed blueprints of the titanic and her sister ship the olympic existed they had been destroyed along with files full of photographs and construction data when the harland and wolff shipbuilding yards in belfast were leveled by german bombers during world war ii if only she wasnt so damned big drummer muttered the boiler rooms are damn near a hundred feet below the boat deck might as well be a hundred miles spencer said he looked up as woodson emerged from the grand stairway entrance ah the great stoneface is with us whats the official photographer of the operation been up to woodson lifted a battery of cameras from around his neck and gently laid them on a makeshift worktable just taking some pictures for posterity he said with his usual deadpan expression never know i just might write a book about all this someday and naturally ill want credit for the illustrations naturally spencer said you didnt by chance find a clear companionway down to the boiler rooms he shook his head ive been shooting in the firstclass lounge its remarkably well preserved except for the obvious ravages of water on the carpeting and furniture it could pass for a sitting room in the palace of versailles he began changing film cartridges hows chances of borrowing the helicopter id like to get some birdseye shots of our prize before the tugs arrive giordino raised up on one elbow better use up your film while you can our prize may be back on the bottom by morning woodson s brows pinched together shes sinking i think not every eye turned to the man who uttered those words pitt was smiling he smiled with the confidence of a man who just became chairman of the board of general motors he said as kit carson used to say when he was surrounded and hopelessly outnumbered by indians we aint done in yet not by a damned sight in ten hours time the engine and boiler rooms will be bonedry he quickly fumbled through the diagrams on the table until he found the one he wanted woodson said it the birdseye view it was right under our noses all the time we should have been looking from overhead instead of from inside big deal giordino said whats so interesting from the air none of you get it drummer looked puzzled you missed me at the last fork in the road spencer spencer shook his head pitt grinned at him and said assemble your men topside and tell them to bring their cutting gear if you say so spencer said but made no move for the door mr spencer is mentally measuring me for a strait jacket pitt said he cant figure why we should be cutting holes on the roof of the ship to penetrate a distance of a hundred feet through eight decks of scrap nothing to it really we have a builtin tunnel free of any debris that leads straight to the boiler rooms in fact we have four of them the boiler casings where the funnels once sat gentlemen torch away the wetsteel seals over the openings and you have a clear shot directly down to the bilges do you see the light spencer saw the light all right everyone else saw it too they headed out the door as one without giving pitt the benefit of an answer two hours later the diesel pumps were knocking away in chorus and two thousand gallons of water a minute were being returned over the side to the mounting swells that were being pushed ahead of the approaching hurricane they had dubbed her hurricane amanda and by that sable afternoon the great steamer tracks running across her projected path were devoid of most vessels all freighters tankers and passenger liners that had put to sea between savannah georgia and portland maine had been ordered back to port after numas hurricane center in tampa sent out the first warnings nearly a hundred vessels along the eastern seaboard had postponed their sailing dates while all ships bound from europe that were already far at sea hove to waiting for the hurricane to pass in tampa dr prescott and his weather people swarmed around the wall chart feeding new data into the computers and plotting any deviation of hurricane amandas track prescotts original predicted track was holding up to within a hundred and seventyfive miles a weatherman came up and handed him a sheet of paper heres a report from a coast guard reconnaissance plane that penetrated the hurricanes eye prescott took the report and read parts of it aloud eye approximately twentytwo miles in diameter forward speed increased to forty knots wind strength one hundred and eighty plus his voice trailed off his assistant looked at him her eyes wide a hundredandeightymileanhour winds and more prescott murmured i pity the ship that gets caught in this one a glaze suddenly passed across the weathermans eyes and he swung back to study the wall chart then his face turned ashen oh jesus the titanic prescott looked at him the what the titanic and her salvage fleet theyre sitting right in the middle of the projected path of the hurricane the hell you say prescott snapped the weatherman moved up to the wall chart and hesitated for several moments finally he reached up and drew an x just below the newfoundland grand banks there thats the position where she was raised from the bottom where did you get this information its been smeared all over the newspapers and television since yesterday if you dont believe me teletype numa headquarters in washington and confirm screw the teletype prescott growled he rushed across the room snatched up a telephone and shouted into the receiver punch me on a direct line to our headquarters in washington i want to speak with someones whos connected with the titanic project while he waited for his call to go through he peered over his glasses at the x on the wall chart heres hoping those poor bastards have a weatherman on board with uncanny foresight he muttered to himself or about this time tomorrow theyll forever learn the meaning of the fury of the sea there was a vague expression on farquars face as he stared at the weather maps laid out before him on the table his mind was so numb and woolly from lack of sleep that he had difficulty in defining the markings he had made only minutes before the indications of temperature wind velocity barometric pressure and the approaching stormfront all melted together into one indistinct blur he rubbed his eyes in a useless attempt to get them to focus then he shook his head to clear the cobwebs trying to remember what it was that he had been about to conclude the hurricane yes that was it farquar slowly came to the realization that he had made a serious miscalculation the hurricane had not veered into cape hatteras as hed predicted instead a highpressure area along the eastern coast held it over the ocean on a northerly course and what was worse it had begun to move faster after recurving and was now hurtling toward the titanics position with forward speed approaching fortyfive knots he had watched the hurricanes birth on the satellite photos and had closely studied the warnings from the numa station in tampa but nothing in all his years of forecasting had prepared him for the violence and the speed that this monstrosity had achieved in such a short time a hurricane in may it was unthinkable then his words to pitt came back to haunt him what was it he had said only god can make a storm farquar suddenly felt sick his face beaded with sweat hands clenching and unclenching god help the titanic this time he murmured under his breath hes the only one who can save her now the usnavy salvage tugs thomas j morse and samual r wallace arrived just before hours and slowly began circling the titanic the vast size and the strange deathlike aura of the derelict filled the tugs crews with the same feeling of awe that was experienced by the numa salvage people the day before after a half an hour of visual inspection the tugs pulled parallel to the great rusty hull and lay to in the heavy swells their engines on stop then as if in unison their cutters were lowered and the captains came across and began climbing a hastily thrown boarding ladder to the titanics shelter deck lieutenant george uphill of the morse was a short plump ruddy faced man who sported an immense bismarck mustache while lieutenant commander scotty butera of the wallace nearly scraped the ceiling at six feet six and buried his chin in a magnificent black beard no spickandspan fleet officers these two they looked and acted every bit the part of tough nononsense salvage men you dont know how happy we are to see you gentlemen gunn said shaking their hands admiral sandecker and mr dirk pitt our special projects director are awaiting you in if youll pardon the expression our operations room the tug captains tailed after gunn up the stairways and across the boat deck staring in trancelike rapture at the remains of the once beautiful ship they reached the gymnasium and gunn made the introductions its positively incredible uphill murmured i never thought in my wildest imagination that i would ever live to walk the decks of the titanic my sentiments exactly butera added i wish we could give you a guided tour pitt said but each minute adds to the risk of losing her to the sea again admiral sandecker motioned them to a long table laden with weather maps diagrams and charts and they all settled in with steaming mugs of coffee our chief concern at the moment is weather he said our weatherman on board the capricorn has suddenly taken to imagining himself as the prophet of doom pitt unrolled a large weather map and flattened it on the table theres no ducking the bad news our weather is deteriorating rapidly the barometer has fallen half an inch in the last twentyfour hours wind force four blowing north northeast and building were in for it gentlemen make no mistake unless a miracle occurs and hurricane amanda decides to cut a quick left turn to the west we should be well into her front quadrant by this time tomorrow hurricane amanda butera repeated the name how nasty is she joel farquar our weatherman assures me they dont come any meaner than this baby pitt replied shes already reported winds of force fifteen on the beaufort scale force fifteen gunn repeated in astonishment my god force twelve is considered a maximum hurricane this im afraid said sandecker is every salvage mans nightmare come trueraise a derelict only to have it snatched away by a whim of the weather he looked grimly at uphill and butera it looks as though you two made the trip for nothing youd better get back to your ships and make a run for it make a run for it hell uphill boomed we just got here i couldnt have said it better butera grinned and looked up at sandecker the morse and the wallace can tow an aircraft earner through a swamp in a tornado if they have to theyre designed to slug it out with anything mother nature can dish out if we can get a cable on board the titanic and get her under tow shell stand a fighting chance of riding out the storm intact pulling a fortyfivethousandton ship through the jaws of a hurricane sandecker murmured thats a pretty heady boast no boast butera came back deadserious by fastening a cable from the stern of the morse to the bow of the wallace our combined power can tow the titanic in the same manner as a pair of railroad engines in tandem can pull a freight train and we can do it in thirtyfoot seas at a speed of five to six knots uphill added sandecker looked at the two tug captains and let them go on butera charged ahead those arent runofthemill harbor tugs floating out there admiral theyre deepsea oceanrescue tugs two hundred and fifty feet in length with fivethousandhorse diesel power plants each boat capable of hauling twenty thousand tons of dead weight at ten knots for two thousand miles without running out of fuel if any two tugs in the world can pull the titanic through a hurricane these can i appreciate your enthusiasm sandecker said but i wont be responsible for the lives of you and your crews on what has to be an impossible gamble the titanic will have to drift out the storm as best she can im ordering you both to shove off and head into a safe area uphill looked at butera tell me commander when was the last time you defied a direct command from an admiral butera feigned mock thoughtfulness come to think of it not since breakfast speaking for myself and the salvage crew pitt said wed welcome your company there you have it sir butera said grinning besides my orders from admiral kemper were either to bring the titanic into port or take out papers for an early retirement me i opt for the titanic thats mutiny sandecker said flatly but there was no hiding the trace of satisfaction in his tone and it took no great stroke of perception to recognize that the argument had gone exactly as he had planned it he gave everyone a very shrewd look and said okay gentlemen its your funeral now that thats settled i suggest that instead of sitting around here you get about the business of saving the titanic captain ivan parotkin stood on the port wing bridge of the mikhail kurkov and searched the sky with a pair of binoculars he was a slender man of medium height with a distinguished face that almost never smiled he was in his late fifties but his receding hair showed no sign of gray a thick turtleneck sweater covered his chest while his hips and legs were encased in heavy woolen pants and knee boots parotkins first officer touched him on the arm and pointed skyward above the mikhail kurkovs huge radar dome a fourengine patrol bomber appeared out of the northeast and magnified until parotkin could make out its russian markings the aircraft seemed to be crawling scant miles per hour above its stalling speed as it swept overhead then suddenly a tiny object ejected from the underbelly and seconds later a parachute blossomed open and began drifting over the ships forward mastpeak its occupant finally dropping into the water about two hundred yards off the starboard bow as the mikhail kurkovs small boat put away and dipped over the mountainous widespaced waves parotkin turned to his first officer as soon as he is safely on board conduct captain prevlov to my quarters then he laid the binoculars on the bridge counter and disappeared down a companionway twenty minutes later the first officer knocked at the highly polished mahogany door opened it and then stood aside to allow a man to pass through he was thoroughly soaked and dripping salt water in puddles about the deck captain parotkin captain prevlov they stood there in silence a few moments both highly trained professionals and sized each other up prevlov had the advantage hed studied parotkins service history in depth parotkin on the other hand had only repute and first appearances to form a judgment he wasnt sure he liked what he saw prevlov came off too handsome too foxlike for parotkin to grasp a favorable sense of warmth or trust we are short on time prevlov said if we could get right down to the purpose of my visit parotkin held up his hand first things first some hot tea and a change of clothing dr rogovski our chief scientist is about your height and weight the first officer nodded and closed the door now then parotkin said i am certain a man of your rank and importance didnt risk his life parachuting into running sea merely to observe the atmospheric phenomenon of a hurricane hardly personal danger is not my cup of tea and speaking of tea i dont suppose you have anything stronger on board parotkin shook his head sorry captain i insist on a dry ship not exactly to the crews liking i admit but it does save occasional grief admiral sloyuk said you were a paragon of efficiency i do not believe in tempting the fates prevlov unzipped his sodden jumpsuit and let it fall on the floor i am afraid you are about to make an exception to that rule captain we you and i are about to tempt the fates as they have never been tempted before pitt could not escape the feeling he was being deserted on a lonely island as he stood on the foredeck of the titanic and watched the salvage fleet get under way and begin moving toward the western horizon and safer waters the alhambra was the last in line to slip past her captain flashing a good luck with his addis lamp the news people quietly solemnly filming what might be the last visual record of the titanic pitt searched for dana seagram among the crowd gathered at the railings but his eyes failed to pick her out he watched the ships until they became small dark specks on a leaden sea only the missile cruiser juneau and the capricorn remained behind but the salvage tender would soon depart and follow the others once the tug captains signaled they had the derelict in tow mr pitt pitt turned to see a man who had the face of a canvas weary prizefighter and the body of a beer keg chief bascom sir of the wallace i brought a twoman crew aboard to make fast the towing cable pitt smiled a friendly smile i bet they call you bad bascom only behind my back its a name thats followed me ever since i tore up a bar in san diego bascom shrugged then his eyes narrowed how did you guess commander butera described you in glowing terms behind your back that is a good man the commander how long will it take for the hookup with luck and the loan of your helicopter about an hour no problem over the helicopter it belongs to the navy anyway pitt turned and gazed down at the wallace as butera very carefully backed the tug toward the titanics old straight upanddown bow until he was less than a hundred feet away i take it the helicopter is to lift the tow cable on board yes sir bascom answered our cable measures ten inches in diameter and weighs in at one ton per seventy feet no lightweight that one on most tow jobs wed cast a small line over the derelicts bow which in turn would be attached to a series of heavier lines with increasing diameters that finally tied into the main cable but that type of operation calls for the services of an electric winch and since the titanic is a dead ship and human muscles are way under matched for the job we take the easy way out no sense in filling up sick bay with a crew of hernia patients even with the help of the helicopter it was all bascom and his men could do to secure the great cable into position sturgis came through like an old pro tenderly manipulating the helicopters controls he laid the end of the wallaces tow cable on the titanics forecastle deck as neatly as though hed practiced the trick for years it took only fifty minutes from the time sturgis released the cable and flew back to the capricorn until chief bascom stood on the forepeak and waved his arms over his head signaling the tugs that the connection was made butera on the wallace acknowledged the signal with a blast on the tugs whistle and rang the engine room for dead ahead slow as uphill on the morse went through the same motions slowly the two tugs gathered way the wallace trailing the morse on three hundred yards of wire leash paying out the main cable until the titanic rose and dropped in the steadily increasing swells nearly a quarter of a mile astern then butera held up his hand and the men on the wallaces afterdeck gently eased on the brake of the tugs immense towing winch and the cable took up the strain from atop the titanics vast height the tugs looked like tiny toy boats tossing over the enormous crests of the waves one moment before disappearing to their mastlights in the cavernous troughs the next it seemed impossible that such puny objects could budge over fortyfive thousand tons of dead weight and yet slowly imperceptibly at first their combined forces of tenthousand horsepower began to tell and soon a minute dogs bone of foam could be discerned curling around the titanics faded plimsolls mark she was barely making waynew york was still twelve hundred miles to the westbut she had at last picked up where shed left off that cold night back in and was once again making for port the ominouslooking black clouds rose and spilled over the southern horizon it was a hurricane bar even as pitt watched it seemed to expand and strengthen turning the sea to a dark shade of dirty gray oddly the wind became light aimlessly changing direction every few seconds he noticed that the sea gulls that had once swarmed about the salvage fleet were not in view only the sight of the juneau moving steadily five hundred yards abeam the titanic provided any sense of security pitt glanced at his watch and then took another look over the port railing before he slowly almost casually approached the entrance to the gymnasium is the gang all here theyre getting restless as hell giordino said he was standing huddled against a ventilator in a seemingly vain attempt to hide from the icy wind if it wasnt for the admirals restraining influence youd have had a firstclass riot on your hands everyone is accounted for to a man youre positive take the word of warden giordino none of the inmates have left the room not even to go potty then i guess its my turn to enter stage right any complaints from our guests giordino asked the usual never satisfied with their accommodations not enough heat or too much air conditioning you know yeah i know youd better go aft and see about making their wait enjoyable for gods sake how tell them jokes giordino gave pitt a sour look and mumbled dryly to himself as he turned and walked off into the evenings dimming light pitt checked his watch once more and entered the gymnasium three hours had passed since the tow had begun and the final act of the salvage had settled down to a routine sandecker and gunn were bent over the radio pestering farquar on the capricorn now fifty miles to the west for the latest news on hurricane amanda while the rest of the crew was grouped in a tight semicircle around a small and thoroughly inadequate oilburning stove as pitt entered they had all looked up expectantly when at last he spoke his voice was unnaturally soft in the unnatural quiet that was broken only by the hum of the portable generators my apologies gentlemen for keeping you waiting but i thought the short coffee break would reconstitute your sagging sinews cut the satire spencer snapped his voice taut with irritation you call us all up here and then make us sit around for half an hour when there is work to do whats the story the story is simple pitt said evenly in a few minutes lieutenant sturgis will drop his helicopter on board one last time before the storm strikes with the exception of giordino and myself i would like all of you and that includes you admiral to return with him to the capricorn arent you out of your depth pitt sandecker said in an unemphatic tone to some degree yes sir but i firmly believe im doing the right thing explain yourself sandecker glowed like a piranha about to gulp a goldfish he was playing his role to the hilt it was an epic job of typecasting i have every reason to believe the titanic hasnt the structural strength left to weather a hurricane this old tub has taken more punishment than any manmade object since the pyramids spencer said and now the great seer of the future dirk pitt predicts the old girl will throw in the sponge and sink at the first blow from a lousy storm theres no guarantee she cant or wont founder under a heavy sea pitt hedged either way its stupid to risk any more lives than we have to let me see if i get this straight drummer leaned forward his hawklike features intent and angry except for you and giordino the rest of us are supposed to haul ass and ditch everything weve busted our balls to achieve over the last nine months just sos we can hide on the capricorn till the storm blows over is that the idea you go to the head of the class drummer man youre out of your gourd impossible spencer said it takes four men just to oversee the pumps and the hull below the waterline has to be sounded around the clock for new leaks gunn added you heroes are all alike drummer drawled always making noble sacrifices to save others lets face it aint no way two men can ride herd on this old tub i vote we all stay spencer turned and read the faces of his sixman crew they all stared back at him out of eyes redrimmed with lack of sleep and nodded in chorus then spencer faced pitt again sorry great leader but spencer and his merry band of pumppushers have decided to hang in there im with you woodson said solemnly count me in said gunn chief bascom touched pitt on the arm beggin your pardon sir but me and my boys are for sticking around too that cable out there has to be checked every hour during the storm for signs of chafing and heavy grease applied to the fairlead to prevent a break sorry pitt my boy sandecker said with a marked degree of satisfaction you lose the sound of sturgiss helicopter was heard hovering for a landing over the lounge roof pitt shrugged resignedly and said well that settles it then we all sink or swim together then he cracked a tired smile youd all better get some rest and some food in your stomachs it may be your last chance a few hours from now well be up to our eyeballs in the front quadrant of the hurricane and i dont have to draw a picture of what we can expect he swung on his heels and walked out the door to the helicopter pad not a bad performance he thought to himself not a bad performance at all hed never be nominated for an academy award but what the hell his captive audience had thought it convincing and thats all that really mattered jack sturgis was a short thin man with sad drooping eyes the kind women considered bedroom eyes he gripped a long cigarette holder between his teeth and jutted his chin forward in a show reminiscent of franklin roosevelt he had just climbed down from the cockpit of the helicopter and seemed to be groping for something under the landing gear when pitt stepped onto the pad sturgis looked up any passengers he asked not this trip sturgis nonchalantly flicked an ash from his cigarette holder i knew i should have stayed cuddled in my warm cozy cabin on the capricorn he sighed flying in the face of hurricanes will be the death of me yet youd better get going pitt said the wind will be on us any time now makes no difference sturgis shrugged indifferently im not going anywhere pitt looked at him what do you mean by that ive been had thats what i mean he gestured up at the rotor blades the twofoot tip of one was hanging down like a limp wrist somebody around here resents whirlybirds did you strike a bulkhead on landing sturgis put on a hurt expression i do not repeat do not strike objects upon landing he found what he was searching for and straightened up here see for yourself some son of a bitch tossed a hammer into my rotor blades pitt took the hammer and examined it the rubber handgrip showed a deep gash where it had come in contact with the blade and after all ive done for you people sturgis said this is how you show your appreciation sorry sturgis but i suggest you forget any aspirations of ever becoming a television detective you sadly lack an analytical mind and youre prone to leap to false conclusions get off it pitt hammers dont fly through the air without a means of propulsion one of your people must have tossed it when i was landing wrong i can vouch for the whereabouts of every soul on board this ship and no one was anywhere near the helicopter pad in the last ten minutes whoever your little destructive friend is im afraid you brought him with you do you think im a deadbrain dont you think id know if i carried a passenger besides now youre insinuating a suicidal act if that hammer had been thrown one minute sooner when we were a hundred feet in the air you and your crew would have had an ugly mess to clean up wrong nomenclature pitt said not passenger but stowaway and hes no deadbrain either he waited until your wheels kissed the deck before he made his play and escaped through the cargo hatch god only knows where hes hiding now a thorough search of fifty miles of pitch dark passageways and compartments is impossible sturgiss face suddenly paled christ our intruder is still in the copter dont be ridiculous he beat it the instant you landed no no its possible to throw a hammer out and up through an open cabin window into the rotor blades but escape is something else again im listening pitt said quietly the cargo compartment hatch is electronically operated and can only be activated from a switch in the control cabin is there another exit only a door to the control cabin pitt studied the sealed cargo hatch for a long moment then turned back to sturgis his eyes cold is this any way to treat an unexpected guest i think the appropriate thing to do is for us to invite him into the fresh air sturgis became rooted to the deck as he spotted the colt fortyfive automatic complete with silencer that had suddenly materialized in pitts right hand sure sure he stammered if you say so sturgis clambered up the ladder to the control cabin leaned in and pushed a switch the electric motors made a whirring sound and the contoured sevenfootbysevenfoot door rose open and upward over the helicopters fuselage even before the locking pins clicked into position sturgis was back on the deck and standing warily behind pitts broad shoulders half a minute after the door had opened pitt was still standing there he stood there for what sturgis thought was a lifetime without moving a muscle breathing slowly and evenly and listening the only sounds were the slap of the waves against the hull the low whine of the steadily building wind over the titanics superstructure and the murmur of voices that carried through the gymnasium door not the sounds he was tuned in for when he was satisfied there were no sounds of feet scraping rustling of clothing or other tones relating to menace or stealth he stepped into the helicopter the darkened skies outside dimmed the interior and pitt was uneasily aware that he was perfectly silhouetted against the dusk light at first glance the compartment seemed empty but then pitt felt a tapping on his shoulder and noted that sturgis was pointing past him at a tarpaulin tucked around a humanlike shape i neatly folded and stowed that tarp not more than an hour ago sturgis whispered swiftly pitt reached down and dragged the tarpaulin away with his left hand while aiming the colt as steadily as a park statue with his right a figure enveloped in a heavy foulweather jacket lay huddled on the cargo deck the eyes loosely closed in a state of unconsciousness that was obviously related to the ugly bleeding and purplish bruise just above the hairline sturgis stood rooted in the shadows in shocked immobility his widening eyes blinking rapidly still adjusting to the diminishing light then he rubbed his chin lightly with his fingers and shook his head in disbelief good lord he muttered in awe do you know who that is i do pitt answered evenly her name is seagram dana seagram with appalling abruptness the sky above the mikhail kurkov went pitch dark great black clouds rolled overhead obliterating the evening stars and the wind returned and rose to a wailing gale of forty miles an hour breaking the edges of the wave crests and carrying the foam in welldefined streaks toward the northeast inside the large wheelhouse of the soviet ship it was warm and comfortable prevlov stood beside parotkin who was watching the titanics blip on radar when i took command of this ship parotkin said as though lecturing a schoolboy i was under the impression my orders were to carry out research and surveillance programs nothing was said about conducting an outandout military operation prevlov held up a protesting hand please captain you forget the words military and operation are unmentionable the little venture upon which we are about to embark is a perfectly legal civilian activity known in the western countries as a change in management blatant piracy is closer to the truth parotkin said and what do you call those ten marines you so kindly added to my crew when we left port stockholders again not marines but rather civilian crewmen of course parotkin said dryly and every one armed to the teeth there is no international law i know of that forbids ship crewmen the right to possess arms if one existed you would no doubt discover an escape clause come come my dear captain parotkin prevlov slapped him heartily on the back when this evening is played to the finale we will both be heroes of the soviet union or dead parotkin said woodenly calm your fears the plan is flawless and with the storm which drove off the salvage fleet it becomes even more so arent you overlooking the juneau her captain will not stand idly by while we steam alongside the titanic board her and raise the hammer and sickle over her bridge prevlov held up his wrist and stared at his watch in exactly two hours and twenty minutes one of our nuclear attack submarines will surface a hundred miles to the north and begin transmitting distress signals under the name of the laguna star a tramp freighter of rather dubious registry and you think the juneau will take the bait and dash to the rescue americans never reject an appeal for help prevlov said confidently they all have a good samaritan complex yes the juneau will respond she has to except for the tugs which cannot leave the titanic she is the only available ship within three hundred miles but if our submarine then submerges nothing will show on the juneaus radar screens naturally her officers will assume that the laguna star has sunk and they will double their efforts to arrive in the nick of time to save the lives of a nonexistent crew i bow to your imagination parotkin smiled yet that still leaves you with such problems as the two united states navy tugs boarding the titanic during the worst hurricane in years neutralizing the american salvage crew and then towing the derelict back to russia all without creating an international uproar there are four parts to your statement captain prevlov paused to light a cigarette number one the tugboats will be eliminated by two soviet operatives who are at this moment masquerading as members of the american salvage crew number two i shall board the titanic and assume its command when the eye of the hurricane reaches us since the wind velocities in this area seldom exceed fifteen knots my men and i should have little difficulty in crossing over and entering through a hull loading door that will be conveniently opened on schedule by one of the operatives number three my boarding party will then dispose of the salvage crew quickly and efficiently and finally number four it will be made to look to the world as though the americans fled the ship at the height of the hurricane and were lost at sea that of course makes the titanic an abandoned derelict the first captain who gets a towline on her is then entitled to the salvage rights you are to be that lucky captain comrade parotkin under international marine law you will have every legal right to take the titanic in tow you will never get away with it parotkin said what youre suggesting is outright mass murder there was a vacant sick look in his eyes have you also considered the consequences of failure with the same dedication to detail prevlov looked at him the everpresent smile tightening failure has been considered comrade but let us fervently hope our final option will not be required he pointed at the large blip on the radar screen it would be a pity to have to sink the worlds most legendary ship a second time and for all time deep in the bowels of the ancient ocean liner spencer and his pumping crew struggled to keep the diesel pumps going sometimes working alone in the cold black caverns of steel with nothing but the pitiful comfort of small spotlights they uncomplainingly went about their business of keeping the ship afloat it came as somewhat of a surprise to find that in some compartments the pumps were falling behind the incoming water by seven oclock the weather had deteriorated to the point of no return the barometer slipped past and was still falling steeply the titanic began to pitch and roll and take solid water over her bow and cargo deck bulwarks visibility under the shroud of night and the driving rain dropped to almost zero the only sighting the men on the tugs had of the big ship came with an occasional bolt of lightning that vaguely silhouetted her ghostly outline the main concern however was the cable that disappeared into the mad swirling waters astern the constant strain on this lifeline was enormous every time the titanic took the full onslaught from a wave of massive proportions they watched in ominous fascination as the cable arched out of the water and creaked in agonized protest butera never moved from his bridge keeping in constant contact with the men in the afterdeck cablehouse suddenly a voice from the speaker crackled over the howl of the outside wind captain this is the captain he replied into a hand phone ensign kelly in the cablehouse sir something mighty peculiar going on back here would you care to explain ensign well sir the cable seems to have gone berserk first she swung to port and now shes carried over to starboard at what i must say sir is an alarming angle okay keep me posted butera switched off and opened another channel uphill can you hear me this is butera on the morse uphill answered almost immediately go ahead i think the titanic has sheered off to starboard can you make out her position negative the only indication is the angle of the cable there came a silence of several moments as uphill thrashed the new development over in his mind then he came back through the speaker were hardly making four knots as it is we have no alternative but to push on if we stop to see what shes up to she may swing broadside into the sea and roll over can you pick her up on your radar no can do a sea swept away our antennae twenty minutes ago how about yours still have the antennae but the same sea that took yours shorted out my circuits then its a case of the blind leading the blind butera set the radio phone in its cradle and cautiously cracked the door leading to the starboard wing of the bridge shielding his eyes with his arm he staggered outside and strained his eyes to penetrate the night gone crazy the searchlights proved useless their beams merely reflected the driving rain and revealed nothing lightning flashed astern its thunder drowned out by the wind and buteras heart skipped a beat the brief burst of backlighting failed to reveal any outline of the titanic it was as though she had never been water streaming down his oilskins his breath coming in gasps he pushed back past the door just as ensign kellys voice rasped over the speaker again captain butera wiped the spray from his eyes and picked up the phone what is it kelly the cable its slackened is it a break no sir the cables still pain out but its settled several feet lower in the water ive never seen one act like this before its as if the derelict took it in her mind to pass us it was the words pass us that did it and butera would never forget the sudden shock of realization a mental click triggered open a floodgate in his mind released a nightmare of images in orderly sequence images of a mad pendulum its arc growing ever wider until it turned in on itself the signs were there the cable angled badly to starboard the sudden slackness he envisioned the whole scene in his mind the titanic driven slightly ahead and parallel to the wallaces starboard beam and now the pull from the cable snapping the derelict back in the manner of a line of school children playing crack the whip then something broke the nightmare inside buteras head and released him from its numbing thrall he grabbed the radio phone and rang the engine room in almost the same movement ahead full speed do you hear me engine room ahead full speed and then he called the morse im coming at you full speed he shouted do you read me uphill please repeat uphill asked order full speed ahead damn it or ill run you down butera dropped the phone and fought his way outside onto the bridge wing again the hurricane was beating the sea into a froth so savage so angry that it was nearly impossible to separate air from water it was all he could do to maintain a hold on the railing then he saw it the immense bow of the titanic looming up through the curtain of the thrashing deluge hardly more than a hundred feet off the starboard quarter there was nothing he could do now except watch in frozen horror as the menacing mass moved inexorably closer to the wallace no he cried above the wind you dirty old corpse you leave my ship alone it was too late it seemed impossible that the titanic could ever swing clear of the wallaces stern and yet the impossible happened the great sixtyfoot bow rose up on a mountainous wave and hung there suspended just long enough for the tugs screws to take bite and pull her clear then the titanic dropped in the trough missing the stern of the wallace by no more than three feet throwing up a surge that engulfed the entire smaller vessel carrying away both its lifeboats and one of the ventilators the wave tore buteras grip from the railing and swept him across the bridge jamming his body against the wheelhouse bulkhead he lay there totally submerged under the billow his throat choking his lungs gasping for air his brain sluggishly taking strength from the strong pulsing beat of the wallaces engines that transmitted through the deck when the water finally drained away he struggled to his feet and retched his stomach empty he clawed his way back into the safety of the wheelhouse butera his senses stunned by the miracle of the wallaces deliverance watched the great black apparition that was the titanic slide by astern until she disappeared again in the shroud of windwhipped rain leave it to dirk pitt to pick up a dame in the middle of the ocean during a hurricane sandecker said whats your secret the pitt curse pitt answered as he tenderly bandaged the swelling on danas head women are forever attracted to me under impossible circumstances when im in no mood to respond dana began to moan softly shes coming around gunn said he was on his knees next to a cot they had wedged between the gymnasiums old exercise equipment to steady it from the ships rolling and pitching pitt covered her with a blanket she suffered a nasty tap but her mass of hair probably saved her from anything worse than a concussion how did she come to be on sturgiss helicopter woodson asked i thought she was babysitting the news people on board the alhambra she was admiral sandecker said several television network correspondents requested permission to cover the titanics haul to new york from aboard the capricorn i gave authorization on the condition that dana accompany them i ferried them over sturgis said and i saw mrs seagram disembark when i landed on the capricorn its a mystery to me how she reentered the helicopter without being noticed yeah a mystery woodson repeated caustically dont you bother checking your cargo compartment between flights im not running a commercial airline sturgis snapped back he looked as though he was about to hit woodson he glanced at pitt and was met with a disapproving stare then with a visible effort he reined in his emotions and spoke slowly and firmly id been flying that bird out there steady for twenty hours straight i was tired i easily convinced myself that there was no need to bother with a cargocompartment check because i was certain it was empty how was i to know dana seagram would sneak on board gunn shook his head why did she do it why would she i dont know why how the hell should i sturgis said suppose you tell me why she threw a hammer through my rotor blades wrapped herself up in a tarpaulin and then clouted herself on the head not necessarily in that order why dont you ask her pitt said he nodded down at the cot dana was staring up at the men her eyes devoid of understanding she looked as though she had just been dragged up from the sanctuary of exhausted sleep forgive me for asking such a hackneyed question she murmured but where am i my dear girl sandecker said kneeling at her side youre on the titanic she looked dazedly at the admiral disbelief written across her face that cant be oh i assure you it is sandecker said pitt theres a bit of scotch left bring me a glass pitt obediently did as he was told and handed sandecker the glass dana took a swallow of the cutty sark choked on it and coughed holding her head as if to contain the pain that had suddenly exploded in her skull there there my dear it was plain to see sandecker was somewhat at a loss as to how to treat a woman in agony rest easy youve suffered a nasty blow on the head dana felt the bandage circling her hair and then clutched the admirals hand knocking the glass on the deck pitt winced as the scotch spilled women just dont appreciate good booze no no im all right she struggled to a sitting position on the cot and stared in wonder at the strange mechanical contrivances the titanic she said the name reverently im actually on the titanic yes pitts voice was edged with sharpness and wed like to know how you got here she looked at him halfuncertainly halfconfused and said i dont know i honestly dont know the last thing i recall i was on the capricorn we found you in the helicopter pitt said the helicopter i lost my makeup kit must have dropped it on the flight from the alhambra she forced a wan smile yes thats it i returned to the helicopter to search for my makeup kit i found it jammed between the foldup seats i tried pulling it free when well i guess i fainted and hit my head when i fell fainted youre sure you pitt broke off his question and asked another instead what was the very last thing you remember seeing before you blacked out she thought a moment staring as if at some distant vision in time those coffeebrown eyes seemed unnaturally large against her pale and strained face sandecker patted her hand paternally just take your time finally her lips formed a word boots say again pitt ordered a pair of boots she answered as if seeing a revelation yes i remember now a pair of sharptoed cowboy boots cowboy boots gunn asked his expression blank dana nodded you see i was down on my hands and knees trying to extricate my makeup kit and then i dont know they just seemed to be there she paused what color were they pitt prodded her kind of a yellow cream color did you see the mans face she started to shake her head and caught herself at the first stab of pain no everything went dark then thats all there is her voice trailed off pitt could see that there was nothing to be gained by further interrogation he looked down at dana and smiled she looked up and smiled back with an anxioustoplease smile we dirty old men had best leave you alone to rest for a while he said if you need anything one of us will always be close by sandecker followed pitt over to the entrance to the grand staircase what do you make of it sandecker asked why would anyone want to harm dana for the same reason they killed henry munk you think she got wise to one of the soviet agents more likely in her case it was a matter of being in the wrong place at the wrong time the last thing we need on our hands now is an injured woman sandecker sighed therell be hell to pay when gene seagram gets my radio message about what happened to his wife with all due respect sir i told gunn not to send your message we cant risk a change in plans at the last minute men make cautious decisions where women are concerned we wont hesitate to risk the lives of a dozen members of our own sex but well balk every time when it comes to endangering one of the female species what seagram the president admiral kemper and the others in washington dont know wont hurt them at least for the next twelve hours it would appear my authority means nothing around here sandecker said acidly anything else you neglected to tell me pitt like who those outlandish cowboy boots belong to the boots belong to ben drummer ive never seen him wear them how would how could you know that i discovered them when i searched his quarters on the capricorn now youve added burglarizing to your other talents sandecker said drummer wasnt alone giordino and i have searched every one of the salvage crews belongings over the past month find anything of interest nothing incriminating who do you think injured dana it wasnt drummer that much is certain hes got at least a dozen witnesses including you and me admiral who will testify that hes been on board the titanic since yesterday it would have been impossible for him to attack dana seagram on a ship that was fifty miles away at that moment woodson came up and caught pitts arm sorry for the interruption boss but we just received an urgent call from the juneau im afraid its bad news lets have it sandecker said wearily the outlook cant possibly be painted any blacker than it is now oh but it can woodson said the message is from the missile cruisers captain and reads have received distress call from eastbound freighter laguna star bearing zero five degrees a hundred and ten miles north of your position must respond repeat must respond sorry to leave you good luck to the titanic good luck to the titanic sandecker echoed his voice was flat and empty of life we might as well raise a flashing sign on the hull that says welcome thieves and pirates come one come all so now it begins pitt thought to himself but the only sensation that coursed through his body was a sudden overwhelming urge to go to the bathroom the air in admiral joseph kempers pentagon office reeked of stale cigarette smoke and halfeaten sandwiches and it almost seemed to crackle under the invisible cloud of tension kemper and gene seagram were huddled over the admirals desk in quiet conversation while mel donner and warren nicholson the cia director sat together on the sofa their feet propped on a coffee table and dozed but they jerked upright in full wakefulness when the strange buzz that was specially tuned into kempers red telephone broke the hushed quiet kemper grunted into the receiver and laid it back in its cradle it was the security desk the president is on his way up donner and nicholson glanced at each other and heaved themselves off the sofa they had no sooner cleared the coffee table of the evenings debris straightened their ties and donned their coats when the door opened and the president strode in followed by his kremlin security adviser marshall collies kemper came from behind his desk and shook the presidents hand nice to see you mr president please make yourself at home may i get you something the president scanned his watch and then grinned three hours yet before the bars close how about a bloody mary kemper grinned back and nodded to his aide commander keith will you do the honors keith nodded one bloody mary coming up sir i hope you gentlemen wont mind me standing watch with you the president said but i have a heavy stake in this too not at all sir nicholson answered were happy to have you what is the situation at the moment admiral kemper gave a full briefing to the president describing the unexpected ferocity of the hurricane showing the positions of the ships on a projected wall map and explaining the titanics towing operation was it absolutely necessary that the juneau be ordered off station the president asked a distress call is a distress call kemper replied solemnly and must be answered by every ship in the area regardless of the circumstances we have to play according to the other teams rules until half time nicholson said after that its our game do you think admiral kemper that the titanic can stand up to the battering of a hurricane as long as the tugs can keep her bow into the wind and sea shes an oddson favorite to come through with flying colors and if for some reason the tugs cannot keep her from swinging broadside to the waves kemper avoided the presidents gaze and shrugged then its in gods hands nothing could be done no sir there is simply no way to protect any one vessel caught in the clutches of a hurricane it becomes a case of every ship for herself i see a knock at the door and another officer entered laid two slips of paper on kempers desk and retreated kemper read the notes and poked up his face set in a grim expression a message from the capricorn he said your wife mr seagram your wife is reported missing a search party aboard ship was unable to locate her they fear she was lost overboard im sorry seagram sagged into collins arms his eyes widened in stunned horror oh my god he cried it cant be true oh god what am i going to do dana dana donner rushed to his side steady gene steady he and collins steered seagram over to the sofa and gently lowered him to the cushions kemper gestured to the president for his attention theres another message sir from the samuel r wallace one of the tugs towing the titanic the towing cable kemper said it snapped the titanic is adrift in the center of the hurricane the cable hung like a dead snake over the stern of the wallace its severed end swaying in the black depths a quarter of a mile below butera stood frozen beside the great electric winch refusing to believe his eyes how he shouted in ensign kellys ear how could it part it was built to take worse stress than this cant figure it kelly yelled back above the storm there was no extreme stress on her when she went bring her up ensign lets take a look the ensign nodded and gave the orders the brake was released and the reel began turning pulling the wire up from the sea a solid sheet of spray dashed against the cablehouse the dead weight of the wire acted as an anchor dragging down the stern of the wallace and each time a column of water approached it rose high over the wheelhouse and came thundering down upon it with a shock that jarred the entire tug at last the end of the tow cable appeared over the stern and snaked up onto the reel as soon as the brake was applied butera and kelly moved in and began examining the frayed strands butera stared at it his face twisted in stunned incomprehension he touched the burned wire ends and looked dumbly at the ensign the ensign did not share buteras muteness jesus christ in heaven he shouted hoarsely its been cut through with an acetylene torch pitt was down on his hands and knees on the cargo floor of the helicopter sweeping his flashlight under the folded passenger seats when the titanics tow cable dropped into the sea outside the wind howled with demonic power pitt couldnt have known it but without the tugs steadying influence the titanics bow was being forced by the raging sea to leeward exposing her entire flank to the unleashed furies she was beginning to broach to it had taken him only two minutes to find danas makeup kit where it had solidly jammed behind one of the folded front seats immediately behind the controlcabin bulkhead he could easily see why she had had difficulty retrieving the blue nylon case from its prison very few women are blessed with mechanical inclinations and dana was definitely not one of them it hadnt occurred to her to simply unclasp the restraining straps and unfold the seat pitt did so and the kit fell free into his hand he didnt bother opening it he wasnt interested what he was interested in was the recessed compartment in the forward bulkhead where a twentyman life raft sat or where it was supposed to sit the yellow rubberized cover was there all right but the raft was gone pitt had no time to appreciate the implication of his discovery even as he pulled the empty cover out of its compartment a monstrous sea crashed against the flank of the helpless titanic heeling her great mass over on her starboard side as though she never meant to stop pitt made a desperate grab for one of the seat supports but his fingers closed on air and he was spilled like a sack of potatoes down across the sloping floor crashing against the partially opened cargo door with such force that he ripped a fourinch gash in his scalp mercifully the next few hours were lost to pitt he was aware of a cold gale sweeping into the fuselage but not much else his mind was a vague mass of gray wool and he felt remotely detached from his surroundings he could not know or even sense when the helicopter shed its triplelashed moorings and was hurled sideways dropping off the firstclass lounge roof onto the boat deck crumpling its tail section tearing off its rotor blades before grinding over the railing and falling toward the tormented sea the russians came aboard the titanic during the storms lull deep down in the bowels of the engine and boiler rooms spencer and his pumping crew had no chance not the least opportunity for any resistance their total surprise acknowledged prevlovs dedication to exact planning and detailed execution the fight that occurred topsidemassacre would have been closer to the truthwas over almost before it began five russian marines half the boarding force their faces all but hidden by seaman caps pulled low on top and with huge mufflers wrapped below were in the gymnasium with automatic machine pistols ready and aimed before anyone could comprehend what was happening woodson was the first to react he swung from the radio his eyes widened in a look of recognition and an expression of pure anger swept over his normally passive face you bastard he blurted and then hurled himself at the nearest intruder but a knife materialized in the mans hand and he deftly rammed it into woodsons chest tearing the photographers heart nearly in two woodson clutched at his killer then slowly slid downward to the booted feet shock in his eyes then disbelief then pain and finally the emptiness of death dana sat up on her cot and screamed and screamed it was that stimulus that finally stung the other members of the salvage crew into action drummer caught woodsons murderer on the cheek with his fist and received the barrel of a machine pistol across his face for his effort sturgis launched his body in a flying tackle but his timing was late a gun butt caught him just above the temple at the same instant he crashed into his intended victim and they both fell to the deck in a heap the assailant quickly regaining his feet while sturgis lay there as if dead giordino was in the act of bringing a wrench down on another russians skull when there was an earsplitting crack a bullet passed through his upraised hand and sent the wrench clattering across the deck the shot seemed to freeze all movement sandecker gunn and chief bascom and his men halted in mid action as they abruptly realized that their unarmed defense of the ship was hopeless in the face of guns held by highly trained killers at that precise moment a man strode into the room his intense gray eyes taking in every detail of the scene he wasted no more than three secondsthree seconds and no more was all andre prevlov needed to survey any given situation he stared down at the stillscreaming dana and smiled graciously do you mind my dear lady he said in fluent idiomatic english i think female panic inflicts quite an unnecessary strain on the vocal chords her round eyes were stricken her mouth closed and she sat huddled in a ball on the cot staring at the spreading pool of blood under omar woodson and shuddering uncontrollably there now thats much better prevlov followed her eyes to woodson then to drummer who was sitting on the deck in the process of spitting out a tooth and then to giordino who glared back holding his bleeding hand your resistance was foolish previov said one dead and three injured and for nothing who are you sandecker demanded by what right do you board this ship and murder my crew ah a pity we must meet under such remote and unpleasant circumstances prevlov apologized you are of course admiral james sandecker are you not my questions still stand sandecker spat angrily my name is of no consequence prevlov replied the answer to your other question is obvious i am taking over this ship in the name of the union of soviet socialist republics my government will never stand idly by and let you get away with it correction prevlov murmured your government will stand idly by you underestimate us prevlov shook his head not i admiral i am fully aware of what your countrymen are capable of i also know they will not start a war over the legitimate boarding of a derelict ship legitimate boarding sandecker echoed the civil salvage service laws define a derelict vessel as one whose crew has abandoned at sea without intent of returning or attempt at recovery since this ship still retains its crew your presence sir constitutes a blatant act of highseas piracy spare me your interpretation of maritime legalities prevlov held up a protesting hand you are quite right of course for the moment the implication was clear you wouldnt dare cast us adrift in the middle of a hurricane nothing so mundane admiral besides i am well aware that the titanic is taking on water i need your salvage engineer spencer i believe his name is and his crew to keep the pumps operating until the storm abates after that you and your people will be provided with a life raft your departure will then guarantee our right to salvage we cannot be allowed to live to testify sandecker said your government would never permit that you know it and i know it prevlov looked at him calm unaffected then he turned casually almost callously dismissing sandecker he spoke in russian to one of the marines the man nodded and tipped over the radio and pounded it with the stock of his machine pistol into mangled pieces of metal glass and wiring there is no further use for your operations room prevlov motioned around the gymnasium i have installed my communication facilities in the main dining room on d deck if you and the others will be so kind as to follow me i will see to your comfort until the weather clears one more question sandecker said without moving you owe me that of course admiral of course where is dirk pitt i regret to inform you prevlov said with ironic sympathy that mr pitt was in your helicopter when it was swept over the side into the sea his death must have come quickly admiral kemper sat opposite a grimfaced president and casually poured four teaspoons of sugar into his coffee cup the aircraft carrier beechers island is nearing the search area her planes will begin searching at first light kemper forced a thin smile dont worry mr president well have the titanic back in tow by midafternoon you have my word on it the president looked up a helpless ship adrift and lost in the middle of the worst storm in fifty years a ship thats rusted half through after lying on the bottom for seventysix years a ship the soviet government is looking for any excuse to get their hands on and you say not to worry youre either a man of unshakable conviction admiral or youre a hyperoptimist hurricane amanda kemper sighed at the name we made allowances for every possible contingency but nothing in our wildest imagination prepared us for a storm of such tremendous magnitude in the middle of may it struck so fearfully hard and on such short notice that there was no time to reshuffle our priorities and time schedules suppose the russians took it into their heads to make their play and are on board the titanic this minute kemper shook his head boarding a ship under a hundredplusmileanhour winds and seventyfoot seas my years at sea tell me thats impossible a week ago hurricane amanda would have been considered impossible too the president looked up dully as warren nicholson sank in the opposite sofa any news nothing from the titanic nicholson said they havent reported since they entered the eye of the hurricane and the navy tugs they still havent sighted the titanicwhich isnt too surprising with their radar inoperative theyre reduced to a visual search pattern a hopeless chore im afraid in nearzero visibility for long moments there was a suffocating silence it was finally broken by gene seagram we cant lose it now not when we were so close he said struggling to his feet the terrible price weve paid ive paid the byzanium oh god we cant let it be taken away from us again his shoulders drooped and he seemed to wither as donner and collins eased him back down on the sofa kemper spoke in a whisper if the worst happens mr president what then we write off sandecker pitt and the others and the sicilian project the sicilian project the president murmured yes we write that off too the heavy gray wool slowly began to fade away and pitt became aware that he was lying in an upsidedown position on something hard and in something wet he hung there long minutes his mind in the twilight zone between consciousness and unconsciousness until gradually he was able to pry open his eyes or at least one eye the other was caked shut by coagulated blood like a man who had just struggled up from a deep dark tunnel into the daylight he squinted his good eye from right to left up and down he was still in the helicopter his feet and legs curled upward along the floor and his back and shoulders lay against the aft bulkhead that accounted for the hardness the wetness was an understatement several inches of water sloshed back and forth around his body he wondered vaguely how he had come to be contorted in this awkward position his head felt as if little men were running around inside it jabbing pitchforks into his brain he splashed some water over his face ignoring the sting of the salt until the blood diluted and ran off allowing the eyelid to open now that he had regained his peripheral vision he turned his body so that he was sitting on the bulkhead and looking up at the floor it was like staring at the crazy room of an amusement park fun house there was to be no exiting through the cargo door it had been jammed shut from the beating the fuselage had taken during its journey across the titanics decks left with no other choice but to get out through the control cabin hatch pitt began climbing up the floor using the cargo tiedown rings for handgrips one ring at a time he pulled himself toward the forward bulkhead or what now constituted the ceiling his head ached and he had to stop every few feet waiting for the cobwebs to clear at last he could reach up and touch the door latch the door wouldnt budge he pulled out the colt and pounded at the latch the force of the blow knocked the pistol out of his wet hand and it clattered all the way to the rear bulkhead the door remained stubbornly closed pitts breath was coming now in heaving gasps he was on the verge of blacking out from exhaustion he turned and looked down the aft bulkhead seemed a long way away he gripped a cargo tiedown ring with both hands swung in a series of everwidening arcs and then lashed out with both feet using all the muscle a man can use when he knows it is his last try the latch gave and the door sprung upward at an angle of thirty degrees before gravity took over and brought it slamming back down but the brief opening was all pitt needed to thrust a hand over the door frame using his fingers as a jam he gasped in agony as the door fell across his knuckles he hung there soaking up the pain gathering the strength for the final hurdle he took a deep breath and heaved his body through the opening as one would climb through a trapdoor in an attic without benefit of a ladder then he rested again waiting for the dizziness to pass and his heart to slow down to a nearnormal beat he wrapped his bleeding fingers in a sodden handkerchief and took stock of the control cabin no problem escaping here the cabin hatch had been torn off its hinges and the windshield glass knocked from its frames now that his escape was assured he began to wonder how long he had been unconscious ten minutes an hour half the night he had no way of knowing as his watch was gone probably wrenched from his wrist what had happened he tried to analyze the possibilities had the helicopter been blown into the sea not likely it would have been pitts coffin in the abyss by now but where had the water in the cargo section come from maybe the aircraft had been ripped loose from its moorings and swept against one of the boat deck bulkheads of the derelict that didnt work either it couldnt explain why the helicopter was standing in a perfect perpendicular position what he did know for certain was that every additional second spent sitting around in the middle of a hurricane and playing questionandanswer games moved him one second closer to more serious injury or even death the answers were waiting outside so he worked himself over the pilots seat and stared through the shattered cockpit windows into the darkness beyond he was staring straight up the side of the titanic the gargantuan rusty plates of the hull stretched off into the dim light to the right and left a quick downward look revealed the angry sea the waves were swirling about in massive confusion often coming together in huge collisions that sounded like an artillery barrage visibility was better now no heavy rain was falling and the wind had slackened to no more than ten or fifteen knots at first pitt thought that he must have slept through the hurricane but then he figured out why the sea was leaping skyward without any sense of direction the titanic was drifting in the eye of the coil and only a few more minutes would pass before the full fury of the storms rear quadrant would fall upon the wallowing ship pitt edged carefully through one of the broken windows over the nose of the helicopter and then dropped onto the deck of the titanic no sensuous or erotic interlude with the worlds most beautiful woman could have come close to matching the thrill he felt at finding his feet on one side of the old liners waterlogged decks again but which deck pitt leaned over the railing twisted around and looked up there on the deck above was the bent and broken handrail still clutching a part of the helicopter that meant he was standing on the b deck promenade he looked down and saw the reason behind the aircrafts ignominious posture its journey toward the boiling sea had been abruptly halted by the landing skids which had caught and then wedged into the observation openings along the promenade deck leaving the helicopter hanging in an upright stance like some monstrous bug on a wall the great swells had then slammed against its fuselage damming it even tighter against the ship pitt had no time to appreciate the miracle of his salvation for as he stood there he felt the increasing pressure from the wind as the tail of the hurricane approached he had trouble getting his footing and he realized that the titanics list had returned and she was leaning heavily to starboard again it was then that he noticed the running lights of another ship close by no more than two hundred yards off the starboard beam there was no way of telling what size she was the sea and the sky began melting together as the driving rain returned lashing his face with the cutting power of sandpaper could it be one of the tugs he wondered or perhaps the juneau had returned but suddenly pitt knew the lights were from none of these a shaft of lightning flashed and he saw the unmistakable dome that could only be the mikhail kurkovs radar antennae shield by the time he had climbed a stairway and staggered to the helicopter pad on the boat deck he was still wet to the skin and panting from the exertion he paused to kneel and pick up one of the mooring lines studying the parted ends of the nylon fibers then he rose and leaned into the howling wind and vanished into the curtain of water that enshrouded the ship the vastness of the titanics firstclass dining saloon stretched under the ornate ceiling far into the dark shadows beyond the lights the few remaining leaded glass windows reflecting eerie distortions of the bonetired and defeated people standing under the guns of the unflinching russians spencer had been forced to join the group the shock of incomprehension mirrored in his eyes he stared at sandecker incredulously pitt and woodson dead it cant be true its true all right drummer mumbled through a swollen mouth one of them sadistic bastards standing there shoved a knife into woodsons gut a miscalculation on your friends part prevlov said with a shrug he gazed speculatively at the frightened woman and the nine men standing before him at their gaunt and bloodcaked faces he seemed to enjoy in a detached sort of way their struggle to retain their balance whenever the titanic was struck broadside by an immense swell and speaking of miscalculations mr spencer it seems your men have developed a noticeable lack of enthusiasm for manning the pumps i neednt remind you that unless the water that is pouring in below the waterline is returned to the sea this ancient monument to capitalistic extravagance will sink so let it sink spencer said easily at least you and your communist scum will go with it not a likely event particularly when you consider that the mikhail kurkov is standing by for just such an emergency prevlov selected a cigarette from a gold case and tapped it thoughtfully so you see a sensible man would accept the inevitable and perform his duties accordingly it still beats hell out of letting you get your slimy hands on her you wont get any of us to do your dirty work for you sandecker said there was a quiet finality in his voice perhaps not prevlov was quite unruffled on the other hand i think i shall have the cooperation i require and very soon he motioned to one of the guards and muttered in russian the guard nodded walked unhurriedly across the dining saloon grabbed dana by the arm and roughly pulled her under one of the portable lights as one the salvage crew crowded forward only to be met by four unyielding machine pistols held at gut level they froze helplessly rage and hostility seething through their every pore if you harm her sandecker whispered his voice quivering in quiet anger youll pay for it oh come now admiral prevlov said rape is for the sick only a cretin would attempt blackmailing you and your crew with such a sorry ploy american men still place their women on marble pedestals youd all willingly die in a useless attempt to protect her virtues and where would that leave me no cruelty and torture are crude methods in the fine art of persuasion humiliation he paused savoring the word yes humiliation a magnificent incentive for inducing your men to return to their labors and keep the ship afloat prevlov turned to dana she looked at him pathetic and lost now then mrs seagram if you will be so good as to take off your clothesall of them what kind of cheap trick is this sandecker asked no trick mrs seagrams modesty will be laid bare layer after layer until you order mr spencer and his men to cooperate no gunn pleaded dont do it dana please no appeals prevlov said wearily i will have one of my men strip her by force if necessary slowly barely perceptibly a strange gleam of belligerence began spreading in danas eyes then without the slightest hesitation she slipped out of her jacket jumpsuit and underclothing in less than a minute she stood there in the halo of light her body supple and alive and very nude sandecker turned his back and one by one the other hardened salvage men followed suit until they were facing away into the darkness you will look upon her prevlov said coldly your gallant gesture is touching but completely useless turn around gentlemen our little performance is just beginning i think this stupid chauvinistic bullshit has gone far enough every head jerked around as if yanked by the strings of a puppeteer at the sound of danas voice she stood there with legs apart hands on hips breasts thrust outward and her eyes blazed with a mocking awareness even with the unsightly bandage around her head she looked magnificent the admission is free boys stare all you want a womans body is no big secret youve all seen and undoubtedly touched one before why all the bashful glances then her eyes changed to shrewd reflection and her lips lifted away from her teeth and she began laughing she had decisively stolen the stage from prevlov he stared at her his mouth slowly tightening an impressive performance mrs seagram an impressive performance indeed but a typical display of western decadence i hardly find amusing show me a communist and ill show you an asshole every time dana taunted him if you shitheads only knew how the whole world laughs behind your threadbare backs every time you spout your gauche little marxist terms like western decadence imperialistic warmongering or bourgeoismanipulating you might straighten up and show a little class as it is your kind is the biggest diabolical farce played on mankind since we climbed down from the trees and if you had any balls youd face up to it prevlovs face went white this has gone far enough he snapped he was on the verge of losing his very carefully practiced control and it frustrated him dana stretched her long and opulent body and said whats the matter ivan to used to musclebound hodcarrying russian women cant get used to the idea of a liberated gal from the land of the free and the home of the brave laughing at your sorry tactics it is your vulgarity that i find difficult to accept at least our women do not act like common gutter sluts fuck you dana grinned sweetly prevlov missed nothing he caught the flickered glance between giordino and spencer caught the flexing of sturgiss fists and the tiny inclination of drummers head he became fully aware now that danas indolent yet continual movement away from the americans and toward the rear of the russian guards was neither unconscious nor unplanned her performance was nearly complete the soviet marines were twisting their necks to gawk their guns were beginning to droop in their hands when prevlov shouted out a command in russian the guards jolted out of their laxity swung back and faced the salvage crew their weapons aimed and steady again my compliments dear lady prevlov bowed your little display of theatrics very nearly worked a clever clever deception there was a curious clinical satisfaction in prevlovs expression a functional chill as if his cunning had been called and he had easily won the hand he watched dana appraising her fractional show of defeat the grin had remained on her face as though painted there and her shoulders huddled in a slight shiver but she shook it off and straightened once again proud and selfassured i dont know what youre talking about of course not prevlov sighed he stared at her for a moment and then turned and said something to one of the guards the man nodded pulled out a knife and slowly advanced toward dana dana stiffened and paled as though turned to salt what are you going to do i ordered him to cut off your left breast prevlov said conversationally spencer stared openmouthed at sandecker his eyes pleading for the admiral to back down good god sandecker uttered desperately you cant allowyou promised no cruelty or torture i am the first to admit there is no finesse in savagery prevlov said but you leave me no choice it is the only solution to your obstinacy sandecker sidestepped around the nearest guard youll have to kill me first the guard jammed his machine pistol muzzle into sandeckers kidney and the admiral fell to his knees his face twisted in agony his breath coming in loud sucking noises dana clenched her hands at her sides until they turned ivory she had played her hand down to the last card and now she looked lost those beautiful coffeebrown eyes were sick in abhorrence when she saw the guards eyes suddenly reflect a look of confusion as a steel hand fell on her shoulder and pushed her aside pitt walked slowly into the light pitt stood frozen in time like some unspeakable apparition that had risen from the depths of a watery hell he was saturated from head to foot his black hair plastered down across a bloodied forehead his lips curled in a satanic smile in the light of the lamps the droplets of water sparkled as they trickled from his wet clothing and splattered on the deck prevlovs face was a wax mask calmly he pulled a cigarette from the gold case lit it and exhaled the smoke in a long sigh your name may i assume that your name is dirk pitt thats what the fine print reads on the birth certificate it seems you are an uncommonly durable man mr pitt it was my understanding that you were dead it just goes to prove you cant rely on shipboard gossip pitt took off his damp jacket and gently draped it over danas shoulders sorry dear heart its the best i can do for the moment then he turned back to prevlov any objections prevlov shook his head pitts offhand manner puzzled him he scrutinized pitt as a diamond cutter studies a stone but saw nothing behind the veil of those seagreen eyes prevlov gestured to one of his men who moved up to pitt simply a precautionary search mr pitt any objections pitt shrugged agreeably and held his hands in the air the guard quickly efficiently ran his hands up and down pitts clothing and then stepped back and shook his head no arms prevlov said very wise of you but then i would have expected nothing less from a man of your reputation i have read with considerable interest a dossier describing your exploits i would have liked very much to have known you under less adversary circumstances sorry i cant return the compliment pitt said pleasantly but youre not exactly the type of vermin id like for a friend prevlov stepped forward two paces and hit pitt with all his strength with the back of his hand pitt staggered back one step and stood there a trickle of blood oozing from one corner of his still grinning lips well well he said quietly thickly the illustrious andre prevlov finally blew his cool prevlov leaned forward his eyes halfclosed in wary speculation my name his voice was barely above a murmur you know my name fair is fair pitt answered i know as much about you as you know about me youre even cleverer than i was led to believe prevlov said youve discovered my identityan astute piece of perception on that i commend you but you neednt bluff with knowledge you do not possess beyond my name you know nothing i wonder perhaps i can enlighten you further with a bit of local folklore i have no patience for fairy tales prevlov said he motioned to the guard with the knife now if we can get on about the business of persuading admiral sandecker to inspire your pumping crew to greater efforts i would be most grateful the guard a tall man his face still hidden under the muffler began advancing toward dana once more he extended the knife its blade gleamed in the light no more than three inches from danas left breast she hugged pitts jacket tightly around her shoulders and stared at the knife numbed beyond fear too bad youre not big on fairy tales pitt said conversationally this is one youd have enjoyed its all about a pair of bumbling characters called silver and gold prevlov glanced at him hesitated and then nodded the guard back you have my attention mr pitt i will give you five minutes to prove your point it wont take long pitt said he paused to rub the eye that had caked closed from the hardening blood now then once upon a time there were two canadian engineers who discovered that spying could be a lucrative sideline so they shed all qualms of guilt and became professional espionage agents in every sense of the word concentrating their talents on obtaining classified data about american oceanographic programs and sending it through hidden channels to moscow silver and gold earned their money make no mistake over the past two years there wasnt a numa project the russians didnt have knowledge of down to the tiniest detail then when the titanics salvage came up the soviet navys department of foreign intelligence your department prevlov smelled a windfall without the slightest degree of chicanery you found yourself with not one but two men in your employ who were in a perfect situation to obtain and pass along americas most advanced deepwatersalvage techniques there was of course another vital consideration but even you werent aware of it at the time silver and gold pitt went on sent regular reports concerning the raising of the wreck through an ingenious method they used a batterypowered pinger a device that can transmit underwater sound waves similar to sonar i should have caught on to it when the capricorns sonar man detected the transmissions but instead i dismissed it as loose debris caused by a deep water current knocking about the titanic the fact that someone was sending out coded messages never entered our heads nobody bothered to decipher the random noises nobody that is except the man sitting under a set of hydrophones on board the mikhail kurkov pitt paused and glanced about the dining saloon he had everyones attention we didnt begin to smell either rat until henry munk felt the need for a poorly timed call of nature on his way back to the head at the aft end of the sappho ii he heard the pinging device in operation and investigated he caught one of the agents in the act your man probably tried to lie his way out of it but henry munk was an instrument specialist he recognized a communications pinger when he saw one and quickly figured the game it was a case of the cat killing curiosity munk had to be silenced and he was from a blow to the base of the skull by one of woodsons camera tripods this created an awkward situation for the murderer so he bashed munks head against the alternator housing to make it look like an accident however the fish didnt take the bait woodson was suspicious i was suspicious and to top it off doc bailey found the bruise on munks neck but since there was no way of proving who the killer was i decided to string along with the accident story until i could scratch up enough evidence to point an accusing finger later i went back and searched the submersible and discovered one slightly used and very bent camera tripod along with the pinging device where our friendly neighborhood spy had ironically hidden them in munks own storage locker certain that it was a waste of time to have them checked on shore for fingerprintsi didnt need a bolt from the blue to tell me i was dealing with a professionali left the tripod and the pinger exactly as i found them i took the chance that it would only be a matter of time before your agent got complacent and began contacting the mikhail kurkov again so i waited a fascinating story prevlov said but very circumstantial absolute proof would have been impossible to come by pitt smiled enigmatically and continued the proof came through a process of elimination i was relatively sure the killer had to be one of the three men on board the submersible who were supposedly asleep during their rest period i then alternated the sappho iis crew schedule every few days so that two of them had duties on the surface while the third was diving below on the wreck when our sonar man picked up the next transmission from the pinger i had munks murderer who is it pitt spencer asked grimly there are ten of us here was it one of us pitt locked eyes for an instant with prevlov and then turned suddenly and nodded at one of the weary men huddled under the lamps i regret that the only introductory fanfare i can offer is the pounding of the waves against the hull but bear with me and take a bow anyway drummer it may well be your final encore before you toast in the electric chair ben drummer gunn gasped i cant believe it not with him sitting there all battered and bloody after attacking woodsons killer local color pitt said it was too early to raise the curtain on his identity not at least until we had all walked the plank until then prevlov needed an informer to blow the whistle on any ideas we might have dreamed up for retaking the ship he fooled me said giordino hes worked harder than any two men on the crew to keep the titanic floating has he pitt came back sure hes looked busy even managed to work up a sweat and get dirty but what have you actually seen him accomplish since we came on board gunn shook his head but hes rather i thought that hed been working day and night surveying the ship surveying the ship hell drummer has been running around with a portable acetylene torch and cutting holes in her bottom i cant buy that said spencer why work at scuttling the ship if his russian chums want to lay their claws on her too a desperate gamble to delay the tow pitt answered timing was critical the only chance the russians had to board the titanic with any degree of success was during the eye of the hurricane it was clever thinking the possibility never occurred to us if the tugs could have towed the hulk without any complications wed have missed the eye by thirty miles but thanks to drummer the instability of the listing hull made the tow job a shambles before the cable parted she sheered all over the ocean forcing the tugs to reduce their speed to minimum steerage way and as you can see the mere presence of prevlov and his band of cutthroats attests to the success of drummers efforts the truth began to register then none of the salvage crew had actually witnessed drummer slaving over a pump or offering to carry his share of the load it registered that hed always been off on his own showing up only to complain of his frustration at not overcoming the obstacles that supposedly prevented his survey tour of the ship they stared at drummer as though he was some alien from another world waiting for expecting the indignant words of denial there was to be no denial no shocked plea of innocence only a flicker of annoyance that vanished as quickly as it had come drummers transformation was nothing short of astounding the sad droop to the eyes had disappeared they suddenly took on a glinting sharpness gone too was the lazy curl from the corners of his lips and the slouched indifferent posture of his body the indolent facade was gone and in its place was a straightshouldered almost aristocraticlooking man permit me to say pitt drummer said in a precise tone your powers of observation would do a firstclass espionage agent proud however you havent uncovered anything that really changes the situation fancy that pitt said our former colleague has suddenly lost his jubilation t cornpone accent i mastered it rather skillfully dont you think thats not all you mastered drummer somewhere in your budding career you learned how to win secrets and murder friends a necessity of the trade drummer said he had eased away from the salvage crew until he was standing beside prevlov tell me which one are you silver or gold not that it matters any longer drummer shrugged im gold then your brother is silver drummers smug expression hardened you know this he said slowly after i had you pegged i turned over my evidence meager as it was to the fbi i have to hand it to prevlov and his comrades at soviet naval intelligence they laid a phony history on you that was as american as apple pie or should i say georgia peach pie and seemingly as genuine as the confederate flag but the bureau finally broke through the false documents certifying your impeccable security clearance and tracked you all the way back to the old homestead in halifax nova scotia where you and your brother were born within ten minutes of each other i might add my god spencer muttered twins yes but nonidentical they dont even look like brothers so it became a simple case of one twin leading to the other spencer said hardly simple pitt replied theyre a smart pair drummer and his brother you cant take that away from them that was my prime mistake attempting to draw a parallel between two men who should have had the same likes and dislikes who shared the same quarters or who palled around together but silver and gold played opposite roles to the core drummer was equally chummy to everyone and lived alone i was at a dead end the fbi was trying to trace drummers brother while rechecking the security clearances of every member of the salvage crew but nobody could make a definite connection then a break in the form of neartragedy burst on the scene and pinned the tail on the donkey the deep fathom accident gunn said staring at drummer through cold unblinking eyes but drummer had no relation with the submersible he was on the crew of the sappho ii he had a very real relation you see his brother was on the deep fathom how did you guess that drummer asked twins have a curious bond they think and feel things as one you may have masqueraded as two totally unrelated persons drummer but the two of you were too close for one of you not to come unglued when the other was on the brink of death you felt your brothers agony just as surely as if you were trapped down there in the abyss with him of course gunn said we were all on edge at the time but drummer was damnnear hysterical again it became a process of elimination among three men this time chavez kiel and merker chavez is obviously of mexican descent and you cant fake that kiel is eight years too young you cant fake that either that left sam merker damn spencer muttered how could we have been taken in for so long not hard to imagine when you consider that we were up against the best team the russians could field a smile tugged at pitts lips incidentally spencer you previously stated that there were ten of us here you miscounted there are eleven you neglected to include jack the ripper there he turned to the guard who was still standing in front of dana still clutching the knife in his hand as if it had grown there why dont you drop your stupid disguise merker and join the party the guard slowly removed his cap and unwound the muffler that covered the lower half of his face hes the dirty bastard that knifed woodson giordino hissed sorry about that merker said calmly woodsons first mistake was in recognizing me he might have lived if he had let it go at that his second mistake and a very fatal one was attacking me woodson was your friend the business of espionage makes no allowances for friends merker sandecker said merker and drummer silver and gold i trusted you both and yet you sold numa down the river for two years you sold us and for what a few lousy dollars i wouldnt say a few admiral merker eased the knife back into its sheath more than enough to support my brother and me in fashionable style for a long time to come hey where did he come from gunn asked merker is supposed to be in doc baileys sick bay on board the capricorn he stowed away on sturgiss helicopter pitt said patting his bleeding head with a damp handkerchief cant be sturgis blurted out you were there pitt when i opened the cargo hatch except for mrs seagram the copter was empty merker was there all right after he gave doc bailey the slip he kept away from his own cabin and made for brother drummers quarters where he borrowed a fresh change of clothing including a pair of cowboy boots then he sneaked onto the helicopter threw out the emergency life raft and hid under its cover unfortunately for dana she happened along in search of her makeup kit when she knelt down to retrieve it her eye caught merkers boots protruding from under the life raft cover not about to let her screw up his escape he popped her on the head with a hammer hed found lying around somewhere wrapped her in a tarpaulin and crawled back into his hiding space that means he was still in the cargo compartment when we uncovered mrs seagram no by then he was gone if you recall after you switched open the cargo door we waited for a few moments listening for any movement inside there was none because merker had already crept into the control cabin under the cover of the noise from the dooractuator motors then when you and i played keystone kops and entered the cargo compartment he dropped down the cockpit ladder outside and walked peacefully into the night but why throw the hammer into the rotor blades sturgis persisted what was the purpose since you flew the copter from the capricorn empty merker said and there was no freight to unload i couldnt risk the chance of your taking off again without opening the cargo door you had me trapped back there and didnt know it you became a busy little beaver after that pitt said to merker flitting about the ship guided no doubt by a diagram provided by drummer first you took your brothers portable cutting rig and burned off the tow cable while chief bascom and his men were resting in the gymnasium between inspection tours next you cut the mooring lines to the helicopter taking great satisfaction im certain in knowing that it was swept over the side of the ship with me in it two birds with one slice merker admitted why deny merker was cut short by a muffled burst from a submachine gun that echoed from somewhere on the decks below prevlov shrugged and looked at sandecker i fear your men below are proving difficult he removed the cigarette from its holder and crushed it out with his boot i think this discussion has lasted long enough the storm will be abating in a few hours and the mikhail kurkov will move into position for the tow admiral sandecker you will see to it your men cooperate in manning the pumps drummer will show you the locations where hes pierced the hull below the waterline so that the rest of your crew can stem the leakage so its back to the torture games sandecker said contemptuously i am through playing games admiral prevlov had a determined look he spoke to one of the guards a short man with a coarsened toughness about him the same guard who had shoved his gun into sandeckers side this is buski a very direct fellow who happens to be the finest marksman in his regiment he also understands a smattering of english enough at any rate to translate numerical progression he turned to the guard buski i am going to begin counting when i reach five you will shoot mrs seagram in the right arm at ten in the left at fifteen in the right knee and so on until admiral sandecker mends his uncooperative ways a businesslike concept pitt added and youll shoot the rest of us after weve served your purpose weight our bodies and dump them in the sea so theyre never found then youll claim we abandoned the ship in the helicopter which of course conveniently crashed youd even provide two witnesses drummer and merker who would testify after their miraculous survival about how the benevolent russians plucked them from the sea just as they were going down for the third time i see no need to prolong the agony any further prevlov said tiredly buski buski raised his machine pistol and took aim at danas arm your intrigue me prevlov pitt said youve shown little interest in how i learned drummer and merkers code names or why i didnt have them thrown in the brig after i ferreted out their identities you dont even seem curious as to how i came to know your name curious yes but it makes no difference nothing can change the circumstances nothing and no one can help you and your friends pitt not now not the cia or the whole united states navy the die is cast there will be no more play with words prevlov nodded at buski one when captain prevlov reaches the count of four you will die buski buski leered smugly and made no reply two we knew your plans for taking the titanic admiral sandecker and i have known for the last fortyeight hours youve run your last bluff prevlov said three pitt shrugged indifferently then all blood is on your hands prevlov four an earshattering blam rang deafeningly through the dining saloon as the bullet caught buski just below the hairline and between the eyes catapulting a quarter of his skull in a crimson blur of slowmotion snapping his head upward and slamming him to the deck in an inert spreadeagle at prevlovs feet dana cried out in startled pain as she was slammed to the deck there were no apologies from pitt for throwing her there and then crushing the breath out of her as he used his hundred and ninety pounds for a protective shield giordino dove for sandecker and hauled him down with all the intensity of a desperation tackle by a linebacker for the green bay packers the rest of the salvage crew wasted no more than a tenth of a second in demonstrating their fondness for selfpreservation they scattered and dropped like leaves in a windstorm closely followed by drummer and merker who fell as though shackled together the blast was still ringing in the far corners of the room when the guards came alive and began firing bursts from their submachine pistols into the darkness toward the diningsaloon entrance it was a meaningless gesture the first was cut down almost instantly pitching forward on his face the second flung his machine pistol into the air and clutched the river of red that burst from his neck while the third sank slowly to his knees staring dumbly at the two small holes that had suddenly appeared in the center of his coat now prevlov stood alone he stared down at them all and then at pitt his expression was one of acceptance acceptance of defeat and death he nodded a salute at pitt and then calmly pulled his automatic from the holster and began firing into the darkness he expended his clip and stood there waiting for the gun flash braced for the pain that must surely come but there was no return fire the room went silent everything seemed to slow down and only then did the revelation burst on him he was not meant to die it had been a trap and he had walked into it as naively as a small child into a tigers den a name began to tear at his very soul taunting him repeating itself over and over again marganin marganin marganin a marine seal is usually defined as an aquatic carnivorous mammal with webbed flippers and soft fur but the wraithlike phantoms who suddenly materialized around prevlov and the fallen guards bore little resemblance to their name sake the united states navy seal an acronym of sea air and land were members of an extraordinary elite fighting group trained in every phase of combat from underwater demolition to jungle warfare there were five of them encased in pitchblack rubber wetsuits hoods and tight slipperlike boots their faces were indistinguishable under the ebony warpaint making it all but impossible to tell where the wetsuits left off and flesh began four men held m automatic rifles with collapsible stocks while the fifth tightly gripped a stoner weapon a wicked looking affair with two barrels one of the seals detached himself from the rest and helped pitt and dana to their feet oh god dana moaned ill be black and blue for a month for perhaps five dazed seconds she massaged her aching body oblivious to the fact that pitts jacket had come open when shocked realization did come when she saw the guards sprawled grotesquely in death hervoice dropped to a whisper oh shit oh shit i think its safe to say the lady survived pitt said with a half grin he shook the seals hand then introduced him to sandecker who was unsteadily clutching giordinos shoulder for support admiral sandecker may i present our deliverer lieutenant fergus united states navy seals sandecker acknowledged ferguss smart salute with a pleased nod released his hold on giordino and stood ramrod straight the ship lieutenant who commands the ship unless im mistaken sir you do ferguss words were punctuated by another burst of echoing gunfire from somewhere in the cavernous depths of the ship the last stubborn holdout fergus smiled it was obvious his white teeth gleamed like a neon sign at midnight the ship is secure sir my ironclad guarantee on it and the pumping crew safe and sound and back at their work how many men in your command two combat units admiral ten men in all including myself sandeckers eyebrows raised only ten men did you say ordinarily for an assault of this nature fergus said matteroffactly wed have used just one combat unit but admiral kemper thought it best to double our force to be on the safe side the navys advanced some since i served sandecker said wistfully any casualties pitt asked until five minutes ago two of my men wounded nothing serious and one missing where did you come from the question was from merkers lips he was staring malevolently over the shoulder of a wary seal there was no ship in the area no aircraft was sighted how fergus looked at pitt questioningly pitt nodded permission granted to inform our former colleague the facts of life lieutenant he can muse over your answers while hes sitting in a cell on death row we came aboard the hard way fergus obliged from fifty feet below the surface through the torpedo tubes of a nuclear submarine thats how i lost one of my men the water was rough as hell a wave must have crushed him against the titanics hull while we were taking turns climbing the boarding ladders dropped over the side by mr pitt strange that no one else saw you come on board spencer murmured not strange at all pitt said while i was helping lieutenant fergus and his team come over the aft cargo deck bulwarks and then tucking thern away in the chief stewards old cabin on c deck the rest of you were assembled in the gymnasium awaiting my soulstirring speech on personal sacrifice spencer shook his head talk about fooling all of the people some of the time i have to hand it to you gunn said you had us all flimflammed at that the russians nearly stole the ballgame we didnt expect them to make their play until the storm quieted down boarding during the lull of the hurricanes eye was a masterstroke and it almost worked without either giordino or the admiral or me to warn the lieutenantwe three were the only ones privy to the seals presencefergus would have never known when to launch his attack on the boarders i dont mind admitting sandecker said for a while there i thought that wed had it giordino and i prisoners of prevlov and pitt thought to be dead god knows pitt said if the helicopter hadnt wedged itself into the promenade deck id be asleep in the deep right now as it was fergus said mr pitt looked like death warmed over when he stumbled in the chief stewards cabin a hardy man this one halfdrowned his head split open and yet he still insisted on guiding my team through this floating museum until we located your soviet visitors dana was looking at pitt in a peculiar way how long were you hiding in the shadows before you made your grand entrance pitt grinned slyly for a minute prior to your striptease you bastard you stood there and let me make an ass out of myself she flared you let them use me like i was a cut of beef in a butcher store window i used you too dear heart as a matter of necessity after i found woodsons body and the smashed radio in the gymnasium i didnt need a gypsy to tell me the boys from the ukraine had boarded the ship i then rounded up fergus and his men and led them down to the boiler rooms figuring the russians would already be guarding the pumping crew i was right first priorities first whoever controlled the pumps controlled the derelict when i saw that i would be more hindrance than help in overcoming the guards i borrowed a seal and came looking for the rest of you after wandering through half the ship we finally heard voices coming out of the dining saloon then i ordered the seal to hightail it below for reinforcements then it was all a great big stalling tactic dana said exactly i needed every second i could beg borrow or steal until fergus showed up and evened the odds thats why i held off until the last second to put in an appearance a high stakes gamble sandecker said you cut act two a bit fine didnt you i had two things going for me pitt explained one was compassion i know you admiral in spite of your gargoyle exterior you still help little old ladies across streets and feed stray animals you might have waited until the last instant to give in but you would have given in then pitt put his arms around dana and slowly produced a nasty looking weapon from a pocket of the jacket draped on her shoulders number two was my insurance policy fergus loaned it to me before the party began its called a stoner weapon it shoots a cloud of tiny needlelike flachettes i could have cut down prevlov and half his men with one burst and i thought you were being a gentleman dana said with a contrived bitter tone you only hung your jacket on me so they wouldnt find the gun when they searched you you have to admit that your ahem exposed condition made for an ideal distraction beggin your pardon sir said chief bascom but why on earth would this rusty old bucket of bolts interest the russians my very thoughts spencer added whats the big deal i guess its a secret no longer pitt shrugged its not the ship the russians were after its a rare element called byzanium that sank with the titanic back in properly processed and installed in a sophisticated defense system so im told it will make intercontinental ballistic missiles about as outdated as flying dinosaurs chief bascom let out a long low whistle and you mean to say that stuff is still below decks somewhere buried under several tons of debris but its still down there youll never live to see it pitt none of you none of us will the titanic will be totally destroyed by morning there was no anger in prevlovs face but something touching on complacent satisfaction did you really think every contingency was not allowed for every possibility for failure not backed up by an alternate plan if we cannot have the byzanium then neither can you pitt looked at him with what seemed to be bemusement forget any hopes you entertain of the cavalry or in your case the cossacks galloping to the rescue prevlov you made a hell of a try but you were playing against an american idiom known as a stacked deck you prepared for everything everything that is except a setup in preparation for a double cross i dont know how the scheme was nurtured it must have been a wonder of creative cunning and you fell for it hook line and sinker im sorry captain prevlov but to the victor belong the spoils the byzanium belongs to the russian people prevlov said gravely it was raped from our soil by your government it is not we who are the robbers pitt it is you a moot point if it were a work of historical art my state department would no doubt see it off on the next ship back to murmansk but not when its the prime ingredient for a strategic weapon if our roles were reversed prevlov you wouldnt give it away any more than we would then it must be destroyed youre wrong a weapon that does not take lives but simply protects them must never be destroyed your kind of sanctimonious philosophy simply affirms what our leaders have known all along you cannot win against us someday in the not too distant future your precious experiment in democracy will go the way of the greek senate a piece of an era for students of communism to study nothing more dont hold your breath comrade your kind will have to show a lot more finesse before you can run the world read your history prevlov said with an ominous smile the people whom the sophisticated nations down through the centuries have referred to as the barbarians have always won in the end pitt smiled back courteously as the seals herded prevlov merker and drummer up the grand staircase to a stateroom where they would be secured under heavy guard but pitts smile was not genuine prevlov was right the barbarians always won in the end southby june hurricane amanda was dying slowly but inevitably what would long be remembered as the great blow of had cut its devastating swath across three thousand miles of ocean in three and a half days and it had yet to deliver its final apocalyptic blow like the final burst of a supernova before disintegrating into obscurity it suddenly swung on an eastward track and slammed into the avalon peninsula of newfoundland lashing the coast from cape race north to pouch cove in minutes one town after another was inundated by the fallout from the storms cloud mass several small seashore villages were swept out to sea by the runoff that came thundering down into the valleys fishing boats were driven onto land and battered into unrecognizable shattered hulks roofs were blown off downtown buildings in st johns as its city streets were turned into rushing rivers from the deluge water and electricity were cut off for days and until rescue ships arrived food was at a premium and had to be rationed no hurricane on record had ever unleashed such raw fury that its winds would carry it so far so fast with such terrible velocity no one would ever evaluate the enormous cost of the damage estimates ran as high as million of this million represented the almost totally destroyed newfoundland fishing fleets nine ships were lost at sea six with no survivors the death toll behind the storms wake ran between and in the early hours of friday morning dr ryan prescott sat alone in the main office of the numa hurricane center hurricane amanda had finally run her course accomplished her destruction taken her lives and only now was she dissipating over the gulf of st lawrence the battle was over there was nothing more the weathermen at the center could do after seventytwo hours of frenzied tracking and nonsleep they had all straggled home to bed prescott stared through tired and bloodshot eyes at the desks strewn with charts data tables computer readout sheets and halfempty coffee cups the floors carpeted with sheets of paper filled with notations and the strange looking symbols common to meteorologists he stared at the giant wall map and silently cursed the storm the sudden swing to eastward had caught them all by surprise a completely illogical pattern it was unparalleled in hurricane history no storm on record had ever behaved so erratically if only it had given some hint of its impending deviation some minute clue as to its fanatical behavior they might have better prepared the people of newfoundland for the onslaught at least half a hundred and fifty lives might have been spared a hundred and fifty men women and children might have been alive now if the finest scientific sources available for weather prediction had not been swept aside like so much hokum at mother natures capricious whim prescott rose and took his last look at the wall chart before the janitors came and erased hurricane amanda out of existence and wiped clean her confounding track in preparation for her as yet unborn descendant one small notation out of all the rest caught his eye it was a small cross labeled titanic the last report hed had from numa headquarters in washington was that the derelict was in tow by two navy tugs that were desperately attempting to drag her out from under the path of the hurricane nothing more had been heard of her for twentyfour hours prescott raised a cup of cold coffee in a toast to the titaniche said aloud in that empty room may you have taken every punch amanda threw at you and still spit in her eye he grimaced as he downed the stale coffee then he turned and walked out of the room into the earlymorning dampness at first light the titanic still lived there was no rhyme or reason for her continued existence she still wallowed aimlessly broadsideon to the sea and wind trapped in the churning turmoil of the tormented waves left in the wake of the departing hurricane like a dazed fighter taking a fearful beating while hanging on the ropes she rose drunkenly over the thirtyfoot crests shouldering each one taking salt spray across her boat deck and then struggling free and somehow staggering upright in time for the next assault to captain parotkin as he stared through his binoculars the titanic looked a doomed ship her rusty old hull plates had been subjected to a stress far beyond anything he thought they could stand he could see the popped rivets and opened seams and he guessed that she was taking water in a hundred places along her hull what he could not see were the exhausted men of the salvage crew the seals and the navy tugmen laboring shoulder to shoulder deep in the black hell under the waterline in a desperate effort to keep the derelict afloat from parotkins viewpoint safe from the elements inside the wheelhouse of the mikhail kurkov it seemed a miracle that the titanic hadnt vanished during the night yet she still clung to life even though she was down a good twenty feet at the bow and was listing nearly thirty degrees to starboard any word from captain prevlov he asked without taking his eyes from the glasses nothing sir answered his first officer i fear the worst has happened parotkin said i see no sign that prevlov is in command of the derelict there sir the first officer said pointing atop the remains of the aft mast it looks like a russian pennant parotkin studied the tiny frayed cloth through the glasses as it snapped in the wind unfortunately the star on the pennant is white rather than the red of our soviet ensign he sighed i must assume that the boarding mission has failed perhaps comrade prevlov has had no time to report his situation there is no time left american search planes will be here within the hour parotkin pounded his fist in frustration on the bridge counter damn prevlov he muttered angrily let us fervently hope our final option will not be required his exact words he is the fortunate one he may even be dead and it is i who must take the responsibility for destroying the titanic and all who remain on board her the first officers face paled his body stiffened there is alternative sir parotkin shook his head the orders were clear we must obliterate the ship rather than let her fall into the hands of americans parotkin took a linen handkerchief from his pocket and wiped his eyes have the crew ready the nuclear missile carrier and steer a course ten miles north of the titanic for our firing position the first officer stared at parotkin for a long moment his face void of expression then he slowly wheeled and made for the radio telephone and ordered the helmsman to steer fifteen degrees to the north thirty minutes later all was in readiness the mikhail kurkov dug her bow into the swells at the position laid for the missile launch as parotkin stood behind the radar operator any hard sightings he asked eight jet aircraft a hundred and twenty miles west closing rapidly surface vessels two small ships bearing twofourfive twentyone miles southwest that would be the tugs returning the first officer said parotkin nodded its the aircraft that concern me they will be over us in ten minutes is the nuclear warhead armed yes sir then begin the countdown the first officer gave the order over the phone and then they moved outside and watched from the starboard bridge wing as the forward cargo hatch swung smoothly aside and a twentysixfoot stoski surfacetosurface missile slowly rose from its concealed tube into the gusty dawn air one minute to firing came a missile technicians voice over the bridge speaker parotkin aimed his glasses at the titanic in the distance he could just make out her outline against the gray clouds that crawled along the horizon a barely perceptible shiver gripped his body his eyes reflected a distant sad look he knew he would be forever cursed among sailors as the captain who sent the helpless and resurrected ocean liner back to her grave beneath the sea he was standing braced and waiting for the roar of the missiles rocket engine and then the great explosion that would pulverize the titanic into thousands of molten particles when he heard the sound of running footsteps from the wheelhouse and the radio operator burst onto the bridge wing captain he blurted an urgent signal from an american submarine thirty seconds to firing the voice droned over the intercom there was unmistakable panic in the radio operators eyes as he thrust the message into parotkins hands it read uss dragonfish to ussr mikhail kurkov derelict vessel rms titanic under protection of united states navy any overt act of aggression on your part will result in immediate repeat immediate retaliatory attack signed captain uss submarine dragonfish ten seconds and counting came the disembodied voice of the missile technician over the speaker seven six parotkin looked up with the clear unworried expression of a man who has just received a million rubles through the mail five four three stop the countdown he ordered in precise tones so there could be no misunderstanding no misinterpretation stop countdown the first officer repeated into the bridge phone his face beaded with sweat and secure the missile good parotkin said curtly a smile spread across his face not exactly what i was told to do but i think soviet naval authorities will see it my way after all the mikhail kurkov is the finest ship of her kind in the world we wouldnt want to throw her away because of a senseless and foolish order from a man who is undoubtedly dead now would we i am in complete accord the first officer smiledback our superiors will also be interested to learn that in spite of all our sophisticated detection gear we failed to discover the presence of an alien submarine practically on our doorstep american undersea penetration methods must truly be highly advanced i feel sure the americans will be just as interested in learning that our oceanographic research vessels carry concealed missiles your orders sir parotkin watched the stoski missile as it sank back into its tube set a course for home he turned and peered across the sea in the direction of the titanic what had happened to prevlov and his men were they alive or dead would he ever know the true facts overhead the clouds began turning from gray to white and the wind dropped to a brisk breeze a solitary sea gull emerged from the brightening sky and began circling the soviet ship then as if heeding a more urgent call to the south it dipped its wings and flew off toward the titanic were done in spencer said in a voice so low that pitt wasnt sure he heard him say again were done in he repeated through slack lips his face was smeared with oil and a rustlike slime its a hopeless case weve plugged most of the holes drummer opened with his cutting torch but the sea has battered the hull all to hell and the old girl is taking water faster than a sieve weve got to keep her on the surface until the tugs return pitt said if they can add their pumps to ours we can stay ahead of the leaks until the damage can be patched its a damned miracle that she didnt go down hours ago how much time can you give me pitt demanded spencer stared wearily down at the water sloshing around his ankles the pump engines are running on fumes now when their fuel tanks are sucked dry the pumps will die a cold hard sad fact he looked up into pitts face an hour maybe an hour and a half i cant promise any more than that when the pumps go and if you had enough fuel to keep the diesels going i could probably keep her on the surface without assistance until noon spencer answered how much fuel will it take two hundred gallons would do nicely they both looked up as giordino plunged down a companionway and splashed into the water covering the deck of the no boiler room talk about frustration he moaned there are eight aircraft up there circling the ship six navy fighters and two radar recon planes ive tried everything except standing on my head and exposing myself and all they do is wave every time they make a pass pitt shook his head in mock sadness remind me never to play charades on your team im open for suggestions giordino said suppose you tell me how to notify some guy whos flying by at four hundred miles an hour that we need help and lots of it pitt scratched his chin theres got to be a practical solution sure giordino said sarcastically just call the automobile club for a service call pitt and spencer stared with widened eyes at each other the same thought had suddenly occurred to them in the same instant brilliance spencer said sheer brilliance if we cant get to a service station pitt said grinning then the service station must come to us giordino looked lost fatigue has queered your minds he said where are you going to find a pay phone what will you use for a radio the russians smashed ours the one in the helicopter is soaked through and prevlovs transmitter caught two bullets during the brawl he shook his head and you can forget those flyboys upstairs without a brush and bucket of paint theres no way to get a message across to their eager little minds thats your problem spencer said loftily you always go around looking up when you should be looking down pitt leaned over and picked up a sledgehammer that was lying among a pile of tools this should do the trick he said casually swinging the sledge against one of the titanics hull plates sending a cacophony of echoes throughout the boiler room spencer dropped wearily onto a raised boiler grating they aint going to believe this oh i dont know pitt managed between swings jungle telegraph it always used to work in the congo giordino was probably right fatigue has queered our minds pitt ignored spencer and kept hammering away after a few minutes he paused a moment to get a new grip on the sledge handle let us hope and pray that one of the natives has his ear to the ground he said between pants and then he went on hammering of the two sonar operators who were on watch aboard the submarine dragonfish the one tuned into the passive listening system was leaning forward toward his panel his head cocked to one side his mind intent on analyzing the strange beat that emitted through the earphones then he gave a slight shake of his head and held up the earphones for the officer who was standing at his shoulder at first i thought it was a hammerhead shark the sonarman said they make a funny pounding noise but this has a definite metallic ring to it the officer pressed the headset against one ear then his eyes took on a puzzled look it sounds like an sos thats how i read it sir someone is knocking out a distress call against their hull where is it coming from the sonarman turned a miniature steering wheel that activated the sensors in the bow of the sub and eyed the panel in front of him the contact is threezeroseven degrees two thousand yards north of west it has to be the titanic sir with the departure of the mikhail kurkov shes the only surface craft left in the area the officer handed back the earphones turned from the sonar compartment and made his way up a wide curving stairway into the conning tower the nerve center of the dragonfish he approached a mediumheight roundfaced man with a graying mustache who wore the oak leaves of a commander on his collar its the titanic all right sir shes hammering out an sos theres no mistake no sir the contact is firm the officer paused and then asked are we going to respond the commander looked thoughtful for a few moments our orders were to deliver the seal and fend off the mikhail kurkov we were also to remain obscure in case the russians decide to make an end run with one of their own submarines wed be in poor position to protect the derelict if we were to surface and move off station during our last sighting she looked to be in pretty rough shape maybe shes going down if that was the case her crew would be screaming for help over every frequency on their radio the commander hesitated his eyes narrowing he stepped over to the radio room and leaned in what time was the last communication sent from the titanic one of the radio operators scanned a sheet in a log book a few minutes shy of eighteen hundred hours yesterday commander they requested an uptotheminute report of the hurricanes speed and direction the commander nodded and turned back to the officer they havent transmitted for over twelve hours could be their radio is out its quite possible wed better have a look the commander said up periscope the periscope tubing hummed slowly into the raised position the commander gripped the handles and stared through the eyepiece looks quiet enough he said shes got a heavy list to starboard and shes down by the bow but not bad enough to be considered dangerous yet no distress flags flying no one in sight on her deckswait a moment i take that back theres a man atop the bridgehouse roof the commander increased the magnification good lord he muttered its a woman the officer stared at him with a disbelieving expression you did say a woman sir see for yourself the officer saw for himself there was indeed a young blond woman above the titanics bridgehouse she seemed to be waving a brassiere ten minutes later the dragonfish had surfaced and was lying under the shadow of the titanic thirty minutes later reserve fuel from the subs auxiliary diesel engine was coursing through a pipe that arched across the still thrashing swells and passed neatly into a hastily cut hole in the titanics hull its from the dragonfish admiral kemper said reading the latest in a long line of communications her captain has sent a work party aboard the titanic to assist pitt and his salvage crew he states that the derelict should remain afloat even with numerous leaks during the tow providing of course shes not struck by another hurricane thank god for small favors marshall collins exhaled between yawns he also reports kemper went on that mrs seagram is on board the titanic and is in rare stage form whatever that means mel donner moved out of the bathroom a towel still draped over his arm would you repeat that admiral the captain of the dragonfish says that mrs dana seagram is alive and well donner rushed over and shook seagram who was sleeping fitfully on the couch gene wake up theyve found dana shes all right seagrams eyes blinked open and for long seconds he looked up at donner astonishment slowly spreading across his face dana dana is alive yes she must have been on the titanic during the storm but how did she get there we dont know all the details yet well just have to wait it out but the important thing is that dana is safe and the titanic is still afloat seagram hung his head in his hands and sat there huddled and shrunken he began sobbing quietly admiral kemper was thankful for the distraction when a very tired commander keith entered and handed him another signal this ones from admiral sandecker kemper said i think youll be interested in what he has to say mr nicholson warren nicholson and marshall collins both eased away from seagram and gathered around kempers desk sandecker says visiting relatives have been entertained and furnished with guest bedroom got something in my eye during the party last night but enjoyed belting out good old song favorites like silver threads among the gold say hello to cousin warren and tell him i have a present to give him having wonderful time wish you were all here signed sandecker it seems the admiral has a strange way with words said the president just what in hell is it hes trying to get across kemper stared at him sheepishly the russians apparently boarded during the eye of the hurricane apparently the president said icily silver threads among the gold nicholson said excitedly silver and gold theyve caught the two espionage agents and your present cousin warren collins said grinning with every tooth must be none other than captain andre prevlov its imperative that i get on board the derelict as soon as possible nicholson said to kemper how soon can you arrange transportation for me admiral kempers hand was already reaching for the phone inside thirty minutes i can have you on a navy jet that will land you on the beechers island from there you can take a helicopter to the titanic the president stepped over to a large window and gazed out at the rising sun as it crept above the eastern horizon and fingered its rays across the lazy waters of the potomac he yawned a long comfortable yawn dana leaned over the forward railing of the titanics bridge and closed her eyes the ocean breeze whipped her honey hair and tingled the skin on her upturned face she felt soothed and free and completely relaxed it was as though she were flying she knew now that she could never go back and slip into the painted puppet that had been the dana seagram of two days ago she had made up her mind she would divorce gene nothing between them mattered any more at least to her the girl he had loved was dead never to return she reveled in the knowledge it was her rebirth to begin again start fresh with no holds barred a dollar for your thoughts she opened her eyes and was greeted by the grinning and freshly shaven face of dirk pitt a dollar i thought it used to be a penny inflation strikes everything sooner or later they stood for a while without saying anything and watched the wallace and the morse as they strained at the great leash that led to the titanics bow chief bascom and his men were checking the tow cable and dabbing grease to the fairlead to ease the chafing the chief looked up and waved to them i wish this voyage would never end dana murmured as they both waved back its so strange and yet so wonderful she turned suddenly and laid her hand on his promise me well never see new york promise me that well sail on forever like the flying dutchman well sail on forever she flung her arms around his neck and pressed her body against his dirk dirk she whispered urgently nothing makes any sense any more i want you i want you now and i dont really know why its because of where you are pitt said quietly he took her by the hand and led her down the grand staircase and into one of the two parlour suite bedrooms on b deck there you are madame the finest suite of rooms on the entire ship cost for a oneway voyage came to better than four thousand dollars those were of course prices however in honor of the light in your eyes ill provide you with a handsome discount he swept her up and carried her to the bed it had been cleaned of the slime and rot and was covered with several blankets dana looked at the bed with wise eyes you prepared this lets just say that like the little old ant who moved the rubber tree plant i had high hopes you know what you are a bastard a lecher a satyr i could think of a dozen apt descriptions she looked at him with a secret womanly smile no youre none of those even a satyr would not have been so thoughtful he pulled her lips to his and kissed her so hard she moaned her performance in bed fooled him he expected a body that would merely give response instead he found himself merged with thrashing undulating waves of flesh piercing screams that he muffled with his hands nails that dug oozing red trenches in his back and finally soft wet sobbings into his neck he couldnt help wondering if all wives blossom with such abandon when they make love for the first time with someone other than their husbands the storm lasted for nearly an hour and the humid perfume of sweating skin began to soak the air of that old rotted ghostly bedroom finally she pushed him away and sat up she raised her knees and hunched herself over them feet crossed how was i like a spastic tiger pitt said i didnt know it could be like this i wish i had a dime for every girl who said those very same words every time she turned on you dont know what its like to have your guts churning in both agony and delight at the same time i dare say i dont a womans release burns from the inside a mans erotic senses are mostly exterior anyway you look at it sex is a females game what do you know about the president she suddenly asked in a soft nostalgic tone pitt looked at her in amused surprise the president what made you think of him at a time like this i hear hes a real man i couldnt say ive never slept with him she ignored his remark if we had a woman president and she wanted to make love to you what would you do my country right or wrong pitt said where is all this talk leading just answer the question would you go to bed with her depends on what president or not i couldnt make my gun stand at attention if she was seventy fat and had skin like a prune thats why men never make good prostitutes dana smiled slowly and closed her eyes make love to me again why so you can let your imagination run wild and fancy that youre being laid by our commanderinchief her eyes narrowed does that bother you two can play the same game ill just pretend that youre ashley fleming prevlov looked up from his huddled position on the floor of stateroom c as the seal guarding the passageway outside turned the newly oiled lock and swung the door open the seal his m held at the ready visually checked prevlov and then stepped aside to allow another man to enter he was carrying an attaché case and wore a business suit that begged to be pressed a faint smile crossed his lips as prevlov studied him with a speculative gaze of surprised recognition captain prevlov i am warren nicholson i know prevlov said as he uncoiled to his feet and gave a very correct halfbow i was not prepared to entertain the chief director of the central intelligence agency himself at least not under these rather awkward circumstances ive come personally to escort you to the united states i am flattered it is we who are flattered captain prevlov you are considered a very big catch indeed then it is to be an internationally publicized trial complete with grave accusations against my government for attempted piracy on the high seas nicholson smiled again no except for a few highranking members of your government and mine im afraid your defection will remain a wellkept secret prevlov squinted defection this was clearly not what he had expected nicholson nodded without answering there is no method by which you can make me willingly defect prevlov said grimly i shall deny it at every opportunity a noble gesture nicholson shrugged however since there will be no trial and no interrogation a request for political asylum becomes your only escape clause you said no interrogation i must accuse you of lying mr nicholson no good intelligence service would ever pass up the chance of prying out the knowledge a man of my position could provide them what knowledge nicholson said you cant tell us anything that we dont already know prevlovs mind was offbalance perspective he thought he must gain a perspective there was only one way the americans could have gained possession of the mass of soviet intelligence secrets that were locked away in the files in his office in moscow the middle of the puzzle was incomplete but the borders were neatly locked into place he met nicholsons steady gaze and spoke quietly lieutenant marganin is one of your people it was more statement than question yes nicholson nodded his name is harry koskoski and he was born in newark new jersey not possible prevlov said i personally checked every phase of pavel marganins life he was born and raised in komsomolsknaamure his family were tailors true the real marganin was a native russian then your man is a double a plant we arranged it four years ago when one of your kashin class missile destroyers exploded and sank in the indian ocean marganin was one of the few survivors he was discovered in the water by an exxon oil tanker but died shortly before the ship docked in honolulu it was a rare opportunity and we had to work fast of all our russian speaking agents koskoski came the closest to marganins physical features we surgically altered his face to make it look as though it had been disfigured in the explosion and then airlifted him to a small outoftheway island two hundred miles from where your ship sank when our bogus soviet seaman was finally discovered by native fishermen and returned to russia he was delirious and suffering from an acute attack of amnesia i know the rest prevlov said solemnly we not only repaired his face through plastic surgery to that of the genuine marganin but we reeducated him to his own personal history as well thats pretty much the story a brilliant coup mr nicholson coming from one of the most respected men in soviet intelligence i consider that a rare compliment indeed then this whole scheme to place me on the titanic was hatched by the cia and carried through by marganin koskoski alias marganin was certain you would accept the plan and you did prevlov gazed at the deck he might have known he might have guessed should have been suspicious from the beginning that marganin was slowly and intricately positioning his neck on the headmans block he should never have fallen for it never but his vanity had been his downfall and he accepted it where does this all lead prevlov asked bleakly by now marganin has produced solid proof of yourif youll pardon the expressiontraitorous activities and has also proven aided by planted evidence that you intended for the titanic mission to fail from the start you see captain the trail leading to your defection has been carefully mapped for nearly two years you yourself helped matters considerably with your fondness for expensive refinements your superiors can draw but one conclusion from your actions you sold out for a very high price and if i deny it who would believe you i venture to say that your name is already on the soviet liquidation list then whats to become of me now you have two choices one we can set you free after a proper period of time i wouldnt last a week i am well aware of the kgb assassin network your second choice is to cooperate with us nicholson paused hesitated then looked directly at prevlov youre a brilliant man captain the best in your field we dont like to let good brains go to waste i dont have to paint you a picture of your value to the western intelligence community thats why its my intention to set you up in charge of a new task force a line of work you should find right up your alley i suppose i should be grateful for that prevlov said dryly your facial appearance will be altered of course youll get a cram course in english and american idioms along with our history sports music and entertainment in the end there wont be the slightest trace of your former shell for the kgb to home in on interest began to form in prevlovs eyes your salary will be forty thousand a year plus expenses and a car forty thousand dollars prevlov asked trying to sound casual that will buy quite a bit of bombay gin nicholson grinned like a wolf sitting down to dinner with a wary rabbit i think that if you really try captain prevlov you might come to enjoy the pleasures of our westernstyle decadence dont you agree prevlov said nothing for several moments but the choice was obvious constant fear versus a long and pleasurable life you win nicholson nicholson shook hands and was mildly surprised to see tears welling in prevlovs eyes the final hours of the long tow brought a clear and sunny sky with a wandering wind that gently nudged the long ocean swells shoreward and brushed their green curving backs ever since dawn four coast guard ships had been busy riding herd on the huge fleet of pleasure craft that darted in and out vying for a closer look at the seaworn decks and superstructure of the hulk high over the crowded waters hordes of light aircraft and helicopters swarmed like hornets their pilots jockeying to give photographers and cameramen the perfect angle from which to shoot the titanic from five thousand feet higher the still listing ship looked like a macabre carcass that was under attack from all sides by armadas of gnats and white ants the thomas j morse reeled in her tow wire from the bow of the samuel r wallace and fell back to the derelicts stem here she attached a hawser and then eased astern to assist steering the unwieldy bulk through the verrazano narrows and up the east river to the old brooklyn navy yard several harbor tugs also appeared and stood by to lend hand if called upon when commander butera gave orders to shorten the main tow cable to two hundred yards the pilot boat arrived within inches of the bulwarks of the wallace and the pilot leaped aboard then it passed on by and thumped against the rusty plates of the titanic separated only by worn truck tires that hung along the smaller boats freeboard within half a minute the new york harbor chief pilot had clutched a rope ladder and was scrambling up to the cargo deck pitt and sandecker greeted him and then led the way up to the port bridge wing where the chief pilot placed both hands on the railing as though he were part of it and solemnly nodded for the tow to carry on pitt waved and butera punched his whistle in reply then the tug commander ordered slow ahead and aimed the bow of the wallace into the main channel under the verrazano bridge that arches from long island to staten island as the strange convoy probed its nose into upper new york bay butera began pacing from one side of the tugs bridge to the other studying the hulk the wind and the current and the tow cable with the dedication of a brain surgeon who is about to perform a delicate operation since the night before thousands of people had lined the waterfront manhattan had come to a standstill streets emptied and office buildings suddenly became silent as workers crowded the windows in hushed awe as the tow crawled up the harbor on the shore of staten island peter hull a reporter from the new york times began his story ghosts do exist i know i saw one in the mists of morning like some grotesque phantom that had been rejected from hell she passed before my unbelieving eyes surrounded by the invisible pall of bygone tragedy shrouded in the souls of her dead she was truly an awesome relic from a past age you could not lay your eyes upon her and not sense pride and sorrow together a cbs commentator expressed a more journalistic view the titanic completed her maiden voyage today seventysix years after departing the dock at southampton england by noon the titanic was edging past the statue of liberty and a vast sea of spectators on the battery no one on shore spoke above a whisper and the city became strangely silent only an occasional toot from a taxi horn gave any hint of normal activity it was as though the whole of new york city had been picked up and placed in a vast cathedral many of the watchers wept openly among them were three of the passengers who had survived the tragic night so long ago the air seemed heavy and hard to breathe most people describing their feelings later were surprised to recall nothing but an odd sense of numbness as though they had been temporarily paralyzed and struck dumb most that is except a rugged fireman by the name of arthur mooney mooney was the captain of one of the new york harbor fireboats a big mischiefeyed irishman born of the city and a seagoing fireeater for nineteen years he slammed a massive fist against the binnacle and shook off the spell then he shouted to his crew up off your asses boys youre not department store dummies his voice carried into every corner of the boat mooney hardly ever required the services of a bullhorn this heres a ship arrivin on her maiden voyage aint she then lets show her a good oldfashioned traditional new york welcome but skipper a crew member protested its not like she was the qe ii or the normandie comin up the channel for the first time that thing is nothin but a wasted hulk a ship of the dead wasted hulk your ass mooney shouted that ship you see there is the most famous liner of all time so shes a little delapidated and shes arrivin a tad late so who gives a damn turn on the hoses and hit the siren it was a reenactment of the titanics raising all over again but on a much grander scale as the water spouted in great sheets over mooneys fireboat and his boat whistle reverberated off the citys skyscrapers another fireboat followed his example and another then whistles on docked freighters began to scream then the horns of cars lined up along the shores of new jersey manhattan and brooklyn joined the outpouring of noise followed by the cheers and yells from a million throats what had begun with the insignificant shrill of a single whistle now built and built until it was a thunderous bedlam of sound that shook the ground and rattled every window in the city it was a moment that echoed across every ocean of the world the titanic had made port thousands of greeters jammed the dock where the titanic was tied up the swarming antlike mass was made up of newspeople national dignitaries cordons of harried policemen and a multitude of uninvited who climbed the shipyard fence any attempt at security was futile a battery of reporters and cameramen stormed up the makeshift gangplank and surrounded admiral sandecker who stood like a victorious caesar on the steps of the main staircase rising from the reception room on d deck this was sandeckers big moment and a team of wild horses couldnt have dragged him off the titanic this day he never missed an opportunity to snatch good publicity in the name of the national underwater and marine agency and this was one occasion where he was going to milk every line of newsprint every second of national television for all they were worth he enthralled the reporters with highly colored exploits of the salvage crew and stared at the mobile camera units and smiled and smiled and smiled the admiral was in his own paradise pitt could have cared less about the fanfare his idea of paradise at the moment was a shower and a clean soft bed he pushed his way down the gangplank to the dock and melted into the crowd he thought hed almost gotten clear when a tv commentator rushed forward and thrust a microphone under his nose hey fella are you a member of the titanics salvage crew no i work for the shipyard pitt said waving like a yokel at the camera the commentators face fell cut it joe he yelled to his cameraman we grabbed a bummer then he turned and moved his way toward the ship shouting for the crowd to keep their feet off his mike cord six blocks and a whole halfhour later pitt finally found a cab driver who was more interested in hauling a fare than in ogling the derelict where to the driver asked pitt hesitated looking down at his grimly sweatstained shirt and pants under the torn and just as grimy windbreaker he didnt need a mirror to see the bloodshot eyes and five oclock shadow he could easily imagine himself as the perfect reflection of a bowery wino but then he figured what the hell hed just stepped off what was once the most prestigious ocean liner in the world whats the most luxurious and expensive hotel in town the pierre on fifth avenue and sixtyfirst aint cheap the pierre it is then the driver looked over his shoulder studied pitt and wrinkled his nose then he shrugged and pulled into the traffic he took less than a half hour to reach the curb in front of the pierre overlooking central park pitt paid off the cabby and walked through the revolving doors and up to the desk the clerk gave him a look of disgust that was a classic im sorry sir he said haughtily before pitt could open his mouth were all filled up pitt knew it would only be a matter of minutes before a mob of reporters discovered his whereabouts if he gave his real name he wasnt ready to face the ordeal of celebrity status yet all he wanted was uninterrupted sieep i am not what i appear pitt said trying to sound indignant i happen to be professor r malcolm smythe author and archaeologist i have just stepped off the plane after a fourmonth dig up the amazon and i havent had time to change my man will be here shortly with my luggage from the airport the desk clerk was instantly transformed into peaches and cream oh i am sorry professor smythe i didnt recognize you however were still filled up the city is crowded with people who came to see the arrival of the titanic im sure you understand it was a masterful performance he didnt buy pitt or one word of his fanciful tale ill vouch for the professor said a voice behind pitt give him your best suite and charge it to this address a card was thrown on the counter the desk clerk picked it up and read it and lit up like a roman candle then with a flourish he laid a registration card before pitt and produced a room key as if by sleight of hand pitt slowly turned and met a face that was every bit as worn and haggard as his the lips were turned up in a crooked smile of understanding but the eyes were dulled with the lost and vacant stare of a zombie it was gene seagram how did you track me down so fast pitt asked he was lying in a bathtub nursing a vodka on the rocks seagram sat across the bathroom on the john no great exercise in intuition he said i saw you leave the shipyard and followed you i thought youd be dancing on the titanic about now the ship means nothing to me my only concern is the byzanium in its vault and ive been told it will be another fortyeight hours before the derelict can be moved into dry dock and the wreckage in the cargo hold removed then why dont you relax for a couple of days and have some fun in a few weeks your problems will be over the sicilian project will be off the drawing boards and a working reality seagrams eyes closed for a moment i wanted to talk to you he said quietly i wanted to talk to you about dana oh god pitt thought here it comes how do you keep a straight face knowing you made love to the mans wife up to now it had been all he could do to maintain a casual tone in his conversation how is she getting along after her ordeal all right i suppose seagram shrugged you suppose she was airlifted off the ship by the navy two days ago havent you seen her since she came ashore she refuses to see me said it was all over between us pitt contemplated the vodka in the glass so its hearts and flowers time so who needs her if i were you seagram id find myself the most expensive hooker in town charge her off on your government expense account and forget dana you dont understand i love her god you sound like a letter to ann landers pitt reached for the bottle on the tiled floor and freshened his drink look seagram youre a pretty decent guy underneath your pompous bullshit facade and who knows you may go down in history as the great merciful scientist who saved mankind from a nuclear holocaust youve still got enough looks to attract a woman and im willing to bet that when you clean off your desk in washington and bid a fond farewell to government service youll be a rich man so dont expect tears and violins from me over a lost love youve got it made what good is it without the woman i love i see im not getting through to you pitt was one third into the bottle and a warm glow had begun to course through his body why throw yourself down the sewer over a broad who suddenly thinks shes found the fountain of youth if shes gone shes gone men come crawling back not women they persevere there isnt a man alive a woman cant persevere into the grave forget dana seagram there are millions of other fish in the stream if you need the phony security of a pair of tits making your bed and fixing your supper go hire a maid theyre cheaper and a hell of a lot less trouble in the long run so now you think youre sigmund freud seagram said rising from the john women are nothing to you a beautiful relationship with you is a love affair with a bottle youre out of touch with the world am i pitt stood up in the tub and yanked open the door to the medicine cabinet so that seagram was staring at his refection in the mirror take a good look theres the face of a man whos out of touch with the world behind those eyes theres a man whos driven by a thousand demons of his own making youre sick seagram mentally sick over problems youve magnified out of all proportion danas desertion is only a crutch to enhance your black depression you dont love her as much as you think you do shes only a symbol a prop you lean on look at the glaze over the eyes look at the slack skin around the mouth get yourself to a psychiatrist and damned soon think about gene seagram for once forget about saving the world its time you saved yourself seagrams face was violently flushed he clenched his fists and trembled then the mirror before his eyes began to mist not on the outside but from within and another face slowly emerged a strange face with the same haunted eyes pitt stood mute and watched as seagrams expression turned from anger to sheer terror god no its him him him he cried joshua hays brewster then seagram struck the mirror with both fists shattering the glass and fled the room pensive and dreamyeyed dana stood in front of a full length mirror and scrutinized herself the bruise on her head was neatly covered by a new hair style and except for several fading blackandblue marks her body looked as lithe and perfect as ever it definitely passed inspection then she stared at the eyes that stared back there were no additional crows feet no new puffiness around the edges the mythical hardened look of a fallen woman was nowhere to be seen instead they seemed to gleam with a vibrant expectancy that hadnt been there before her rebirth as an unfettered woman of the world had been a complete success care for any breakfast marie sheldons voice carried up the stairs dana donned a soft lace dressing gown just coffee thanks she said what time is it a few minutes after nine a minute later marie poured the coffee as dana stepped into the kitchen whats on the agenda for today she asked something typically femininei think ill go shopping have lunch by myself at an intimate tearoom and then go over to the numa clubhouse and scare up a partner for an hour or so of tennis sounds charming marie said dryly but i suggest you stop playing mrs rich bitch which you arent and start acting like a broad with responsibilities which you are whats the sense in it marie threw up her hands in exasperation whats the sense in it for one thing sweetie youre the girl of the hour in case you havent noticed the phone has been ringing off the hook for the past three days every womans magazine in the country wants your exclusive story and ive taken at least eight requests for you to appear on nationally televised talk shows like it or not youre big news dont you think its about time you came back down to earth and met the onslaught headon whats there to say so i was the only woman on board an old drifting derelict with twenty men big deal you almost died out there in the ocean and you treat the whole episode as though it were just another cruise down the nile on cleopatras barge having all those men catering to your every whim must have gone to your head if only marie knew the whole truth but dana and everyone on board had been sworn to secrecy by warren nicholson the attempted assault by the russians was to be buried and forgotten by everyone but she took a perverse sort of satisfaction in knowing that her performance on the titanic that cold stormy night would linger in the minds of the men who were present for the rest of their lives too much happened out there dana sighed im not the same person any more so what does that mean to begin with im taking out papers to divorce gene its come to that its come to that dana repeated firmly also im going to take a leave of absence from numa and have a fling at life as long as im the exalted female of the year im going to make it pay the personal stories the tv appearancestheyre going to enable me to do what every girl yearns to do all her life which is spend money and have a high old time doing it marie shook her head sadly im beginning to feel like ive helped create a monster dana took her gently by the hand not you dear friend it took a brush with death for me to learn that i had condemned myself to an existence that led nowhere it began i suppose with my childhood danas voice trailed off as the terrible memories came flickering back my childhood was a nightmare and ive carried its effects with me all my adult life i even infected my marriage with its sickness gene recognized the symptoms and married me more out of pity than deep love unwittingly he treated me more as a father than as a lover i cant force myself to go back now the emotional responses that it takes to build and maintain a lasting relationship just arent in me im a loner marie i know that now im too selfish with my affections toward others its the albatross around my neck from here on in im going it alone that way i can never hurt anyone ever again marie looked up tears in her eyes well then i guess between us well even up the sides youre folding your marriage and going back to the single ways while im shucking the oddwomanout syndrome and joining the great ranks of the matronly housewives danas lips parted in a wide smile you and mel me and mel when it had better be soon or im going to have to order my trousseau from the blessed event maternity shop youre pregnant that aint betty crocker thats rising in my oven dana came around the table and hugged marie you with a baby i cant believe it you better believe it they tried mouthtomouth resuscitation and massive doses of adrenaline but it was no go the frog still died you mean rabbit whereve you been they gave up rabbits years ago oh marie im so happy for you the two of us beginning whole new life patterns arent you excited oh sure marie said in a dry tone nothing like starting anew with a big bang is there any other way ive got the easy path sweetie marie kissed dana on to cheek lightly its you im worried about just dont go too far too fast and fall off the deep end the deep end is where all the fun is take my word for it learn to swim in the shallows too tame danas eyes grew thoughtful im going to start at the very crest and just how are you going to initiate that little feat dana met maries eyes evenly all it takes is one little phone call the president came from behind his desk in the oval office and greeted the majority leader of the senate john burdick with warmth john its good to see you how are josie and the kids burdick a tall thin man with a bush of black hair that seldom saw a comb shrugged good naturedly josies fine and you know kids as far as theyre concerned good old dad is nothing but a money machine after they were seated the talk kicked off with their differences on budget programs although the two men were opposing party leaders and sniped at each other at every opportunity in the open behind closed doors they were warm intimate friends congress is beginning to think youve gone mad mr president during the past six months youve vetoed every spending bill sent to the white house from the hill and im going to go right on vetoing until the day i walk through that door for the last time the president paused to light a thin cigar lets face the cold hard truth john the government of the united states is broke and its been broke since the end of world war two but nobody will admit it we go merrily on our way running up a national debt that defies comprehension figuring that somewhere down the line the poor bastard that defeats us in the next election will pay the piper for the spending spree of the last fifty years what do you expect congress to do declare bankruptcy sooner or later it may have to the consequences are unthinkable the national debt is carried by half the insurance companies savings and loans and banks in the nation theyd all be wiped out overnight so what else is new burdick shook his head i refuse to accept it damn it john you cant sweep it under the carpet do you realize that every taxpayer under the age of fifty will never see a social security check in another twelve years it will be absolutely impossible to pay even a third of the people who are eligible for benefits thats another reason im going to sound the warning a small voice in the wilderness i regretfully admit but still in the few months remaining of my term in office im going to shout doom every chance i get the american people dont like to hear sad tidings you wont be very popular i dont give a damn i dont care one thin dime for what anybody thinks popularity contests are for egoists a few months from now im going to be on my ketch sailing peacefully somewhere south of fiji and the government can go straight to hell im sorry to hear that mr president youre a good man even your worst enemies will concede that but the president was not to be stopped we had a great republic going for a while john but you and i and all the other attorneys screwed it up government is a big business and attorneys shouldnt be allowed to take office its the accountants and the marketing people who should be congressmen and president it takes attorneys to run a legislature the president shrugged wearily whats the use whatever course i take wont change a thing then he straightened in his chair and smiled my apologies john you didnt come here to hear me make a speech whats on your mind the underprivileged childrens medical bill burdick stared intently at the president are you going to veto that one too the president leaned back in his chair and studied his cigar yes he said simply thats my bill burdick said quietly i nursed it through both the house and the senate i know how can you veto a bill for children whose families cant afford to give them proper medical attention for the same reason ive vetoed added benefits for citizens over eighty federal scholarship programs for the minorities and a dozen other welfare bills somebody has to pay for them and the working class who support this country has been pushed to the wall with a fivehundred percent tax increase over the last ten years for the love of humanity mr president for the love of a balanced budget senator where do you expect the funds to support your program to come from you might begin by cutting back the budget of meta section so there it was congressional snoops had finally breached the walls of meta section it had to come sooner or later at least it was later he decided to play it noncommittal meta section a superclassified thinktank youve supported for years surely i dont have to describe its operation to you no the president said evenly you dont an uncomfortable silence followed finally burdick forged ahead it took months of checking by my investigatorsyou covered the financial tracks very cleverlybut they finally managed to backtrail the source of the funds used to raise the titanic to a supersecret organization operating under the name of meta section and then ultimately to you my god mr president you authorized nearly three quarters of a billion dollars to salvage that worthless old wreck and then lied by saying that it costs less than half that amount and here i am only asking for fifty million to get the childrens medical bill off the ground if i may say so sir your odd sense of priorities is a bloody crime what do you intend to do john blackmail me into signing your bill to be perfectly candid yes i see before the conversation could go on the presidents secretary entered the room excuse me for interrupting mr president but you asked to check over your appointment schedule for this afternoon the president made an apologetic gesture to burdick excuse me john this will only take a moment the president scanned the schedule he stopped at a name penciled in for he looked up at his secretary his eyebrows raised mrs seagram yes sir she called and said she had traced down the history of that model ship in the bedroom i thought perhaps you might be interested in what she discovered so i squeezed her in for a few minutes the president held his hands over his face and closed his eyes call mrs seagram and cancel the fourfifteen appointment ask her to join me for dinner on board the presidential yacht at seventhirty the secretary made the notation and left the room the president turned back to burdick now john if i still refuse to sign your bill what then burdick held up his hands then you leave me no choice but to blow the whistle on your clandestine uses of government funds in that event i fear you can expect a scandal that will make the old watergate mess look like an easter egg hunt youd do that i would an icy calm seemed to settle ever the president before you dash out the door and waste more of the taxpayers dollars on a congressional hearing over my fiscal maneuverings i suggest you hear from the horses own mouth what meta section is all about and what theyve produced in the defense of the country that keeps us both gainfully employed im listening mr president good one hour later a thoroughly subdued senator john burdick sat in his office and carefully dropped his secret file on meta section into a shredding machine it was a staggering sight to see the titanic propped high and dry in the huge canyon of a dry dock already the noise had started welders were attacking the clogged passageways riveters were hammering against the scarred hull beefing up the temporary repairs made at sea to the jagged wounds below the waterline overhead two skyreaching cranes dipped their jaws down into the darkened cargo holds only to have them reappear minutes later with mangled bits and pieces of debris clutched in their iron teeth pitt took what he knew would be his last look about the gymnasium and upper deck like bidding a new years eve goodby to a passing piece of his life he stood there and soaked up the memories the sweat of the salvage the blood and sacrifice of his crew the fragility of their hope that had in the end carried them through it would all be left behind finally he cast aside his reverie and walked down the main staircase and eventually found his way to the forward cargo hold on g deck they were all present and accounted for and looking strangely unfamiliar under the silver hard hats gene seagram gaunt and trembling paced back and forth mel donner wiping trickles of sweat from his neck and chin and nervously keeping a concerned eye on seagram herb lusky a meta section mineralogist standing by with his analysis equipment admirals sandecker and kemper huddled in one corner of the darkened hold and conversing in low tones pitt carefully stepped around the twisted bulkhead supports and over the rippled deck of warped steel until he was standing behind a shipyard worker who was intently aiming his cutting torch at a massive hinge on the vault door the cult pitt thought darkly it was only a matter of minutes now before the secret hidden inside its gut was laid bare suddenly he became aware of an icy chill everything around him seemed to turn cold and he began to dread the opening of the vault as if sharing his uneasiness the other men in the dank hold became quiet and gathered beside pitt in restless apprehension at last the worker turned off the fiery blue jet of his torch and raised his face shield hows it look pitt asked they sure built them good in the old days the worker replied ive torched out the lock mechanism and knocked off the hinges but shes still frozen solid what now we run a cable from the doppleman crane above attach it to the vault door and hope for the best it took the better part of an hour for a crew of men to wrestle a twoinchthick cable into the hold and fasten it onto the vault then when all was ready a signal was relayed to the crane operator via a portable radio transmitter and the cable began slowly to straighten out its curves and tighten no one had to be told to move back out of the way they all knew that if the wire took it in its head to snap it would whiplash through the hold with more than enough force to split a man in two in the distance they could hear the engine of the crane straining for long seconds nothing happened the cable stretched and quivered its strands groaning under the tremendous load pitt threw caution aside and edged closer still nothing happened the vaults stubborn resolve seemed as firm as the steel of its walls the cable slackened as the crane operator eased off the strain to work up his engines rpms then he revved up and engaged the clutch once more and the cable suddenly went taut with an audible twang to the silent men who looked anxiously on it seemed inconceivable that the old rusted vault could stand up to such a powerful assault and yet the inconceivable was apparently happening but then a tiny hairline crack made its appearance along the upper edge of the vault door it was followed by two vertical cracks along the sides and finally a fourth running across the bottom abruptly with an agonizing screech of protest the door reluctantly relinquished its grip and tore off the great steel cube no water came out of the yawning blackness the vault had remained airtight during its long sojourn in the deep abyss nobody made a move they stood rooted frozen mesmerized by that uninviting black square hole a musty stench rolled out from within lusky was the first to find his voice my god what is it what in hell is that smell get me a light pitt ordered one of the workmen someone produced a fluorescent hand light pitt switched it on and danced its bluishwhite beam on the interior of the vault they could see ten wooden boxes tightly secured by stout leather straps they could also see something else something that turned every face ghostly pale it was the mummified remains of a man he was lying in one corner of the vault eyes closed and sunken in skin as blackened as old tar paper on a warehouse roof the muscle tissue was shrunken over the bony skeleton and a bacterial growth covered him from head to toe he looked like a moldy piece of bread only the white hair of his head and beard were perfectly preserved a pool of viscous fluid extended around the remains and moistened the atmosphere as if a bucket of water had been thrown on the walls of the vault whoever it is is still wet kemper murmured his faces mask of horror how can that be after so long water accounts for over half the weight of the body pitt answered quietly there simply wasnt enough air trapped inside the vault to evaporate all of the fluids donner turned away repulsed by the macabre scene who was he he managed fighting the urge to vomit pitt looked at the mummy impassively i think we will find that his name was joshua hays brewster brewster seagram whispered his frightened eyes wild with fear why not pitt said who else knew the contents of the vault admiral kemper shook his head in stunned wonderment can you imagine he said reverently what it must have been like dying in that black hole while the ship was sinking into the depths of the sea i dont care to dwell on it donner said ill probably have nightmares every night for the next month as it is its positively ghastly sandecker said with difficulty he studied the saddened knowing expression on pitts face you knew about this pitt nodded i was forewarned by commodore bigalow sandecker fixed him with a speculative look but he let it drop at that and turned to one of the shipyard workers call the coroners office and tell them to come and get that thing out of there then clear the area and keep it cleared until i give you an order to the contrary the shipyard people needed no further urging they disappeared from the cargo hold as if by magic seagram grabbed luskys arm with an intensity that made he mineralogist start okay herb its your show now hesitantly lusky entered the cavity stepped over the mummy and pried open one of the ore boxes then he set up his equipment and began analyzing the contents after what seemed forever to the men pacing the deck outside the vault he looked up his eyes reflecting a dazed disbelief this stuff is worthless seagram moved in closer say again its worthless there isnt even a minute trace of byzanium try another box seagram gasped feverishly lusky nodded and went to work but it was the same story on the next ore box and the next until the contents of all ten were strewn everywhere lusky looked as though he was suffering a seizure junk pure junk he stammered nothing but common gravel the kind youd find under any roadbed the hushed note of bewilderment in luskys voice faded away and the quiet in the titanics cargo hold became heavy and deep pitt stared downward stared dumbly every eye was held by the rubble and the broken boxes while numbed minds fought to grasp the appalling reality the horrible undeniable truth that everythingthe salvage the exhausting labor the astronomical drain of money the deaths of munk and woodson had all been for nothing the byzanium was not on the titanic nor had it ever been they were the victims of a monstrously cruel joke that had been played out seventysix years before it was seagram who finally broke the silence in the final ignition of madness he grinned to himself in the gray light the grin mushrooming into a bansheelike laughter that echoed in the steel hold he thrust himself through the door of the vault snatched up a rock and struck lusky on the side of the head sending a spray of red over the yellow wood ore boxes he was still laughing locked in the throes of black hysteria when he fell upon the putrescent remains of joshua hays brewster and began bashing the mummified head against the vault wall until it loosened from the neck and came off in his hands as he held the ugly abhorrent thing before him seagrams conflicted mind suddenly saw the blackened parchmentlike lips spread into a hideous grin his breakdown was complete the parallel depression of joshua hays brewster had reached out through the mists of time and bequeathed seagram a ghostly inheritance that hurled the physicist into the yawning jaws of a madness from which he was never to escape six days later donner entered the hotel dining room where admiral sandecker was eating breakfast and eased into a vacant chair across the table have you heard the latest sandecker paused between bites of his omelet if its more bad news id just as soon you keep it to yourself they nailed me coming out of my apartment this morning he threw a folded paper on the table in front of him a subpoena to appear in front of a congressional investigating committee sandecker forked another slice of the omelet without looking at the paper congratulations same goes for you admiral dollarsto doughnuts a federal marshal is lurking in your office anteroom this very minute waiting to slap one on you whos behind it some punkeased freshman senator from wyoming whos trying to make a name for himself before hes forty donner dabbed a crumpled handkerchief on his damp forehead the stupid ass even insists on having gene testify that id have to see sandecker pushed the plate away and leaned back in his chair how is seagram getting along manic depressive psychosis is the fancy term for it how about lusky twenty stitches and a nasty concussion he should be out of the hospital in another week sandecker shook his head i hope i never have to live through anything like that ever again he took a swallow of coffee how do we play it the president called me personally from the white house last night he said to play it straight the last thing he wants is to become entangled in a snarl of conflicting lies what about the sicilian project it died a quick death when we opened the titanics vault donner said we have no alternative but to spill the entire can of worms from the beginning to the sorry end why does the dirty laundry have to be washed in the open what good will it do the woes of a democracy donner said resignedly everything has to be open and above board even if it means giving away secrets to an unfriendly foreign government sandecker placed his hands on his face and sighed well i guess ill be looking for a new job not necessarily the president has promised to issue a statement to the effect that the whole failure of the project was his responsibility and his alone sandecker shook his head no good i have several enemies in congress theyre just drooling in anticipation of turning the screws on my resignation from numa it may not come to that for the past fifteen years ever since i attained the rank of admiral ive had to doubledeal with politicians take my word for it its a dirty business before this thing is over with everyone remotely connected with the sicilian project and the raising of the titanic will be lucky if they can find a job cleaning stables im truly sorry it had to end like this admiral believe me so am i sandecker finished off his coffee and patted a napkin against his mouth tell me donner whats the batting order who has the illustrious senator from wyoming named as the leadoff witness my understanding is that he intends taking the titanics salvage operation first and then working backward to involve meta section and finally the president donner picked up the subpoena and shoved it back in his coat pocket the first witness theyre most likely to call is dirk pitt sandecker looked at him pitt did you say thats right interesting sandecker said softly most interesting youve lost me somewhere sandecker neatly folded the napkin and laid it on the table what you dont know donner what you couldnt know is that immediately after the men in the little white coats carried seagram off the titanic pitt vanished into thin air donners eyes narrowed surely you know where he is his friends giordino dont you think we all tried to find him sandecker snarled hes gone disappeared its as though the earth swallowed him up but he must have left some clue he did say something but it didnt make any sense what was that he said he was going to look for southby who in hell is southby damned if i know sandecker said damned if i know pitt steered the rented rover sedan cautiously down the narrow rainslickened country road the tall beech trees lining the shoulders seemed to close in and attack the moving car as they pelted its steel roof with the heavy runoff from their leaves pitt was tired dead tired he had set out on his odyssey not sure of what it was he might find if anything hed begun as joshua hays brewster and his crew of miners had begun on the docks of aberdeen scotland and then hed followed their deathstrewn path across britain almost to the old ocean duck at southampton from which the titanic had set out on her maiden voyage he turned his gaze from the pounding wipers on the windshield and glanced down at the blue notebook lying on the passenger seat it was filled with dates places miscellaneous jottings and torn newspaper articles he had accumulated along the way the musty files of the past had told him little two americans found dead the april editions of the glasgow papers noted fifteen pages back from the headline the detailbarren stories were as deeply buried as the bodies of coloradans john caldwell and thomas price were in a local cemetery their tombstones discovered by pitt in a small churchyard offered virtually nothing other than their names and dates of death it was the same story with charles widney walter schmidt and warner odeming of alvin coulter he could find no trace and finally there was vernon hall pitt hadnt found his resting place either where had he fallen had his blood been spilled amid the neat and orderly landscape of the hampshire downs or perhaps somewhere on the back streets of southampton itself out of the corner of one eye he caught a marker that gave the distance to the great harbor port as twenty kilometers pitt drove on mechanically the road curved and then paralleled the lovely rippling itchen stream famous throughout southern england for its fighting trout but he didnt notice it up ahead across the emeraldgreen farmlands of the coastal plain a small town came into view and he decided he would stop there for breakfast an alarm went off in the back of pitts mind he jammed on the brakes but much too hardthe rear wheels broke loose and the rover skidded around in a perfect threehundredandsixtydegree circle coming to rest still aimed southward but sunk to the hubcaps in the yielding muck of a roadside ditch almost before the car had fully stopped pitt threw open the door and leaped out his shoes sank out of sight and became stuck but he pulled free of them and ran back down the road in his stocking feet he halted at a small sign beside the road part of the lettering was obscured by a small tree that had grown up around it slowly as if he were afraid his hopes would be shattered by yet another disappointment he pushed aside the branches and suddenly it all became quite clear the key to the riddle of joshua hays brewster and the byzanium was there in front of him he stood there soaking up the falling rain and in that instant he knew that everything had been worthwhile marganin sat on a bench by the fountain in sverdlov square across from the bolshoi theater and read a newspaper he felt a slight quiver and knew without looking that someone had taken the vacant place beside him the fat man in the rumpled suit leaned against the backrest and casually gnawed on an apple congratulations on your promotion commander he mumbled between bites considering how events turned out marganin said without lowering the paper it was the least admiral sloyuk could do and your situation now with prevlov out of the way with the good captains defection i was the logical choice to replace him as chief of the foreign intelligence analysis division it was an obvious conclusion it is good that our years of labor have paid such handsome dividends marganin turned a page we have only opened the door the dividends are yet to come you must be more careful of your actions now than ever before i intend to marganin said this prevlov business badly burned the soviet navys credibility with the kremlin everyone in the naval intelligence department is having their security clearances rechecked under tight scrutiny it will be a long time before i am trusted as fully as captain prevlov was we will see to it that things are speeded up a bit the fat man pretended to swallow a large bite from the apple when you leave here mingle with the crowd at the entrance to the subway across the street one of our people who is adroit at lifting wallets from the unsuspecting will do a reverse routine and discreetly insert an envelope into your inside breast pocket the envelope contains the minutes from the last meeting of the united states navy chief of staff with his fleet commanders thats pretty heady material the minutes have been doctored they may seem important but in reality they have been carefully reworded to mislead your superiors passing along fake documents wont do my position any good ease your mind the fat man said tomorrow at this time an agent of the kgb will obtain the same material the kgb will declare it bona fide since you will have produced your information twentyfour hours ahead of them it will put a feather in your cap in the eyes of admiral sloyuk very cunning marganin said staring at the newspaper anything else this is goodby the fat man murmured goodby yes i have been your contact long enough too long weve come too far you and i to become lax in our security now and my new contact are you still living in the naval barracks the fat man replied with another question the barracks will remain my home i am not about to draw suspicion as a big spender and live in a fancy apartment like prevlovs i shall continue to lead a spartan existence on my soviet naval pay good my replacement is already assigned he will be the orderly who cleans the officers quarters of your barracks i will miss you old friend marganin said slowly and i you there was a long moment of silence and then finally the fat man spoke again in a hushed undertone god bless harry when marganin folded the newspaper and laid it aside the fat man was gone thats our destination over there to the right the pilot of the helicopter said ill set down in that pasture just across the road from the churchyard sandecker looked out the window it was a gray overcast morning and soft blankets of mist were hovering over the low areas of the tiny village a quiet lane wandered past several quaint houses and was bordered on both sides by picturesque rock walls he stiffened as the pilot made a steep bank around the church steeple he glanced at donner on the seat beside him donner was staring straight ahead in front of him occupying the seat next to the pilot was sid koplin the mineralogist had been called back on this one last assignment for meta section because herb lusky was still not well enough to make the trip sandecker felt the slight bump as the landing skids touched the ground and a moment later the pilot cut the engine and the rotor blades drifted to a stop in the sudden stillness after the flight from london the pilots voice seemed overly loud were here sir sandecker nodded and stepped out the side door pitt was waiting and walked toward him with an outstretched hand welcome to southby admiral he said smiling sandecker smiled as he took pitts hand but there was no humor in his face the next time you take a powder without notifying me as to your intentions youre fired pitt feigned a hurt expression and then turned and greeted donner mel nice to see you likewise donner said warmly i believe youve already met sid koplin a chance meeting pitt grinned we were never formally introduced koplin took pitts hand in both of his this was hardly the same man pitt had found dying in the snows of novaya zemlya koplins grip was firm and his eyes alert it was my fondest wish he said his voice heavy with emotion that some day i would have the opportunity of thanking you in person for saving my life im glad to see you in good health was all pitt could think of to mumble he looked down at the ground nervously by god sandecker thought to himself the man was actually embarrassed he never dreamed hed see the day when dirk pitt turned modest the admiral rescued pitt by grabbing him by the arm and pulling him toward the village church i hope you know what youre doing sandecker said the british frown upon colonials who go around digging up their graveyards it took a direct call from the president to the prime minister to cut through all the bureaucratic red tape of an exhumation donner added i think you will find the inconvenience has been worth it pitt said they came to the road and crossed it then they passed through an ancient wroughtiron gate and walked into the graveyard that surrounded the parish church they walked in silence for several moments reading the inscriptions on the weatherworn headstones then sandecker motioned toward the little village its so far off the beaten track what steered you onto it pure luck pitt answered when i began tracing the coloradans movements from aberdeen i had no idea of how southby might fit in the puzzle the final sentence in brewsters journal if you recall said how i long to return to southby and according to commodore bigalow brewsters last words just before he shut himself in the titanics vault were thank god for southby my only inkling and a meager one at that was southby had an english ring to it so i began by pinpointing as nearly is i could the miners trail to southampton by following their grave markers donner finished they read like signposts pitt admitted that and the fact that brewsters journal recorded the times and places of their deaths except that is for alvin coulter and vernon hall coulters final resting place remains a mystery but hall lies here in the southby village cemetery then you found it on a map no the village is so small it isnt even a dot in the michelin tour guide i just happened to notice an old forgotten handpainted sign some farmer had set along the main road years ago advertising a milk cow for sale the directions gave the farms location as three kilometers east in the next country lane to southby the last pieces of the puzzle then began dropping into place they walked along in silence and made their way over to where three men were standing two wore the standard work clothes of local farmers the third was in the uniform of a county constable pitt made the brief introductions and then donner solemnly handed the constable the order for exhumation they all stared down at the grave the tombstone stood at one end of a large stone slab that lay atop the deceased the stone simply read vernon hall died april rip neatly carved in the center of the arched horizontal slab was the image of an old threewasted sailing ship the precious ore we labored so desperately to rape from the bowels of that cursed mountain lies safely in the vault of the ship only vernon will be left to tell the tale for i depart on the great white star steamer pitt recited the words from joshua hays brewsters journal vernon halls burial vault donner said as if in a dream this is what he meant not the vault of the titanic its unreal sandecker murmured is it possible that the byzanium lies here well know in a few minutes pitt said he nodded to the two farmers who began shoving at the slab with pry bars once the slab was hefted aside the farmers began digging but why bury the byzanium here sandecker asked why didnt brewster go on to southampton and have it loaded on board the titanic a myriad of reasons pitt said his voice unnaturally loud in the quiet graveyard hunted like a dog exhausted beyond human endurance his friends all brutally murdered before his eyes brewster was pushed into madness just as surely as gene seagram was when he learned that fate had snatched away his moment of success on the very verge of fulfillment add all that to the fact that brewster was in a strange land he was alone and friendless death stalked him constantly without letup and his only chance for escaping to the united states with the byzanium was moored several miles away at the dock in southampton its said that insanity breeds genius perhaps in brewsters case it was so or perhaps he was simply misguided by his delusions he assumed wrongly as it turned out that he could never make it safely aboard the ship with the byzanium by himself so he buried it in vernon halls grave and substituted worthless rock in the original ore boxes then he probably left his journal with the church vicar with instructions to turn it over to the american consulate in southampton i imagine his cryptic prose grew from the madness that had brought him to the point where he trusted no onenot even an old country vicar he probably figured that some perceptive soul in the army department would decipher the true meaning of his wandering prose in the event of his murder but he made it on board the titanic safely donner said the french didnt stop him my guess is that things were getting too warm for the french agents the british police must have followed the trail of bodies just as i did and were breathing down the pursuers back so the french afraid of an international scandal of gigantic proportions backed off at the last moment koplin injected thats one theory pitt replied sandecker looked thoughtful the titanic the titanic sank and queered everything true pitt answered automatically now a thousand ifs enter the picture if captain smith had heeded the ice warnings and reduced speed if the ice packs hadnt floated unusually far south that year if the titanic had missed the iceberg and docked in new york as scheduled and if brewster had lived to tell his story to the army the byzanium would have simply been dug up and recovered at a later date on the other hand even if brewster had been killed before he boarded the ship the army department would have no doubt figured the double meaning at the end of his journal and acted accordingly unfortunately the wheels of chance played a dirty trick the titanic sank taking brewster along with it and the veiled words of his journal threw everybody including ourselves completely off the track for seventysix years then why did brewster lock himself in the titanics vault donner asked in puzzlement knowing that the ship was doomed knowing that any suicidal act was a meaningless gesture why didnt he try and save himself guilt is a powerful motive for suicide pitt said brewster was insane that much we know when he realized that his scheme to steal the byzanium had caused a score of people eight of whom were close friends to die needlessly he blamed himself many men and women too have taken their own lives for much less hold on a moment koplin cut in he was kneeling over an open case of mineralanalysis gear im getting a radioactive reading from the fill over the coffin the diggers climbed out of the hole the rest clustered around koplin and peered curiously as he went through his ritual sandecker pulled a cigar from his breast pocket and stuck it between his lips without lighting it the air was cold but donners shirt was wet right through his coat no one spoke their breaths came in small wisps of vapor that quickly dissipated in the subdued gray light koplin studied the rocky soil it didnt match the composition of the moist brown earth that surrounded the graves excavation at last he rose unsteadily to his feet he held several small rocks up in his hand byzanium is is it here donner asked in a hushed whisper is it really all here ultra high grade koplin announced his face broke into a wide smile more than enough to complete the sicilian project thank god donner gasped he staggered over to an aboveground crypt and unceremoniously collapsed on it oblivious to the shocked stares of the local farmers koplin looked back down into the grave insanity does breed genius he murmured brewster filled the grave with the ore anyone except a professional mineralogist would have simply dug through it and finding nothing in the coffin but bones would have walked off and left it an ideal way to conceal it donner agreed practically right out in the open sandecker stepped over and took pitts hand and shook it thank you he said simply pitt could only nod in reply he felt tired and numb he wanted to find himself a place where he could crawl away from the world and forget it for a while he wished the titanic had never been had never slid down the ways of the belfast shipyard to the silent sea to the merciless sea that had transformed that beautiful ship into a grotesque rusted old hulk sandecker seemed to read pitts eyes you look like you need a rest he said dont let me see your ugly face around my office for at least two weeks i was hoping youd say that pitt smiled wearily mind telling me where you plan to hide out sandecker asked slyly only in the event an emergency arises at numa of course and i have to get in touch with you of course pitt came back dryly he paused a moment theres a little airline stewardess who lives with her great grandfather in teignmouth you might try me there sandecker nodded in silent understanding koplin came over and grasped pitt by both shoulders i hope we meet again sometime my sentiments too donner looked at him without rising and said with emotional hoarseness its finally over yes pitt said its over and done with everything he felt a sudden chill a feeling of cold familiarity as though his words had echoed hauntingly from the past then he turned and walked from the southby graveyard they all stood and watched him grow smaller in the distance until he entered a shroud of mist and disappeared he came from the mists and he returned to the mists koplin said his mind drifting back to his first meeting with pitt on the slopes of bednaya mountain donner gazed at him oddly what was that you said just thinking out loud koplin shrugged thats all august reckoning stop engines the telegraph rang in reply to the captains command and the vibrations coming from the engine room of the british cruiser hms troy died away the foam around the bow melted into the blackness of the sea as the ship slowly lost her momentum silent except for the hum of her generators it was a warm night for the north atlantic the sea was glassycalm and the stars blazed in a sparkling carpet across the sky from horizon to horizon the union jack hung limp and lifeless in its halyards untouched by even a hint of breeze the crew over two hundred of them was assembled on the foredeck as a lifeless body sewn in the traditional sailcloth of a bygone era and shrouded by the national flag was carried out and poised at the ships railing then the captain his voice resonant and unemotional read the sailors burial service as soon as he uttered the final words he nodded the slat was tilted and the body slid into the waiting arms of the eternal sea the bugle notes were clear and pure as they drifted into the quiet night then the men were dismissed and they turned silently away a few minutes later when the troy was under way again the captain sat dowry and made the following entry in the ships log hms troy time august pos lat n long w at the exact time in the morning of the white star steamer rms titanics foundering and in accordance with his dying wish that he spend eternity with his former shipmates the remains of commodore sir john bigalow kbe rd rnr retired were committed to the deep the captains hand trembled as he signed his name he was closing out the last chapter of a tragic drama that had stunned the world a world the likes of which would never be seen again at almost the same moment on the other side of the earth somewhere in the vast desolate wastes of the pacific ocean a huge cigarshaped submarine crept silently far below the languorous waves startled fish scattered into the depths at the monsters approach while within its smooth black skin men prepared to launch a quad of ballistic missiles at a series of divergent targets six thousand miles to the east at precisely hours the first of the great missiles ignited its rocket engine and burst through the sundanced swells in a volcanic eruption of white water rising with a thunderous roar into the blue pacific sky in thirty seconds it was followed by the second and the third and finally the fourth then trailing long fiery columns of orange flame the quartet of potential massdestruction arched into space and disappeared thirtytwo minutes later while homing in on their downrange trajectory the missiles abruptly blew up one by one in gigantic balls of flame and disintegrated while still some ninety miles from their respective targets it was the first time in the history of american rocketry that anyone remembered that the attending technicians and engineers and military officers who held rein on the nations defense programs had ever cheered the sudden and seemingly disastrous end to a perfect launch the sicilian project had proven itself an unqualified success on its first try
