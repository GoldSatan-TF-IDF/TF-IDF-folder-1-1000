philip kerr berlin noir march violets the pale criminal a german requiem march violets for my mother berlin first man have you noticed how the march violets have managed to completely overtake party veterans like you and me second man youre right perhaps if hitler had also waited a little before climbing on to the nazi bandwagon hed have become führer quicker too schwarze korps november stranger things happen in the dark dreams of the great persuader this morning at the corner of friedrichstrasse and jägerstrasse i saw two men s a men unscrewing a red der stürmer showcase from the wall of a building der stürmer is the antisemitic journal thats run by the reichs leading jewbaiter julius streicher the visual impact of these display cases with their semipornographic linedrawings of aryan maids in the voluptuous embraces of longnosed monsters tends to attract the weakerminded reader providing him with cursory titillation respectable people have nothing to do with it anyway the two s a men placed the stürmerkästen in the back of their lorry next to several others they did their work none too carefully because there were at least a couple which had broken glass covers an hour later i saw the same two men removing another one of these stürmerkästen from outside a tramstop in front of the town hall this time i went up to them and asked what they were doing its for the olympiad said one were ordered to take them all down so as not to shock the foreign visitors who will be coming to berlin to see the games in my experience such sensitivity on the part of the authorities is unheard of i drove home in my car its an old black hanomag and changed into my last good suit made of lightgrey flannel cloth it cost me marks when i bought it three years ago and it is of a quality that is becoming increasingly rare in this country like butter coffee and soap new wool material is ersatz more often than not the new material is serviceable enough all right just not very hardwearing and rather ineffective when it comes to keeping out the cold in winter or for that matter in summer i checked my appearance in the bedroom mirror and then picked up my best hat its a widebrimmed hat of darkgrey felt and is encircled by a black barathea band common enough but like the gestapo i wear my hat differently from other men with the brim lower in front than at the back this has the effect of hiding my eyes of course which makes it more difficult for people to recognize me its a style that originated with the berlin criminal police the kripo which is where i acquired it i slipped a packet of murattis into my jacket pocket and tucking a giftwrapped piece of rosenthal porcelain carefully under my arm i went out the wedding took place at the luther kirche on dennewitz platz just south of potsdamer railway station and a stones throw from the home of the brides parents the father herr lehmann was an engine driver out of lehrter station and drove the dzug the express train to hamburg and back four times a week the bride dagmarr was my secretary and i had no idea what i was going to do without her not that i cared to know either id often thought of marrying dagmarr myself she was pretty and good at organizing me and in my own odd way i suppose that i loved her but then at thirtyeight i was probably too old for her and maybe just a shade too dull im not much given to having a wild time and dagmarr was the sort of girl who deserved some fun so here she was marrying this flyer and on the face of it he was everything that a girl could have wished for he was young handsome and in the greyblue uniform of the national socialist flying corps he looked to be the epitome of the dashing young aryan male but i was disappointed when i met him at the wedding reception like most party members johannes buerckel had the look and the air of a man who took himself very seriously indeed it was dagmarr who made the introduction johannes true to type brought his heels together with a loud click and bowed his head curtly before shaking my hand congratulations i said to him youre a very fortunate fellow id have asked her to marry me only i dont think i look as good as you in uniform i took a closer look at his uniform on the left breastpocket he wore the silver s a sports badge and the pilots badge above these two decorations was the ubiquitous scary badge the party badge and on his left arm he wore the swastika armband dagmarr told me you were a pilot with lufthansa on temporary attachment to the ministry of aviation but i had no idea what did you say he was dagmarr a sports flyer yes thats it a sports flyer well i had no idea you fellows were in uniform of course it didnt take a detective to work out that sports flyer was one of those fancy reich euphemisms and that this particular one related to the secret training of fighter pilots he does look splendid doesnt he said dagmarr and you look beautiful my dear cooed the groom dutifully forgive me for asking johannes but is germanys air force now to be officially recognized i said flying corps said buerckel its a flying corps but that was the whole of his answer and you herr gunther a private detective eh that must be interesting private investigator i said correcting him it has its moments what sort of things do you investigate almost anything except divorce people act funny when theyre being cheated by their wives or their husbands or when theyre the ones doing the cheating i was once engaged by a woman to tell her husband that she was planning to leave him she was afraid hed pop her so i told him and what do you know the son of a bitch tried to pop me i spent three weeks in st gertrauden hospital with my neck in a brace that finished me with matrimonial work permanently these days i do anything from insurance investigations to guarding wedding presents to finding missing persons thats the ones the police dont already know about as well as the ones they do yes thats one area of my business thats seen a real improvement since the national socialists took power i smiled as affably as i could and wiggled my eyebrows suggestively i guess weve all done well out of national socialism havent we proper little march violets you mustnt take any notice of bernhard said dagmarr he has an odd sense of humour i would have said more but the band started to play and dagmarr wisely led buerckel on to the dancefloor where they were applauded warmly bored with the sekt that was on offer i went into the bar in search of a real drink i ordered a bock and a klares chaser which is a shot of the clear colourless potatobased alcohol i have a taste for and i drank these fairly quickly and ordered the same again thirsty work weddings said the little man next to me it was dagmarrs father he turned his back to the bar and watched his daughter proudly looks a proper picture doesnt she herr gunther i dont know what im going to do without her i said perhaps you can persuade her to change her mind and stay on with me im sure they must need the money young couples always need money when they first marry herr lehmann shook his head im afraid that there is only one kind of labour for which johannes and his national socialist government think a woman is qualified and thats the kind she has at the end of a ninemonth term he lit his pipe and puffed philosophically anyway he said i suppose theyll be applying for one of those reich marriage loans and that would stop her from working wouldnt it yes i suppose youre right i said and downed the chaser i saw his face say that he never had me marked as a drunk and so i said dont let this stuff fool you herr lehmann i just use it as a mouthwash only im too damned lazy to spit the stuff out he chuckled at that and slapped me on the back and ordered us two large ones we drank those and i asked him where the happy couple were going on their sparkle to the rhine he said wiesbaden frau lehmann and myself went to königstein for ours its a lovely part of the world hes not long back though and then hes off on some strength through joy trip courtesy of the reich labour service oh where to mediterranean you believe that the old man frowned no he said grimly i havent mentioned it to dagmarr but i reckon hes off to spain and war and war yes mussolini has helped franco so hitlers not going to miss out on the fun is he he wont be happy until hes got us into another bloody war after that we drank some more and later on i found myself dancing with a nice little stockingbuyer from grunfelds department store her name was carola and i persuaded her to leave with me and we went over to dagmarr and buerckel to wish them luck it was rather odd i thought that buerckel should choose that moment to make a reference to my war record dagmarr tells me that you were on the turkish front was he i wondered a little bit worried about going to spain and that you won an iron cross i shrugged only a second class so that was it i thought the flyer was hungry for glory nevertheless he said an iron cross the führers iron cross was a second class well i cant speak for him but my own recollection is that provided a soldier was honest comparatively honest and served at the front it was really rather easy towards the end of the war to collect a second class you know most of the firstclass medals were awarded to men in cemeteries i got my iron cross for staying out of trouble i was warming to my subject who knows i said if things work out you might collect one yourself it would look nice on a handsome tunic like that the muscles in buerckels lean young face tightened he bent forwards and caught the smell of my breath youre drunk he said si i said unsteady on my feet i turned away adios hombre it was late gone one oclock when finally i drove back to my apartment in trautenaustrasse which is in wilmersdorf a modest neighbourhood but still a lot better than wedding the district of berlin in which i grew up the street itself runs northeast from guntzelstrasse past nikolsburger platz where there is a scenic sort of fountain in the middle of the square i lived not uncomfortably at the prager platz end ashamed of myself for having teased buerckel in front of dagmarr and for the liberties i had taken with carola the stockingbuyer in the tiergarten near the goldfish pond i sat in my car and smoked a cigarette thoughtfully i had to admit to myself that i had been more affected by dagmarrs wedding than previously i would have thought possible i could see there was nothing to be gained by brooding about it i didnt think that i could forget her but it was a safe bet that i could find lots of ways to take my mind off her it was only when i got out of the car that i noticed the large darkblue mercedes convertible parked about twenty metres down the street and the two men who were leaning on it waiting for someone i braced myself as one of the men threw away his cigarette and walked quickly towards me as he drew nearer i could see that he was too wellgroomed to be gestapo and that the other one was wearing a chauffeurs uniform although he would have looked a lot more comfortable in a leopardskin leotard with his musichall weightlifters build his less than discreet presence lent the welldressed and younger man an obvious confidence heir gunther are you herr bernhard gunther he stopped in front of me and i shot him my toughest look the sort that would make a bear blink i dont care for people who solicit me outside my house at one in the morning im his brother hes out of town right now the man smiled broadly he didnt buy that herr gunther the private investigator my employer would like a word with you he pointed at the big mercedes hes waiting in the car i spoke to the concierge and she told me that you were expected back this evening that was three hours ago so you can see weve been waiting quite some time it really is very urgent i lifted my wrist and nicked my eyes at my watch friend its in the morning so whatever it is youre selling im not interested im tired and im drunk and i want to go to bed ive got an office on alexanderplatz so do me a favour and leave it till tomorrow the young man a pleasant freshfaced fellow with a buttonhole blocked my path it cant wait until tomorrow he said and then smiled winningly please speak to him just for a minute i beg you speak to whom i growled looking over at the car heres his card he handed it over and i stared stupidly at it like it was a winning raffleticket he leaned over and read it for me upsidedown dr fritz schemm german lawyer of schemm schellenberg unter den linden number thats a good address sure it is i said but a lawyer out at this time of night and from a smart firm like that you must think i believe in fairies but i followed him to the car anyway the chauffeur opened the door keeping one foot on the running board i peered inside a man smelling of cologne leaned forward his features hidden in the shadows and when he spoke his voice was cold and inhospitable like someone straining on a toiletbowl youre gunther the detective thats right i said and you must be i pretended to read his business card dr fritz schemm german lawyer i uttered the word german with a deliberately sarcastic emphasis ive always hated it on business cards and signs because of the implication of racial respectability and even more so now that at least as far as lawyers are concerned it is quite redundant since jews are forbidden to practise law anyway i would no more describe myself as a german private investigator than i would call myself a lutheran private investigator or an antisocial private investigator or a widowed private investigator even though i am or was at one time all of these things these days im not often seen in church its true that a lot of my clients are jews their business is very profitable they pay on the nail and its always the same missing persons the results are pretty much the same too a body dumped in the landwehr canal courtesy of the gestapo or the s a a lonely suicide in a rowboat on the wannsee or a name on a police list of convicts sent to a k z a concentration camp so right away i didnt like this lawyer this german lawyer i said listen herr doktor like i was just telling your boy here im tired and ive drunk enough to forget that ive got a bank manager who worries about my welfare schemm reached into his jacket pocket and i didnt even shift which shows you how blue i must have been as it was he only took out his wallet i have made inquiries about you and i am informed that you offer a reliable service i need you now for a couple of hours for which i will pay you reichsmarks in effect a weeks money he laid his wallet on his knee and thumbed two blues onto his trouserleg this couldnt have been easy since he had only one arm and afterwards ulrich will drive you home i took the notes hell i said i was only going to go to bed and sleep i can do that anytime i ducked my head and stepped into the car lets go ulrich the door slammed and ulrich climbed into the drivers seat with freshface alongside of him we headed west where are we going i said all in good time herr gunther he said help yourself to a drink or a cigarette he flipped open a cocktail cabinet which looked as though it had been salvaged from the titanic and produced a cigarette box these are american i said yes to the smoke but no to the drink when people are as ready to part with marks as dr schemm had been it pays to keep your wits about you would you be so kind as to light me please said schemm fitting a cigarette between his lips matches are the one thing i cannot manage i lost my arm with ludendorff at the capture of the fortress of liege did you see any active service the voice was fastidious suave even soft and slow with just a hint of cruelty the sort of voice i thought that could lead you into incriminating yourself quite nicely thank you the sort of voice that would have done well for its owner had he worked for the gestapo i lit our cigarettes and settled back into the mercedess big seat yes i was in turkey christ there were so many people taking an interest in my war record all of a sudden that i wondered if i hadnt better apply for an old comrades badge i looked out of the window and saw that we were driving towards the grunewald an area of forest that lies on the west side of the city near the river havel commissioned sergeant i heard him smile i was a major he said and that was me put firmly in my place and you became a policeman after the war no not right away i was a civil servant for a while but i couldnt stand the routine i didnt join the force until and when did you leave listen herr doktor i dont remember you putting me on oath when i got into the car im sorry he said i was merely curious to discover whether you left of your own accord or or was pushed youve got a lot of forehead asking me that schemm have i he said innocently but ill answer your question i left i dare say if id waited long enough theyd have weeded me out like all the others im not a national socialist but im not a fucking kozi either i dislike bolshevism just like the party does or at least i think it does but thats not quite good enough for the modern kripo or sipo or whatever its called now in their book if youre not for it you must be against it and so you a kriminalinspektor left kripo he paused and then added in tones of affected surprise to become the house detective at the adlon hotel youre pretty cute i sneered asking me all these questions when you already know the answers my client likes to know about the people who work for him he said smugly i havent taken the case yet maybe ill turn it down just to see your face maybe but youd be a fool berlin has a dozen like you private investigators he named my profession with more than a little distaste so why pick me you have worked for my client before indirectly a couple of years ago you conducted an insurance investigation for the germania life assurance company of which my client is a major shareholder while the kripo were still whistling in the dark you were successful in recovering some stolen bonds i remember it and i had good reason to it had been one of my first cases after leaving the adlon and setting up as a private investigator i said i was lucky never underestimate luck said schemm pompously sure i thought just look at the führer by now we were on the edge of the grunewald forest in dahlem home to some of the richest and most influential people in the country like the ribbentrops we pulled up at a huge wroughtiron gate which hung between massive walls and freshface had to hop out to wrestle it open ulrich drove on through drive on ordered schemm dont wait were late enough as it is we drove along an avenue of trees for about five minutes before arriving at a wide gravel courtyard around which were set on three sides a long centre building and the two wings that comprised the house ulrich stopped beside a small fountain and jumped out to open the doors we got out circling the courtyard was an ambulatory with a roof supported by thick beams and wooden columns and this was patrolled by a man with a pair of evillooking dobermanns there wasnt much light apart from the coachlamp by the front door but as far as i could see the house was white with pebbledash walls and a deep mansard roof as big as a decentsized hotel of the sort that i couldnt afford somewhere in the trees behind the house a peacock was screaming for help closer to the door i got my first good look at the doctor i suppose he was quite a handsome man since he was at least fifty i suppose you would say that he was distinguishedlooking taller than he had seemed when sitting in the back of the car and dressed fastidiously but with a total disregard for fashion he wore a stiff collar you could have sliced a loaf with a pinstriped suit of a lightgrey shade a creamycoloured waistcoat and spats his only hand was gloved in grey kid and on his neatly cropped square grey head he wore a large grey hat with a brim that surrounded the high wellpleated crown like a castle moat he looked like an old suit of armour he ushered me towards the big mahogany door which swung open to reveal an ashenfaced butler who stood aside as we crossed the threshold and stepped into the wide entrance hall it was the kind of hall that made you feel lucky just to have got through the door twin flights of stairs with gleaming white banisters led up to the upper floors and on the ceiling hung a chandelier that was bigger than a churchbell and gaudier than a strippers earrings i made a mental note to raise my fees the butler who was an arab bowed gravely and asked me for my hat ill hang on to it if you dont mind i said feeding its brim through my fingers itll help to keep my hands off the silver as you wish sir schemm handed the butler his own hat as if to the manor born maybe he was but with lawyers i always assume that they came by their wealth and position through avarice and by means nefarious i never yet met one that i could trust his glove he neatly removed with an almost doublejointed contortion of his fingers and dropped it into his hat then he straightened his necktie and asked the butler to announce us we waited in the library it wasnt big by the standards of a bismarck or a hindenburg and you couldnt have packed more than six cars between the reichstagsized desk and the door it was decorated in early lohengrin with its great beams granite chimneypiece in which a log crackled quietly and wallmounted weaponry there were plenty of books of the sort you buy by the metre lots of german poets and philosophers and jurists with whom i can claim a degree of familiarity but only as the names of streets and cafés and bars i took a hike around the room if im not back in five minutes send out a search party schemm sighed and sat down on one of the two leather sofas that were positioned at right angles to the fire he picked a magazine off the rack and pretended to read dont these little cottages give you claustrophobia schemm sighed petulantly like an old maiden aunt catching the smell of gin on the pastors breath do sit down herr gunther he said i ignored him fingering the two hundreds in my trouser pocket to help me stay awake i meandered over to the desk and glanced over its greenleather surface there was a copy of the berliner tageblatt well read and a pair of halfmoon spectacles a pen a heavy brass ashtray containing the butt of a wellchewed cigar and next to it the box of black wisdom havanas from which it had been taken a pile of correspondence and several silverframed photographs i glanced over at schemm who was making heavy weather of his magazine and his eyelids and then picked up one of the framed photographs she was dark and pretty with a full figure which is just how i like them although i could tell that she might find my afterdinner conversation quite resistible her graduation robes told me that shes beautiful dont you think said a voice that came from the direction of the library door and caused schemm to get up off the sofa it was a singsong sort of voice with a light berlin accent i turned to face its owner and found myself looking at a man of negligible stature his face was florid and puffy and had something so despondent in it that i almost failed to recognize it while schemm was busy bowing i mumbled something complimentary about the girl in the photograph herr six said schemm with more obsequy than a sultans concubine may i introduce herr bernhard gunther he turned to me his voice changing to suit my depressed bank balance this is herr doktor hermann six it was funny i thought how it was that in more elevated circles everyone was a damned doctor i shook his hand and found it held for an uncomfortably long time as my new clients eyes looked into my face you get a lot of clients who do that they reckon themselves as judges of a mans character and after all theyre not going to reveal their embarrassing little problems to a man who looks shifty and dishonest so its fortunate that ive got the look of someone who is steady and dependable anyway about the new clients eyes they were blue large and prominent and with an odd son of watery brightness in them as if he had just stepped out of a cloud of mustard gas it was with some shock that it dawned on me that the man had been crying six released my hand and picked up the photograph id just been looking at he stared at it for several seconds and then sighed profoundly she was my daughter he said with his heart in his throat i nodded patiently he replaced the photograph face down on the desk and pushed his monkishlystyled grey hair across his brow was because she is dead im sorry i said gravely you shouldnt be he said because if she were alive you wouldnt be here with the chance to make a lot of money i listened he was talking my language you see she was murdered he paused for dramatic effect clients do a lot of that but this one was good murdered i repeated dumbly murdered he tugged at one of his loose elephantine ears before thrusting his gnarled hands into the pockets of his shapeless navyblue suit i couldnt help noticing that the cuffs of his shirt were frayed and dirty id never met a steel millionaire before id heard of hermann six he was one of the major ruhr industrialists but this struck me as odd he rocked on the balls of his feet and i glanced down at his shoes you can tell a lot by a clients shoes thats the only thing ive picked up from sherlock holmes sixs were ready for the winter relief thats the national socialist peoples welfare organization where you send all your old clothes but then german shoes arent much good anyway the ersatz leather is like cardboard just like the meat and the coffee and the butter and the cloth but coming back to herr six i didnt have him marked as so stricken by grief that he was sleeping in his clothes no i decided he was one of these eccentric millionaires that you sometimes read about in the newspapers they spend nothing on anything which is how they come to be rich in the first place she was shot dead in cold blood he said bitterly i could see we were in for a long night i got out my cigarettes mind if i smoke i asked he seemed to recover himself at that do excuse me herr gunther he sighed im forgetting my manners would you like a drink or something the or something sounded just fine like a nice fourposter perhaps but i asked for a mocha instead fritz schemm stirred on the big sofa thank you just a glass of water he said humbly six pulled the bellrope and then selected a fat black cigar from the box on the desk he ushered me to a seat and i dumped myself on the other sofa opposite schemm six took a taper and pushed it at a flame then he lit his cigar and sat down beside the man in grey behind him the library door opened and a young man of about thirtyfive came into the room a pair of rimless glasses worn studiously at the end of a broad almost negroid nose belied his athletic frame he snatched them off stared awkwardly at me and then at his employer do you want me in this meeting herr six he said his accent was vaguely frankfurt no its all right hjalmar said six you get off to bed theres a good fellow perhaps youd ask farraj to bring us a mocha and a glass of water and my usual um right away herr six again he looked at me and i couldnt work out whether my being there was a source of vexation to him or not so i made a mental note to speak to him when i got the chance there is one more thing said six turning round on the sofa please remind me to go through the funeral arrangements with you first thing tomorrow i want you to look after things while im away very well herr six and with that he wished us good night and left now then herr gunther said six after the door had closed he spoke with the black wisdom stuck in the corner of his mouth so that he looked like a fairground barker and sounded like a child with a piece of candy i must apologize for bringing you here at this unearthly hour however im a busy man most important of all you must understand that i am also a very private one all the same herr six i said i must have heard of you that is very probable in my position i have to be the patron of many causes and the sponsor of many charities you know the sort of thing im talking about wealth does have its obligations so does an outside toilet i thought anticipating what was coming i yawned inside myself but i said i can certainly believe it with such an affectation of understanding that it caused him to hesitate for a short moment before continuing with the wellworn phrases i had heard so many times before need for discretion and no wish to involve the authorities in my affairs and complete respect for confidentiality etc etc thats the thing about my job people are always telling you how to conduct their case almost as if they didnt quite trust you almost as if you were going to have to improve your standards in order to work for them if i could make a better living as a notsoprivate investigator id have tried it a long time ago i told him but in my line of business a big mouth is bad for business word would get around and one or two wellestablished insurance companies and legal practices who i can call regular clients would go elsewhere look i know youve had me checked out so lets get down to business shall we the interesting thing about the rich is that they like being told where to get off they confuse it with honesty six nodded appreciatively at this point the butler cruised smoothly into the room like a rubber wheel on a waxed floor and smelling faintly of sweat and something spicy he served the coffee the water and his masters brandy with the blank look of a man who changes his earplugs six times a day i sipped my coffee and reflected that i could have told six that my nonagenarian grandmother had eloped with the führer and the butler would have continued to serve the drinks without so much as flexing a hair follicle when he left the room i swear i hardly noticed the photograph you were looking at was taken only a few years ago at my daughters graduation subsequently she became a schoolteacher at the arndt grammar school in berlindahlem i found a pen and prepared to take notes on the back of dagmarrs wedding invitation no he said please dont take notes just listen herr schemm will provide you with a complete dossier of information at the conclusion of this meeting actually she was rather a good schoolteacher although i ought to be honest and tell you that i could have wished for her to have done something else with her life grete yes i forgot to tell you her name grete had the most beautiful singing voice and i wanted her to take up singing professionally but in she married a young lawyer attached to the berlin provincial court his name was paul pfarr was i said my interruption drew the profound sigh from him once again yes i should have mentioned it im afraid hes dead too two murders then i said yes he said awkwardly two murders he took out his wallet and a snapshot this was taken at their wedding there wasnt much to tell from it except that like most society weddingreceptions it had been held at the adlon hotel i recognized the whispering fountains distinctive pagoda with its carved elephants from the adlons goethe garden i stifled a real yawn it wasnt a particularly good photograph and id had more than enough of weddings for one day and a half i handed it back a fine couple i said lighting another muratti sixs black cigar lay smokeless and flat on the round brass ashtray grete was teaching until when like many other women she lost her job a casualty of the governments general discrimination against working women in the employment drive meanwhile paul landed a job at the ministry of the interior not long afterwards my first wife lisa died and grete became very depressed she started drinking and staying out late but just a few weeks ago she seemed her old self again six regarded his brandy morosely and then threw it back in one gulp three nights ago however paul and grete died in a fire at their home in lichterfeldeost but before the house caught fire they were each shot several times and the safe ransacked any idea what was in the safe i told the fellows from kripo that i had no idea what it contained i read between the lines and said which wasnt quite true right i have no idea as to most of the safes contents there was one item however which i did know about and failed to inform them of why did you do that herr six because i would prefer that they didnt know and me the item in question affords you with an excellent chance of tracking down the murderer ahead of the police and what then i hoped he wasnt planning some private little execution because i didnt feel up to wrestling with my conscience especially when there was a lot of money involved before delivering the murderer into the hands of the authorities you will recover my property on no account must they get their hands on it what exactly are we talking about six folded his hands thoughtfully then unfolded them again and then swathed himself with his arms like a partygirls wrap he looked quizzically at me confidentially of course i growled jewels he said you see herr gunther my daughter died intestate and without a will all her property goes to her husbands estate paul did make a will leaving everything to the reich he shook his head can you believe such stupidity herr gunther he left everything everything one can hardly credit it he was a patriot then six failed to perceive the irony in my remark he snorted with derision my dear herr gunther he was a national socialist those people think that they are the first people ever to love the fatherland he smiled grimly i love my country and there is nobody who gives more than i do but i simply cannot stand the thought that the reich is to be enriched even further at my expense do you understand me i think so not only that but the jewels were her mothers so quite apart from their intrinsic value which i can tell you is considerable they are also of some sentimental account how much are they worth schemm stirred himself to offer up some facts and figures i think i can be of some assistance here herr six he said delving into a briefcase that lay by his feet and producing a buffcoloured file which he laid on the rug between the two sofas i have here the last insurance valuations as well as some photographs he lifted a sheet of paper and read off the bottomline figure with no more expression than if it had been the amount of his monthly newspaper account seven hundred and fifty thousand reichsmarks i let out an involuntary whistle schemm winced at that and handed me some photographs i had seen bigger stones but only in photographs of the pyramids six took over with a description of their history in the world jewel market was flooded with gems sold by russian exiles or put on sale by the bolsheviks who had discovered a treasure trove walled up in the palace of prince youssoupov husband to the niece of the tsar i acquired several pieces in switzerland that same year a brooch a bracelet and most precious of all a diamond collet necklace consisting of twenty brilliants it was made by cartier and weighs over one hundred carats it goes without saying herr gunther that it will not be easy to dispose of such a piece no indeed it might seem cynical of me but the sentimental value of the jewels was now looking quite insignificant beside their monetary value tell me about the safe i paid for it said six just as i paid for the house paul didnt have a great deal of money when cretes mother died i gave her the jewels and at the same time i had a safe installed so that she could keep them there when they werent in the vault at the bank so she had been wearing them quite recently yes she accompanied my wife and myself to a ball just a few nights before she was killed what kind of safe was it a stockinger wallmounted combination lock and who knew the combination my daughter and paul of course they had no secrets from each other and i believe he kept certain papers to do with his work there nobody else no not even me do you know how the safe was opened if there were any explosives used i believe there were no explosives used a nutcracker then hows that a professional safecracker mind you it would have to be someone very good to puzzle it six leaned forward on the sofa perhaps he said the thief forced grete or paul to open it then ordered them back to bed where he shot them both and afterwards he set fire to the house in order to cover his tracks throw the police off the scent yes thats possible i admitted i rubbed a perfectly circular area of smooth skin on my otherwise stubbly face its where a mosquito bit me when i was in turkey and ever since then ive never had to shave it but quite often i find myself rubbing it when i feel uneasy about something and if theres one thing guaranteed to make me feel uneasy its a client playing detective i didnt rule out what he was suggesting might have happened but it was my turn to play the expert possible but messy i said i cant think of a better way of raising the alarm than making your own private reichstag playing van der lubbe and torching the place doesnt sound like the sort of thing a professional thief would do but then neither does murder there were a lot of holes in that of course i had no idea that it was a professional not only that but in my experience its rare that a professional job also involves murder i just wanted to hear my own voice for a change who would have known she had jewels in the safe i asked me said six grete wouldnt have told anyone i dont know if paul had and did either of them have any enemies i cant answer for paul he said but im sure that grete didnt have an enemy in the world while i could accept the possibility that daddys little girl always brushed her teeth and said her prayers at night i found it hard to ignore how vague six was about his soninlaw that made the second time he was uncertain about what paul would have done what about you i said a rich and powerful man like yourself must have your fair share of enemies he nodded is there anyone who might hate you bad enough to want to get back at you through your daughter he rekindled his black wisdom puffed at it and then held it away from him between the tips of his fingers enemies are the inevitable corollary of great wealth herr gunther he told me but these are business rivals im talking about not gangsters i dont think any of them would be capable of something as coldblooded as this he stood up and went to attend to the fire with a large brass poker he dealt vigorously with the log that was threatening to topple out of the grate while six was offguard i jabbed him with one about the soninlaw did you and your daughters husband get on he twisted round to look at me poker still in hand and face slightly flushed it was all the answer that i needed but still he tried to throw some sand in my eyes why ever do you ask such a question he demanded really herr gunther said schemm affecting shock at my asking such an insensitive question we had our differences of opinion said six but what man can be expected sometimes not to agree with his soninlaw he put down the poker i kept quiet for a minute eventually he said now then with regard to the conduct of your investigations i would prefer it if you would confine your activities specifically to searching for the jewels i dont care for the idea of you snooping around in the affairs of my family ill pay your fees whatever they are seventy marks a day plus expenses i lied hoping that schemm hadnt checked it out what is more the germania life assurance and germania insurance companies will pay you a recovery fee of five per cent is that agreeable to you herr gunther mentally i calculated the figure to be with that sort of money i was set i found myself nodding although i didnt care for the ground rules he was laying down but then for nearly it was his game but i warn you im not a patient man he said i want results and i want them quickly i have written out a cheque for your immediate requirements he nodded to his stooge who handed me a cheque it was for marks and made out to cash at the privat kommerz bank schemm dug into his briefcase again and handed me a letter on the germania life assurance companys notepaper this states that you have been retained by our company to investigate the fire pending a claim by the estate the house was insured by us if you have any problems you should contact me on no account are you to bother herr six or to mention his name here is a file containing any background information you may need you seem to have thought of everything i said pointedly six stood up followed by schemm and then stiffly by me when will you start your investigations he said first thing in the morning excellent he clapped me on the shoulder ulrich will drive you home then he walked over to his desk sat down in his chair and settled down to go through some papers he didnt pay me any more attention when i stood in the modest hall again waiting for the butler to turn up with ulrich i heard another car draw up outside this one was too loud to be a limousine and i guessed that it was some kind of sports job a door slammed there were footsteps on the gravel and a key scraped in the lock of the front door through it came a woman i recognized immediately as the u f a film studio star lise rudel she was wearing a dark sable coat and an evening dress of blue satinorganza she looked at me puzzled while i just gawped back at her she was worth it she had the kind of body id only ever dreamed about in the sort of dream id often dreamed of having again there wasnt much i couldnt imagine it doing except the ordinary things like work and getting in a mans way good morning i said but the butler was there with his catburglars steps to take her mind off me and help her out of the sable farraj where is my husband herr six is in the library madam my blue eyes popped a good deal at that and i felt my jaw slacken that this goddess should be married to the gnome sitting in the study was the sort of thing that bolsters your faith in money i watched her walk towards the library door behind me frau six i couldnt get over it was tall and blonde and as healthylooking as her husbands swiss bank account there was a sulkiness about her mouth and my acquaintance with the science of physiognomy told me that she was used to having her own way in cash brilliant clips flashed on her perfect ears and as she got nearer the air was filled with the scent of cologne just as i thought she was going to ignore me she glanced in my direction and said coolly goodnight whoever you are then the library swallowed her whole before i had a chance to do the same i rolled my tongue up and tucked it back into my mouth i looked at my watch it was ulrich reappeared no wonder he stays up late i said and followed him through the door the following morning was grey and wet i woke with a whores drawers in my mouth drank a cup of coffee and went through the mornings berliner borsenzeitung which was even more difficult to understand than usual with sentences as long and as hardtoincomprehensible as a speech from hess shaved and dressed and carrying my laundry bag i was at alexanderplatz the chief traffic centre of east berlin less than an hour later approached from neue königstrasse the square is flanked by two great office blocks berolina haus to the right and alexander haus to the left where i had my office on the fourth floor i dropped off my laundry at adlers wetwash service on the ground floor before going up waiting for the lift it was hard to ignore the small noticeboard that was situated immediately next to it to which were pinned an appeal for contributions to the mother and child fund a party exhortation to go and see an antisemitic film and an inspiring picture of the führer this noticeboard was the responsibility of the buildings caretaker herr gruber a shifty little undertaker of a man not only is he the block airdefence monitor with police powers courtesy of orpo the regular uniformed police he is also a gestapo informer long ago i decided that it would be bad for business to fall out with gruber and so like all the other residents of alexander haus i gave him three marks a week which is supposed to cover my contributions to whichever new moneymaking scheme the d a f the german labour front has dreamed up i cursed the lifts lack of speed as i saw grubers door open just enough to permit his pepperedmackerel of a face to peer down the corridor ah herr gunther its you he said coming out of his office he edged towards me like a crab with a bad case of corns good morning herr gruber i said avoiding his face there was something about it that always reminded me of max schrecks screen portrayal of nosferatu an effect that was enhanced by the rodentlike washing movements of his skeletal hands there was a young lady who came for you he said i sent her up i do hope that was convenient herr gunther yes if shes still there that is he said that was at least half an hour ago only i knew fräulein lehmann is no longer working for you so i had to say that there was no telling when you would turn up you keeping such irregular hours to my relief the lift arrived and i drew open the door and stepped in thank you herr gruber i said and shut the door heil hitler he said the lift started to rise up the shaft i called heil hitler you dont miss the hitler salute with someone like gruber its not worth the trouble but one day im going to have to beat the crap out of that weasel just for the sheer pleasure of it i share the fourth floor with a german dentist a german insurance broker and a german employment agency the latter having provided me with the temporary secretary who i now presumed was the woman seated in my waiting room coming out of the lift i hoped that she wasnt battlescarred ugly i didnt suppose for a minute that i was going to get a juicy one but then i wasnt about to settle for any cobra either i opened the door herr gunther she stood up and i gave her the onceover well she wasnt as young as gruber had led me to believe i guessed her to be about fortyfive but not bad i thought a bit warm and cosy maybe she had a substantial backside but i happen to prefer them like that her hair was red with a touch of grey at the sides and on the crown and tied back in a knot she wore a suit of plain grey cloth a white highnecked blouse and a black hat with a breton brim turned up all around the head good morning i said as affably as i could manage on top of the mewling tomcat that was my hangover you must be my temporary secretary lucky to get a woman at all and this one looked halfreasonable frau protze she declared and shook my hand im a widow sorry i said unlocking the door to my office what part of bavaria are you from the accent was unmistakable regensburg thats a nice town you must have found buried treasure there witty too i thought that was good shed need a sense of humour to work for me i told her all about my business she said it all sounded very exciting i showed her into the adjoining cubicle where she was to sit on that backside actually its not so bad if you leave the door to the waiting room open i explained then i showed her the washroom along the corridor and apologized for the shards of soap and the dirty towels i pay seventyfive marks a month and i get a tip like this i said damn it im going to complain to that sonofabitch of a landlord but even as i said it i knew i never would back in my office i flipped open my diary and saw that the days only appointment was frau heine at eleven oclock ive an appointment in twenty minutes i said woman wants to know if ive managed to trace her missing son hes a jewish uboat a what a jew in hiding what did he do that he has to hide she said you mean apart from being a jew i said already i could see that she had led quite a sheltered life even for a regensburger and it seemed a shame to expose the poor woman to the potentially distressing sight of her countrys evilsmelling arse still she was all grownup now and i didnt have the time to worry about it he just helped an old man who was being beaten up by some thugs he killed one of them but surely if he was helping the old man ah but the old man was jewish i explained and the two thugs belonged to the s a strange how that changes everything isnt it his mother asked me to find out if he was still alive and still at liberty you see when a man is arrested and beheaded or sent to a k z the authorities dont always bother to inform his family there are a lot of mps missing persons from jewish families these days trying to find them is a large part of my business frau protze looked worried you help jews she said dont worry i said its perfectly legal and their money is as good as anyones i suppose so listen frau protze i said jews gypsies red indians its all the same to me ive got no reason to like them but i dont have any reason to hate them either when he walks through that door a jew gets the same deal as anyone else same as if he were the kaisers cousin but it doesnt mean im dedicated to their welfare business is business certainly said frau protze colouring a little i hope you dont think i have anything against the jews of course not i said but of course that is what everybody says even hitler good god i said when the uboats mother had left my office thats what a satisfied customer looks like the thought depressed me so much that i decided to get out for a while at loeser wolff i bought a packet of murattis after which i cashed sixs cheque i paid half of it into my own account and i treated myself to an expensive silk dressinggown at wertheims just for being lucky enough to land as sweet an earner as six then i walked southwest past the railway station from which a train now rumbled forth heading towards the jannowitz bridge to the corner of königstrasse where i had left my car lichterfeldeost is a prosperous residential district in southwest berlin much favoured by senior civil servants and members of the armed forces ordinarily it would have been way out of a young couples price league but then most young couples dont have a multimillionaire like hermann six for a father ferdinandstrasse ran south from the railway line there was a policeman a young anwarter in the orpo standing guard outside number which was missing most of the roof and all of its windows the bungalows blackened timbers and brickwork told the story eloquently enough i parked the hanomag and walked up to the garden gate where i flipped out my identification for the young bull a spottylooking youth of about twenty he looked at it carefully naively and said redundantly a private investigator eh sright ive been retained by the insurance company to investigate the fire i lit a cigarette and watched the match suggestively as it burned towards my fingertips he nodded but his face appeared troubled it cleared all of a sudden as he recognized me hey didnt you used to be in kripo up at the alex i nodded my nostrils trailing smoke like a factory chimney yes i thought i recognized the name bernhard gunther you caught gormann the strangler didnt you i remember reading about it in the newspapers you were famous i shrugged modestly but he was right when i caught gormann i was famous for a while i was a good bull in those days the young anwarter took off his shako and scratched the top of his squarish head well well he said and then im going to join kripo that is if theyll have me you seem a bright enough fellow you should do all right thanks he said hey how about a tip try scharhorn in the three oclock at the hoppegarten i shrugged hell i dont know whats your name young fellow eckhart he said wilhelm eckhart so wilhelm tell me about the fire first of all whos the pathologist on the case some fellow from the alex i think he was called upmann or illmann an old man with a small chinbeard and rimless glasses he nodded thats illmann when was he here day before yesterday him and kriminalkommissar jost jost its not like him to get his flippers dirty id have thought it would take more than just the murder of a millionaires daughter to get him off his fat arse i threw my cigarette away in the opposite direction from the gutted house there didnt seem any point in tempting fate i heard it was arson i said is that true wilhelm just smell the air he said i inhaled deeply and shook my head dont you smell the petrol no berlin always smells like this maybe ive just been standing here a long time well they found a petrol can in the garden so i guess that seals it look wilhelm would you mind if i just took a quick look around it would save me having to fill out some forms theyll have to let me have a look sooner or later go right ahead herr gunther he said opening the front gate not that theres much to see they took bags of stuff away with them i doubt theres anything that would be of interest to you i dont even know why im still here i expect its to watch out in case the murderer returns to the scene of the crime i said tantalizingly lord do you think he might breathed the boy i pursed my lips who knows i said although personally i had never heard of such a thing ill take a look anyway and thanks i appreciate it dont mention it he was right there wasnt much to see the man with the matches had done a proper job i looked in at the front door but there was so much debris i couldnt see anywhere for me to step round to the side i found a window that gave onto another room where the going wasnt so difficult underfoot hoping that i might at least find the safe i climbed inside not that i needed to be there at all i just wanted to form a picture inside my head i work better that way ive got a mind like a comic book so i wasnt too disappointed when i found that the police had already taken the safe away and that all that was left was a gaping hole in the wall there was always illmann i told myself back at the gate i found wilhelm trying to comfort an older woman of about sixty whose face was stained with tears the cleaning woman he explained she turned up just now apparently shes been away on holiday and hadnt heard about the fire poor old souls had a bit of a shock he asked her where she lived neuenburger strasse she sniffed im all right now thank you young man from her coat pocket she produced a small lace handkerchief which seemed as improbable in her large peasant hands as an antimacassar in those of max schmelling the boxer and quite inadequate for the task which lay before it she blew her pickledwalnut of a nose with the sort of ferocity and volume that made me want to hold my hat on my head then she wiped her big broad face with the soggy remnant smelling some information about the pfarr household i offered the old pork chop a lift home in my car its on the way i said i wouldnt want to put you to any trouble its no trouble at all i insisted well if you are sure that would be very kind of you i have had a bit of a shock she picked up the box that lay at her feet each one of which bulged over the top of its wellpolished black walking shoe like a butchers thumb in a thimble her name was frau schmidt youre a good sort herr gunther said wilhelm nonsense i said and so it was there was no telling what information i might glean from the old woman about her late employers i took the box from her hands let me help you with that i said it was a suitbox from stechbarths the official tailor to the services and i had the idea that she might have been bringing it for the pfarrs i nodded silently at wilhelm and led the way to the car neuenburger strasse i repeated as we drove off thats off lindenstrasse isnt it she confirmed that it was gave me some directions and was silent for a moment then she started weeping again what a terrible tragedy she sobbed yes yes its most unfortunate i wondered how much wilhelm had told her the less the better i thought reasoning that the less shocked she was at least at this stage the more i would get out of her are you a policeman she asked im investigating the fire i said evasively im sure you must be too busy to drive an old woman like me across berlin why dont you drop me on the other side of the bridge and ill walk the rest im all right now really i am its no trouble anyway id quite like to talk to you about the pfarrs that is if it wouldnt upset you we crossed the landwehr canal and came onto bellealliance platz in the centre of which rises the great column of peace you see there will have to be an inquest and it would help me if i knew as much about them as possible yes well i dont mind if you think i can be of assistance she said when we got to neuenburger strasse i parked the car and followed the old woman up to the second floor of an apartment building that was several storeys high frau schmidts apartment was typical of the older generation of people in this city the furniture was solid and elaborate berliners spend a lot of money on their tables and chairs and there was a big porcelaintiled stove in the living room a copy of an engraving by dürer which was as common in the berliners home as an aquarium in a doctors waiting room hung dully above a dark red biedermeier sideboard on which were placed various photographs including one of our beloved führer and a little silk swastika mounted in a large bronze frame there was also a drinks tray from which i took a bottle of schnapps and poured a small glassful youll feel better after youve drunk this i said handing her the glass and wondering whether or not i dared take the liberty of pouring myself one too enviously i watched her knock it back in one smacking her fat lips she sat down on a brocaded chair by the window feel up to answering a few questions she nodded what do you want to know well for a start how long had you known herr and frau pfarr hmm lets see now a silent movie of uncertainty flickered on the womans face the voice emptied slowly out of the boris karloff mouth with its slightly protruding teeth like grit from a bucket it must be a year i suppose she stood up again and removed her coat revealing a dingy floralpatterned smock then she coughed for several seconds tapping herself on the chest as she did so all this time i stood squarely in the middle of the room my hat on the back of my head and my hands in my pockets i asked her what sort of couple the pfarrs had been i mean were they happy argumentative she nodded to both of these suggestions when i first went to work there they were very much in love she said but it wasnt long after that that she lost her job as a schoolteacher quite cut up about it she was and before long they were arguing not that he was there very often when i was but when he was then more often than not theyd have words and i dont mean squabbles like most couples no they had loud angry arguments almost as if they hated each other and a couple of times i found her crying in her room afterwards well i really dont know what it was they had to be unhappy about they had a lovely home it was a pleasure to clean it so it was mind you they werent flashy i never once saw her spending lots of money on things she had lots of nice clothes but nothing showy any jewellery i believe she had some jewellery but i cant say as i remember her wearing it but then i was only there in the daytime on the other hand there was an occasion when i moved his jacket and some earrings fell onto the floor and they werent the sort of earrings that she would have worn how do you mean these were for pierced ears and frau pfarr only ever wore clips so i drew my own conclusions but said nothing it was none of my business what he got up to but i reckon she had her suspicions she wasnt a stupid woman far from it i believe thats what drove her to drink as much as she did did she drink like a sponge what about him he worked at the ministry of the interior didnt he she shrugged it was some government place but i couldnt tell you what it was called he was something to do with the law he had a certificate on the wall of his study all the same he was very quiet about his work and very careful not to leave papers lying around so that i might see them not that i would have read them mind but he didnt take the chance did he work at home much sometimes and i know he used to spend time at that big office building on bülowplatz you know the one that used to be the headquarters for them bolsheviks you mean the d a f building the headquarters of the german labour front thats what it is now that the kozis have been thrown out of it thats right now and again herr pfarr would give me a lift there you see my sister lives in brunenstrasse and normally id catch a number to rosenthaler platz after work now and then herr pfarr was kind enough to run me as far as bülowplatz where id see him go in the d a f building you saw them last when its two weeks yesterday ive been on holiday see a strength through joy trip to rugen island i saw her but not him how was she she seemed quite happy for a change not only that but she didnt have a drink in her hand when she spoke to me she told me that she was planning a little holiday to the spas she often went there i think she got dried out i see and so this morning you went to ferdinandstrasse via the tailors is that correct frau schmidt yes thats right i often did little errands for herr pfarr he was usually too busy to get to the shops and so hed pay me to get things for him before i went on holiday there was a note asking me to drop his suit off at his tailors and that they knew all about it his suit you say well yes i think so i picked up the box mind if i take a look i dont see why not hes dead after all isnt he even before i had removed the lid i had a pretty good idea of what was in the box i wasnt wrong there was no mistaking the midnight black that echoed the old elitist cavalry regiments of the kaisers army the wagnerian doublelightning flash on the right collarpatch and the romanstyle eagle and swastika on the left sleeve the three pips on the left collarpatch denoted the wearer of the uniform as a captain or whatever the fancy rank that captains were called in the s s was there was a piece of paper pinned to the right sleeve it was an invoice from stechbarths addressed to hauptstuürmführer pfarr for twentyfive marks i whistled so paul pfarr was a black angel id never have believed it said frau schmidt you mean you never saw him wearing this she shook her head i never even saw it hanging in his wardrobe is that so i wasnt sure whether i believed her or not but i could think of no reason why she should lie about it it was not uncommon for lawyers german lawyers working for the reich to be in the s s i imagined pfarr wearing his uniform on ceremonial occasions only it was frau schmidts turn to look puzzled i meant to ask you how the fire started i thought for a minute and decided to let her have it without any of the protective padding in the hope that the shock would stop her asking some awkward questions that i couldnt answer it was arson i said quietly they were both murdered her jaw dropped like a catflap and her eyes moistened again as if she had stepped into a draught good god she gasped how terrible whoever could do such a thing thats a good question i said do you know if either of them had any enemies she sighed deeply and then shook her head did you ever overhear either of them arguing with someone other than each other on the telephone perhaps somebody at the door anything she continued to shake her head wait a minute though she said slowly yes there was one occasion several months ago i heard herr pfarr arguing with another man in his study it was pretty heated and i can tell you some of the language they used was not fit to be heard by decent folk they were arguing about politics at least i think it was politics herr six was saying some terrible things about the führer which did you say herr six yes she said he was the other man after a while he came storming out of the study and through the front door with a face like pigs liver nearly knocked me over he did can you remember what else was said only that each accused the other of trying to ruin him where was frau pfarr when all this happened she was away on one of her trips i think thank you i said youve been most helpful and now i must be getting back to alexanderplatz i turned towards the door excuse me said frau schmidt she pointed to the tailors box what shall i do with herr pfarrs uniform mail it i said putting a couple of marks on the table to reichsführer himmler prinz albrecht strasse number simeonstrasse is only a couple of streets away from neuenburger strasse but where the windows of the buildings in the latter are lacking paint in simeonstrasse they are lacking glass calling it a poor area is a bit like saying that joey goebbels has a problem finding his size in shoes tenement buildings five and sixstoreys high closed in on a narrow crocodiles back of deep cobblestones like two granite cliffs linked only by the ropebridges of washing sullen youths each one of them with a rollup hanging in ashes from his thin lips like a trail of shit from a bowlbored goldfish buttressed the ragged corners of gloomy alleyways staring blankly at the colony of snotnosed children who hopped and skipped along the pavements the children played noisily oblivious to the presence of these older ones and taking no notice of the crudely daubed swastikas hammers and sickles and general obscenities that marked the street walls and which were their elders dividing dogmas below the level of the rubbishstrewn streets and under the shadow of the suneclipsing edifices which enclosed them were the cellars that contained the small shops and offices that served the area not that it needs much in the way of service there is no money in an area like this and for most of these concerns business is about as brisk as a set of oak floorboards in a lutheran church hall it was into one of these small shops a pawnbroker that i went ignoring the large star of david daubed on the wooden shutters that protected the shop window from breakage a bell rang as i opened and shut the door doubly deprived of daylight the shops only source of illumination was an oil lamp hanging from the low ceiling and the general effect was that of the inside of an old sailing ship i browsed around waiting for weizmann the proprietor to appear from the back of the shop there was an old pickelhaube helmet a stuffed marmot in a glass case that looked as if it had perished of anthrax and an old siemens vacuumcleaner there were several cases full of military medals mostly secondclass iron crosses like mine own twenty odd volumes of kohlers naval calendar full of ships long since sunk or sent to the breakers yard a blaupunkt radio a chipped bust of bismarck and an old leica i was inspecting the case of medals when a smell of tobacco and weizmanns familiar cough announced his present appearance you should look after yourself weizmann and what would i do with a long life the threat of weizmanns wheezing cough was ever present in his speech it lay in wait to trip him like a sleeping halberdier sometimes he managed to catch himself but this time he fell into a spasm of coughing that sounded hardly human at all more like someone trying to start a car with an almost flat battery and as usual it seemed to afford him no relief whatsoever nor did it require him to remove the pipe from his tobaccopouch of a mouth you should try inhaling a little bit of air now and then i told him or at least something you havent first set on fire air he said it goes straight to my head anyway im training myself to do without it theres no telling when theyll ban jews from breathing oxygen he lifted the counter come into the back room my friend and tell me what service i can do for you i followed him round the counter past an empty bookcase is business picking up then i said he turned to look at me what happened to all the books weizmann shook his head sadly unfortunately i had to remove them the nuremberg laws he said with a scornful laugh they forbid a jew to sell books even secondhand ones he turned and passed on through to the back room these days i believe in the law like i believe in horst wessels heroism horst wessel i said never heard of him weizmann smiled and pointed at an old jacquard sofa with the stem of his reeking pipe sit down bernie and let me fix us a drink well what do you know they still let jews drink booze i was almost feeling sorry for you back there when you told me about those books things are never as bad as they seem just as long as theres a drink about thats the truth my friend he opened a corner cabinet found the bottle of schnapps and poured it carefully but generously handing me my glass he said ill tell you something if it wasnt for all the people who drink this country really would be in a hell of a state he raised his glass let us wish for more drunks and the frustration of an efficiently run national socialist germany to more drunks i said watching him drink it almost too gratefully he had a shrewd face with a mouth that wore a wry smile even with the chimneystack a large fleshy nose separated eyes that were rather too closely set together and supported a pair of thick rimless glasses the stilldark hair was brushed neatly to the right of a high forehead wearing his wellpressed blue pinstriped suit weizmann looked not unlike ernst lubitsch the comic actor turned film director he sat down at an old rolltop and turned sideways to face me so what can i do for you i showed him the photograph of sixs necklace he wheezed a little as he looked at it and then coughed his way into a remark if its real he smiled and nodded his head from side to side is it real of course its real or why else would you be showing me such a nice photograph well then it looks like a very fine piece indeed its been stolen i said bernie with you sitting there i didnt think it was stuck up a tree waiting for the fire service he shrugged but such a finelooking necklace what can i tell you about it that you dont already know come on weizmann until you got caught thieving you were one of friedlaenders best jewellers ah you put it so delicately after twenty years in the business you know bells like you know your own waistcoat pocket twentytwo years he said quietly and poured us both another glass very well ask your questions bernie and we shall see what we shall see how would someone go about getting rid of it you mean some other way than just dropping it in the landwehr canal for money it would depend on what i said patiently on whether the person in possession was jewish or gentile come on weizmann i said you dont have to keep wringing the yarmulke for my benefit no seriously bernie right now the market for gems is at rock bottom there are lots of jews leaving germany who to fund their emigration must sell the family jewels at least those who are lucky enough to have any to sell and as you might expect they get the lowest prices a gentile could afford to wait for the market to become more buoyant a jew could not coughing in small explosive bursts he took another longer look at sixs photograph and gave a chesty little shrug way out of my league i can tell you that much sure i buy some small stuff but nothing big enough to interest the boys from the alex like you they know about me bernie theres my time in the cement for a start if i was to step badly out of line theyd have me in a k z quicker than the drawers off a kitkat showgirl wheezing like a leaky old harmonium weizmann grinned and handed the photograph back to me amsterdam would be the best place to sell it he said if you could get it out of germany that is german customs officers are a smugglers nightmare not that there arent plenty of people in berlin who would buy it like who for instance the twotray boys one tray on top and one under the counter they might be interested like peter neumaier hes got a nice little shop on schlüterstrasse specializing in antique jewellery this might be his sort of thing ive heard hes got plenty of flea and can pay it in whatever currency you like yes id have thought hed certainly be worth checking out he wrote the name down on a piece of paper then we have werner seldte he may appear to be a bit potsdam but hes not above buying some hot bells potsdam was a word of faint opprobrium for people who like the antiquated proroyalists of that town were smug hypocritical and hopelessly dated in both intellectual and social ideas frankly hes got fewer scruples than a backstreet angelmaker his shop is on budapester strasse or ebertstrasse or hermann goering strasse or whatever the hell the party calls it now then there are the dealers the diamond merchants who buy and sell from classy offices where a browser for an engagement ring is about as popular as a pork chop in a rabbis coat pocket these are the sort of people who do most of their business on the gabbler he wrote down some more names this one laser oppenheimer hes a jew thats just to show that im fair and that ive got nothing against gentiles oppenheimer has an office on joachimsthaler strasse anyway the last i heard of him he was still in business theres gert jeschonnek new to berlin used to be based in munich from what ive heard hes the worst kind of march violet you know climbing on board the party wagon and riding it to make a quick profit hes got a very smart set of offices in that steel monstrosity on potsdamer platz whats it called columbus haus i said thats it columbus haus they say that hitler doesnt much care for modern architecture bernie do you know what that means weizmann gave a little chuckle it means that he and i have something in common is there anyone else maybe i dont know its possible who our illustrious prime minister goering buying hot bells are you serious oh yes he said firmly that man has a passion for owning expensive things and hes not always as fussy as he could be regarding how he gets hold of them jewels are one thing i know he has a weakness for when i was at friedlaenders he used to come into the shop quite often he was poor in those days at least too poor to buy much but you could see he would have bought a great deal if he had been able to jesus christ weizmann i said can you imagine it me dropping in at karinhall and saying excuse me herr prime minister but you wouldnt happen to know anything about a valuable diamond necklace that some coat has clawed from a ferdinandstrasse residence in the past few days i trust you would have no objections to me taking a look down your wife emmys dress and seeing if shes got them hidden somewhere between the exhibits youd have the devils own job to find anything down there wheezed weizmann excitedly that fat sow is almost as big as he is ill bet she could breastfeed the entire hitler youth and still have milk enough left for hermanns breakfast he began a fit of coughing which would have carried off another man i waited until it had found a lower gear and then produced a fifty he waved it away what did i tell you let me buy something then whats the matter are you running out of crap all of a sudden no but wait though he said there is something you might like to buy a finger lifted it at a big parade on unter den linden he got up and went into the small kitchen behind the office when he came back he was carrying a packet of persil thanks i said but i send my stuff to the laundry no no no he said pushing his hand into the powder i hid it in here just in case i had any unwelcome visitors ah here we are he withdrew a small flat silvery object from the packet and polished it on his lapel before laying it flat on my palm it was an ovalshaped disc about the size of a matchbox on one side was the ubiquitous german eagle clutching the laurel crown that encircled the swastika and on the other were the words secret state police and a serial number at the top was a small hole by which the bearer of the badge could attach it to the inside of his jacket it was a gestapo warrantdisc that ought to open a few doors for you bernie youre not joking i said christ if they caught you with this yes i know it would save you a great deal of slip money dont you think so if you want it ill ask fifty for it fair enough i said although i wasnt sure about carrying it myself what he said was true it would save on bribes but if i was caught using it id be on the first train to sachsenhausen i paid him the fifty a bull without his beertoken god id like to have seen the bastards face thats like a hornplayer without a mouthpiece i stood up to go thanks for the information i said and in case you didnt know its summertime up on the surface yes i noticed that the rain was a little warmer than usual at least a rotten summer is one thing they cant blame on the jews dont you believe it i said there was chaos back at alexanderplatz where a tram had derailed the clock in the tall redbrick tower of st georges was striking three oclock reminding me that i hadnt eaten anything since a bowl of quaker quick flakes for the youth of the nation since breakfast i went to the café stock it was close by wertheims department store and in the shadow of the sbahn railway viaduct the café stock was a modest little restaurant with an even more modest bar in the far corner such was the size of the eponymous proprietors bibulous belly that there was only just room for him to squeeze behind the bar and as i came through the door it was there that i found him standing pouring beers and polishing glasses while his pretty little wife waited on the tables these tables were often taken by kripo officers from the alex and this had the effect of obliging stock to play up his commitment to national socialism there was a large picture of the führer on the wall as well as a printed sign that said always give the hitler salute stock wasnt always that way and before march he had been a bit of a red he knew that i knew it and it always worried him that there were others who would remember it too so i didnt blame him for the picture and the sign everyone in germany was somebody different before march and as im always saying who isnt a national socialist when theres a gun pointed at his head i sat down at an empty table and surveyed the rest of the clientele a couple of tables away were two bulls from the queer squad the department for the suppression of homosexuality a bunch of what are little better than blackmailers at a table next to them and sitting on his own was a young kriminalassistent from the station at wedersche market whose badly pockmarked face i remembered chiefly for his having once arrested my informer neumann on suspicion of theft frau stock took my order of pigs knuckle with sauerkraut briskly and without much in the way of pleasantry a shrewish woman she knew and disapproved of my paying stock for small snippets of interesting gossip about what was going on at the alex with so many officers coming in and out of the place he often heard quite a lot she moved off to the dumbwaiter and shouted my order down the shaft to the kitchen stock squeezed out from behind his bar and ambled over he had a copy of the party newspaper the beobachter in his fat hand hallo bernie he said lousy weather were having eh wet as a poodle max i said ill have a beer when youre ready coming right up you want to look at the paper anything in it mr and mrs charles lindbergh are in berlin hes the fellow that flew across the atlantic it sounds fascinating really it does i suppose the great aviator will be opening a few bomber factories while hes here maybe even take a testflight in a shiny new fighter perhaps they want him to pilot one all the way to spain stock looked nervously over his shoulder and gestured for me to lower my voice not so loud bernie he said twitching like a rabbit youll get me shot muttering unhappily he went off to get my beer i glanced at the newspaper he had left on my table there was a small paragraph about the investigation of a fire on ferdinandstrasse in which two people are known to have lost their lives which made no mention of their names or their relation to my client or that the police were treating it as a murder investigation i tossed it contemptuously onto another table theres more real news on the back of a matchbox than there is in the beobachter meanwhile the detectives from the queer squad were leaving and stock came back with my beer he held the glass up for my attention before placing it on the table a nice sergeantmajor on it like always he said thanks i took a long drink and then wiped some of the sergeantmajor off my upper lip with the back of my hand frau stock collected my lunch from the dumbwaiter and brought it over she gave her husband a look that should have burned a hole in his shirt but he pretended not to have seen it then she went to clear the table that was being vacated by the pockmarked kriminalassistant stock sat down and watched me eat after a while i said so what have you heard anything a mans body fished out of the landwehr thats about as unusual as a fat railwayman i told him the canal is the gestapos toilet you know that its got so that if someone disappears in this goddamn city its quicker to look for him at the lightermans office than police headquarters or the city morgue yes but this one had a billiard cue up his nose it penetrated the bottom of his brain they reckoned i put down my knife and fork would you mind laying off the gory details until ive finished my food i said sorry said stock well thats all there is really but they dont normally do that sort of thing do they the gestapo theres no telling what is considered normal on prinz albrecht strasse perhaps hed been sticking his nose in where it wasnt wanted they might have wanted to do something poetic i wiped my mouth and laid some change on the table which stock collected up without bothering to count it funny to think that it used to be the art school gestapo headquarters i mean hilarious i bet the poor bastards they work over up there go to sleep as happy as little snowmen at the notion i stood up and went to the door nice about the lindberghs though i walked back to the office frau protze was polishing the glass on the yellowing print of tilly that hung on the wall of my waiting room contemplating with some amusement the predicament of the hapless burgomeister of rothenburg as i came through the door the phone started to ring frau protze smiled at me and then stepped smartly into her little cubicle to answer it leaving me to look afresh at the clean picture it was a long time since id really looked at it the burgomeister having pleaded with tilly the sixteenthcentury commander of the imperial german army for his town to be spared destruction was required by his conqueror to drink six litres of beer without drawing breath as i remembered the story the burgomeister had pulled off this prodigious feat of bibbing and the town had been saved it was as i had always thought so characteristically german and just the sort of sadistic trick some s a thug would play nothing really changes that much its a lady frau protze called to me she wont give her name but she insists on speaking to you then put her through i said stepping into my office i picked up the candlestick and the earpiece we met last night said the voice i cursed thinking it was carola the girl from dagmarrs wedding reception i wanted to forget all about that little episode but it wasnt carola or perhaps i should say this morning it was pretty late you were on your way out and i was just coming back after a party do you remember frau i hesitated still not quite able to believe it please she said less of the frau lise rudel if you dont mind herr gunther i dont mind at all i said how could i not remember you might she said you looked very tired her voice was as sweet as a plate of kaisers pancakes hermann and i we often forget that other people dont keep such late hours if youll permit me to say so you looked pretty good on it well thank you she cooed sounding genuinely flattered in my experience you can never flatter any woman too much just as you can never give a dog too many biscuits and how can i be of service id like to speak to you on a matter of some urgency she said all the same id rather not talk about it on the telephone come and see me here in my office im afraid i cant im at the studios in babelsberg right now perhaps you would care to come to my apartment this evening your apartment i said well yes id be delighted where is it badenschestrasse number shall we say nine oclock that would be fine she hung up i lit a cigarette and smoked it absently she was probably working on a film i thought and imagined her telephoning me from her dressing room wearing only a robe having just finished a scene in which shed been required to swim naked in a mountain lake that took me quite a few minutes ive got a good imagination then i got to wondering if six knew about the apartment i decided he did you dont get to be as rich as six was without knowing your wife had her own place she probably kept it on in order to retain a degree of independence i guessed that there wasnt much she couldnt have had if she really put her mind to it putting her body to it as well probably got her the moon and a couple of galaxies on top all the same i didnt think it was likely that six knew or would have approved of her seeing me not after what he had said about me not poking into his family affairs whatever it was she wanted to talk to me urgently about was certainly not for the gnomes ears i called müller the crime reporter on the berliner morgenpost which was the only halfdecent rag left on the newsstand müller was a good reporter gone to seed there wasnt much call for the old style of crimereporting the ministry of propaganda had seen to that look i said after the preliminaries i need some biographical information from your library files as much as you can get and as soon as possible on hermann six the steel millionaire working on his daughters death eh bernie ive been retained by the insurance company to investigate the fire what have you got so far you could write what i know on a tram ticket well said müller thats about the size of the piece weve got on it for tomorrows edition the ministry has told us to lay off it just to record the facts and keep it small hows that six has got some powerful friends bernie his sort of money buys an awful lot of silence were you onto anything i heard it was arson thats about all when do you need this stuff fifty says tomorrow and anything you can dig up on the rest of the family i can always use a little extra money be talking to you i hung up and shoved some papers inside some old newspapers and then dumped them in one of the desk drawers that still had a bit of space after that i doodled on the blotter and then picked up one of the several paperweights that were lying on the desk i was rolling its cold bulk around my hands when there was a knock at the door frau protze edged into the room i wondered if there was any filing that needed to be done i pointed at the untidy stacks of files that lay on the floor behind my desk thats my filing system there i said believe it or not they are in some sort of order she smiled humouring me no doubt and nodded attentively as if i was explaining something that would change her life and are they all work in progress i laughed this isnt a lawyers office i said with quite a few of them i dont know whether they are in progress or not investigation isnt a fast business with quick results you have to have a lot of patience yes i can see that she said there was only one photograph on my desk she turned it round to get a better look at it shes very beautiful your wife she was died on the day of the kapp putsch i must have made that remark a hundred times allying her death to another event like that well it plays down how much i still miss her even after sixteen years never successfully however it was spanish influenza i explained we were together for only ten months frau protze nodded sympathetically we were both silent for a moment then i looked at my watch you can go home if you like i told her when she had gone i stood at my high window a long time and watched the wet streets below glistening like patent leather in the late afternoon sunlight the rain had stopped and it looked as though it would be a fine evening already the office workers were making their ways home streaming out of berolina haus opposite and down into the labyrinth of underground tunnels and walkways that led to the alexanderplatz ubahn station berlin i used to love this old city but that was before it had caught sight of its own reflection and taken to wearing corsets laced so tight that it could hardly breathe i loved the easy carefree philosophies the cheap jazz the vulgar cabarets and all of the other cultural excesses that characterized the weimar years and made berlin seem like one of the most exciting cities in the world behind my office to the southeast was police headquarters and i imagined all the good hard work that was being done there to crack down on berlins crime villainies like speaking disrespectfully of the führer displaying a sold out sign in your butchers shop window not giving the hitler salute and homosexuality that was berlin under the national socialist government a big haunted house with dark corners gloomy staircases sinister cellars locked rooms and a whole attic full of poltergeists on the loose throwing books banging doors breaking glass shouting in the night and generally scaring the owners so badly that there were times when they were ready to sell up and get out but most of the time they just stopped up their ears covered their blackened eyes and tried to pretend that there was nothing wrong cowed with fear they spoke very little ignoring the carpet moving underneath their feet and their laughter was the thin nervous kind that always accompanies the bosss little joke policing like autobahn construction and informing is one of the new germanys growth industries and so the alex is always busy even though it was past closing time for most of the departments that had dealings with the public there were still a great many people milling about the various entrances to the building when i got there entrance four for the passport office was especially busy berliners many of them jewish who had queued all day for an exit visa were even now emerging from this part of the alex their faces happy or sad according to the success of their enterprise i walked on down alexanderstrasse and passed entrance three in front of which a couple of traffic police nicknamed white mice because of their distinctive short white coats were climbing off their powderblue bmw motorcycles a green minna a policevan came racing down the street martinhorn blaring in the direction of jannowitz bridge oblivious to the noise the two white mice swaggered in through entrance three to make their reports i went in by entrance two knowing the place well enough to have chosen the entrance where i was least likely to be challenged by someone if i was stopped i was on my way to room the lost property office but entrance two also serves the police morgue i walked nonchalantly along a corridor and down into the basement past a small canteen to a fire exit i pushed the bar on the door down and found myself in a large cobbled courtyard where several police cars were parked one of these was being washed by a man wearing gumboots who paid me no attention as i crossed the yard and ducked into another doorway this led to the boiler room and i stopped there for a moment while i made a mental check of my bearings i hadnt worked at the alex for ten years not to know my way around my only concern was that i might meet someone who knew me i opened the only other door that led out of the boiler room and ascended a short staircase into a corridor at the end of which was the morgue when i entered the morgues outer office i encountered a sour smell that was reminiscent of warm wet poultry flesh it mixed with the formaldehyde to make a sickly cocktail that i felt in my stomach at the same time as i drew it into my nostrils the office barely furnished with a couple of chairs and a table contained nothing to warn the unwary of what lay beyond the two glass doors except the smell and a sign which simply read morgue entrance forbidden i opened the doors a crack and looked inside in the centre of a grim damp room was an operatingtable that was also part trough on opposite sides of a stained ceramic gulley were two marble slabs set slightly at an angle so that fluids from a corpse could drain into the centre and be washed down a drain by water from one of the two tall murmuring taps that were situated at each end the table was big enough for two corpses laid headtotoe one on each side of the drain but there was only one cadaver that of a male which lay under the knife and the surgical saw these were wielded by a bent slight man with thin dark hair a high forehead glasses a long hooked nose a neat moustache and a small chinbeard he was wearing gumboots a heavy apron rubber gloves and a stiff collar and a tie i stepped quietly through the doors and contemplated the corpse with professional curiosity moving closer i tried to see what had caused the mans death it was clear that the body had been lying in water since the skin was sodden and peeling away on the hands and feet like gloves and socks otherwise it was in largely reasonable condition with the exception of the head this was black in colour and completely featureless like a muddy football and the top part of the cranium had been sawn away and the brain removed like a wet gordian knot it now lay in a kidneyshaped dish awaiting dissection confronted with violent death in all its ghastly hues contorted attitudes and porcine fleshiness i had no more reaction than if i had been looking in the window of my local german butchers shop except that this one had more meat on display sometimes i was surprised at the totality of my own indifference to the sight of the stabbed the drowned the crushed the shot the burnt and the bludgeoned although i knew well how that insensitivity had come about seeing so much death on the turkish front and in my service with kripo i had almost ceased to regard a corpse as being in any way human this acquaintance with death had persisted since my becoming a private investigator when the trail of a missing person so often led to the morgue at st gertrauden berlins largest hospital or to a salvagemans hut near a levee on the landwehr canal i stood there for several minutes staring at the gruesome scene in front of me and puzzled as to what had produced the condition of the head and the differing one of the body before eventually dr illmann glanced round and saw me good god he growled bernhard gunther are you still alive i approached the table and blew a breath of disgust christ i said the last time i came across body odour this bad a horse was sitting on my face hes quite a picture isnt he youre telling me what was he doing frenching a polar bear or maybe hitler kissed him unusual isnt it almost as if the head were burned acid yes illmann sounded pleased like i was a clever pupil very good its difficult to say what kind but most probably hydrochloric or sulphuric like someone didnt want you to know who he was precisely so mind you it doesnt disguise the cause of death he had a broken billiard cue forced up one of his nostrils it pierced the brain killing him instantly not a very common way of killing a man indeed in my experience it is unique however one learns not to be surprised at the various ways in which murderers choose to kill their victims but im sure youre not surprised you always did have a good imagination for a bull bernie to say nothing of your nerve you know youve got a hell of a nerve just walking in here like this its only my sentimental nature that stops me from having you thrown out on your ear i need to talk to you about the pfarr case you did the pm didnt you youre well informed he said as a matter of fact the family reclaimed the bodies this morning and your report look i cant talk here ill be through with our friend on the slab in a while give me an hour where how about the künstler eck on alt kolln its quiet there and we wont be disturbed the künstler eck i repeated ill find it i turned back towards the glass doors oh and bernie make sure you bring a little something for my expenses the independent township of alt kölln long since absorbed by the capital is a small island on the river spree largely given up to museums it has thus earned itself the sobriquet museum island but i have to confess that i have never seen the inside of one of them im not much interested in the past and if you ask me it is this countrys obsession with its history that has partly put us where we are now in the shit you cant go into a bar without some arsehole going on about our pre borders or harking back to bismarck and when we kicked the stuffing out of the french these are old sores and to my mind it doesnt do any good to keep picking at them from the outside there was nothing about the place that would have attracted the passerby to drop in for a casual drink not the doors scruffy paintwork nor the driedup flowers in the windowbox and certainly not the poorly handwritten sign in the dirty window which read tonights speech can be heard here i cursed for this meant that joey the cripp was addressing a party rally that evening and as a result there would be the usual traffic chaos i went down the steps and opened the door there was even less about the inside of the künstler eck that would have persuaded the casual drinker to stay awhile the walls were covered with gloomy wood carvings tiny models of cannons deaths heads coffins and skeletons against the far wall was a large pumporgan painted to look like a graveyard with crypts and graves yielding up their dead at which a hunchback was playing a piece by haydn this was as much for his own benefit as anyone elses since a group of stormtroopers were singing my prussia stands so proud and great with sufficient gusto as to almost completely drown the hunchbacks playing ive seen some odd things in berlin in my time but this was like something from a conrad veidt film and not a very good one at that i expected the onearmed policecaptain to come in at any moment instead i found illmann sitting alone in a corner nursing a bottle of engelhardt i ordered two more of the same and sat down as the stormtroopers finished their song and the hunchback commenced a massacre of one of my favourite schubert sonatas this is a hell of a place to choose i said grimly im afraid that i find it curiously quaint just the place to meet your friendly neighbourhood bodysnatcher dont you see enough of death during the day that you have to come to drink in a charnelhouse like this he shrugged unabashedly it is only with death around me that i am constantly reminded that i am alive theres a lot to be said for necrophilia illmann smiled as if agreeing with me so you want to know about the poor hauptsturmführer and his little wife eh i nodded this is an interesting case and i dont mind telling you the interesting ones are becoming increasingly rare with all the people who wind up dead in this city you would think i was busy but of course there is usually little or no mystery about how most of them got that way half the time i find myself presenting the forensic evidence of a homicide to the very people who committed it its an upside down world that we live in he opened his briefcase and took out a blue ringfile i brought the photographs i thought you would want to see the happy couple im afraid theyre a pair of real stokers i was only able to make the identification from their wedding rings his and hers i flicked through the file the camera angles changed but the subject remained the same two gunmetal grey corpses bald like egyptian pharaohs lay on the exposed and blackened springs of what had once been a bed like sausages left too long under the grill nice album what were they doing having a punchup i said noticing the way in which each corpse had its fists raised like a bareknuckle fighter a common enough observation in a death like this what about those cuts in the skin they look like knife wounds again what one would expect said illmann the heat in a conflagration causes the skin to split open like a ripe banana that is if you can remember what a banana looks like where did you find the petrol cans he raised his eyebrows quizzically oh you know about those do you yes we found two empty cans in the garden i dont think theyd been there very long they werent rusted and there was still a small amount of petrol which remained unevaporated in the bottom of one of them and according to the fire officer there was a strong smell of petrol about the place arson then undoubtedly so what made you look for bullets experience with a postmortem following a fire one always keeps in mind the possibility that there has been an attempt to destroy evidence its standard procedure i found three bullets in the female two in the male and three in the headboard of the bed the female was dead before the fire started she was hit in the head and the throat not so the male there were smoke particles in the air passages and carbon monoxide in the blood the tissues were still pink he was hit in the chest and in the face has the gun been found yet i asked no but i can tell you that it was most probably a mm automatic and something quite hard on its ammunition like an old mauser and they were shot from what sort of distance i should say the murderer was about cm from the victims when firing the weapon the entry and exit wounds were consistent with the murderer having stood at the bottom of the bed and of course there are the bullets in the headboard just the one weapon you think illmann nodded eight bullets i said thats a whole magazine for a pocket pistol isnt it somebody was making very sure or else they were very angry christ didnt the neighbours hear anything apparently not if they did they probably thought it was just the gestapo having a little party the fire wasnt reported until am by which time there was no chance of bringing it under control the hunchback abandoned his organ recital as the stormtroopers launched into a rendition of germany thou art our pride one of them a big burly fellow with a scar on his face the length and consistency of a piece of baconrind walked round the bar waving his beer and demanding that the rest of the künstler ecks customers join in the singing illmann did not seem to mind and sang in a loud baritone my own singing showed a considerable want of key and alacrity loud songs do not a patriot make the trouble with these fucking national socialists especially the young ones is that they think they have got a monopoly on patriotism and even if they dont have one now the way things are going they soon will when the song was over i asked illmann some more questions they were both naked he told me and had drunk a good deal she had consumed several ohio cocktails and hed had a large amount of beer and schnapps more than likely they were quite drunk when they were shot also i took a high vaginal swab in the female and found recent semen which was of the same blood type as the male i think theyd had quite an evening oh yes she was eight weeks pregnant ah lifes little candle burns but briefly pregnant i repeated the word thoughtfully illmann stretched and yawned yes he said want to know what they had for dinner no i said firmly tell me about the safe instead was it open or shut open he paused you know its interesting you didnt ask me how it was opened which leads me to suppose that you already knew that beyond a bit of scorching the safe was undamaged that if the safe was opened illegally then it was done by someone who knew what he was doing a stockinger safe is no pushover any piano players on it illmann shook his head it was too badly scorched to take any prints he said let us assume i said that immediately prior to the deaths of the pfarrs the safe contained what it contained and that it was as it should have been locked up for the night very well then there are two possibilities one is that a professional nutcracker did the job and then killed them and the other is that someone forced them to open it and then ordered them back to bed where he shot them still its not like a pro to have left the safe door open unless he was trying hard to look like an amateur said illmann my own opinion is that they were both asleep when they were shot certainly from the angle of bullet entry i would say that both of them were lying down now if you were conscious and someone had a gun on you its more than likely you would be sitting up in bed and so i would conclude that your intimidation theory is unlikely he looked at his watch and finished his beer patting my leg he added warmly its been good bernie just like the old days how pleasant to talk to someone whose idea of detective work does not involve a spotlight and a set of brass knuckles still i wont have to put up with the alex for much longer our illustrious reichskriminaldirektor arthur nebe is retiring me just as hes retired the other old conservatives before me i didnt know you were interested in politics i said im not he said but isnt that how hitler got elected in the first place too many people who didnt give a shit who was running the country the funny thing is that i care even less now than i did before catch me joining those march violets on the bandwagon but i wont be sorry to leave im tired of all the squabbling that goes on between sipo and orpo as to who controls kripo it gets very confusing when it comes to filing a report not knowing whether or not one should be involving our uniformed friends in orpo i thought sipo and the gestapo were in the kripo driving seat at the higher levels of command that is the case illmann confirmed but at the middle and lower levels the old administrative chains of command still operate at the municipal level local police presidents who are part of orpo are also responsible for kripo but the word is that orpos head is giving undercover encouragement to any police president who is prepared to frustrate the thumbscrew boys in sipo in berlin that suits our own police president he and the reichskriminaldirektor arthur nebe hate each others guts ludicrous isnt it and now if you dont mind i really must be going what a way to run a fucking bullring i said believe me bernie youre well out of it he grinned happily and it can get a lot worse yet illmanns information cost me a hundred marks ive never found that information comes cheap but lately the cost of private investigation does seem to be going up its not difficult to see why everyone is making some sort of a twist these days corruption in one form or another is the most distinctive feature of life under national socialism the government has made several revelations about the corruption of the various weimar political parties but these were as nothing compared to the corruption that exists now it flourishes at the top and everyone knows it so most people figure that they are due a share themselves i dont know of anyone who is as fastidious about such things as they used to be and that includes me the plain truth of it is that peoples sensitivity to corruption whether its blackmarket food or obtaining favours from a government official is about as blunt as a joiners pencil stub that evening it seemed as though almost all of berlin was on its way to neukölln to witness goebbels conduct the orchestra of soft persuasive violins and brittle sarcastic trumpets that was his voice but for those unlucky enough not to have sight of the popular enlightener there were a number of facilities provided throughout berlin to ensure that they could at least have the sound as well as the radios required by law in restaurants and cafés on most streets there were loudspeakers mounted on advertising pillars and lampposts and a force of radio wardens was empowered to knock on doors and enforce the mandatory civic duty to listen to a party broadcast driving west on leipzigerstrasse i met the torchlight parade of brownshirt legions as it marched south down wilhelmstrasse and i was obliged to get out of my car and salute the passing standard not to have done so would have been to risk a beating i guess there were others like me in that crowd our right arms extended like so many traffic policemen doing it just to avoid trouble and feeling a bit ridiculous who knows but come to think of it political parties were always big on salutes in germany the social democrats had their clenched fist raised high above the head the bolshies in the k p d had their clenched fist raised at shoulder level the centrists had their twofingered pistolshaped hand signal with the thumb cocked and the nazis had fingernail inspection i can remember when we used to think it was all rather ridiculous and melodramatic and maybe thats why none of us took it seriously and here we all were now saluting with the best of them crazy badenschestrasse running off berliner strasse is just a block short of trautenau strasse where i have my own apartment proximity is their only common factor badenschestrasse number is one of the most modern apartment blocks in the city and about as exclusive as a reunion dinner for the ptolemies i parked my small and dirty car between a huge deusenberg and a gleaming bugatti and went into a lobby that looked like it had left a couple of cathedrals short of marble a fat doorman and a stormtrooper saw me and deserting their desk and their radio which was playing wagner prior to the party broadcast they formed a human barrier to my progress anxious that i might want to insult some of the residents with my crumpled suit and selfinflicted manicure like it says on the sign outside growled fatso this is a private building i wasnt impressed with their combined effort to get tough with me im used to being made to feel unwelcome and i dont bounce easily i didnt see any sign i said truthfully we dont want any trouble mister said the stormtrooper he had a delicatelooking jaw that would have snapped like a dead twig with only the briefest of introductions to my fist im not selling any i told him fatso took over well whatever it is youre selling they dont want any here i smiled thinly at him listen fatso the only thing thats stopping me from pushing you out of my way is your bad breath itll be tricky for you i know but see if you can work the telephone and ring up fräulein rudel youll find shes expecting me fatso pulled the huge brownandblack moustache that clung to his curling lip like a bat on a crypt wall his breath was a lot worse than i could have imagined for your sake swanktail youd better be right he said itd be a pleasure to throw you out swearing under his breath he wobbled back to his desk and dialled furiously is fräulein rudel expecting someone he said moderating his tone only she never told me his face fell as my story checked out he put the phone down and swung his head at the lift door third floor he hissed there were only two doors at opposite ends of the third there was a velodrome of parquetfloor between them and as if i was expected one of the doors was ajar the maid ushered me into the drawing room youd better take a seat she said grumpily shes still dressing and theres no telling how long shell be fix yourself a drink if you want then she disappeared and i examined my surroundings the apartment was no larger than a private airfield and looked about as cheap a set as something out of cecil b de mille of whom there was a photograph jostling for pride of place with all the others on the grand piano compared with the person who had decorated and furnished the place the archduke ferdinand had been blessed with the taste of a troupe of turkish circus dwarves i looked at some of the other photographs mostly they were stills of lise rudel taken from her various films in a lot of them she wasnt wearing very much swimming nude or peering coyly from behind a tree which hid the more interesting parts rudel was famous for her scantily clad roles in another photograph she was sitting at a table in a smart restaurant with the good dr goebbels and in another she was sparring with max schmelling then there was one in which she was being carried in a workmans arms only the workman just happened to be emil jannings the famous actor i recognized it as a still from the builders hut i like the book a lot better than i had liked the film at the hint of i turned around and found myself shaking the beautiful film star by the hand i see youve been looking at my little gallery she said rearranging the photographs i had picked up and examined you must think it terribly vain of me to have so many pictures of myself on display but i simply cant abide albums not at all i said its very interesting she flashed me the smile that made thousands of german men myself included go weak at the chin im so glad you approve she was wearing a pair of greenvelvet lounging pyjamas with a long gold fringed sash and highheeled green morocco slippers her blonde hair was done up in a braided knot at the back of her head as was fashionable but unlike most german women she was also wearing makeup and smoking a cigarette that sort of thing is frowned on by the bdm the womens league as being inconsistent with the nazi ideal of german womanhood however im a city boy plain scrubbed rosy faces may be just fine down on the farm but like nearly all german men i prefer my women powdered and painted of course lise rudel lived in a different world to other women she probably thought the nazi womens league was a hockey association im sorry about those two fellows on the door she said but you see josef and magda goebbels have an apartment upstairs so security has to be extra tight as you can imagine which reminds me i promised josef that id try and listen to his speech or at least a bit of it do you mind it was not the sort of question that you ever asked unless you happened to be on firstname terms with the minister of propaganda and popular enlightenment and his lady wife i shrugged thats fine by me well only listen for a few minutes she said switching on the philco that stood on top of a walnut drinks cabinet now then what can i get you to drink i asked for a whisky and she poured me one that was big enough for a set of false teeth she poured herself a glass of bowie berlins favourite summer drink from a tall blueglass pitcher and joined me on a sofa that was the colour and contours of an underripe pineapple we clinked glasses and as the tubes of the radio set warmed up the smooth tones of the man from upstairs slipped slowly into the room first of all goebbels singled out foreign journalists for criticism and rebuked their biased reporting of life in the new germany some of his remarks were clever enough to draw laughter and then applause from his sycophantic audience rudel smiled uncertainly but remained silent and i wondered if she understood what her clubfooted neighbour from upstairs was talking about then he raised his voice and proceeded to declaim against the traitors whoever they were i didnt know who were trying to sabotage the national revolution here she stifled a yawn finally when joey got going on his favourite subject the glorification of the führer she jumped up and switched the radio off goodness me i think weve heard enough from him for one evening she went over to the gramophone and picked up a disc do you like jazz she said changing the subject oh its all right its not negro jazz i love it dont you only nonnegro jazz is permitted in germany now but i often wonder how they can tell the difference i like any kind of jazz i said she wound up the gramophone and put the needle into the groove it was a nice relaxed sort of piece with a strong clarinet and a saxophonist who could have led a company of italians across no mans land in a barrage i said do you mind me asking why you keep this place she danced back to the sofa and sat down well herr private investigator hermann finds my friends a little trying he does a lot of work from our house in dahlem and at all hours i do most of my entertaining here so as not to disturb him sounds sensible enough i said she blew a column of smoke at me from each exquisite nostril and i took a deep breath of it not because i enjoyed the smell of american cigarettes which i do but because it had come from inside her chest and anything to do with that chest was all right by me from the movement underneath her jacket i had already concluded that her breasts were large and unsupported so i said what was it that you wanted to see me about to my surprise she touched me lightly on the knee relax she smiled youre not in a hurry are you i shook my head and watched her stub out her cigarette there were already several butts in the ashtray all heavily marked with lipstick but none of them had been smoked for more than a few puffs and it occurred to me that she was the one who needed to relax and that maybe she was nervous about something me perhaps as if confirming my theory she jumped up off the sofa poured herself another glass of bowie and changed the record are you all right with your drink yes i said and sipped some it was good whisky smooth and peaty with no backburner in it then i asked her how well she had known paul and grete pfarr i dont think the question surprised her instead she sat close to me so that we were actually touching and smiled in a strange way oh yes she said whimsically i forgot youre the man whos investigating the fire for hermann arent you she didsome more grinning and added i suppose the case has the police baffled there was a note of sarcasm in her voice and then you come along the great detective and find the clue that solves the whole mystery theres no mystery fräulein rudel i said provocatively it threw her only slightly why surely the mystery is who did it she said a mystery is something that is beyond human knowledge and comprehension which means that i should be wasting my time in even trying to investigate it no this case is nothing more than a puzzle and i happen to like puzzles oh so do i she said almost mocking me i thought and please you must call me lise while youre here and i shall call you by your christian name what is it bernhard bernhard she said trying it for size and then shortening it bernie she gulped a large mouthful of the champagne and sauterne mixture she was drinking picked out a strawberry from the top of her glass and ate it well bernie you must be a very good private investigator to be working for hermann on something as important as this i thought you were all seedy little men who followed husbands and looked through keyholes at what they got up to and then told their wives divorce cases are just about the one kind of business that i dont handle is that a fact she said smiling quietly to herself it irritated me quite a bit that smile in part because i felt she was patronizing me but also because i wanted desperately to stop it with a kiss failing that the back of my hand tell me something do you make much money doing what you do tapping me on the thigh to indicate that she hadnt finished her question she added i dont mean to sound rude but what i want to know is are you comfortable i took note of my opulent surroundings before answering me comfortable like a bauhaus chair i am she laughed at that you didnt answer my question about the pfarrs i said didnt i you know damn well you didnt she shrugged i knew them well enough to know what paul had against your husband is that really what youre interested in she said itll do for a start she gave an impatient little sigh very well well play your game but only until i get bored of it she raised her eyebrows questioningly at me and although i had no idea what she was talking about i shrugged and said thats fine by me its true they didnt get on but i havent the haziest why when paul and grete first met hermann was against their getting married he thought paul wanted a nice platinum tooth you know a rich wife he tried to persuade grete to drop him but grete wouldnt hear of it after that by all accounts they got on fine at least until hermanns first wife died by then id been seeing him for some time it was when we got married that things really started to cool off between the two of them grete started drinking and their marriage seemed little more than a figleaf for decencys sake paul being at the ministry and all that what did he do there do you know no idea did he nudge around with other women she laughed paul was goodlooking but a bit lame he was dedicated to his work not another woman if he did he kept it very quiet what about her rudel shook her golden head and took a large gulp of her drink not her style but she paused for a moment and looked more thoughtful although she shrugged it probably isnt anything come on i said unpack it well there was one time in dahlem when i was left with just the tiniest suspicion that grete might have had something going with haupthändler i raised an eyebrow hermanns private secretary this would have been about the time when the italians had entered addis ababa i remember that only because i went to a party at the italian embassy that would have been early in may yes anyway hermann was away on business so i went by myself i was filming at u f a the next morning and had to be up early i decided to spend the night at dahlem so i would have a bit more time in the morning its a lot easier getting to babelsberg from there anyway when i got home i poked my head around the drawingroom door in search of a book i had left there and who should i find sitting in the dark but hjalmar haupthändler and grete what were they doing nothing nothing at all thats what made it so damned suspicious it was two oclock in the morning and there they were sitting at opposite ends of the same sofa like a couple of school children on their first date i could tell they were embarrassed to see me they gave me some cabbage about just chatting and was that really the time but i didnt buy it did you mention it to your husband no she said actually i forgot about it and even if i hadnt i wouldnt have told him hermann is not the sort of person who could have just left it alone to sort itself out most rich men are like that i think distrustful and suspicious id say he must trust you a great deal to let you keep your own apartment she laughed scornfully god what a joke if you knew what i have to put up with but then you probably know all about us you being a private investigator she didnt let me answer ive had to sack several of my maids because they were being bribed by him to spy on me hes really a very jealous man under similar circumstances id probably act the same way i told her most men would be jealous of a woman like you she looked me in the eye and then at the rest of me it was the sort of provocative look that only whores and phenomenally rich and beautiful film stars can get away with it was meant to get me to climb aboard her bones like a creeper on to a trellis a look that made me want to gore a hole in the rug frankly you probably like to make a man jealous you strike me as the kind of woman who holds out her hand to signal a left and then makes a right just to keep him guessing are you ready to tell me why you asked me here tonight ive sent the maid home she said so stop thrashing words and kiss me you big idiot normally im not too good at taking orders but on this occasion i didnt quarrel its not every day that a film star tells you to kiss her she gave me the soft luscious inside of her lips and i let myself equal their competence just to be polite after a minute i felt her body stir and when she pulled her mouth away from my lampreylike kiss her voice was hot and breathless my that was a real slowburner i practise on my forearm she smiled and raised her mouth up to mine kissing me like she intended to lose control of herself and so that i would stop holding something back from her she was breathing through her nose as if she needed more oxygen gradually getting serious about it and me keeping pace with her until she said i want you to fuck me bernie i heard each word in my fly we stood up in silence and taking me by the hand she led me to the bedroom ive got to go to the bathroom first i said she was pulling the pyjamajacket over her head her breasts wobbling these were real film stars chicks and for a moment i couldnt take my eyes off them each brown nipple was like a british tommys helmet dont be too long bernie she said dropping first her sash and then the trousers so that she stood there in just her knickers but in the bathroom i took a long honest look in the mirror which was one whole wall and asked myself why a living goddess like the one turning down the white satin sheets needed me of all people to help justify an expensive laundry account it wasnt my choirboys face or my sunny disposition with my broken nose and my carbumper of a jaw i was handsome only by the standards of a fairground boxingbooth i didnt imagine for a minute that my blond hair and blue eyes made me fashionable she wanted something else besides a brush and i had a shrewd idea what it was the trouble was i had an erection that temporarily at least was very firmly in command back in the bedroom she was still standing there waiting for me to come and help myself impatient of her i snatched her knickers down pulling her onto the bed where i prised her sleek tanned thighs apart like an excited scholar opening a priceless book for quite a while i pored over the text turning the pages with my fingers and feasting my eyes on what i had never dreamed of possessing we kept the light on so that finally i had a perfect view of myself as i plugged into the crisp fluff between her legs and afterwards she lay on top of me breathing like a sleepy but contented dog stroking my chest almost as if she was in awe of me my but youre a wellbuilt man mother was a blacksmith i said she used to hammer a nail into a horses shoe with the flat of her hand i get my build from her she giggled you dont say much but when you do you like to joke dont you there are an awful lot of dead people in germany looking very serious and so very cynical why is that i used to be a priest she fingered the small scar on my forehead where a piece of shrapnel had creased me how did you get this after church on sundays id box with the choirboys in the sacristy you like boxing i remembered the photograph of schmelling on the piano i adore boxing she said i love violent physical men i love going to the busch circus and watching them train before a big fight just to see if they defend or attack how they jab if theyve got guts just like one of those noblewomen in ancient rome i said checking up on her gladiators to see if theyre going to win before she puts a bet on but of course i like winners now you yes id say you could take a good punch maybe take quite a few you strike me as the durable patient sort methodical prepared to soak up more than a little punishment that makes you dangerous and you she bounced excitedly on my chest her breasts wobbling engagingly although for the moment at least i had no more appetite for her body oh yes yes she cried excitedly what sort of fighter am i i looked at her from the corner of one eye i think you would dance around a man and let him expend quite a bit of energy before coming back at him with one good punch to win on a knockout a win on points would be no sort of contest for you you always like to put them down on the canvas theres just one thing that puzzles me about this bout whats that what makes you think id take a dive she sat up in bed i dont understand sure you do now that id had her it was easy enough to say you think your husband hired me to spy on you isnt that right you dont believe im investigating the fire at all thats why youve been planning this little tryst all evening and now i imagine im supposed to play the poodle so that when you ask me to lay off ill do just what you say otherwise i might not get any more treats well youve been wasting your time like i said i dont do divorce work she sighed and covered her breasts with her arms you certainly can pick your moments herr sniffer dog she said its true isnt it she sprang out of bed and i knew that i was watching the whole of her body as naked as a pin without a hat for the last time from here on in i would have to go to the cinema to catch those tantalizing glimpses of it like all the other fellows she went over to the cupboard and snatched a gown from a hanger from the pocket she produced a packet of cigarettes she lit one and smoked it angrily with one arm folded across her chest i could have offered you money she said but instead i gave you myself she took another nervous puff hardly inhaling it at all how much do you want exasperated i slapped my naked thigh and said shit youre not listening spoonears i told you i wasnt hired to go peeking through your keyhole and find out the name of your lover she shrugged with disbelief how did you know i had a lover she said i got out of bed and started to dress i didnt need a magnifying glass and a pair of tweezers to pick that one up it stands to reason that if you didnt already have a lover then you wouldnt be so damned nervous of me she gave me a smile that was as thin and dubious as the rubber on a secondhand condom no i bet youre the sort who could find lice on a bald head anyway who said i was nervous of you i just dont happen to care for the interruption of my privacy look i think you had better push off she turned her back to me as she spoke im on my way i buttoned up my braces and slipped my jacket on at the bedroom door i made one last try to get through to her for the last time i wasnt hired to check up on you youve made a fool of me i shook my head theres not enough sense in anything youve said to fill a hollow tooth with all your milkmaids calculations you didnt need my help to make a fool of yourself thanks for a memorable evening as i left her room she started to curse me with the sort of eloquence you expect only from a man who has just hammered his thumb i drove home feeling like a ventriloquists mouth ulcer i was sore at the way things had turned out its not every day that one of germanys great film stars takes you to bed and then throws you out on your ear id like to have had more time to grow familiar with her famous body i was a man who had won the big prize at the fair only to be told there had been a mistake all the same i said to myself i ought to have expected something like that nothing resembles a street snapper so much as a rich woman once inside my apartment i poured myself a drink and then boiled some water for a bath after that i put on the dressinggown id bought in wertheims and started to feel good again the place was stuffy so i opened a few windows then i tried reading for a while i must have fallen asleep because a couple of hours had passed by the time i heard the knock at the door who is it i said going into the hall open up police said a voice what do you want to ask you some questions about lise rudel he said she was found dead at her apartment an hour ago murdered i snatched the door open and found the barrel of a parabellum poking me in the stomach back inside said the man with the pistol i retreated raising my hands instinctively he wore a bavariancut sports coat of lightblue linen and a canaryyellow tie there was a scar on his pale young face but it was neat and cleanlooking and probably selfinflicted with a razor in the hope that it might be mistaken for a students duelling scar accompanied by a strong smell of beer he advanced into my hallway closing the door behind him anything you say sonny i said relieved to see that he looked less than comfortable with the parabellum you had me fooled there with that story about fräulein rudel i shouldnt have fallen for it you bastard he snarled mind if i put my hands down only my circulation isnt what it used to be i dropped my hands to my sides whats this all about dont deny it deny what that you raped her he adjusted his grip on the gun and swallowed nervously his adams apple tossing around like a honeymoon couple under a thin pink sheet she told me what you did to her so you neednt try and deny it i shrugged what would be the point in your shoes i know who i would believe but listen are you sure you know what youre doing your breath was waving a red flag when you tiptoed in here the nazis may seem a bit liberal in some things but they havent done away with capital punishment you know even if youre hardly old enough to be expected to hold your drink im going to kill you he said licking his dry lips well thats all right but do you mind not shooting me in the belly i pointed at his pistol its by no means certain that youd kill me and id hate to spend the rest of my life drinking milk no if i were you id go for a head shot between the eyes if you can manage it a difficult shot but it would kill me for sure frankly the way i feel right now youd be doing me a favour it must be something ive eaten but my insides feel like the wave machine at luna park i farted a great meaty trombone of a fart in confirmation oh jesus i said waving my hand in front of my face see what i mean shut up you animal said the young man but i saw him raise the barrel and level it at my head i remembered the parabellum from my army days when it had been the standard service pistol the pistol relies on the recoil to fire the striker but with the first shot the firing mechanism is always comparatively stiff my head made a smaller target than my stomach and i hoped that id have enough time to duck i threw myself at his waist and as i did so i saw the flash and felt the air of the mm bullet as it zipped over my head and smashed something behind me my weight carried us both crashing into the front door but if i had expected him to be less than capable of putting up a stiff resistance i was mistaken i took hold of the wrist with the gun and found the arm twisting towards me with a lot more strength than i had credited it with i felt him grab the collar of my dressinggown and twist it then i heard it rip shit i said that does it i pushed the gun towards him and succeeded in pressing the barrel against his sternum putting my whole weight onto it i hoped to break a rib but instead there was a muffled fleshy report as it fired again and i found myself covered in his steaming blood i held his limp body for several seconds before i let it roll away from me i stood up and took a look at him there was no doubt that he was dead although blood continued to bubble up from the hole in his chest then i went through his pockets you always want to know whos been trying to kill you there was a wallet containing an id card in the name of walther kolb and marks it didnt make sense to leave the money for the boys from kripo so i took to cover the cost of my dressinggown also there were two photographs one of these was an obscene postcard in which a man was doing things to a girls bottom with a length of rubber tube and the other was a publicity still of lise rudel signed with much love i burned the photograph of my former bedmate poured myself a stiff one and marvelling at the picture of the erotic enema i called the police a couple of bulls came down from the alex the senior officer oberinspektor tesmer was a gestapo man the other inspektor stahlecker was a friend one of my few remaining friends in kripo but with tesmer around there wasnt a chance of an easy ride thats my story i said having told it for the third time we were all seated round my dining table on which lay the parabellum and the contents of the dead mans pockets tesmer shook his head slowly as if i had offered to sell him something he wouldnt have a chance of shifting himself you could always part exchange it for something else come on try again maybe this time youll make me laugh with its thin almost nonexistent lips tesmers mouth was like a slash in a length of cheap curtain and all you saw through the hole were the points of his rodents teeth and the occasional glimpse of the ragged greywhite oyster that was his tongue look tesmer i said i know it looks a bit beat up but take my word for it its really very reliable not everything that shines is any good try shifting some of the fucking dust off it then what do you know about the canned meat i shrugged only what was in his pockets and that he and i werent going to get along that wins him quite a few extra points on my card said tesmer er sat uncomfortably beside his boss and tugged nervously at his eyepatch he had lost an eye when he was with the prussian infantry and at the same time had won the coveted pour le mérite for his bravery me id have hung onto the eye although the patch did look rather dashing combined with his dark colouring and bushy black moustache it served to give him a piratical air although his manner was altogether more stolid slow even but he was a good bull and a loyal friend all the same he wasnt about to risk burning his fingers while tesmer was doing his best to see if id catch fire his honesty had previously led him to express one or two illadvised opinions about the nsdap during the elections since then hed had the sense to keep his mouth shut but he and i both knew that the kripo executive was just looking for an excuse to hang him out to dry it was only his outstanding war record that had kept him in the force this long and i suppose he tried to kill you because he didnt like your cologne said tesmer you noticed it too huh i saw stahlecker smile a bit at that but so did tesmer and he didnt like it gunther youve got more lip than a nigger with a trumpet your friend here may think youre funny but i just think youre a cunt so dont fuck me around im not the sort with a sense of humour ive told you the truth tesmer i opened the door and there was herr kolb with the lighter pointing at my dinner a parabellum on you and yet you still managed to take him i dont see any fucking holes in you gunther im taking a correspondence course in hypnotism like i said i was lucky he missed you saw the broken light listen i dont mesmerize easy this fellow was a professional not the sort to let you have his lighter for a bag of sherbet a professional what haberdasher dont talk out of your navel tesmer he was just a kid well that makes it worse for you because he isnt going to do any more growing up young he may have been i said but he was no weakling i didnt bite my lip because i find you so damned attractive this is real blood you know and my dressinggown its torn or hadnt you noticed tesmer laughed scornfully i thought you were just a sloppy dresser hey this is a fiftymark gown you dont think id tear it just for your benefit do you you could afford to buy it then you could also afford to lose it i always thought your kind made too much money i leaned back in my chair i remembered tesmer as one of police major walther weckes hatchetmen charged with rooting out conservatives and bolsheviks from the force a mean bastard if ever there was one i wondered how stahlecker managed to survive what is it you earn gunther three four hundred marks a week probably make as much as me and stahlecker put together eh stahlecker my friend shrugged noncommittally i dunno see said tesmer even stahlecker doesnt have any idea how many thousands a year you make youre in the wrong job tesmer the way you exaggerate you should work for the ministry of propaganda he said nothing all right all right i get it how much is it going to cost me tesmer shrugged trying to control the grin that threatened to break out on his face from a man with a fiftymark gown lets say a round hundred a hundred for that cheap little garterhandler go and take another look at him tesmer he doesnt have a charlie chaplin moustache and a stiff right arm tesmer stood up you talk too much gunther lets hope your mouth begins to fray at the edges before it gets you into serious trouble he looked at stahlecker and then back at me im going for a piss your old pitman here has got until i come back into the room to persuade you otherwise he pursed his lips and shook his head as he walked out i called after him make sure you lift the seat i grinned at stahlecker how are you doing bruno what is it bernie have you been drinking you blue or something come on you know how difficult tesmer could make things for you first you plum the man with all that smart talk and now you want to play the black horse pay the bastard look if i dont black horse him a little and drag my heels about paying him that kind of mouse then hell figure im worth a lot more bruno as soon as i saw that son of a bitch i knew that the evening was going to cost me something before i left kripo he and wecke had me marked i havent forgotten and neither has he i still owe him some agony well you certainly made it expensive for yourself when you mentioned the price of that gown not really i said it cost nearer a hundred christ breathed stahlecker tesmer is right you are making too much money he thrust his hands deep into his pockets and looked squarely at me want to tell me what really happened here another time bruno it was mostly true excepting one or two small details right listen i need a favour can we meet tomorrow the matinee at the kammerlichtespiele in the haus vaterland back row at four oclock bruno sighed and then nodded ill try before then see if you cant find out something about the paul pfarr case he frowned and was about to speak when tesmer returned from the lavatory i hope you wiped the floor tesmer pointed a face at me in which belligerence was moulded like cornicework on a gothic folly the set of his jaw and the spread of his nose gave him about as much profile as a piece of lead piping the general effect was earlypaleolithic i hope you decided to get wise he growled there would have been more chance of reasoning with a water buffalo seems like i dont have much choice i said i dont suppose theres any chance of a receipt just off clayallee on the edge of dahlem was the huge wroughtiron gate to sixs estate i sat in the car for a while and watched the road several times i closed my eyes and found my head nodding it had been a late night after a short nap i got out and opened the gate then i ambled back to the car and turned onto the private road down a long gentle slope and into the cool shade cast by the dark pine trees lining its gravelled length in daylight sixs house was even more impressive although i could see now that it was not one but two houses standing close together beautiful solidly built wilhelmine farmhouses i pulled up at the front door where lise rudel had parked her bmw the night i had first seen her and got out leaving the door open just in case the two dobermanns put in an appearance dogs are not at all keen on private investigators and its an antipathy that is entirely mutual i knocked on the door i heard it echo in the hall and seeing the closed shutters i wondered if id had a wasted journey i lit a cigarette and stood there just leaning on the door smoking and listening the place was about as quiet as the sap in a giftwrapped rubber tree then i heard some footsteps and i straightened up as the door opened to reveal the levantine head and round shoulders of the butler farraj good morning i said brightly i was hoping that id find herr haupthändler in farraj looked at me with the clinical distaste of a chiropodist regarding a septic toenail do you have an appointment he asked not really i said handing him my card i was hoping he might give me five minutes though i was here the other night to see herr six farraj nodded silently and returned my card my apologies for not recognizing you sir still holding the door he retreated into the hall inviting me to enter having closed it behind him he looked at my hat with something short of amusement no doubt you will wish to keep your hat again sir i think i had better dont you standing closer to him i could detect the very definite smell of alcohol and not the sort they serve in exclusive gentlemens clubs very good sir if youll just wait here for a moment ill find herr haupthändler and ask him if he can see you thanks i said do you have an ashtray i held my cigarette ash aloft like a hypodermic syringe yes sir he produced one made of dark onyx that was the size of a church bible and which he held in both hands while i did the stubbing out when my cigarette was extinguished he turned away and still carrying the ashtray he disappeared down the corridor leaving me to wonder what i was going to say to haupthändler if he would see me there was nothing in particular i had in mind and not for one minute did i imagine that he would be prepared to discuss lise rudels story about him and grete pfarr i was just poking around you ask ten people ten dumb questions and sometimes you hit a raw nerve somewhere sometimes if you werent too bored to notice you managed to recognize that you were on to something it was a bit like panning for gold every day you went down to the river and went through pan after pan of mud and just occasionally provided you kept your eyes peeled you found a dirty little stone that was actually a nugget i went to the bottom of the stairs and looked up the stairwell a large circular skylight illuminated the paintings on the scarletcoloured walls i was looking at a still life of a lobster and a pewter pot when i heard footsteps on the marble floor behind me its by karl schuch you know said haupthändler worth a great deal of money he paused and added but very very dull please come this way he led the way into sixs library im afraid i cant give you very long you see i still have a great many things to do for the funeral tomorrow im sure you understand i sat down on one of the sofas and lit a cigarette haupthändler folded his arms the leather of his nutmegbrown sports jacket creaking across his sizeable shoulders and leaned against his masters desk now what was it that you wished to see me about actually its about the funeral i said improvising on what he had given me i wondered where it was to be held i must apologize herr gunther he said im afraid it hadnt occurred to me that herr six would wish you to attend hes left all the arrangements to me while hes in the ruhr but he didnt think to leave any instructions regarding a list of mourners i tried to look awkward oh well i said standing up naturally with a client such as herr six i should like to have been able to pay my respects to his daughter it is customary but im sure he will understand herr gunther said haupthändler after a short silence would you think it terrible of me if i were to give you an invitation now by hand not at all i said if you are sure it wont inconvenience your arrangements its no trouble he said i have some cards here he walked around the desk and pulled open a drawer have you worked for herr six long about two years he said absently prior to that i was a diplomat with the german consular service he took out a pair of glasses from his breast pocket and placed them on the end of his nose before writing out the invitation and did you know grete pfarr well he glanced up at me briefly i really didnt know her at all he said other than to say hallo to do you know if she had any enemies jealous lovers that sort of thing he finished writing the card and pressed it on the blotter im quite sure she didnt he said crisply removing his glasses and returning them to his pocket is that so what about him paul i can tell you even less about him im afraid he said slipping the invitation into an envelope did he and herr six get on all right they werent enemies if thats what youre implying their differences were purely political well that amounts to something quite fundamental these days wouldnt you say not in this case no now if youll excuse me herr gunther i really must be getting on yes of course he handed me the invitation well thanks for this i said following him out into the hall do you live here too herr haupthändler no i have an apartment in town really where he hesitated for a moment kurfurstenstrasse he said eventually why do you ask i shrugged i ask too many questions herr haupthändler i said forgive me its habit im afraid a suspicious nature goes with the job please dont be offended well i must be going he smiled thinly and as he showed me to the door he seemed relaxed but i hoped i had said enough to put a few ripples on his pond the hanomag seems to take an age to reach any sort of speed so it was with a certain amount of misplaced optimism that i took the avus speedway back to the centre of town it costs a mark to get on this highway but the avus is worth it ten kilometres without a curve all the way from potsdam to kurfürstendamm its the one road in the city on which the driver who fancies himself as carraciola the great racing driver can put his foot down and hit speeds of up to kilometres an hour at least they could in the days before b v aral the lowoctane substitute petrol thats not much better than meths now it was all i could do to get ninety out of the hanomags litre engine i parked at the intersection of kurfürstendamm and joachimsthaler strasse known as grunfeld corner because of the department store of the same name which occupies it when grunfeld a jew still owned his store they used to serve free lemonade at the fountain in the basement but since the state dispossessed him as it has with all the jews who owned big stores like wertheim hermann teitz and israel the days of free lemonade have gone if that werent bad enough the lemonade you now have to pay for and once got free doesnt taste half as good and you dont have to have the sharpest tastebuds in the world to realize that theyre cutting down on the sugar just like theyre cheating on everything else i sat drinking my lemonade and watching the lift go up and down the tubular glass shaft that allowed you to see out into the store as you rode from floor to floor in two minds whether or not to go up to the stocking counter and see carola the girl from dagmarrs wedding it was the sour taste of the lemonade that put me in mind of my own debauched behaviour and that decided me against it instead i left grunfelds and walked the short distance down kurfürstendamm and onto schluterstrasse a jewellers is one of the few places in berlin where you can expect to find people queueing to sell rather than to buy peter neumaiers antique jewellers was no exception when i got there the line wasnt quite outside the door but it was certainly rubbing the glass and it was older and sadder looking than most of the queues that i was used to standing in the people waiting there were from a mixture of backgrounds but mostly they had two things in common their judaism and as an inevitable corollary their lack of work which was how they came to be selling their valuables in the first place at the top of the queue behind a long glass counter were two stonefaced shop assistants in good suits they had a neat line in appraisal which was to tell the prospective seller how poor the piece actually was and how little it was likely to fetch on the open market we see stuff like this all the time said one of them wrinkling his lips and shaking his head at the spread of pearls and brooches on the counter beneath him you see we cant put a price on sentimental value im sure you understand that he was a young fellow half the age of the deflating old mattress of a woman before him and goodlooking too although in need of a shave perhaps his colleague was less forthcoming with his indifference he sniffed so that his nose took on a sneer he shrugged a half shrug of his coathangersized shoulders and he grunted unenthusiastically silently he counted out five onehundredmark notes from a roll in his skinny misers hand that must have been worth thirty times as much the old man he was buying from was undecided about whether or not he should accept what must have been a derisory offer and with a trembling hand he pointed at the bracelet lying on the piece of cloth he had wrapped it up in but look here said the old man youve got one just like it in the window for three times what youre offering the coathanger pursed his lips fritz he said how long has that sapphire bracelet been in the window it was an efficient doubleact you had to say that much must be six months responded the other dont buy another one this isnt a charity you know he probably said that several times a day coathanger blinked with slow boredom see what i mean look go somewhere else if you think you can get more for it but the sight of the cash was too much for the old man and he capitulated i walked to the head of the line and said that i was looking for herr neumaier if youve got something to sell then youll have to wait in line with all the rest of them muttered coathanger i have nothing to sell i said vaguely adding im looking for a diamond necklace at that coathanger smiled at me like i was his longlost rich uncle if youll just wait one moment he said unctuously ill just see if herr neumaier is free he disappeared behind a curtain for a minute and when he returned i was ushered through to a small office at the end of the corridor peter neumaier sat at his desk smoking a cigar that belonged properly in a plumbers toolbag he was dark with bright blue eyes just like our beloved führer and was possessed of a stomach that stuck out like a cash register the cheeks of his face had a red skinned look as if he had eczema or had simply stood too close to his razor that morning he shook me by the hand as i introduced myself it was like holding a cucumber im pleased to meet you herr gunther he said warmly i hear youre looking for some diamonds thats correct but i should tell you that im acting on behalf of someone else i understand neumaier grinned did you have a particular setting in mind oh yes indeed a diamond necklace well you have come to the right place there are several diamond necklaces i can show you my client knows precisely what he requires i said it must be a diamond collet necklace made by cartier neumaier laid his cigar in the ashtray and breathed out a mixture of smoke nerves and amusement well he said that certainly narrows the field thats the thing about the rich herr neumaier i said they always seem to know exactly what they want dont you think oh indeed they do herr gunther he leaned forwards in his chair and collecting his cigar he said a necklace such as you describe is not the sort of piece that comes along every day and of course it would cost a great deal of money it was time to stick the nettle down his trousers naturally my client is prepared to pay a great deal of money twentyfive per cent of the insured value no questions asked he frowned im not sure i understand what youre talking about he said come off it neumaier we both know that theres a lot more to your operation than the heartwarming little scene youre putting on out front there he blew some smoke and looked at the end of his cigar are you suggesting that i buy stolen merchandise herr gunther because if you are keep your ears stiff neumaier i havent finished yet my clients flea is solid cash money i tossed the photograph of sixs diamonds at him if some mouse walks in here trying to sell it you give me a call the numbers on the back neumaier regarded it and me distastefully and then stood up you are a joke herr gunther with a few cups short in your cupboard now get out of here before i call the police you know thats not a bad idea i said im sure theyll be very impressed with your public spirit when you offer to open up your safe and invite them to inspect the contents thats the confidence of honesty i suppose get out of here i stood up and walked out of his office i hadnt intended to handle it that way but i hadnt liked what id seen of neumaiers operation in the shop coathanger was halfway through offering an old woman a price for her jewelbox that was less than she might have got for it at the salvation army hostel several of the jews waiting behind her looked at me with an expression that was a mixture of hope and hopelessness it made me feel about as comfortable as a trout on a marble slab and for no reason that i could think of i felt something like shame gert jeschonnek was a different proposition his premises were on the eighth floor of columbus haus a ninestoreyed building on potsdamer platz which has a strong emphasis on the horizontal line it looked like something a longterm prisoner might have made given an endless supply of matches and at the same time it put me in mind of the nearly eponymous building near tempelhof airport that is columbia haus the gestapo prison in berlin this country shows its admiration for the discoverer of america in the strangest ways the eighth floor was home to a whole countryclub of doctors lawyers and publishers who were only just getting by on a year the double entrance doors to jeschonneks office were made of polished mahogany on which appeared in gold lettering gert jeschonnek precious stone merchant beyond these was an lshaped office with walls that were a pleasant shade of pink on which were hung several framed photographs of diamonds rubies and various gaudy little baubles that might have stimulated the greed of a solomon or two i took a chair and waited for an anaemic young man sitting behind a typewriter to finish on the telephone after a minute he said ill call you back rudi he replaced the receiver and looked at me with an expression that was just a few centimetres short of surly yes he said call me oldfashioned but i have never liked male secretaries a mans vanity gets in the way of serving the needs of another male and this particular specimen wasnt about to win me over when youve finished filing your nails perhaps youd tell your boss that id like to see him the names gunther do you have an appointment he said archly since when does a man whos looking for some diamonds need to make an appointment tell me that would you i could see that he found me less amusing than a boxful of smoke save your breath to cool your soup he said and came round the desk to go through the only other door ill find out if he can see you while he was out of the room i picked up a recent issue of der stürmer from the magazine rack the front page had a drawing of a man in angels robes holding an angels mask in front of his face behind him was his devils tail sticking out from underneath his surplice and his angels shadow except that this now revealed the profile behind the mask to be unmistakably jewish those der stürmer cartoonists love to draw a big nose and this one was a real pelicans beak a strange thing to find in a respectable businessmans office i thought the anaemic young man emerging from the other office provided the simple explanation he wont keep you very long he said adding he buys that to impress the kikes im afraid i dont follow we get a lot of jewish custom in here he explained of course they only want to sell never to buy herr jeschonnek thinks that if they see that he subscribes to der stürmer it will help him to drive a harder bargain very shrewd of him i said does it work i guess so youd better ask him maybe i will at that there wasnt much to see in the bosss office across a couple of acres of carpet was a grey steel safe that had once been a small battleship and a panzersized desk with a dark leather top the desk had very little on it except a square of felt on which lay a ruby that was big enough to decorate a maharajahs favourite elephant and jeschonneks feet wearing immaculate white spats and these swung under the table as i came through the door gert jeschonnek was a burly hog of a man with small piggy eyes and a brown beard cropped close to his sunburned face he wore a lightgrey doublebreasted suit that was ten years too young for him and in the lapel was a scary badge he had march violet plastered all over him like insect repellent herr gunther he said brightly and for a moment he was almost standing at attention then he crossed the floor to greet me a purplish butchers hand pumped mine own which showed patches of white when i let it go he must have had blood like treacle he smiled a sweet smile and then looked across my shoulder to his anaemic secretary who was about to close the door on us jeschonnek said helmut a pot of your best strong coffee please two cups and no delays he spoke quickly and precisely beating time with his hand like a teacher of elocution he led me over to the desk and the ruby which i figured was there to impress me in the same way as the copies of der stürmer were there to impress his jewih custom i pretended to ignore it but jeschonnek was not to be denied his little performance he held the ruby up to the light in his fat fingers and grinned obscenely an extremely fine cabochon ruby he said like it red isnt my colour i said it doesnt go with my hair he laughed and replaced the ruby on the velvet which he folded up and returned to his safe i sat down on a big armchair in front of his desk im looking for a diamond necklace i said he sat down opposite me well herr gunther im the acknowledged expert on diamonds his head gave a proud little flourish like a racehorse and i caught a powerful whiff of cologne is that so i said i doubt if theres a man in berlin who knows as much about diamonds as i do he thrust his stubbly chin at me as if challenging me to contradict him i almost threw up im glad to hear it i said the coffee arrived and jeschonnek glanced uncomfortably after his secretary as he minced out of the room i cannot get used to having a male secretary he said of course i can see that the proper place for a woman is in the home bringing up a family but i have a great fondness for women herr gunther id take a partner before id take on a male secretary i said he smiled politely now then i believe youre in the market for a diamond diamonds i said correcting him i see on their own or in a setting actually im trying to trace a particular piece which has been stolen from my client i explained and handed him my card he stared at it impassively a necklace to be precise i have a photograph of it here i produced another photograph and handed it to him magnificent he said each one of the baguettes is one carat i told him quite he said but i dont see how i can help you herr gunther if the thief should try and offer it to you id be grateful if you would contact me naturally there is a substantial reward i have been authorized by my client to offer twentyfive per cent of the insured value for recovery no questions asked may one know the name of your client herr gunther i hesitated well i said ordinarily a clients identity is confidential but i can see that you are the kind of man who is used to respecting confidentiality youre much too kind he said the necklace is indian and belongs to a princess who is in berlin for the olympiad as the guest of the government jeschonnek began to frown as he listened to my lies i have not met the princess myself but i am told that she is the most beautiful creature that berlin has ever seen she is staying at the adlon hotel from where the necklace was stolen several nights ago stolen from an indian princess eh he said adding a smile to his features well i mean why was there nothing in the newspapers about this and why are the police not involved i drank some of my coffee to prolong a dramatic pause the management of the adlon is anxious to avoid a scandal i said its not so very long ago that the adlon suffered a series of unfortunate robberies committed there by the celebrated jewelthief faulhaber yes i remember reading about that it goes without question that the necklace is insured but where the reputation of the adlon is concerned that is hardly the point as i am sure you will understand well sir i shall certainly contact you immediately if i come across any information that may help you said jeschonnek producing a gold watch from his pocket he glanced at it deliberately and now if youll excuse me i really must be getting on he stood up and held out his pudgy hand thanks for your time i said ill see myself out perhaps youd be kind enough to ask that boy to step in here when you go out he said sure he gave me the hitler salute heil hitler i repeated dumbly in the outside office the anaemic boy was reading a magazine my eyes caught sight of the keys before id finished telling him that his boss required his presence they were lying on the desk next to the telephone he grunted and wrenched himself out of his seat i hesitated at the door oh do you have a piece of paper he pointed to the pad on which the keys were lying help yourself he said and went into jeschonneks office thanks i will the keyring was labelled office i took a cigarette case out of my pocket and opened it in the smooth surface of the modelling clay i made three impressions two sides and a vertical of both keys i suppose that you could say i did it on impulse i d hardly had time to digest everything that jeschonnek had said or rather what he hadnt said but then i always carry that piece of clay and it seems a shame not to use it when the opportunity presents itself you would be surprised how often a key that ive had made with that mould comes in useful outside i found a public telephone and called the adlon i still remembered lots of good times at the adlon and lots of friends too hello hermine i said its bernie hermine was one of the girls on the adlons switchboard you stranger she said we havent seen you in ages ive been a bit busy i said sos the führer but he still manages to get around and wave to us maybe i should buy myself an opentop mercedes and a couple of outriders i lit a cigarette i need a small favour hermine ask if a man telephones and asks you or benita if there is an indian princess staying at the hotel would you please say that there is if he wants to speak to her say shes not taking any calls thats all yes does this princess have a name you know the names of any indian girls well she said i saw a film the other week which had this indian girl in it her name was mushmi let it be princess mushmi then and thanks hermine ill be speaking to you soon i went into the pschorr haus restaurant and ate a plate of bacon and broad beans and drank a couple of beers either jeschonnek knew nothing about diamonds or he had something to hide id told him that the necklace was indian when he ought to have recognized it as being by carrier not only that but he had failed to contradict me when i described the stones incorrectly as baguettes baguettes are square or oblong with a straight edge but sixs necklace consisted of brilliants which are round and then there was the caratage id said that each stone was a carat in weight when they were obviously several times larger it wasnt much to go on and mistakes are made its impossible always to pick up a stick by the right end but all the same i had this feeling in my socks that i was going to have to visit jeschonnek again after leaving pschorr haus i went into the haus vaterland which as well as housing the cinema where i was to meet bruno stahlecker is also home to an almost infinite number of bars and cafés the place is popular with the tourists but its too oldfashioned to suit my taste the great ugly halls the silver paint the bars with their miniature rainstorms and moving trains it all belongs to a quaint old european world of mechanical toys and musichall leotarded strongmen and trained canaries the other thing that makes it unusual is that its the only bar in germany that charges for admission stahlecker was less than happy about it i had to pay twice he grumbled once at the front door and again to come in here you should have flashed your sipo pass i said youd have got in for nothing thats the whole point of having it isnt it stahlecker looked blankly at the screen very funny he said what is this shit anyway still the newsreel i told him so what did you find out theres the small matter of last night to be dealt with yet my word of honour bruno i never saw the kid before stahlecker sighed wearily apparently this kolb was a smalltime actor one or two bitparts in films in the chorusline in a couple of shows not exactly richard tauber now why would a fellow like that want to kill you unless maybe youve turned critic and gave him a few bad notices ive got no more understanding of theatre than a dog has of laying a fire but you do know why he tried to kill you right theres this lady i said her husband hired me to do a job for him she thought that id been hired to look through her keyhole so last night she has me round to her place asks me to lay off and accuses me of lying when i tell her that im not concerned who shes sleeping with then she throws me out next thing i know theres this pearhead standing in my doorway with a lighter poked in my gut accusing me of raping the lady we dance around the room a while and in the process the gun goes off my guess is that the kid was in a swarm about her and that she knew it and so she put him up to it right thats the way i see it but try and make it stick and see how far youd get i dont suppose youre going to tell me the name of this lady or her husband are you i shook my head no i thought not the film was starting called the higher order it was one of those patriotic little entertainments that the boys in the ministry of propaganda had dreamed up on a bad day stahlecker groaned come on he said lets go and get a drink i dont think i can stand watching this shit we went to the wild west bar on the first floor where a band of cowboys were playing home on the range painted prairies covered the walls complete with buffalo and indians leaning up against the bar we ordered a couple of beers i dont suppose any of this would have something to do with the pfarr case would it bernie ive been retained to investigate the fire i explained by the insurance company all right he said ill tell you this just the once and then you can tell me to go to hell drop it its a hot one if youll pardon the expression bruno i said go to hell im on a percentage just dont say i didnt warn you when they throw you into a k z i promise now unpack it bernie youve got more promises than a debtor has for the bailiff he sighed and shook his head well heres what there is this paul pfarr fellow was a highflyer passed his juridicial in saw preparatory service in the stuttgart and berlin provincial courts in this particular march violet joins the s a and by he is an assessor judge in the berlin police court trying cases of police corruption of all things the same year he is recruited into the s s and in he also joins the gestapo supervising associations economic unions and of course the d a f the reich labour service later that year he is transferred yet again this time to the ministry of the interior reporting directly to himmler with his own department investigating corruption amongst servants of the reich im surprised that they notice apparently himmler takes a very dim view of it anyway paul pfarr was charged with paying particular attention to the d a f where corruption is endemic so he was himmlers boy eh thats right and his exboss takes an even dimmer view of people working for him getting canned than he does of corruption so a couple of days ago the reichskriminaldirektor appoints a special squad to investigate its an impressive team gohrmann schild jost dietz you get mixed up in this bernie and you wont last longer than a synagogue window they got any leads the only thing i heard was that they were looking for a girl it seems as though pfarr might have had a mistress no name im afraid not only that but shes disappeared you want to know something i said disappearing is all the rage everyones doing it so i heard i hope you arent the fashionable sort then me i must be one of the only people in this city not to own a uniform id say that makes me very unfashionable back at alexanderplatz i visited a locksmith and gave him the mould to make a copy of jeschonneks office keys id used him many times before and he never asked any questions then i collected my laundry and went up to the office i wasnt halfway through the door before a sipo pass had flashed in front of my face in the same instant i caught sight of the walther inside the mans unbuttoned greyflannel jacket you must be the sniffer he said weve been waiting to speak to you he had mustardcoloured hair coiffed by a competition sheepshearer and a nose like a champagne cork his moustache was wider than the brim on a mexicans hat the other one was the racial archetype with the sort of exaggerated chin and cheekbones hed copied off a prussian election poster they both had cool patient eyes like mussels in brine and sneers like someone had farted or told a particularly tasteless joke if id known id have gone to see a couple of movies the one with the pass and the haircut stared blankly at me this here is kriminalinspektor dietz he said the one called dietz who i guessed to be the senior officer was sitting on the edge of my desk swinging his leg and looking generally unpleasant youll excuse me if i dont get out my autographbook i said and walked over to the corner by the window where frau protze was standing she sniffed and pulled out a handkerchief from the sleeve of her blouse and blew her nose through the material she said im sorry herr gunther they just barged in here and started ransacking the place i told them i didnt know where you were or when you would be back and they got quite nasty i never knew that policemen could behave so disgracefully theyre not policemen i said more like knuckles with suits youd better run along home now ill see you tomorrow she sniffed some more thank you herr gunther she said but i dont think ill be coming back i dont think my nerves are up to this sort of thing im sorry thats all right ill mail what i owe you she nodded and having stepped round me she almost ran out of the office the haircut snorted with laughter and kicked the door shut behind her i opened the window theres a bit of a smell in here i said what do you fellows do when youre not scaring widows and searching for the pettycash box dietz jerked himself off my desk and came over to the window i heard about you gunther he said looking out at the traffic you used to be a bull so i know that you know the official paper on just how far i can go and thats still a hell of a long way yet i can stand on your fucking face for the rest of the afternoon and i dont even have to tell you why so why dont you cut the shit and tell me what you know about paul pfarr and then well be on our way again i know he wasnt a careless smoker i said look if you hadnt gone through this place like an earthtremor i might have been able to find a letter from the germania life assurance company engaging me to investigate the fire pending any claim oh we found that letter said dietz we found this too he took my gun out of his jacket pocket and pointed it playfully at my head ive got a licence for it sure you have he said smiling then he sniffed the muzzle and spoke to his partner you know martins id say this pistol has been cleaned and recently too im a clean boy i said take a look at my fingernails if you dont believe me walther ppk mm said martins lighting a cigarette just like the gun that killed poor herr pfarr and his wife thats not what i heard i went over to the drinks cabinet i was surprised to see that they hadnt helped themselves to any of my whisky of course said dietz we were forgetting that youve still got friends over at the alex werent we i poured myself a drink a little too much to swallow in less than three gulps i thought they got rid of all those reactionaries said martins i surveyed the last mouthful of whisky id offer you boys a drink only i wouldnt want to have to throw away the glasses afterwards i tossed the drink back martins flicked away his cigarette and clenching his fists he stepped forward a couple of paces this bum specializes in lip like a yid does in nose he snarled dietz stayed where he was leaning on the window but when he turned around there was tabasco in his eyes im running out of patience with you mulemouth i dont get it i said youve seen the letter from the assurance people if you think its a fake then check it out we already did then why the double act dietz walked over and looked me up and down like i was shit on his shoe then he picked up my last bottle of good scotch weighed it in his hand and threw it against the wall above the desk it smashed with the sound of a canteen of cutlery dropping down a stairwell and the air was suddenly redolent with alcohol dietz straightened his jacket after the exertion we just wanted to impress you with the need to keep us informed of what youre doing gunther if you find out anything and i mean anything then you better speak to us because if i find out youve been giving us any figleaf then ill have you in a k z so quick your fucking ears will whistle he leaned towards me and i caught the smell of his sweat understand mulemouth dont stick your jaw too far out dietz i said or ill feel obliged to slap it he smiled id like that sometime really i would he turned to his partner come on he said lets get out of here before i kick him in the eggs id just finished clearing up the mess when the phone rang it was müller from the berliner morgenpost to say that he was sorry but beyond the sort of material that the obituaries people collected over the years there really wasnt much in the files about hermann six to interest me are you giving me the up and down eddie christ this fellow is a millionaire he owns half the ruhr if he stuck his finger up his arse hed find oil somebody must have got a look through his keyhole at some time there was a reporter a while back who did quite a bit of spadework on all of those big boys on the ruhr krupp voegler wolff thyssen she lost her job when the government solved the unemployment problem ill see if i can find out where shes living thanks eddie what about the pfarrs anything she was really into spas nauheim wiesbaden bad homburg you name it shed splashed some there she even wrote an article about it for die frau and she was keen on quack medicine theres nothing about him im afraid thanks for the gossip eddie next time ill read the society page and save you the trouble not worth a hundred huh not worth fifty find this lady reporter for me and then ill see what i can do after that i closed the office and returned to the key shop to collect my new set of keys and my tin of clay ill admit it sounds a bit theatrical but honestly ive carried that tin for several years and short of stealing the actual key itself i dont know of a better way of opening locked doors a delicate mechanism of fine steel with which you can open any kind of lock i dont have the truth is that with the best modern locks you can forget picking there are no slick fancy little wonder tools that stuff is for the filmboys at u f a more often than not a burglar simply saws off the bolthead or drills around it and removes a piece of the goddam door and that reminded me sooner or later i was going to have to check out just who there was in the fraternity of nutcrackers with the talent to have opened the pfarrs safe if that was how it was done which meant that there was a certain scrofulous little tenor who was long overdue for a singing lesson i didnt expect to find neumann at the dump where he lived in admiralstrasse in the kottbusser tor district but i tried there anyway kottbusser tor was the kind of area that had worn about as well as a musichall poster and admiralstrasse number was the kind of place where the rats wore earplugs and the cockroaches had nasty coughs neumanns room was in the basement at the back it was damp it was dirty it was foul and neumann wasnt there the concierge was a snapper who was over the hill and down a disused mineshaft her hair was every bit as natural as parade goosestepping down the wilhelmstrasse and shed evidently been wearing a boxingglove when shed applied the crimson lipstick to her paperclip of a mouth her breasts were like the rear ends of a pair of dray horses at the end of a long hard day maybe she still had a few clients but i thought it was a better bet that id see a jew at the front of a nuremberg porkbutchers queue she stood in the doorway to her apartment naked under the grubby towelling robe which she left open and lit a halfsmoked cigarette im looking for neumann i said doing my level best to ignore the two coatpegs and the russian boyars beard that were being displayed for my benefit you felt the twang and itch of syphilis in your tail just looking at her im a friend of his the snapper yawned cheesily and deciding that id seen enough for free she closed her robe and tied the cord you a bull she sniffed like i said im a friend she folded her arms and leaned on the doorway neumann doesnt have any friends she said looking at her dirty fingernails and then back at my face i had to give her that one except for me maybe and thats only because i feel sorry for the little twitcher if you were a friend of his youd tell him to see a doctor he isnt right in the head you know she took a long drag on her cigarette and then nicked the butt past my shoulder hes not tapped i said he just has a tendency to talk to himself a bit strange thats all if thats not tapped then i dont know what the hell is she said there was something in that too you know when hell be back the snapper shrugged a hand that was all blue veins and knuckleduster rings took hold of my tie she tried to smile coyly only it came out as a grimace maybe youd care to wait for him she said you know twenty marks buys an awful lot of time retrieving my tie i took out my wallet and thumbed her a five id like to really i would but i must be getting on my way perhaps youd tell neumann that i was looking for him the name is gunther bernhard gunther thank you bernhard youre a real gentleman do you have any idea where he might be bernhard your guess is as good as mine you could chase him from pontius to pilate and still not find him she shrugged and shook her head if hes broke hell be somewhere like the x bar or the rucker if hes got any mouse in his pocket hell be trying to nudge a bit of plum at the femina or the café casanova i started down the stairs and if hes not at any of those places then hell be at the racetrack she followed me out onto the landing and down some of the steps i got into my car with a sigh of relief its always difficult getting away from a snapper they never like to see trade walking out of the door i dont have much faith in experts or for that matter in the statements of witnesses over the years ive come to belong to the school of detection that favours good oldfashioned circumstantial evidence of the kind that says a fellow did it because he was the type whod do that sort of thing anyway that and information received keeping a tenor like neumann is something that requires trust and patience and just as the first of these does not come naturally to neumann so the second does not come naturally to me but only where he is concerned neumann is the best informer ive ever had and his tips are usually accurate there were no lengths to which i would not go to protect him on the other hand it does not follow that you can rely on him like all informers he would sell his own sisters plum you get one to trust you thats the hard bit but you could no more trust one yourself than i could win the sierstorpff stakes at the hoppegarten i started at the x bar an illegal jazz club where the band were sandwiching american hits between the opening and closing chords of whatever innocuous and culturally acceptable aryan number took their fancy and they did it well enough not to trouble any nazis conscience regarding socalled inferior music in spite of his occasionally strange behaviour neumann was one of the most nondescript anonymouslooking people i had ever seen it was what made him such an excellent informer you had to look hard to see him but that particular night there was no sign of him at the x nor at the allaverdi nor the rucker bar in the rough end of the redlight district it wasnt yet dark but already the dope dealers had surfaced to be caught selling cocaine was to be sent to a k z and for my money they couldnt catch too many of them but as i knew from experience that wasnt easy the dealers never carried coke on them instead they would hide it in a stash nearby in a secluded alley or doorway some of them posed as war cripples selling cigarettes and some of them were war cripples selling cigarettes wearing the yellow armlet with its three black spots that had persisted from weimar days this armlet conferred no official status however only the salvation army received official permission to peddle wares on street corners but the laws against vagrancy were not strictly enforced anywhere except the more fashionable areas of the city where the tourists were likely to go ssigars and ssigarettes hissed a voice those familiar with this coke signal would answer with a loud sniff often they found that they had bought cooking salt and aspirin the femina on nurnberger strasse was the sort of spot you went when you were looking for some female company if you didnt mind them big and florid and thirty marks for the privilege table telephones made the femina especially suitable for the shy type so it was just neumanns sort of place always presuming that he had some money he could order a bottle of sekt and invite a girl to join him without so much as moving from his table there were even pneumatic tubes through which small presents could be blown into the hand of a girl at the opposite end of the club apart from money the only thing a man needed at the femina was good eyesight i sat at a corner table and glanced idly at the menu as well as the list of drinks there was a list of presents that could be purchased from the waiter for sending through the tubes a powder compact for one mark fifty a matchboxcontainer for a mark and perfume for five i couldnt help thinking that money was likely to be the most popular sort of present you could send rocketing over to whichever party girl caught your eye there was no sign of neumann but i decided to stick it out for a while in case he showed up i signalled the waiter and ordered a beer there was a cabaret of sorts a chanteuse with orange hair and a twangy voice like a jews harp and a skinny little comedian with joinedup eyebrows who was about as risqué as a wafer on an icecream sundae there was less chance of the crowd at the femina enjoying the acts than there was of it rebuilding the reichstag it laughed during the songs and it sang during the comedians monologues and it was no nearer the palm of anyones hand than if it had been a rabid dog looking round the room i found there were many false eyelashes flapping at me that i was beginning to feel a draught several tables away a fat woman rippled the fingers of a pudgy hand at me and misinterpreting my sneer for a smile she started to struggle out of her seat i groaned yessir answered the waiter i pulled a crumpled note out of my pocket and tossed it on to his tray without bothering to wait for my change i turned and fled theres only one thing that unnerves me more than the company of an ugly woman in the evening and thats the company of the same ugly woman the following morning i got into the car and drove to potsdamer platz it was a warm dry evening but the rumbling in the purple sky told me that the weather was about to change for the worse i parked on leipziger platz in front of the palast hotel then i went inside and telephoned the adlon i got through to benita who said that hermine had left her a message and that about half an hour after i had spoken to her a man had called asking about an indian princess it was all i needed to know i collected my raincoat and a flashlight from the car holding the flash under the raincoat i walked the fifty metres back to potsdamer platz past the berlin tramway company and the ministry of agriculture towards columbus haus there were lights on the fifth and seventh floors but none on the eighth i looked in through the heavy plateglass doors there was a security guard sitting at the desk reading a newspaper and further along the corridor a woman who was going over the floor with an electric polisher it started to rain as i turned the corner onto hermann goering strasse and made a left onto the narrow service alley that led to the underground carpark at the back of columbus haus there were only two cars parked a d k w and a mercedes it seemed unlikely that either of them belonged to the security guard or the cleaner more probably their owners were still at work in offices on the floors above behind the two cars and under a bulkhead light was a grey steel door with the word service painted on it it had no handle and was locked i decided that it was probably the sort of lock that had a spring bolt that could be withdrawn by a knob on the inside or by means of a key on the outside and i thought that there was a good chance that the cleaner might leave the building through this door i checked the doors of the two parked cars almost absentmindedly and found that the mercedes was not locked i sat in the drivers seat and fumbled for the light switch the two huge lamps cut through the shadows like the spots at a party rally in nuremberg i waited several minutes passed bored i opened the glovebox there was a road map a bag of mints and a party membership book with stamps up to date it identified the bearer as one henning peter manstein manstein had a comparatively low party number which belied the youthfulness of the man in the photograph on the books ninth page there was quite a racket in the sale of early party numbers and there was no doubting that was how manstein had come by his a low number was essential to quick political advancement his handsome young face had the greedy look of a march violet stamped all over it as clearly as the party insignia embossed across the corner of the photograph fifteen minutes passed before i heard the sound of the service door opening i sprang out of the seat if it was manstein then i was going to have to make a run for it a wide pool of light spilled onto the floor of the garage and the cleaning woman came through the door hold the door i called i switched off the headlights and slammed the car door ive left something upstairs i said i thought for a minute i was going to have to walk all the way round to the front she stood there dumbly holding the door open as i approached when i drew near her she stepped aside saying i have to walk all the way to nollendorf platz i dont have no big car to take me home i smiled sheepishly like the idiot i imagined manstein to be thanks very much i said and muttered something about having left my key in my office the cleaning woman hovered a little and then released the door to me i stepped inside the building and let it go it closed behind me and i heard the loud click of the cylinder lock as the bolt hit the chamber two double doors with porthole windows led into a long brightly lit corridor that was lined with stacks of cardboard boxes at the far end was a lift but there was no way of using it without alerting the guard so i sat down on the stairs and removed my shoes and socks putting them on again in reverse order with the socks over the shoes its an old trick favoured by burglars for muffling the sound of shoeleather on a hard surface i stood up and began the long climb by the time i got to the eighth floor my heart was pounding with the effort of the climb and having to breathe quietly i waited at the edge of the stairs but there was no sound from any of the offices next to jeschonneks i shone the flash at both ends of the corridor and then walked down to his door kneeling down i looked for some wires that might give a clue to there being an alarm but there were none i tried first one key and then the other the second one was almost turning so i pulled it out and smoothed the points with a small file i tried again this time successfully i opened the door and went in locking it behind me in case the security guard decided to do his rounds i pointed the flash onto the desk over the pictures and across to the door to jeschonneks private office without the least resistance to the levers the key turned smoothly in my ringers covering the name of my locksmith with mental blessings i walked over to the window the neon sign on top of pschorr haus cast a red glow over jeschonneks opulent office so there wasnt much need for the flash i turned it off i sat down at the desk and started to look for i didnt know what the drawers werent locked but they contained little that was of any interest to me i got quite excited when i found a red leatherbound address book but i read it all the way through recognizing just the one name that of hermann goering only he was care of a gerhard von greis at an address on derfflingerstrasse i remembered weizmann the pawnbroker saying something about fat hermann having an agent who sometimes bought precious stones on his behalf so i copied out von greiss address and put it in my pocket the filing cabinet wasnt locked either but again i drew a blank plenty of catalogues of gems and semiprecious stones a lufthansa flight table a lot of papers to do with currency exchange some invoices and some life assurance policies one of which was with the germania life meanwhile the big safe sat in the corner impregnable and mocking my rather feeble attempts to uncover jeschonneks secrets if he had any it wasnt difficult to see why the place wasnt fitted with an alarm you couldnt have opened that box if youd had a truckload of dynamite there wasnt much left apart from the wastepaper basket i emptied the contents on the desk and started to poke through the scraps of paper a wrigleys chewinggum wrapper the mornings beobachter two tickethalves from the lessing theater a till receipt from the k d w department store and some rolledup balls of paper i smoothed them out on one of these was the adlons telephone number and underneath the name princess mushmi which had been questionmarked and then crossed out several times next to it was written my own name there was another telephone number written next to my name and this had been doodled around so that it looked like an illumination from a page in a medieval bible the number was a mystery to me although i recognized it was berlin west i picked up the receiver and waited for the operator number please she said ji trying to connect you there was a brief silence on the line and then it started ringing i have an excellent memory when it comes to recognizing a face or a voice but it might have taken me several minutes to place the cultured voice with its light frankfurt accent that answered the telephone as it was the man identified himself immediately he had finished confirming the number im so sorry i mumbled indistinctly i have the wrong number but as i replaced the receiver i knew that it was anything but it was in a grave close to the north wall of the nikolai cemetery on prenzlauer alice and only a short distance away from the memorial to national socialisms most venerated martyr horst wessel that the bodies were buried one on top of the other following a short service at nikolai kirche on nearby molken market wearing a stunning black hat that was like a grand piano with the lid up lise rudel was even more beautiful in mourning than she was in bed a couple of times i caught her eye but tightlipped like she had my neck between her teeth she looked straight through me as if i was a piece of dirty glass six himself maintained an expression that was more angry than griefstricken with eyebrows knotted and head bowed he stared down into the grave as though he were trying by a supernatural effort of will to make it yield up the living body of his daughter and then there was haupthändler who looked merely thoughtful like a man for whom there were other matters that were more pressing such as the disposal of a diamond necklace the appearance on the same sheet of paper in jeschonneks wastepaper basket of haupthändlers home telephone number with that of the adlon hotel my own name and that of the bogus princess demonstrated a possible chain of causation alarmed by my visit and yet puzzled by my story jeschonnek had telephoned the adlon to confirm the existence of the indian princess and then having done so he had telephoned haupthändler to confront him with a set of facts regarding the ownership and theft of the jewels which was at variance with that which might originally have been explained to him perhaps at least it was enough to be going on with at one point haupthändler stared impassively at me for several seconds but i could read nothing in his features no guilt no fear no ignorance of the connection i had established between him and jeschonnek nor any suspicion of it either i saw nothing that made me think he was incapable of having committed a double murder but he was certainly no cracksman so had he somehow persuaded frau pfarr to open it for him had he made love to her in order to get at her jewels given lise rudels suspicion that they might have been having an affair it had to be counted as one possibility there were some other faces that i recognized old kripo faces reichskriminaldirektor arthur nebe hans lobbe the head of kripo executive and one face which with its rimless glasses and small moustache looked more as if it belonged to a punctilious little schoolmaster than to the head of the gestapo and reichsführer of the s s himmlers presence at the funeral confirmed bruno stahleckers impression that pfarr had been the reichsführers star pupil and that he wasnt about to let the murderer get away with it of a woman on her own who might have been the mistress that bruno had mentioned as having been kept by paul pfarr there was no sign not that i really expected to see her but you never can tell after the burial haupthändler was ready with a few words of advice from his and my employer herr six sees little need for you to have concerned yourself in what is essentially a family affair im also to remind you that you are being remunerated on the basis of a daily fee i watched the mourners get into their big black cars and then himmler and the top bulls in kripo get into theirs look haupthändler i said forget the sledge ride tell your boss that if he thinks hes getting a cat in a sack then he can cut me loose now im not here because i like fresh air and eulogies then why are you here herr gunther he said ever read the song of the niebelungen naturally then youll remember that the niebelung warriors wished to avenge the murder of siegfried but they couldnt tell who they should hold to account so the trial of blood was begun the burgundian warriors passed one by one before the bier of the hero and when it was the murderer hagens turn siegfrieds wounds flowed with blood again so revealing hagens guilt haupthändler smiled thats hardly the stuff of modern criminal investigation is it detection should observe the little ceremonies herr haupthändler be they apparently anachronistic you might have noticed that i was not the only person involved in finding a solution to this case who attended this funeral are you seriously suggesting that someone here could have killed paul and grete pfarr dont be so bourgeois of course it is possible its preposterous thats what it is all the same do you have someone in mind for the role of hagen yet its under consideration then i trust you will be able to report your having identified him to herr six before very long good day to you i had to admit one thing if haupthändler had killed the pfarrs then he was as cool as a treasure chest in fifty fathoms of water i drove down prenzlauer strasse on to alexanderplatz i collected my mail and went up to the office the cleaning woman had opened the window but the smell of booze was still there she must have thought i washed in the stuff there were a couple of cheques a bill and a handdelivered note from neumann telling me to meet him at the café kranzler at twelve oclock i looked at my watch it was almost in front of the german war memorial a company of reichswehr were making trade for chiropodists to the accompaniment of a brass band sometimes i think that there must be more brass bands in germany than there are motorcars this one struck up with the great electors cavalry march and set off at a lick towards the brandenburger tor everyone who was watching was getting in some arm exercise so i hung back pausing in a shop doorway to avoid having to join them i walked on following the parade at a discreet distance and reflecting on the last alterations to the capitals most famous avenue changes that the government has deemed to be necessary to make unter den linden more suitable for military parades like the one i was watching not content with removing most of the lime trees which had given the avenue its name they had erected white doric columns on top of which sat german eagles new lime trees had been planted but these were not even as tall as the street lamps the central lane had been widened so that military columns might march twelve abreast and was strewn with red sand so that their jackboots did not slip and tall white flagpoles were being erected for the imminent olympiad unter den linden had always been flamboyant without much harmony in its mixture of architectural designs and styles but that flamboyance was now made brutal the bohemians fedora had become a pickelhaube the café kranzler on the corner of friedrichstrasse was popular with the tourists and prices were accordingly high so it was not the sort of place that i would have expected neumann to have chosen for a meet i found him twitching over a cup of mocha and an abandoned piece of cake whats the matter i said sitting down lost your appetite neumann sneered at his plate just like this government he said it looks damn good but tastes of absolutely nothing lousy ersatz cream i waved to the waiter and ordered two coffees look herr gunther can we make this quick im going over to karlshorst this afternoon oh got a tip have you well as a matter of fact i laughed neumann i wouldnt bet on a horse that you were going to back if it could outpace the hamburg express so fuck off then he snapped if he was a member of the human race at all neumann was its least attractive specimen his eyebrows twitching and curling like two poisoned caterpillars were joined together by an irregular scribble of poorly matched hair behind thick glasses that were almost opaque with greasy thumbprints his grey eyes were shifty and nervous searching the floor as if he expected that at any moment he would be lying flat on it cigarette smoke poured out from between teeth that were so badly stained with tobacco they looked like two wooden fences youre not in trouble are you neumanns face adopted a phlegmatic expression i owe some people some flea thats all how much couple of hundred so youre going to karlshorst to try and win some of it is that it he shrugged and what if i am he put out his cigarette and searched his pockets for another you got a nail ive run out i tossed a packet across the table keep it i said lighting us both a couple of hundred eh you know i just might be able to help you out there maybe even leave you some on top that is if i get the right information neumann raised his eyebrows what sort of information i drew on my cigarette and held it deep within my lungs the name of a puzzler a first class professional nutcracker who might have done a job about a week ago stolen some bells he pursed his lips and shook his head slowly i havent heard anything herr gunther well if you do make sure you let me know on the other hand he said lowering his voice i could tell you something that would put you well in with the gestapo whats that i know where a jewish uboat is hiding out he smiled smugly neumann you know im not interested in that crap but as i spoke i thought of frau heine my client and her son hold on a moment i said whats the jews name neumann gave me a name and grinned a disgusting sight his was an order of life not much higher than the calcareous sponge i pointed my finger squarely at his nose if i get to hear that uboats been pulled in i wont have to know who informed on him i promise you neumann ill come round and tear your fucking eyelids off whats it to you he whined since when have you been the knight in goldberg armour his mother is a client of mine before you forget you ever heard about him i want the address where he is so i can tell her all right all right but thats got to be worth something hasnt it i took out my wallet and gave him a twenty then i wrote down the address that neumann gave me youd disgust a dungbeetle i said now what about this nutcracker he frowned exasperatedly at me look i said i didnt have anything youre a liar honest herr gunther i dont know nothing if i did id tell you i need the money dont i he swallowed hard and wiped the sweat from his brow with a public healthhazard of a handkerchief avoiding my eyes he stubbed out his cigarette which was only halfsmoked you dont act like someone who knows nothing i said i think youre scared of something no he said flatly ever hear of the queer squad he shook his head you might say they used to be colleagues of mine i was thinking that if i found out youd been holding out on me id have a word with them tell them you were a smelly little para he looked at me with a mixture of surprise and outrage do i look like i suck lemons im not queer you know im not yes but they dont and who are they going to believe you wouldnt do that he grabbed my wrist from what i hear of it lefthanders dont have too good a time of it in the k zs neumann stared glumly into his coffee you evil bastard he sighed a couple of hundred you said and a bit more a hundred now and two more if its on the level he started to twitch you dont know what youre asking herr gunther theres a ring involved theyd kill me for sure if they found out id fingered them rings were unions of exconvicts dedicated officially to the rehabilitation of criminals they had respectable club names and their rules and regulations spoke of sporting activities and social gatherings not infrequently a ring would host a lavish dinner they were all very rich at which defence lawyers and police officials would appear as guests of honour but behind their semirespectable facades the rings were no nothing more than the institutions of organized crime in germany which one is it i asked the german strength well they wont find out anyway none of them are as powerful as they used to be theres only one ring thats doing good business these days and thats the party vice and drugs may have taken a bit of a hammering he said but the rings still run the gambling the currency rackets the black market new passports loansharking and dealing in stolen goods he lit another cigarette believe me herr gunther theyre still strong you dont want to get in their way he lowered his voice and leaned towards me ive even heard a strong whisper that they canned some old junker who was working for the prime minister how do you like that eh the bulls dont even know that hes dead yet i racked my brain and came across the name that i had copied from gert jeschonneks address book this junkers name it wouldnt have been von greis would it i didnt hear no name all i know is that hes dead and that the bulls are still looking for him he flicked his ash negligently at the ashtray now tell me about the nutcracker well it seems like i did hear something about a month ago a fellow by the name of kurt mutschmann finishes two years cement at tegel prison from what ive heard about him mutschmann is a real craftsman he could open the legs of a nun with rigor mortis but the polyps dont know about him you see he got put inside because he clawed a car nothing to do with his regular line of work anyway hes a german strength man and when he came out the ring was there to look after him after a while they set him up with his first job i dont know what it was but heres the interesting part herr gunther the boss of german strength red dieter has now got a contract out on mutschmann who is nowhere to be found the word is that mutschmann doublecrossed him mutschmann was a professional you say one of the best would you say murder was part of his portfolio well said neumann i dont know the man myself but from what ive heard hes an artist it doesnt sound like his number what about this red dieter hes a right bastard hed kill a man like someone else would pick their nose where do i find him you wont tell him it was me who told you will you herr gunther not even if he were to put a gun to your head no i lied loyalty goes only so far well you could try the rheingold restaurant on potsdamer platz or the germania roof and if you take my advice youll carry a lighter im touched by your concern for my wellbeing neumann youre forgetting the money he said correcting me you said id get another if it checked out he paused and then added and a hundred now i took out my wallet again and thumbed him a couple of fifties he held the two notes up to the window to scrutinize the watermarks you must be joking neumann looked at me blankly what about he pocketed the money quickly forget it i stood up and dropped some loose change onto the table one more thing can you remember when you heard about the contract on mutschmann neumann looked as thoughtful as he couid manage well now that i come to think of it it was last week about the time that i heard about this junker getting killed i walked west down unter den linden towards pariser platz and the adlon i went through the hotels handsome doorway and into the sumptuous lobby with its square pillars of dark yellowclouded marble everywhere there were tasteful objets dart and in every corner there was the gleam of yet more marble i went into the bar which was full of foreign journalists and embassy people and asked the barman an old friend of mine for a beer and the use of his telephone i called bruno stahlecker at the alex hallo its me bernie what do you want bernie how about gerhard von greis i said there was a long pause what about him brunos voice sounded vaguely challenging as if he was daring me to know more than i was supposed to hes just a name on a piece of paper to me at the moment that all well i heard he was missing would you mind telling me how come on bruno why are you being so coy about it look my little songbird told me all right maybe if i knew a bit more i might be able to help bernie there are two hot cases in this department right now and you seem to be involved in both of them that worries me if it will make you feel better ill have an early night give me a break bruno this makes two in one week i owe you youre damn right you do so whats the story stahlecker lowered his voice ever heard of walther funk funk no i dont think i have wait a minute isnt he some big noise in the business world he used to be hitlers economic advisor hes now vicepresident of the reich chamber of culture it would seem that he and herr von greis were a bit warm on each other von greis was funks boyfriend i thought the führer couldnt stand queers he cant stand cripples either so what will he do when he finds out about joey goebbelss club foot it was an old joke but i laughed anyway so the reason for tiptoes is because it could be embarrassing for funk and therefore embarrassing for the government right its not just that von greis and goering are old friends they saw service together in the war goering helped von greis get his first job with i g farben chemicals and lately hed been acting as goerings agent buying art and that sort of thing the reichskriminaldirektor is keen that we find von greis as soon as possible but its over a week now and theres been no sign of him he and funk had a secret lovenest on privatstrasse that funks wife didnt know about but he hasnt been there for days from my pocket i removed the piece of paper on which i had copied down an address from the book in jeschonneks desk drawer it was a number in derfflingerstrasse privatstrasse eh was there any other address not as far as we know are you on the case bruno not any more im not dietz has taken over but hes working on the pfarr case isnt he i guess so well doesnt that tell you something i dont know bernie im too busy trying to put a name to some guy with half a billiard cue up his nose to be a real detective like you is that the one they fished out of the river bruno sighed irritatedly you know one time im going to tell you something you dont already know about illmann was talking to me about it i bumped into him the other night yeah where was that in the morgue i met your client there goodlooking fellow maybe hes von greis no i thought of that von greis had a tattoo on his right forearm an imperial eagle look bernie ive got to go like i said a hundred times dont hold out on me if you hear anything let me know the way the boss is riding me i could use a break like i said bruno i owe you one two you owe me two bernie i hung up and made another call this time to the governor of tegel prison i made an appointment to see him and then ordered another beer while i was drinking it i did some doodling on a piece of paper the algebraic kind that you hope will help you think more clearly when i finished doing that i was more confused than ever algebra was never my strong subject i knew i was getting somewhere but i thought i would worry about where that was only when i arrived derfflingerstrasse was convenient for the brandnew air ministry situated at the south end of wilhelmstrasse and the corner of leipzigerstrasse not to mention the presidential palace on nearby leipzigerplatz convenient for von greis to wait upon his master in his capacities as chief of the luftwaffe and as prime minister of prussia von greiss apartment was on the third floor of a smart apartmentblock there was no sign of a concierge so i went straight on up i hit the doorknocker and waited after a minute or so had elapsed i bent down to look through the letterbox to my surprise i found the door swinging open as i pushed back the flap on its tight spring i didnt need my deerstalkerhat to realize that the place had been turned over from top to bottom the long hallways parquet floor was covered with books papers envelopes and empty wallet files as well as a considerable amount of broken glass which was referable to the empty doors of a large secretaire bookcase i walked past a couple of doors and stopped dead as i heard a chair scrape in the grate of one of the rooms ahead of me instinctively i reached for my gun the pity was it was still in my car i was going for a heavy cavalry sabre mounted on the wall when behind me i heard a piece of glass crack underneath someones foot and a stinging blow to the back of my neck sent me plunging through a hole in the earth for what seemed like hours although it must only have been a few minutes i lay at the bottom of a deep well fumbling my way back to consciousness i became aware of something in my pockets and then a voice from a long way off then i felt someone lift me under the shoulders drag me for a couple of miles and shove my face under a waterfall i shook my head and squinted up to look at the man who had hit me he was almost a giant with a lot of mouth and cheeks like hed stuffed each of them with a couple of slices of bread there was a shirt round his neck but it was the kind that belonged properly in a barbers chair and the kind of neck that ought to have been harnessed to a plough the arms of his jacket had been stuffed with several kilos of potatoes and they ended prematurely revealing wrists and fists that were the size and colour of two boiled lobsters breathing deeply i shook my head painfully i sat up slowly holding my neck with both hands christ what did you hit me with a length of railway track sorry about that said my attacker but when i saw you going for that sabre i decided to slow you down a bit i guess im lucky you didnt decide to knock me out otherwise i nodded at my papers which the giant was holding in his great paws looks like you know who i am mind telling me who you are it seems like i ought to know you rienacker wolf rienacker gestapo you used to be a bull didnt you up at the alex thats right and now youre a sniffer so what brought you up here looking for herr von greis i glanced about the room there was a lot of mess but it didnt seem that there was much missing a silver epergne stood immaculate on a sideboard the empty drawers of which were lying on the floor and there were several dozen oil paintings leaning in neat ranks against the walls clearly whoever had ransacked the place hadnt been after the usual variety of loot but something in particular i see he nodded slowly you know who owns this apartment i shrugged i had supposed it was herr von greis rienacker shook his bucketsized head only some of the time no the apartment is owned by hermann goering few people know about it very few he lit a cigarette and threw me the packet i lit one and smoked it gratefully i noticed that my hand was shaking so the first mystery continued rienacker is how you did the second is why you wanted to speak to von greis at all could be that you were after the same thing that the first mob were after the third mystery is where von greis is now maybe hes hiding maybe someones got him maybe hes dead i dont know this place was done over a week ago i came back here this afternoon to have another poke around in case there was something i missed the first time and to do some thinking and what do you know you come through the door he took a long drag on his cigarette in his enormous ham of a fist it looked like a babys tooth its my first real break on this case so hows about you start talking i sat up and straightened my tie and tried to fix my sodden collar let me just figure this out i said ive got this friend up at the alex who told me that the police dont know about this place and yet here you are staking it out which leads me to suppose that you or whoever it is youre working for likes it that way youd prefer to find von greis or at least get your hands on what makes him so popular before they do now it wasnt the silver and it wasnt the paintings because theyre still here go on this is goerings apartment so i guess that makes you goerings bloodhound theres no reason goering should have any regard for himmler after all himmler won control of the police and the gestapo from him so it would make sense for goering to want to avoid involving himmlers men more than was necessary arent you forgetting something i work for the gestapo rienacker i may be easy to slug but im not stupid we both know that goering has lots of friends in the gestapo which is hardly surprising since he set it up you know you should have been a detective my client thinks much the same way as yours about involving the bulls in his business which means that i can level with you rienacker my man is missing a picture an oil painting which he acquired outside any of the recognized channels so you see it would be best if the police didnt know anything about it the big bull said nothing so i kept on going anyway a couple of weeks ago it was stolen from his home which is where i fit in ive been hanging around some of the dealers and the word i hear is that hermann goering is a keen art buyer that somewhere in the depths of karinhall he has a collection of old masters not all of them acquired legitimately i heard that he had an agent herr von greis in all matters relating to the purchase of art so i decided to come here and see if i could speak to him who knows the picture im looking for might very well be one of the ones stacked up against that wall maybe it is said rienacker always supposing i believe you whos the painting by and whats the subject rubens i said enjoying my own inventiveness a couple of nude women standing by a river its called the bathers or something like that ive a photograph back at the office and who is your client im afraid i cant tell you that rienacker wielded a fist slowly i could try persuading you perhaps i shrugged i still wouldnt tell you its not that im the honourable type protecting my clients reputation and all that crap its just that im on a pretty substantial recovery fee this case is my big chance to make some real flea and if it costs me a few bruises and some broken ribs then thats the way it will have to be all right said rienacker take a look at the pictures if you want but if it is there ill have to clear it first i got back onto my wobbly legs and went over to the paintings i dont know a great deal about art all the same i recognize quality when i see it and most of the pictures in goerings apartment were the genuine article to my relief there was nothing that had a nude woman in it so i wasnt required to make a guess as to whether rubens had done it or not its not here i said finally but thanks for letting me take a look rienacker nodded in the hallway i picked up my hat and placed it back on my throbbing head he said im at the station on charlottenstrasse corner of französische strasse yes i said i know it above lutter and wegners restaurant isnt it rienacker nodded and yes if i hear anything ill let you know see that you do he growled and let me out when i got back to alexanderplatz i found that i had a visitor in my waiting room she was wellbuilt and quite tall in a suit of black cloth that lent her impressive curves the contours of a wellmade spanish guitar the skirt was short and narrow and tight across her ample behind and the jacket was cut to give a highwaisted line with the fullness gathered in to fit under her substantial bust on her shiny black head of hair she wore a black hat with a brim turned up all the way round and in her hands she held a black cloth bag with a white handle and clasp and a book which she put down as i came into the waiting room the blue eyes and perfectly lipsticked mouth smiled with disarming friendliness herr gunther i imagine i nodded dumbly im inge lorenz a friend of eduard müller of the berliner morgenpost we shook hands i unlocked the door to my office come in and make yourself comfortable i said she took a look around the room and sniffed the air a couple of times the place still smelt like a bartenders apron sorry about the smell im afraid i had a bit of an accident i went to the window and pushed it open when i turned round i found her standing beside me an impressive view she observed its not bad berlin alexanderplatz have you read doblins novel i dont get much time for reading nowadays i said anyway theres so little thats worth reading of course its a forbidden book she said but you should read it while its in circulation again i dont understand i said oh but havent you noticed banned writers are back in the bookshops its because of the olympiad so that tourists wont think things are quite as repressive here as has been made out of course theyll disappear again as soon as its all over but if only because they are forbidden you should read them thanks ill bear it in mind do you have a cigarette i flipped open the silver box on the desk and held it up by the lid for her she took one and let me light her the other day in a café on kurfürstendamm i absentmindedly lit one and some old busybody came up to me and reminded me of my duty as a german woman wife or mother fat chance i thought im nearly thirtynine hardly the age to start producing new recruits for the party im what they call a eugenic dud she sat down in one of the armchairs and crossed her beautiful legs i could see nothing that was dud about her except maybe the cafés she frequented its got so that a woman cant go out wearing a bit of makeup for fear of being called a whore you dont strike me as being the type to worry much about what people call you i said and as it happens i like a woman to look like a lady not a hessian milkmaid thank you herr gunther she said smiling thats very sweet of you müller says you used to be a reporter on the d a z yes thats right i lost my job during the partys clear women out of industry campaign an ingenious way of solving germanys unemployment problem dont you think you just say that a woman already has a job and thats looking after the home and the family if she doesnt have a husband then shed better get one if she knows whats good for her the logic is frightening how do you support yourself now i did freelance a bit but right now well frankly herr gunther im broke which is why im here müller says youre digging for some information on hermann six id like to try and sell what i know are you investigating him no actually hes my client oh she seemed slightly taken aback at this there was something about the way he hired me that made me want to know a lot more about him i explained and i dont just mean the school he went to i suppose you could say that he irritated me you see i dont like being told what to do not a very healthy attitude these days i guess not i grinned at her shall we say fifty marks then for what you know shall we say a hundred and then you wont be disappointed how about seventyfive and dinner its a deal she offered me her hand and we shook on it is there a file or something fräulein lorenz she tapped her head please call me inge and its all up here down to the last detail and then she told me hermann six was born the son of one of the wealthiest men in germany in april nine years to the day before our beloved führer entered this world since you mentioned school he went to the könig wilhelm gymnasium in berlin after that he went into the stock exchange and then into his fathers business which of course was the six steel works along with fritz thyssen the heir to another great family fortune young six was an ardent nationalist organizing the passive resistance to the french occupation of the ruhr in for this both he and thyssen were arrested and imprisoned but there the similarity between the two ends for unlike thyssen six has never cared for hitler he was a conservative nationalist never a national socialist and any support he may have given the party has been purely pragmatic not to say opportunistic meanwhile he married lisa voegler a former state actress in the berlin state theatre they had one child grete born in lisa died of tuberculosis in and six married lise rudel the actress inge lorenz stood up and started to walk about the room as she spoke watching her made it difficult to concentrate when she turned away my eyes were on her behind and when she turned to face me they were on her belly i said that six doesnt care for the party thats true he is equally opposed however to the tradeunion cause and appreciated the way in which the party set about neutralizing it when it first came to power but its the socalled socialism of the party that really sticks in his throat and the partys economic policy six was one of several leading businessmen present at a secret meeting in early held in the presidential palace at which future national socialist economic policy was explained by hitler and goering anyway these businessmen responded by contributing several million marks to party coffers on the strength of hitlers promise to eliminate the bolsheviks and restore the army it was a courtship that did not last long like a lot of germanys industrialists six favours expanding trade and increased commerce specifically with regard to the steel industry he prefers to buy his raw materials abroad because its cheaper goering does not agree however and believes that germany should be selfsufficient in iron ore as in everything else he believes in a controlled level of consumption and exports its easy to see why she paused waiting for me to furnish her with the explanation that was so easy to see is it i said she tutted and sighed and shook her head all at once well of course it is the simple fact of the matter is that germany is preparing for war and so conventional economic policy is of little or no relevance i nodded intelligently yes i see what you mean she sat down on the arm of her chair and folded her arms i was speaking to someone who still works on the d a z she said and he says that theres a rumour that in a couple of months goering will assume control over the second fouryear economic plan given his declared interest in the setting up of stateowned raw material plants to guarantee the supply of strategic resources such as iron ore one can imagine that six is less than happy about that possibility you see the steel industry suffered from considerable overcapacity during the depression six is reluctant to sanction the investment that is required for germany to become selfsufficient in iron ore because he knows that as soon as the rearmament boom finishes hell find himself massively overcapitalized producing expensive iron and steel itself the result of the high cost of producing and using domestic iron ore hell be unable to sell german steel abroad because of the high price of course it goes without saying that six wants business to keep the initiative in the german economy and my guess is that hell be doing his best to persuade the other leading businessmen to join him in opposing goering if they fail to back him theres no telling what hes capable of hes not above fighting dirty its my suspicion and its only a suspicion mind that he has contacts in the underworld the stuff on german economic policy was of marginal consequence i thought but six and the underworld well that really got me interested what makes you say that well first there was the strikebreaking that occurred during the steel strikes she said some of the men who beat up workers had gangland connections many of them were exconvicts members of a ring you know one of those criminal rehabilitation societies can you remember the name of this ring she shook her head it wasnt german strength was it i dont remember she thought some more i could probably dig up the names of the people involved if that would help if you can i said and anything else you can produce on that strikebreaking episode if you wouldnt mind there was a lot more but i already had my seventyfivemarks worth knowing more about my private secretive client i felt that i was properly in the driving seat and now that id heard her out it occurred to me that i could make use of her how would you like to come and work for me i need someone to be my assistant someone to do the digging around in public records and to be here now and then i think it would suit you i could pay you say sixty marks a week cash so we wouldnt have to inform the labour people maybe more if things work out what do you say well if youre sure she shrugged i could certainly use the money thats settled then i thought for a minute presumably you still have a few contacts on papers in government departments she nodded do you happen to know anyone in the d a f the german labour service she thought for a minute and fiddled with the buttons on her jacket there was someone she said ruminatively an exboyfriend an s a man why do you ask give him a call and ask him to take you out this evening but i havent seen or spoken to him in months she said and it was bad enough getting him to leave me alone the last time hes a real leech her blue eyes glanced anxiously at me i want you to find out anything you can about what sixs soninlaw paul pfarr was so interested in that he was there several times a week he had a mistress too so anything you can find out about her as well and i mean anything id better wear an extra pair of knickers then she said the man has hands like he thinks he should have been a midwife for the briefest of moments i allowed myself a small pang of jealousy as i imagined him making a pass at her perhaps in time i might do the same ill ask him to take me to see a show she said summoning me from my erotic reverie maybe even get him a little drunk thats the idea i said and if that fails offer the bastard money tegal prison lies to the northwest of berlin and borders a small lake and the borsig locomotive company housingestate as i drove onto seidelstrasse its redbrick walls heaved into sight like the muddy flanks of some hornyskinned dinosaur and when the heavy wooden door banged shut behind me and the blue sky vanished as though it had been switched off like an electric light i began to feel a certain amount of sympathy for the inmates of what is one of germanys toughest prisons a menagerie of warders lounged around the main entrance hall and one of these a pugfaced man smelling strongly of carbolic soap and carrying a bunch of keys that was about the size of the average car tyre led me through a cretan labyrinth of yellowing toiletbricked corridors and into a small cobbled courtyard in the centre of which stood the guillotine its a fearsomelooking object and always sends a chill down my spine when i see it again since the party had come to power it had seen quite a bit of action and even now it was being tested no doubt in preparation for the several executions that were posted on the gate as scheduled for dawn the next morning the warder led me through an oak door and up a carpeted stairway to a corridor at the end of the corridor the warder stood outside a polished mahogany door and knocked he paused for a second or two and then ushered me inside the prison governor dr konrad spiedel rose from behind his desk to greet me it was several years since i had first made his acquaintance when hed been governor of brauweiler prison near köln but he had not forgotten the occasion you were seeking information on the cellmate of a prisoner he recalled nodding towards an armchair something to do with a bank robbery youve a good memory herr doktor i said i confess that my recall is not entirely fortuitous he said the same man is now a prisoner within these walls on another charge spiedel was a tall broadshouldered man of about fifty he wore a schiller tie and an olivegreen bavarian jacket and in his buttonhole the blackandwhite silk bow and crossed swords that denoted a war veteran oddly enough im here on the same sort of mission i explained i believe that until recently you had a prisoner here by the name of kurt mutschmann i was hoping that you could tell me something about him mutschmann yes i remember him what can i tell you except that he kept out of trouble while he was here and seemed quite a reasonable fellow spiedel stood up and went over to his filing cabinet and rummaged through several sections yes here we are mutschmann kurt hermann aged thirtysix convicted of car theft april sentenced to two years imprisonment address given as cicerostrasse number halensee is that where he went on discharge im afraid your guess is as good as mine mutschmann had a wife but during his imprisonment it would seem from his record that she visited him only the one time it doesnt look like he had much to look forward to on the outside did he have any other visitors spiedel consulted the file just the one from the union of exconvicts a welfare organization we are led to believe although i have my doubts as to the authenticity of that organization a man by the name of kasper tillessen he visited mutschmann on two occasions did mutschmann have a cellmate yes he shared with bock hj he retrieved another file from the drawer hans jürgen bock aged thirtyeight convicted of assaulting and maiming a man in the old steel workers union in march sentenced to six years imprisonment do you mean that he was a strikebreaker yes he was you wouldnt happen to have the particulars of that case would you spiedel shook his head im afraid not the case file has been sent back to criminal records at the alex he paused hmm this might help you though on discharge bock gave the address where he was intending to stay as care of pension tillessen chamissoplatz number kreuzberg not only that but this same kasper tillessen paid bock a visit on behalf of the union of exconvicts he looked at me vaguely thats about it im afraid i think ive got enough i said brightly it was kind of you to give me some of your time spiedel adopted an expression of great sincerity and with some solemnity he said sir it was my pleasure to help the man who brought gormann to justice i reckon that in ten years from now ill still be trading off that gormann business when a mans wife visits him only once in two years cement then she doesnt bake him a spongecake to celebrate his freedom but it was possible that mutschmann had seen her after his release if only to knock the shit out of her so i decided to check her out anyway you always eliminate the obvious thats fundamental to detection neither mutschmann nor his wife lived at the address in cicerostrasse any more the woman i spoke to there told me that frau mutschmann had remarried and was living in ohmstrasse on the siemens housingestate i asked her if anyone else had been around looking for her but she told me that there hadnt it was by the time i got to the siemens housingestate there are as many as a thousand houses on it each of them built of the same whitewashed brick and providing accommodation for the families of the employees of the siemens electrical company i couldnt imagine anything less congenial than living in a house that had all the character of a sugar lump but i knew that in the third reich there were many worse things being done in the name of progress than the homogenizing of workers dwellings standing outside the front door my nose caught the smell of cooking meat pork i thought and suddenly i realized how hungry i was and how tired i wanted to be at home or seeing some easy brainless show with inge i wanted to be anywhere other than confronting the flintfaced brunette who opened the door to me she wiped her mottled pink hands on her grubby apron and eyed me suspiciously frau buverts i said using her new married name and almost hoping she wasnt yes she said crisply and who might you be not that i need to ask youve got bull stapled to each dumb ear so ill tell you once and then you can clear off i havent seen him in more than eighteen months and if you should find him then tell him not to come after me hes as welcome here as a jews prick up goerings arse and that goes for you too its the small manifestations of ordinary good humour and common courtesy that make the job so worthwhile later that night between and there was a loud knock at my front door i hadnt had a drink but the sleep id been having was deep enough to make me feel as if i had i walked unsteadily into the hall where the faint chalky outline of walther kolbs body on the floor brought me out of my sleepy stupor and prompted me to go back and get my spare gun there was another knock louder this time followed by a mans voice hey gunther its me rienacker come on open up i want to talk to you im still aching from our last little chat aw youre not still sore about that are you im fine about it but as far as my neck is concerned youre strictly persona non grata especially at this time of night hey no hard feelings gunther said rienacker look this is important theres money in it there was a long pause and when rienacker spoke again there was an edge of irritation in his bass voice come on gunther open up will you what the fuck are you so scared of if i was arresting you id have busted the door down by now there was some truth in that i thought so i opened the door revealing his massive figure he glanced coolly at the gun in my hand and nodded as if admitting that for the moment i still had an advantage you werent expecting me then he said drily oh i knew it was you all right rienacker i heard your knuckles dragging on the stairs he snorted a laugh that was mainly tobacco smoke then he said get dressed were going for a ride and better leave the hammer i hesitated whats the matter he grinned at my discomfiture dont you trust me now why do you say that the nice man from the gestapo knocks on my door at midnight and asks me if id like to take a spin in his big shinyblack motorcar naturally i just go weak at the knees because i know that youve booked us the best table at horchers someone important wants to see you he yawned someone very important theyve named me for the olympic shitthrowing team right rienackers face changed colour and his nostrils flared and contracted quickly like two emptying hotwater bottles he was starting to get impatient all right all right i said i suppose im going whether i like it or not ill get dressed i went towards the bedroom and no peeking it was a big black mercedes and i climbed in without a word there were two gargoyles in the front seat and lying on the floor in the back his hands cuffed behind him was the semiconscious body of a man it was dark but from his moans i could tell that hed taken quite a beating rienacker got in behind me with the movement of the car the man on the floor stirred and made a half attempt to get up it earned him the toe of rienackers boot against his ear what did he do leave his fly button undone hes a fucking kozi said rienacker outraged as if he had arrested an habitual child molester a midnight fucking postman we caught him redhanded pushing bolshie leaflets for the k p d through letterboxes in this area i shook my head i see the job is just as hazardous as it always was he ignored me and shouted to the driver well drop this bastard off and then go straight onto leipzigerstrasse mustnt keep his majesty waiting drop him off where schoneberger bridge rienacker laughed maybe he produced a hip flask from his coat pocket and took a long pull from it id had just such a leaflet put through my own letterbox the previous evening it had been devoted largely to ridiculing no less a person than the prussian prime minister i knew that in the weeks leading up to the olympiad the gestapo were making strenuous efforts to smash the communist underground in berlin thousands of kozis had been arrested and sent to k z camps like oranienburg columbia haus dachau and buchenwald putting two and two together it suddenly came to me with a shock just who it was i was being taken to see at grolmanstrasse police station the car stopped and one of the gargoyles dragged the prisoner out from under our feet i didnt think much for his chances if ever i saw a man destined for a latenight swimming lesson in the landwehr it was him then we drove east on berlinerstrasse and charlottenburghaussee berlins eastwest axis which was decorated with a lot of black white and red bunting in celebration of the forthcoming olympiad rienacker eyed it grimly fucking olympic games he sneered waste of fucking money im forced to agree with you i said whats it all for thats what id like to know we are what we are so why pretend were not all this pretence really pisses me off you know theyre even drafting in snappers from munich and hamburg because berlin trade in female flesh has been so hard hit by the emergency powers and nigger jazz is legal again what do you make of that gunther say one thing do another thats this government all over he looked at me narrowly i wouldnt go around saying that sort of thing if i were you he said i shook my head it doesnt matter what i say rienacker you know that just as long as i can be of service to your boss he wouldnt care if i were karl marx and moses in one if he thought i could be of use to him then youd better make the most of it youll never get another client as important as this one thats what they all say just short of the brandenburger tor the car turned south onto hermann goering strasse at the british embassy all the lights were burning and there were several dozen limousines drawn up out front as the car slowed and turned into the driveway of the big building next door the driver wound down the window to let the stormtrooper on guard identify us and we heard the sound of a big party drifting across the lawn we waited rienacker and i in a room the size of a tennis court after a short while a tall thin man wearing the uniform of an officer in the luftwaffe told us that goering was changing and that he would see us in ten minutes it was a gloomy palace overbearing grandiose and affecting a bucolic air that belied its urban location rienacker sat down in a medievallooking chair saying nothing as i took a look around but watching me closely cosy i said and stood in front of a gobelin tapestry depicting several hunting scenes that could just as easily have accommodated a scene featuring a fullscale version of the hindenburg the rooms only light came from a lamp on the huge renaissancestyle desk which was composed of two silver candelabra with parchment shades it illuminated a small shrine of photographs there was one of hitler wearing the brown shirt and leather cross belt of an s a man and looking more than a little like a boy scout and there were photographs of two women whom i guessed were goerings dead wife karin and his living wife emmy next to the photographs was a large leatherbound book on the front of which was a coat of arms which i presumed was goerings own this was a mailed fist grasping a bludgeon and it struck me how much more appropriate than the swastika it would have been for the national socialists i sat down beside rienacker who produced some cigarettes we waited for an hour perhaps longer before we heard voices outside the door and hearing it open we both stood up two men in luftwaffe uniform followed goering into the room to my astonishment i saw that he was carrying a lion cub in his arms he kissed it on the head pulled its ears and then dropped it on to the silk rug off you go and play mucki theres a good little fellow the cub growled happily and gambolled over to the window where he started to play with the tassel on one of the heavy curtains goering was shorter than i had imagined which made him seem that much bulkier he wore a sleeveless greenleather hunting jacket a white flannel shirt white drill trousers and white tennis shoes hallo he said shaking my hand and smiling broadly there was something slightly animal about him and his eyes were a hard intelligent blue the hand wore several rings one of them a big ruby thank you for coming im so sorry youve been kept waiting affairs of state you understand i said that it was quite all right although in truth i hardly knew what to say close up i was struck by the smooth almost babyish quality of his skin and i wondered if it was powdered we sat down for several minutes he continued to appear delighted at my being there almost childishly so and after a while he felt obliged to explain himself ive always wanted to meet a real private detective he said tell me have you ever read any of dashiell hammetts detective stories hes an american but i think hes wonderful i cant say i have sir oh but you should i shall lend you a german edition of red harvest youll enjoy it and do you carry a gun herr gunther sometimes sir when i think i might need it goering beamed like an excited schoolboy are you carrying it now i shook my head rienacker here thought it might scare the cat a pity said goering i should like to have seen the gun of a real shamus he leaned back in his chair which looked as though it might once have belonged to a bumpersized medici pope and waved his hand well then to business he said one of the aides brought forward a file and laid it before his master goering opened it and studied the contents for several seconds i figured that it was about me there were so many files on me around these days that i was beginning to feel like a medical casehistory it says here that you used to be a policeman he said quite an impressive record too youd have been a kommissar by now why did you leave he removed a small lacquered pillbox from his jacket and shook a couple of pink pills onto his fat palm as he waited for me to reply he took them with a glass of water i didnt much care for the police canteen sir he laughed loudly but with respect herr prime minister im sure you are well aware of why i left since at that time you were yourself in command of the police i dont recall making a secret of my opposition to the purging of socalled unreliable police officers many of those men were my friends many of them lost their pensions a couple even lost their heads goering smiled slowly with his broad forehead cold eyes low growling voice predatory grin and lazy belly he reminded me of nothing so much as a big fat maneating tiger and as if telepathically conscious of the impression he was making on me he leaned forwards in his chair scooped up the lion cub from off the rug and cradled it on his sofasized lap the cub blinked sleepily hardly stirring as its owner stroked its head and thumbed its ears he looked like he was admiring his own child you see he said he is not in anyones shadow and hes not afraid to speak his mind that is the great virtue of independence theres no reason on earth why this man should do me a service hes got the guts to remind me of that when another man would have stayed silent i can trust a man like that i nodded at the file on his desk id lay a bet that it was diels who put that little lot together and youd be right i inherited this file your file with a great many others when he lost his position as gestapo chief to that little shit of a chicken farmer it was the last great service that he was to do for me do you mind my asking what happened to him not at all he is still in my employment although occupying a lesser position as an inlandshipping administrator with the hermann goering works in cologne goering repeated his own name without the least trace of hesitation or embarrassment he must have thought it was the most natural thing in the world that a factory should bear his name you see he said proudly i look after the people who have done me a service isnt that so rienacker the big mans answer came back with the speed of a pilota ball yes sir herr prime minister you most certainly do full marks i thought as a servant bearing a large tray of coffee moselle and eggs benedict for the prime minister came into the room goering tucked in as if he hadnt eaten all day i may no longer be head of the gestapo he said but there are many in the security police like rienacker here who are still loyal to me rather than to himmler a great many piped rienacker loyally who keep me informed about what the gestapo is doing he dabbed daintily at his wide mouth with a napkin now then he said rienacker tells me that you turned up at my apartment in derfflingerstrasse this afternoon it is as he may already have told you an apartment that i have placed at the disposal of a man who in certain matters is my confidential agent his name is as i believe you know gerhard von greis and he has been missing for over a week rienacker says that you thought that he might have been approached by someone trying to sell a stolen painting a rubens nude to be precise what made you think that my agent was worth contacting and how you managed to track him down to that particular address i have no idea but you impress me herr gunther thank you very much herr prime minister who knows i thought with a little practice i could sound just like rienacker your record as a police officer speaks for itself and i dont doubt that as a private investigator you are no less competent he finished eating swallowed a glassful of moselle and lit an enormous cigar he showed no signs of weariness unlike the two aides and rienacker and i was starting to wonder what the pink pills had been he blew a doughnutsized smokering gunther i want to become your client i want you to find gerhard von greis preferably before sipo does not that hes committed any crime you understand its just that he is the custodian of some confidential information which i have no wish to see fall into himmlers hands what kind of confidential information herr prime minister im afraid i cant tell you that look sir i said if im going to row the boat i like to know if there are any leaks in it thats the difference between me and a regular bull he doesnt get to ask why its the privilege of independence goering nodded i admire directness he said i dont just say that im going to do something i do it and i do it properly i dont suppose theres any point in hiring you unless i take you fully into my confidence but you must understand that imposes certain obligations on you herr gunther the price of betraying my trust is a high one i didnt doubt it for a minute i got so little sleep these days i didnt think that losing some more on account of what i knew about goering was going to make any difference i couldnt back off besides there was likely to be some good money in it and i try not to walk away from money unless i can possibly help it he took another two of the little pink pills he seemed to take them as often as i might have smoked a cigarette sir rienacker will tell you that when he and i met in your apartment this afternoon he asked me to tell him the name of the man i was working for the man who owns the rubens nude i wouldnt tell him he threatened to beat it out of me i still wouldnt tell him rienacker leaned forwards thats correct herr prime minister he offered i continued with my pitch every one of my clients gets the same deal discretion and confidentiality i wouldnt stay in business for very long if it was any other way goering nodded thats frank enough he said then let me be equally frank many positions in the bureaucracy of the reich fall to my patronage consequently im often approached by a former colleague a business contact to grant a small favour well i dont blame people for trying to get on if i can i help them but of course i will ask a favour in return that is the way the world works at the same time i have built up a large store of intelligence it is a reservoir of knowledge that i draw on to get things done knowing what i know it is easier to persuade people to share my point of view i have to take the larger view for the good of the fatherland even now there are many men of influence and power who do not agree with what the führer and myself have identified as the priorities for the proper growth of germany so that this wonderful country of ours may assume its rightful place in the world he paused perhaps he was expecting me to jump up and give the hitler salute and burst into a couple of verses of horst wessel but i stayed put nodding patiently waiting for him to come to the point von greis was the instrument of my will he said silkily as well as of my foible he was both my purchasing agent and my fund raiser you mean he was an upmarket squeezeartist goering winced and smiled at the same time herr gunther it does you much credit to be so honest and so objective but please try not to make it compulsive i am a blunt man myself but i dont make a virtue out of it understand this everything is justified in the service of the state sometimes one must be hard it was i think goethe who said that one must either conquer and rule or serve and lose suffer or triumph be the anvil or the hammer do you understand yes sir look it might help if i knew who von greis had dealings with goering shook his head i really cant tell you that its my turn to get on the soapbox and talk about discretion and confidentiality to that extent youll have to work in the dark very well sir ill do my best do you have a photograph of the gentleman he reached into a drawer and produced a small snapshot which he handed to me this was taken five years ago he said he hasnt changed a great deal i looked at the man in the picture like many german men he wore his fair hair cropped relentlessly close to the skull except for an absurd kisscurl decorating his broad forehead the face crumpled in many places like an old cigarettepacket wore a waxed moustache and the general effect was of the cliché german junker to be found in the pages of a back number of jugend also he has a tattoo added goering on his right arm an imperial eagle very patriotic i said i put the photograph in my pocket and asked for a cigarette one of goerings aides offered me one from the great silver box and lit it with his own lighter i believe that the police are working on the idea that his disappearance might have something to do with his being a homosexual i said nothing about the information that neumann had given me concerning the german strength ring having murdered a nameless aristocrat until i could check his story there was no point in throwing away what might turn out to be a good card that is indeed a possibility goerings admission sounded uncomfortable its true his homosexuality led him to some dangerous places and on one occasion it even brought him to the attention of the police however i was able to see that the charge was dropped gerhard was not deterred by what should have been a salutary experience there was even a relationship with a prominent bureaucrat to contend with foolishly i allowed it to continue in the hope that it would force gerhard to become more discreet i took this information with several pinches of salt i thought it much more likely that goering had allowed the relationship to continue in order that he might compromise funk a lesser political rival with the aim of putting him into his back pocket that is if he wasnt there already did von greis have any other boyfriends goering shrugged and looked at rienacker who stirred and said there was nobody in particular as far as we know but its difficult to say for sure most of the warm boys have been driven underground by the emergency powers and most of the old queer clubs like the eldorado have been closed all the same herr von greis still managed to pursue a number of casual liaisons there is one possibility i said that on a nocturnal visit to some out of the way corner of the city for sex the gentleman was picked up by the local kripo beaten up and tossed into a k z you might not hear about it for several weeks the irony of the situation was not lost on me that i should be discussing the disappearance of the servant of the man who was himself the architect of so many other disappearances i wondered if he could see it too frankly sir one to two weeks is not a long time to be missing in berlin these days inquiries in that direction are already being made said goering but you are right to mention it apart from thatits up to you now from what inquiries rienacker has made about you missing persons would seem to be your speciality my aide here will provide you with money and anything else you may require is there anything else i thought for a moment id like to put a tap on a telephone i knew that the forschungsamt the directorate of scientific research which took care of wiretaps was subordinate to goering housed in the old air ministry building it was said that even himmler had to obtain goerings permission to put a wiretap on someone and i strongly suspected that it was through this particular facility that goering continued to add to the reservoir of intelligence that diels had left to his erstwhile master goering smiled you are wellinformed as you wish he turned and spoke to his aide see to it it is to be given priority and make sure that herr gunther is given a daily transcript yes sir said the man i wrote out a couple of numbers on a piece of paper and handed it to him then goering stood up this is your most important case he said putting his hand lightly on my shoulder he walked me to the door rienacker followed at a short distance and if you are successful you will not find me wanting in generosity and if i wasnt successful for the moment i preferred to forget that possibility it was nearly light by the time i got back to my apartment the paintingout squad was hard at work on the streets obliterating the nocturnal daubings of the k p d red front will win and long live thaelman and torgler before the city awoke to the new day i had been asleep for no more than a couple of hours when the sound of sirens and whistles wrenched me violently from my quiet slumbers it was an airraid practice i buried my head under the pillow and tried to ignore the area warden hammering on my door but i knew that i would only have to account for my absence later on and that failure to provide a verifiable explanation would result in a fine thirty minutes later when the whistles had blown and the sirens cranked to sound the allclear there seemed little point in going back to bed so i bought an extra litre off the bolle milkman and cooked myself an enormous omelette inge arrived at my office at just after nine without much ceremony she sat down on the other side of my desk and watched me finish making some case notes did you see your friend i asked her after a moment we went to the theatre yes what did you see i found that i wanted to know everything including details that had no bearing on the mans possible knowledge of paul pfarr the base wallah it was rather weak but otto seemed to enjoy it he insisted on paying for the tickets so i didnt need the petty cash then what did you do we went to baarzs beer restaurant i hated it a real nazi place everyone stood and saluted the radio when it played the horst wessel song and deutschland über alles i had to do it too and i hate to salute it makes me feel like im hailing a taxi otto drank rather a lot and became very talkative i drank quite a lot myself actually i feel a bit rough this morning she lit a cigarette anyway otto was vaguely acquainted with pfarr he says that pfarr was about as popular as a ferret in a gumboot at the d a f and its not difficult to see why pfarr was investigating corruption and fraud in the labour union as a result of his investigations two treasurers of the transport workers union were dismissed and sent to k zs one after the other the chairman of the koch strasse shopcommittee of ullsteins the big printing works was found guilty of stealing funds and executed rolf togotzes the cashier of the metal workers union was sent to dachau and a lot more if ever a man had enemies it was paul pfarr apparently there were lots of smiling faces around the department when it became known that pfarr was dead any idea what he was investigating at the time of his death no apparently he played things very close to his chest he liked to work through informers amassing evidence until he was ready to make formal charges did he have any colleagues there just a stenographer a girl by the name of marlene sahm otto my friend if you can call him that took quite a shine to her and asked her out a couple of times nothing much came of it thats the story of his life im afraid but he remembered her address though inge opened her handbag and consulted a small notebook nollendorfstrasse number shell probably know what he had been getting up to he sounds like a bit of a ladies man your friend otto inge laughed thats what he said about pfarr he was pretty sure that pfarr was cheating on his wife and that he had a mistress he saw him with a woman on several occasions at the same nightclub he said that pfarr seemed embarrassed at being discovered otto said she was quite a beauty if a bit flashy he thought her name was vera or eva or something like that did he tell the police that no he says that they never asked on the whole hed rather not get involved with the gestapo unless he has to you mean that he hasnt even been questioned apparently not i shook my head i wonder what theyre playing at i thought for a minute and then added thanks for doing that by the way i hope it wasnt too much of a nuisance she shook her head how about you you look tired i was working late and i didnt sleep all that well then this morning there was a damned airraid practice i tried to massage some life into the top of my head i didnt tell her about goering there was no need for her to know more than she had to it was safer for her that way that morning she was wearing a dress of darkgreen cotton with a fluted collar and cavalier cuffs of stiffened white lace for a brief moment i fed myself on the fantasy that had me lifting her dress up and familiarizing myself with the curve of her buttocks and the depth of her sex this girl pfarrs mistress are we going to try and find her i shook my head the bulls would be bound to hear about it and then it could get awkward theyre quite keen on finding her themselves and i wouldnt want to start picking that nostril with one finger already in there i picked up the phone and asked to be connected to sixs home telephone number it was farraj the butler who answered is herr six or herr haupthändler at home its bernhard gunther speaking im sorry sir but theyre both away at a meeting this morning then i believe theyll be attending the opening of the olympic games may i give either of them a message sir yes you can i said tell them both that im getting close is that all sir yes theyll know what i mean and make sure that you tell both of them farraj wont you yes sir i put the phone down right i said its time we got going it was a tenpfennig ride on the ubahn to the zoo station repainted to look especially smart for the olympic fortnight even the walls of the houses backing on to the station had been given a new coat of white but high above the city and where the hindenburg airship droned noisily back and forwards towing an olympic flag the sky had gathered a surly gang of darkgrey clouds as we left the station inge looked upwards and said it would serve them right if it rained better still if it rained for the entire fortnight thats the one thing they cant control i said we approached the top of kurfurstenstrasse now then while herr haupthändler is away with his employer i propose to have a squint at his rooms wait for me at aschingers restaurant inge began to protest but i continued speaking burglary is a serious crime and i dont want you around if the going gets tough understand she frowned and then nodded brute she muttered as i walked away number was a fivestorey block of expensivelooking flats of the sort that had a heavy black door that was polished so keenly they could have used it as a mirror in a negro jazzbands dressing room i summoned the diminutive caretaker with the enormous stirrupshaped brass doorknocker he looked about as alert as a doped tree sloth i flashed the gestapo warrant disc in front of his rheumy little eyes at the same time i snapped gestapo at him and pushing him roughly aside i stepped quickly into the hall the caretaker oozed fear through every one of his pasty pores which is herr haupthändlers apartment realizing that he was not about to be arrested and sent to a k z the caretaker relaxed slightly the second floor apartment five but hes not at home right now i snapped my fingers at him your passkey give it to me with eager unhesitating hands he produced a small bunch of keys and removed one from the ring i snatched it from his trembling fingers if herr haupthändler returns ring once on the telephone and then replace the receiver is that clear yes sir he said with an audible gulp haupthändlers were an impressively large suite of rooms on two levels with arched doorways and a shiny wooden floor covered with thick oriental rugs everything was neat and wellpolished so much so that the apartment seemed hardly lived in at all in the bedroom were two large twin beds a dressingtable and a pouffe the colour scheme was peach jadegreen and mushroom with the first colour predominating i didnt like it on each of the two beds was an open suitcase and on the floor were empty carrierbags from several large department stores including c a grunfelds gersons and tietz i searched through the suitcases the first one i looked in was a womans and i was struck by the fact that everything in it was or at least looked brandnew some of the garments still had the price tags attached and even the soles of the shoes were unworn by contrast the other suitcase which i presumed must belong to haupthändler himself contained nothing that was new except for a few toiletries there was no diamond necklace but lying on the dressingtable was a walletsized folder containing two deutsche lufthansa airtickets for the monday evening flight to croydon london the tickets were returns and booked in the name of herr and frau teichmüller before leaving haupthändlers apartment i called the adlon hotel when hermine answered i thanked her for helping me with the princess mushmi story i couldnt tell if goerings people in the forschungsamt had tapped the telephone yet there were no audible clicks nor any extra resonance in hermines voice but i knew that if they really had put a tap on haupthändlers telephone then i ought to see a transcript of my conversation with hermine later on that day it was as good a way as any of testing the true extent of the prime ministers cooperation i left haupthändlers rooms and returned to the ground floor the caretaker emerged from his office and took possession of his passkey again you will say nothing of my being here to anyone otherwise it will go badly for you is that understood he nodded silently i saluted smartly something gestapo men never do preferring as they do to remain as inconspicuous as possible but i was laying it on for the sake of effect heil hitler i said heil hitler repeated the caretaker and returning the salute he managed to drop the keys weve got until monday night to pull this one back i said sitting down at inges table i explained about the airtickets and the two suitcases the funny thing was that the womans case was full of new things your herr haupthändler sounds like he knows how to look after a girl everything was new the garterbelt the handbag the shoes there wasnt one item in that case that looked as though it had been used before now what does that tell you inge shrugged she was still slightly piqued at having been left behind maybe hes got a new job going doortodoor selling womens clothes i raised my eyebrows all right then she said maybe this woman that hes taking to london doesnt have any nice clothes more like doesnt have any clothes at all i said rather a strange kind of woman wouldnt you say bernie just you come home with me ill show you a woman without any clothes for a brief second i entertained myself with the idea but i went on no im convinced that haupthändlers mystery girlfriend is starting out on this trip with a completely new wardrobe from top to toe like a woman with no past or said inge a woman who is starting afresh the theory was taking shape in her mind even as she was speaking with greater conviction she added a woman who has had to sever contact with her previous existence a woman who couldnt go home and pick up her things because there wasnt time no that cant be right she has until monday night after all so perhaps shes afraid to go home in case theres someone waiting for her there i nodded approvingly and was about to develop this line of reasoning but found that she was there ahead of me perhaps she said this woman was pfarrs mistress the one the police are looking for vera or eva i forget which haupthändler in this with her yes i said thoughtfully that could fit maybe pfarr gives his mistress the brushoff when he finds out that his wife is pregnant the prospect of fatherhood has been known to bring some men to their senses but it also happens to spoil things for haupthändler who might himself have had ambitions as far as frau pfarr was concerned maybe haupthändler and this woman eva got together and decided to play the part of the wronged lover in tandem so to speak and also make a little money into the bargain its not unlikely that pfarr might have told eva about his wifes jewellery i stood up finishing my drink then maybe haupthändler is hiding eva somewhere that makes three maybes more than im used to having over lunch any more and ill get sick i glanced at my watch come on we can think about it some more on the way on the way where kreuzberg she levelled a wellmanicured finger at me and this time im not being left somewhere safe while you get all the fun understood i grinned at her and shrugged understood the kreuzberg the hill of the cross lies to the south of the city in viktoria park near tempelhof airport its where berlins artists gather to sell their pictures just a block away from the park chamissoplatz is a square surrounded by high grey fortresslike tenements pension tillessen occupied the corner of number but with its closed shutters pasted over with party posters and k p d graffiti it didnt look as though it had been taking guests since bismarck grew his first moustache i went to the front door and found it locked bending down i peered through the letterbox but there was no sign of anyone next door at the office of heinrich billinger german accountant the coalman was delivering some browncoal briquets on what looked like a bakery tray i asked him if he could recollect when the pension had closed he wiped his smutty brow and then spat as he tried to remember it never was what you might call a regular pension he declared finally he looked uncertainly at inge and choosing his words carefully added more what you might call a house of illrepute not a regular outandout bawdy house you understand just the sort of place where you used to see a snapper take her sledge i remember as i saw some men coming out of there only a couple of weeks ago the boss never bought coal regular like just the odd tray here and there but as to when it closed i couldnt tell you if it is closed mind dont judge it by the way it looks seems to me as how its always been in that state i led inge round the back to a small cobbled alleyway that was lined with garages and lockups stray cats sat mangily selfcontained on top of brick walls a mattress lay abandoned in a doorway its iron guts spilling on to the ground someone had tried to burn it and i was reminded of the blackened bedframes in the forensic photographs illmann had shown me we stopped beside what i took to be the garage belonging to the pension and looked through the filthy window but it was impossible to see anything ill come back for you in a minute i said and clambered up the drainpipe at the side of the garage and onto the corrugated iron roof see that you do she called i walked carefully across the badly rusted roof on all fours not daring to stand up straight and concentrate all my weight on one point at the back of the roof i looked down into a small courtyard which led on to the pension most of the windows in the rooms were shrouded with dirty net curtains and there was no sign of life at any of them i searched for a way down but there was no drainpipe and the wall to the adjoining property the german accountants was too low to be of any use it was fortunate that the rear of the pension obscured the view to the garage of anyone who might have chanced to look up from poring over a dull set of accounts there was no choice but to jump although it was a height of over four metres i made it but it left the soles of my feet stinging for minutes afterwards as if they had been beaten with a length of rubber hosing the back door to the garage was not locked and but for a pile of old car tyres it was empty i unbolted the double doors and admitted inge then i bolted them again for a moment we stood in silence looking at each other in the half darkness and i nearly let myself kiss her but there are better places to kiss a pretty girl than a disused garage in kreuzberg we crossed the yard and when we came to the back door of the pension i tried the handle the door stayed shut now what said inge a lockpick a skeleton key something like that i said and kicked the door in very subtle she said watching the door swing open on its hinges i assume youve decided that theres nobody here i grinned at her when i looked through the letterbox i saw a pile of unopened mail on the mat i went in she hesitated long enough for me to look back at her its all right theres nobody here hasnt been for some time id bet so what are we doing here were having a look around thats all you make it sound as if we were in grunfelds department store she said following me down the gloomy stone corridor the only sound was our own footsteps mine strong and purposeful and hers nervous and half on tiptoe at the end of the corridor i stopped and glanced into a large and extremely smelly kitchen piles of dirty dishes lay in untidy stacks cheese and meat lay flyblown on the kitchen table a bloated insect buzzed past my ear one step in the stink was overpowering behind me i heard inge cough so that it was almost a retch i hurried to the window and pushed it open for a moment we stood there enjoying the clean air then looking down at the floor i saw some papers in front of the stove one of the doors to the incinerator was open and i bent forward to take a look inside the stove was full of burnt paper most of it nothing more than ash but here and there were the edges or corners of something that had not quite been consumed by the flames see if you can salvage some of this i said it looks like someone was in a hurry to cover his tracks anything in particular anything legible i suppose i walked over to the kitchen doorway where will you be im going to take a look upstairs i pointed to the dumbwaiter if you need me just shout up the shaft there she nodded silently and rolled up her sleeves upstairs and on the same level as the front door there was even more mess behind the front desk were empty drawers their contents lying on the threadbare carpet and the doors of every cupboard had been wrenched off their hinges i was reminded of the mess in goerings derfflingerstrasse apartment most of the bedroom floorboards had been ripped up and some of the chimneys showed signs of having been probed with a broom then i went into the dining room blood had spattered the white wallpaper like an enormous graze and on the rug was a stain the size of a dinnerplate i stood on something hard and bent down to pick up what looked like a bullet it was a lead weight encrusted with blood i tossed it in my hand and then put it in my jacket pocket more blood had stained the wooden sill of the dumbwaiter i leaned into the shaft to shout down to inge and found myself retching so strong was the smell of putrefaction i staggered away there was something sticking in the shaft and it wasnt a late breakfast covering my nose and mouth with my handkerchief i poked my head back into the shaft looking down i saw that the lift itself was stuck between floors glancing upwards i saw that as it crossed the pulley one of the ropes supporting the lift had been jammed with a piece of wood sitting on the sill with the top half of my body in the shaft i reached up and pulled the piece of wood away the rope ran past my face and beneath me the lift plummeted down to the kitchen with a loud bang i heard inges shocked scream and then she screamed again only this time it was louder and more sustained i sprinted out of the dining room down the stairs to the basement and found her standing in the corridor leaning weakly on the wall outside the kitchen are you all right she swallowed loudly its horrible what is i went through the doorway i heard inge say dont go in there bernie but it was too late the body sat to one side in the lift huddled foetally like a daredevil ready to attempt niagara falls in a beer barrel as i stared at it the head seemed to turn and it took a moment for me to realize that it was covered with maggots a glistening mask of worms feeding on the blackened face i swallowed hard several times covering my nose and mouth once again i stepped forward for a closer look close enough so that i could hear the light rustling sound like a gentle breeze through moist leaves of hundreds of small mouth parts from my small knowledge of forensics i knew that soon after death flies not only lay their eggs on a cadavers moist parts such as the eyes and mouth but also on open wounds by the number of maggots feeding on the upper part of the cranium and on the right temple it looked more than probable that the victim had been beaten to death from the clothes i could tell that the body was that of a man and judging by the obvious quality of his shoes quite a wealthy one i put my hand into the righthand jacket pocket and turned it inside out some loose change and scraps of paper fell to the floor but there was nothing that might have identified him i felt around the area of the breast pocket but it seemed to be empty and i didnt feel like squeezing my hand between his knee and the maggoty head to make sure as i stepped back to the window to draw a decent breath a thought occurred to me what are you doing bernie her voice seemed stronger now just stay where you are i told her i wont be very long i just want to see if i can find out who our friend is i heard her take a deep breath and the scrape of a match as she lit a cigarette i found a pair of kitchen scissors and went back to the dumbwaiter where i cut the arm of the jacket lengthways up the mans forearm against the skins greenish purplish hue and marbled veining the tattoo was still clearly visible clinging to his forearm like a large black insect which rather than feast on the head with the smaller flies and worms had chosen to dine alone on a bigger piece of carrion ive never understood why men get themselves tattooed you would have thought there were better things to do than deface your own body still it makes identifying someone relatively straightforward and it occurred to me that it wouldnt be very long before every german citizen was the subject of compulsory tattooing but right now the imperial german eagle identified gerhard von greis just as certainly as if i had been handed his party card and passport inge looked round the doorway do you have any idea who it is i rolled up my sleeve and put my arm into the incinerator yes i do i said feeling around in the cold ash my fingers touched something hard and long i drew it out and regarded it objectively it was hardly burnt at all not the sort of wood that burns easily at the thicker end it was split revealing another lead weight and an empty socket for the one i had found on the carpet in the dining room upstairs his name was gerhard von greis and he was a highclass squeezeartist looks like he was paid off permanently someone combed his hair with this what is it a length of broken billiard cue i said and thrust it back into the stove shouldnt we tell the police we dont have the time to help them feel their way around not right now anyway wed just spend the rest of the weekend answering stupid questions i was also thinking that a couple of days more fees from goering wouldnt go amiss but i kept that one to myself what about him the dead man i looked back at von greiss maggoty body and then shrugged hes in no hurry i said besides you wouldnt want to spoil the picnic would you we collected up the scraps of paper that inge had managed to salvage from the inside of the stove and caught a cab back to the office i poured us both large cognacs inge drank it gratefully holding the glass with both hands like a small child who is greedy for lemonade i sat down on the side of her chair and put my arm around her trembling shoulders drawing her to me von greiss death accelerating our growing need to be close im afraid im not used to dead bodies she said with an embarrassed smile least of all badly decomposed bodies that appear unexpectedly in servicelifts yes it must have been quite a shock to you im sorry you had to see that i have to admit hed let himself go a bit she gave a slight shudder its hard to credit that it was ever human at all it looked so so vegetable like a sack of rotten potatoes i resisted the temptation to make another tasteless remark instead i went over to my desk laid out the scraps of paper from tillessens kitchen stove and glanced over them mostly they were bills but there was one almost untouched by the flames that interested me a good deal what is it said inge i picked up the scrap of paper between finger and thumb a payslip she stood up and looked at it more closely from a paypacket made up by the gesellschaft reichsautobahnen for one of its motorwayconstruction workers whose a fellow by the name of hans jürgen bock until recently he was in the cement with somebody by the name of kurt mutschmann a nutcracker and you think that this mutschmann might have been the one who opened the pfarrs safe right both he and bock are members of the same ring as was the owner of the excuse for a hotel we just visited but if bock is in a ring with mutschmann and tillessen whats he doing working in motorway construction thats a good question i shrugged and added who knows maybe hes trying to go straight whatever hes doing we ought to speak to him perhaps he can tell us where to find mutschmann its possible and tillessen i shook my head tillessens dead i explained von greis was killed beaten with a broken billiard cue a few days ago in the police morgue i saw what happened to the other half of that billiard cue it was pushed up tillessens nose into his brain inge grimaced uncomfortably but how do you know it was tillessen i dont for sure i admitted but i know that mutschmann is hiding and that it was tillessen who he went to stay with when he got out of prison i dont think tillessen would have left a body lying around his own pension if he could possibly have avoided it the last i heard the police still hadnt made a positive id on the corpse so im assuming that it must be tillessen but why couldnt it be mutschmann i dont see it that way a couple of days ago my informer told me that there was a contract out on mutschmann by which time the body with the cue up its nose had already been fished out of the landwehr no it could only be tillessen and von greis was he a member of this ring too not this ring but another one and far more powerful he worked for goering all the same i cant explain why he should have been there i swilled some brandy around my mouth like a mouthwash and when i had swallowed it i picked up the telephone and called the reichsbahn i spoke to a clerk in the payroll department my name is rienacker i said kriminalinspecktor rienacker of the gestapo we are anxious to trace the whereabouts of an autobahnconstruction worker by the name of hans jürgen bock pay reference he may be able to help us in apprehending an enemy of the reich yes said the clerk meekly what is it that you wish to know obviously the section of the autobahn on which he is working and whether or not hell be there today if you will please wait one minute i shall go and check the records several minutes elapsed thats quite a nice little act you have there said inge i covered the mouthpiece its a brave man who refuses to cooperate with a caller claiming to be in the gestapo the clerk came back to the telephone and told me that bock was on a work detail beyond the edge of greater berlin on the berlintohanover stretch specifically the section between brandenburg and lehnin i suggest that you contact the siteoffice a couple of kilometres this side of brandenburg its about seventy kilometres you drive to potsdam then take zeppelin strasse after about forty kilometres you pick up the abahn at lehnin thank you i said and is he likely to be working today im afraid i dont know said the clerk many of them do work saturdays but even if hes not working youll probably find him in the workers barracks they live on site you see youve been most helpful i said and added with the pomposity that is typical of all gestapo officers i shall report your efficiency to your superior its just typical of the bloody nazis said inge to build the peoples roads before the peoples car we were driving towards potsdam on the avus speedway and inge was referring to the much delayed strength through joy car the kdfwagen it was a subject she evidently felt strongly about if you ask me its putting the cart before the horse i mean who needs these gigantic highways its not as if theres anything wrong with the roads we have now its not as if there are that many cars in germany she turned sideways in her seat the better to see me as she continued speaking i have this friend an engineer who tells me that theyre building an autobahn right across the polish corridor and that one is projected across czechoslovakia now why else would that be but to move an army about i cleared my throat before answering it gave me a couple more seconds to think about it i cant see the autobahns are of much military value and there are none west of the rhine towards france anyway on a long straight stretch of road a convoy of trucks makes an easy target for an air attack this last remark drew a short mocking laugh from my companion thats precisely why theyre building up the luftwaffe to protect the convoys i shrugged maybe but if youre looking for the real reason why hitler has built these roads then its much more simple its an easy way of cutting the unemployment figures a man receiving state relief risks losing it if he refuses the offer of a job on the autobahns so he takes it who knows that may be what happened to bock you should take a look at wedding and neukolln sometime she said referring to berlins remaining strongholds of k p d sympathy well of course there are those who know all about the rotten pay and conditions on the autobahns i suppose a lot of them think that its better not to sign on for relief at all rather than risk being sent to work on the roads we were coming into potsdam on the neue königstrasse potsdam a shrine where the older residents of the town light the candles to the glorious bygone days of the fatherland and to their youth the silent discarded shell of imperial prussia more frenchlooking than german its a museum of a place where the old ways of speech and sentiment are reverently preserved where conservatism is absolute and where the windows are as well polished as the glass on the pictures of the kaiser a couple of kilometres down the road to lehnin the picturesque gave way abruptly to the chaotic where once had been some of the most beautiful countryside outside berlin there was now the earthmoving machinery and the torn brown valley that was the half built lehninbrandenburg stretch of autobahn closer to brandenburg at a collection of wooden huts and idle excavating equipment i pulled up and asked a worker to direct me to the foremans hut he pointed at a man standing only a few metres away if you want him thats the foreman there i thanked him and parked the car we got out the foreman was a stocky redfaced man of medium height and with a belly that was bigger than a woman who has reached the full term of her pregnancy it hung over the edge of his trousers like a climbers rucksack he turned to face us as we approached and almost as if he had been preparing to square up to me he hitched up his trousers wiped his stubbly jaw with the back of his shovelsized hand and transferred most of his weight on to his back foot hallo there i called before we were quite next to him are you the foreman he said nothing my name is gunther bernhard gunther im a private investigator and this is my assistant fräulein inge lorenz i handed him my identification the foreman nodded at inge and then returned his gaze back to my licence there was a literalness about his conduct that seemed almost simian peter welser he said what can i do for you people id like to speak to herr bock im hoping he can help us were looking for a missing person welser chuckled and hitched up his trousers again christ thats a funny one he shook his head and then spat onto the earth this week alone ive had three workers disappear perhaps i should hire you to try and find them eh he laughed again was bock one of them good god no said welser hes a damn good worker exconvict trying to live an honest life i hope youre not going to spoil that for him herr welser i just want to ask him one or two questions not rubber him and take him back to tegel prison in my trunk is he here now yes hes here hes very probably in his hut ill take you over there we followed him to one of several long singlestorey wooden huts that had been built at the side of what had once been forest and was now destined to be the autobahn at the bottom of the hut steps the foreman turned and said theyre a bit roughandready these fellows maybe it would be better if the lady didnt come in you have to take these men as you find them some of them might not be dressed ill wait in the car bernie said inge i looked at her and shrugged apologetically before following welser up the steps he raised the wooden latch and we went through the door inside the walls and floor were painted a washedout shade of yellow against the walls were bunks for twelve workers three of them without mattresses and three of them occupied by men wearing just their underwear in the middle of the hut was a potbellied stove made of black castiron its stovepipe going straight through the ceiling and next to it a big wooden table at which four men were seated playing skat for a few pfennigs welser spoke to one of the card players this fellow is from berlin he explained hed like to ask you a few questions a solid slab of man with a head the size of a tree stump studied the palm of his big hand carefully looked up at the foreman and then suspiciously at me another man got up off his bunk and started to sweep the floor nonchalantly with a broom ive had better introductions in my time and i wasnt surprised to see that it didnt exactly put bock at his ease i was about to utter my own codicil to welsers inadequate reference when bock sprang out of his chair and my jaw blocking his exit was duly hooked aside not much of a punch but enough to set off a small steam kettle between my ears and knock me sideways a second or two later i heard a short dull clang like someone striking a tin tray with a soup ladle when i had recovered my senses i looked around and saw welser standing over bocks halfconscious body in his hand he held a coal shovel with which he had evidently struck the big mans head there was the scrape of chairs and table legs as bocks cardplaying friends jumped to their feet relax all of you yelled welser this fellow isnt a fucking bull hes a private investigator hes not come to arrest hans he just wants to ask him a few questions thats all hes looking for a missing person he pointed at one of the men in the skat game here you give me a hand with him then he looked at me you all right he said i nodded vaguely welser and the other man bent down and lifted bock from where he lay in the doorway i could see it wasnt easy the man looked heavy they sat him in a chair and waited for him to shake his head clear meanwhile the foreman told the rest of the men in the hut to go outside for ten minutes the men in the bunks didnt put up any resistance and i could see that welser was a man who was used to being obeyed and quickly when bock came round welser told him what he had told the rest of the hut i could have wished that he had done it at the beginning ill be outside if you need me said welser and pushing the last man from the hut he left the two of us alone if youre not a polyp then you must be one of reds boys bock spoke sideways out of his mouth and i saw that his tongue was several sizes too big for his mouth its tip remained buried in his cheek somewhere so that all i saw was the large pinkcoloured chew that was his tongues thickest part look im not a complete idiot he said more vehemently im not so stupid that id get killed to protect kurt i really have no idea where he is i took out my cigarette case and offered him one i lit us both in silence listen first off im not one of reds boys i really am a private investigator like the man said but ive got a sore jaw and unless you answer all my questions your name will be the one the boys up at the alex draw out of the hat to make the trip to the blade for canning the meat at pension tillessen bock stiffened in his chair and if you move from that chair so help me ill break your damned neck i drew up a chair and put one foot on its seat so that i could lean on my knee while looking at him you cant prove i was near the place he said i grinned at him oh cant i i took a long pull at my smoke and blew it in his face i said on your last little visit to tillessens joint you kindly left your payslip behind i found it in the incinerator next to the murder weapon thats how i managed to track you down here of course its not there now but i could easily put it back the police havent yet found the body but thats only because i havent had time to tell them that payslip puts you in an awkward situation next to the murder weapon its more than enough to send you to the block what do you want i sat down opposite him answers i said look friend if i ask you to name the capital of mongolia youd better give me an answer or ill have your fucking head for it do you understand he shrugged but well start with kurt mutschmann and what the two of you did when you came out of tegel bock sighed heavily and then nodded i got out first i decided to try and go straight this isnt much of a job but its a job i didnt want to go back in the cement i used to go back to berlin for the odd weekend see stay at tillessens bang hes a pimp or was sometimes he fixed me up with a bit of plum he tucked the cigarette into the corner of his mouth and rubbed the top of his head anyway a couple of months after i got out kurt finished his cement and went to stay with tillessen i went to see him and he told me that the ring were going to fix him up with his first bit of thieving well the same night i saw him red dieter and a couple of his boys turn up he more or less runs the ring you understand theyve got this older fellow with them and start working him over in the dining room i stayed out of the way in my room after a while red comes in and tells kurt that he wants him to do a safe and that he wants me to drive well neither of us was too happy about it me because id had enough of all that sort of thing and kurt because hes a professional he doesnt like violence mess you know he likes to take his time too not just go straight ahead and do a job without any real planning this safe did red dieter find out about it from the man in the dining room the man being beaten up bock nodded what happened then i decided that i wanted nothing to do with it so i went out through the window spent the night at the dosshouse on frobestrasse and came back here that fellow the one they had beaten up he was still alive when i left they were keeping him alive until they found out if he had told them the truth he took the cigarette stub out of his mouth and dropped it on the wooden floor grinding it under his heel i gave him another well the next thing i hear is that the job went wrong tillessen did the driving apparently afterwards reds boys killed him they would have killed kurt too only he got away did they doublecross red nobodys that stupid youre singing arent you when i was in the cement in tegel i saw lots of men die on that guillotine he said quietly id rather take my chances with red when i go i want to go in one piece tell me more about the job just crack a nut said red easy to a man like kurt hes a real professional could open hitlers heart the job was middle of the night puzzle the safe and take some papers thats all no diamonds diamonds he never said nothing about no bells are you sure of that course im sure he was just to claw the papers nothing else what were these papers do you know bock shook his head just papers what about the killings nobody mentioned killings kurt wouldnt have agreed to do the job if he thought he was going to have to can anyone he wasnt that kind of fellow what about tillessen was he the type to shoot people in their beds not a chance that wasnt his style at all tillessen was just a fucking garterhandler beating up snappers was all he was good for show him a lighter and hed have been off like a rabbit maybe they got greedy and helped themselves to more than they were supposed to you tell me youre the fucking detective and you havent seen or heard from kurt since hes too smart to contact me if hes got any sense hell have done a uboat by now does he have any friends a few but i dont know who his wife left him so you can forget her she spent every pfennig he had earned and when shed finished she took off with another man hed die before hed ask that bitch for help perhaps hes dead already i suggested not kurt said bock his face set against the thought hes a clever one resourceful hell find a way out of it maybe i said and then one thing i cant figure is you going straight especially when you end up working here how much do you make a week bock shrugged about forty marks he caught the quiet surprise in my face it was even less than i had supposed not much is it so whats the deal why arent you breaking heads for red dieter who says i ever did you went inside for beating up steel pickets didnt you that was a mistake i needed the money who was paying it red and what was in it for him money same as me just more of it his sort never gets caught i worked that one out in the cement the worst of it is that now that ive decided to go straight it seems like the rest of the country has decided to go bent i go to prison and when i come out i find that the stupid bastards have elected a bunch of gangsters how do you like that well dont blame me friend i voted for the social democrats did you ever find out who was paying red to break the steel strikes hear any names maybe he shrugged the bosses i suppose doesnt take a detective to work that one out but i never heard any names but it was definitely organized oh yes it was organized all right whats more it worked they went back didnt they and you went to prison i got caught never have been very lucky you turning up here is proof of that i took out my wallet and thumbed a fifty at him he opened his mouth to thank me skip it i got to my feet and made for the hut door turning round i said was your kurt the type of puzzler to leave a nut hed cracked open bock folded the fifty and shook his head nobody was ever tidier round a job than kurt mutschmann i nodded thats what i thought youre going to have quite an eye in the morning said inge she took hold of my chin and turned my head to get a better look at the bruise on my cheekbone youd better let me put something on that she went into the bathroom we had stopped off at my apartment on our way back from brandenburg i heard her run the tap for a while and when she returned she pressed a cold flannel to my face as she stood there i felt her breath caress my ear and i inhaled deeply of the haze of perfume in which she moved this might help to stop the swelling she said thanks a jawwhistler looks bad for business on the other hand maybe theyll just think that im the determined type you know the kind who never lets up on a case hold still she said impatiently her belly brushed against me and i realized with some surprise that i had an erection she blinked quickly and i supposed that she had noticed it too but she did not step back instead almost involuntarily she brushed against me once more only with a greater pressure than before i lifted my hand and cradled her ample breast on my open palm after a minute or so of that i took her nipple in between my finger and thumb it wasnt difficult to find it was as hard as the lid on a teapot and just as big then she turned away perhaps we should stop now she said if youre intending to stop the swelling youre too late i told her her eyes passed lightly over me as i said it colouring a little she folded her arms across her breasts and flexed her long neck against her backbone enjoying the very deliberateness of my own actions i stepped close to her and looked slowly down from her face across her breasts and her belly over her thighs to the hem of the green cotton dress reaching down i caught hold of it our fingers brushed as she took the hem from me and held it at her waist where i had placed it then i knelt before her my eyes lingering on her underthings for long seconds before i reached up and slipped her knickers round her ankles she steadied herself with one hand on my shoulder and stepped out of them her long smooth thighs trembling slightly as she moved i looked up at the sight i had coveted and then beyond to a face that smiled and then vanished as the dress rose up over her head revealing her breasts her neck and then her head again which shook its cascade of shiny black hair like a bird fluttering the feathers on its wings she dropped the dress to the floor and stood before me naked but for her garterbelt her stockings and her shoes i sat back on my haunches and with an excitement that ached to be liberated i watched her slowly turn herself in front of me showing me the profile of her pubic hair and her erect nipples the long chute of her back and the two perfectly matched halves of her bottom and then once more the swell of her belly the dark pennant that seemed to prick the air with its own excitement and the smooth quivering shanks i picked her up and took her into the bedroom where we spent the rest of the afternoon caressing exploring and blissfully enjoying a feast of each others flesh the afternoon drifted lazily into evening with light sleep and tender words and when we rose from my bed having satisfied our lust we found our appetites the more ravenous i took her to dinner at the peltzer grill and then dancing at the germania roof in nearby hardenbergstrasse the roof was crowded with berlins smartest set many of them in uniform inge looked around at the blue glass walls the ceiling illuminated with small blue stars and supported with columns of burnished copper and the ornamental pools with their waterlilies and smiled excitedly isnt this simply wonderful i didnt think that this was your sort of place i said lamely but she didnt hear me she was taking me by the hand and pulling me on to the less crowded of the two circular dancefloors it was a good band and i held her tight and breathed through her hair i was congratulating myself on bringing her here instead of one of the clubs with which i was better acquainted such as johnnys or the golden horseshoe then i remembered that neumann had said that the germania roof was one of red dieters chosen haunts so when inge went to the ladies room i called the waiter over to our table and handed him a five this gets me a couple of answers to a couple of simple questions right he shrugged and pocketed the cash is dieter helfferrich in the joint tonight red dieter what other colours are there he didnt get that so i left it he looked thoughtful for a moment as if wondering whether or not the ringleader of german strength would mind his being identified in this way he made the right decision yes hes here tonight anticipating my next question he nodded over his shoulder in the direction of the bar hes sitting in the booth furthest from the band he started to collect some empties from the table and lowering his voice added it doesnt do to ask too many questions about red dieter and thats for free just one more question i said whats his usual neckoil the waiter who had the lemonsucking look of a warm boy looked at me pityingly as if such a question hardly needed to be asked red drinks nothing but champagne the lower the life the fancier the taste eh send a bottle over to his table with my compliments i handed him my card and a note and keep the change if there is any he gave inge the onceover as she came back from the ladies room i didnt blame him and he wasnt the only one there was a man sitting at the bar who also seemed to find her worthy of attention we danced again and i watched the waiter deliver the bottle of champagne to red dieters table i couldnt see him in his seat but i saw my card being handed over and the waiter nodding in my direction look i said theres something that i have to do i wont be long but ill have to leave you for a short while if theres anything you want just ask the waiter she looked at me anxiously as i accompanied her back to the table but where are you going i have to see someone someone here ill only be a few minutes she smiled at me and said please be careful i bent forward and kissed her on the cheek like i was walking on a tightrope there was a touch of the fatty arbuckle about the solitary occupant of the end booth his fat neck rested on a couple of doughnutsized rolls pressed tight against the collar of his evening shirt the face was as red as a boiled ham and i wondered if this was the explanation behind the nickname red dieter helfferichs mouth was set at a tough angle like it ought to have been chewing on a big cigar when he spoke it was a mediumsized brown bear of a voice growling from the inside of a short cave and always on the edge of outrage when he grinned the mouth was a cross between earlymayan and high gothic a private investigator huh i never met one that just goes to show there arent enough of us around mind if i join you he glanced at the label on the bottle this is good champagne the least i can do is hear you out sit down he lifted his hand and looked at my card again for effect herr gunther he poured us both a glass and raised his own in a toast cowled under brows the size and shape of horizontal eiffel towers were eyes that were too wide for my comfort each revealing a broken pencil of an iris to absent friends he said i nodded and drank my champagne like kurt mutschmann perhaps absent but not forgotten he uttered a brash gloating laugh and sipped at his drink it would seem that wed both like to know where he is just to put our minds at rest of course to stop us worrying about him eh should we be worried i asked these are dangerous times for a man in kurts line of work well im sure i dont have to tell you that you know all about that dont you fleabite you being an exbull he nodded appreciatively ive got to hand it to your client fleabite it showed real intelligence involving you rather than your former colleagues all he wants is his bells back no questions asked you can get closer you can negotiate perhaps hell even pay a small reward eh youre very well informed i am if thats all your client wants and to that extent ill even help you if i can his face darkened but mutschmann hes mine if your fellow has got any misplaced ideas of revenge tell him to lay off thats my beat its simply a matter of good business practice is that all you want just to tidy up the store youre forgetting the small matter of von greiss papers arent you you remember the ones your boys were so anxious to talk to him about like where hed hidden them or who hed given them to what were you planning to do with the papers when you got them try a little firstclass blackmail people like my client maybe or did you want to put a few politicians in your pocket for a rainy day youre quite well informed yourself fleabite like i said your client is a clever man its lucky for me he took you into his confidence instead of the police lucky for me lucky for you because if you were a bull sitting there telling me what you just told me youd be on your way to being dead i leaned out of the booth to check that inge was all right i could see her shiny black head easily she was freezing off a uniformed reveller who was wasting his best lines thanks for the champagne fleabite you took a fairsized chance talking to me and you havent had much of a payout on your bet but at least youre walking away with your stakemoney he grinned well this time the thrill of playing was all i wanted the gangster seemed to find that funny there wont be another you can depend on it i moved to go but found him holding my arm i expected him to threaten me but instead he said listen id hate you to think that id cheated you dont ask me why but im going to do you a favour maybe because i like your nerve dont turn round but sitting at the bar is a big heavy fellow brown suit seaurchin haircut take a good look at him when you go back to your table hes a professional killer he followed you and the girl in here you must have stepped on someones corns it looks as though you must be this weeks rent money i doubt hell try anything in here out of respect for me you understand but outside fact is i dont much like cheap gunmen coming in here creates a bad impression thanks for the tip i appreciate it i lit a cigarette is there a back way out of here i wouldnt want my girl to get hurt he nodded through the kitchens and down the emergency stairs at the bottom theres a door that leads onto an alley its quiet there just a few parked cars one of them the lightgrey sports belongs to me he pushed a set of keys towards me theres a lighter in the glovebox if you need it just leave the keys in the exhaust pipe afterwards and make sure you dont mark the paintwork i pocketed the keys and stood up its been nice talking to you red funny things fleabites you dont notice one when youre first bitten but after a while theres nothing more irritating red dieter frowned get out of here gunther before i change my mind about you on the way back to inge i glanced over at the bar the man in the brown suit was easy enough to spot and i recognized him as the man who had been looking at inge earlier on at our table inge was finding it easy if not particularly pleasant to resist the negligible charm of a goodlooking but rather short s s officer i hurried inge to her feet and started to draw her away the officer held my arm i looked at his hand and then in his face slow down shorty i said looming over his diminutive figure like a frigate coming alongside of a fishing boat or ill decorate your lip and it wont be with a knights cross and oak leaves i pulled a crumpled fivemark note from out of a pocket and dropped it onto the tabletop i didnt think you were the jealous type she said as i moved her towards the door get into the lift and go straight down i told her when you get outside go to the car and wait for me theres a gun under the seat better keep it handy just in case i glanced over at the bar where the man was paying for his drink look i havent got time to explain now but its got nothing to do with our dashing little friend back there and where will you be she said i handed her my car keys im going out the other way theres a big man in a brown suit whos trying to kill me if you see him coming towards the car go home and phone kriminalinspektor bruno stahlecker at the alex got that she nodded for a moment i pretended to follow her and then turned abruptly away walking quickly through the kitchens and out of the fire door three flights down i heard footsteps behind me in the almost pitch dark of the stairwell as i scampered blindly down i wondered if i could take him but then i wasnt armed and he was what was more he was a professional i tripped and fell scrambling up again even as i hit the landing reaching out for the banister and wrenching myself down another flight ignoring the pain in my elbows and forearms with which i had broken my fall at the top of the last flight i saw a light underneath a door and jumped it was further than i thought but i landed well on all fours i hit the bar on the door and crashed out into the alley there were several cars all of them parked in a neat row but it wasnt difficult to spot red dieters grey bugatti royale i unlocked the door and opened the glovebox inside there were several small paper twists of white powder and a big revolver with a long barrel the sort that puts a window in an eightcentimetrethick mahogany door i didnt have time to check whether it was loaded but i didnt think that red was the sort who kept a gun because he liked playing cowboys and indians i dropped to the ground and rolled under the runningboard of the car parked next to the bugatti a big mercedes convertible at that moment my pursuer came through the fire door hugging the wellshadowed wall for cover i lay completely still waiting for him to step into the moonlit centre of the alley minutes passed with no sound or movement in the shadows and after a while i guessed that he had edged along the wall in the cover of the shadow until he was far enough away from the cars to cross the alley in safety before doubling back a heel scraped on a cobblestone behind me and i held my breath there was only my thumb which moved slowly and steadily pulling back the revolvers hammer with a scarcely audible click and then releasing the safety slowly i turned and looked down the length of my body i saw a pair of shoes standing squarely behind where i was lying framed neatly by the two rear wheels of the car the mans feet took him away to my right behind the bugatti and realizing that he was on to its halfopen door i slid in the opposite direction to my left and out from underneath the mercedes staying low beneath the level of the cars windows i went to the rear and peered around its enormous trunk a brownsuited figure crouched beside the rear tyre of the bugatti in almost exactly the same position as me but facing in the opposite direction he was no more than a couple of metres away i stepped quietly forward bringing the big revolver up to level it at arms length at the back of his hat drop it i said or ill put a tunnel through your goddamned head so help me god the man froze but the gun stayed put in his hand no problem friend he said releasing the handle of his automatic a mauser so that it dangled from his forefinger by the trigger guard mind if i put the catch on it this little babys got a hairtrigger the voice was slow and cool first pull the brim of your hat down over your face i said then put the catch on like you had your hand in a bag of sand remember at this range i can hardly miss and it would be too bad to mess up reds nice paintwork with your brains he tugged at his hat until it was well down over his eyes and after he had seen to the mausers safety catch he let the gun drop to the ground where it clattered harmlessly on the cobbles did red tell you i was following you shut up and turn around i told him and keep your hands in the air the brown suit turned and then dropped his head back onto his shoulders in an effort to see beyond the brim of his hat you going to kill me he said that depends on what on whether or not you tell me whos signing your expenses maybe we can make a deal i dont see that youve got much to trade i said either you talk or i fit you with an extra pair of nostrils its that simple he grinned you wouldnt shoot me in cold blood he said oh wouldnt i i poked the gun hard against his chin and then dragged the barrel up across the flesh of his face to screw it under his cheekbone dont be so sure youve got me in the mood to use this thing so youd better find your tongue now or youll never find it again but if i sing then what will you let me go and have you track me down again you must think im stupid what can i do to convince you that i wouldnt i stepped away from him and thought for a moment swear on your mothers life i swear on my mothers life he said readily enough fine so whos your client youll let me go if i tell you yes swear on your mothers life i swear on my mothers life all right then he said it was a fellow called haupthändler how much is he paying you three hundred now and he didnt finish the sentence stepping forward i knocked him cold with one blow of the revolvers butt it was a cruel blow delivered with sufficient power to render him insensible for a long time my mother is dead i said then i picked up his weapon and pocketing both guns i ran back to the car inges eyes widened when she saw the dirt and oil covering my suit my best suit the lifts not good enough for you what did you do jump down something like that i felt around under the drivers seat for the pair of handcuffs i kept next to my gun then i drove the seventy or so metres back to the alley the brown suit lay unconscious where i had dropped him i got out of the car and dragged him over to a wall a short way up the alley where i manacled him to some iron bars protecting a window he groaned a little as i moved him so i knew i hadnt killed him i went back to the bugatti and returned reds gun to the glovebox at the same time i helped myself to the small paper twists of white powder i didnt figure that red dieter was the type to keep cookingsalt in his glovebox but i sniffed a pinch anyway just enough to recognize cocaine there werent many of the twists not more than a hundred marks worth and it looked like they were for reds personal use i locked the car and slid the keys inside the exhaust like hed asked then i walked back to the brown suit and tucked a couple of the twists into his top pocket this should interest the boys at the alex i said short of killing him in cold blood i could think of no more certain way of ensuring that he wouldnt finish the job hed started deals were for people that met you with nothing more deadly in their right hand than a shot of schnapps the next morning it was drizzling a warm fine rain like the spray from a gardensprinkler i got up feeling sharp and rested and stood looking out of the windows i felt as full of life as a pack of sleddogs we got up and breakfasted on a pot of mexican mixture and a couple of cigarettes i think i was even whistling as i shaved she came into the bathroom and stood looking at me we seemed to be doing a lot of that considering that someone tried to kill you last night she said youre in a remarkably good frame of mind this morning i always say that theres nothing like a brush with the grim reaper to renew the taste for life i smiled at her and added that and a good woman you still havent told me why he did it because he was paid to i said by whom the man in the club i wiped my face and looked for missed stubble there wasnt any so i put down my razor do you remember yesterday morning that i telephoned sixs house and asked the butler to give both his master and haupthändler a message inge nodded yes you said to tell them that you were getting close i was hoping it would spook haupthändler into playing his hand well it did only rather more quickly than i had expected so you think he paid that man to kill you i know he did inge followed me into the bedroom where i put on a shirt and watched me as i fumbled with the cufflink on the arm that i had grazed and that she had bandaged you know i said last night posed just as many questions as it answered theres no logic to anything none at all its like trying to make up a jigsaw with not one but two sets of pieces there were two things stolen from the pfarrs safe some jewels and some papers but they dont seem to fit together at all and then there are the pieces which have a picture of a murder on them which cant be made to fit with those belonging to the theft inge blinked slowly like a clever cat and looked at me with the sort of expression that makes a man feel meschugge for not having thought of it first irritating to watch but when she spoke i realized just how stupid i really was perhaps there never was just one jigsaw she said perhaps youve been trying to put one together when there were two all along it took a moment or two to let that one sink all the way in helped at the end with the flat of my hand smacking against my forehead shit of course her remark had the force of revelation it wasnt one crime i was staring in the face trying to understand it was two we parked on nollendorfplatz in the shadow of the sbahn overhead a train thundered across the bridge with a noise that possessed the whole square it was loud but it wasnt enough to disturb the soot from the great factory chimneys of tempelhof and neukölln that caked thewalls of the buildings which ringed the square buildings which had seen many better days walking westwards into lowermiddleclass schoneberg we found the fivestorey block of apartments on nollendorfstrasse where marlene sahm lived and climbed up to the fourth floor the young man who opened the door to us was in uniform some special company of s a that i failed to recognize i asked him if fräulein sahm lived there and he replied that she did and that he was her brother and who are you i handed him my card and asked if i might speak to his sister he looked more than a little put out at the intrusion and i wondered if he had been lying when he said that she was his sister he ran his hand through a large head of strawcoloured hair and glanced back over his shoulder before standing aside my sister is having a liedown right now he explained but i will ask her if she wishes to speak with you herr gunther he closed the door behind us and tried to fix a more welcoming expression to his face broad and thicklipped the mouth was almost negroid it smiled broadly now but quite independently of the two cold blue eyes that flicked between inge and myself as if they had been following a tabletennis ball please wait here a moment when he left us alone in the hall inge pointed above the sideboard where there hung not one but three pictures of the führer she smiled doesnt look like theyre taking any chances as far as their loyalty is concerned didnt you know i said theyre on special offer at woolworths buy two dictators and you get one free sahm returned accompanied by his sister marlene a big handsome blonde with a drooping melancholic nose and an underhung jaw that lent her features a certain modesty but her neck was so muscular and welldefined as to appear almost inflexible and her bronzed forearm was that of an archer or a keen tennis player as she strode into the hallway i caught a glimpse of a wellmuscled calf that was the shape of an electric lightbulb she was built like a rococo fireplace they showed us into the modest little sitting room and with the exception of the brother who stood leaning against the doorway and looking generally suspicious of myself and inge we all sat down on a cheap brownleather suite behind the glass doors of a tall walnut cabinet were enough trophies for a couple of school prizegivings thats quite an impressive collection you have there i said awkwardly to no one in particular sometimes i think my smalltalk falls a couple of centimetres short yes it is said marlene with a disingenuous look that might have passed for modesty her brother had no such reserve if thats what it was my sister is an athlete but for an unfortunate injury she would be running for germany in the olympiad inge and i made sympathetic noises then marlene held up my card and read it again how can i help you herr gunther she said i sat back on the sofa and crossed my legs before launching into my patter ive been retained by the germania life assurance company to make some investigations concerning the death of paul pfarr and his wife anyone who knew them might help us to find out just what did happen and enable my client to make a speedy settlement yes said marlene with a long sigh yes of course i waited for her to say something before eventually i prompted her i believe you were herr pfarrs secretary at the ministry of the interior yes thats right i was she was giving no more away than a cardplayers eyeshade do you still work there yes she said with an indifferent sort of shrug i risked a glance at inge who merely raised a perfectly pencilled eyebrow at me by way of response does herr pfarrs department investigating corruption in the reich and the d a f still exist she examined the toes of her shoes for a second and then looked squarely at me for the first time since i had seen her who told you about that she said her tone was even but i could tell that she was taken aback i ignored her question trying to wrongfoot her do you think thats why he was killed because somebody didnt like him snooping and blowing the whistle on people i i have no idea why he was killed look here herr gunther i think have you ever heard of a man by the name of gerhard von greis hes a friend of the prime minister as well as being a blackmailer you know whatever it was that he passed on to your boss cost him his life i dont believe that she said and then checked herself i cant answer any of your questions but i kept on going what about pauls mistress eva or vera or whatever her name is any idea why she might be hiding who knows maybe shes dead too her eyes quivered like a cup and saucer in an express diningcar she gasped at me and stood up her hands clenched tightly at her sides please she said her eyes starting to well up with tears the brother shouldered himself away from the doorway and moved in front of me much in the manner of a referee stopping a boxingmatch thats quite enough herr gunther he said i see no reason why i should allow you to interrogate my sister in this fashion why not i asked standing up i bet she sees it all the time in the gestapo and a lot worse besides that all the same he said it seems quite clear to me that she does not wish to answer your questions strange i said i had come to much the same conclusion i took inge by the arm and moved towards the door but as we were leaving i turned and added im not on anyones side and the only thing im trying to get is the truth if you change your mind please dont hesitate to contact me i didnt get into this business to throw anyone to the wolves i never had you down as the chivalrous type inge said when we were outside again me i said now wait a minule i went to the don quixote school of detection i got a bplus in noble sentiment too bad you didnt get one for interrogation she said you know she got really rattled when you suggested that pfarrs mistress might be dead well what would you have me do pistolwhip it out of her i just meant that it was too bad she wouldnt talk thats all maybe she will change her mind i wouldnt bet on it i said if she does work for the gestapo then it stands to reason that shes not the sort who underlines verses in her bible and did you see those muscles i bet shes their best man with a whip or a rubber truncheon we picked up the car and drove east on bülowstrasse i pulled up outside viktoria park come on i said lets walk awhile i could do with some fresh air inge sniffed the air suspiciously it was heavy with the stink of the nearby schultheis brewery remind me never to let you buy me any perfume she said we walked up the hill to the picture market where what passed for berlins young artists offered their irreproachably arcadian work for sale inge was predictably contemptuous have you ever seen such absolute shit she snorted from all these pictures of the musclebound peasants binding corn and ploughing fields you would think we were living in a story by the brothers grimm i nodded slowly i liked it when she became animated on a subject even if her voice was too loud and her opinions of the sort that could have landed both of us in a k z who knows with a bit more time and patience she might have obliged me to reexamine my own rather matteroffact opinion of the value of art but as it was i had something else on my mind i took her by the arm and steered her to a collection of paintings depicting steeljawed stormtroopers that was arranged in front of an artist who looked anything but the aryan stereotype i spoke quietly ever since leaving the sahms apartment ive had the idea that we were being followed i said she looked around carefully there were a few people milling around but none that seemed especially interested in the two of us i doubt youll spot him i said not if hes good do you think its the gestapo she asked theyre not the only pack of dogs in this town i said but i guess thats where the smart money is theyre aware of my interest in this case and i wouldnt put it past them to let me do some of their legwork well what are we going to do her face looked anxious but i grinned back at her you know i always think that theres nothing thats quite as much fun as trying to shake off a tail especially if it might turn out to be the gestapo there were only two items in the morning mail and both had been delivered by hand away from grubers inquisitive hungrycat stare i opened them and found that the smaller of the two envelopes contained a solitary square of cardboard that was a ticket for the days olympic trackandfield events i turned it over and on the back were written the initials ms and oclock the larger envelope bore the seal of the air ministry and contained a transcript of calls that haupthändler and jeschonnek had made and received on their respective telephones during saturday which apart from the one i had made myself from haupthändlers apartment was none i threw the envelope and its contents into the wastepaper basket and sat down wondering if jeschonnek had already bought the necklace and just what i would do if i was obliged to follow haupthändler to tempelhof airport that same evening on the other hand if haupthändler had already disposed of the necklace i couldnt imagine that he would have been waiting for the monday evening flight to london just for the hell of it it seemed more likely that the deal involved foreign currency and that jeschonnek had needed the time to raise the money i made myself a coffee and waited for inge to arrive i glanced out of the window and seeing that the weather was dull i smiled as i imagined her glee at the prospect of another shower of rain falling upon the führers olympiad except that now i was going to get wet too what had she called it the most outrageous confidencetrick in the history of modern times i was searching in the cupboard for my old rubberized raincoat when she came through the door god i need a cigarette she said tossing her handbag onto a chair and helping herself from the box on my desk with some amusement she looked at my old coat and added are you planning to wear that thing yes fräulein muscles came through after all there was a ticket for todays games in the mail she wants me to meet her in the stadium at two inge looked out of the window youre right she laughed youll need the coat its going to come down by the bucket she sat down and put her feet up on my desk well ill just stay here on my own and mind the shop ill be back by four oclock at the latest i said then we have to go to the airport she frowned oh yes i was forgetting haupthändler is planning to fly to london tonight forgive me if i sound naive but exactly what are you going to do when you get there just walk up to him and whoever it is hes taking with him and ask them how much they got for the necklace maybe theyll just open their suitcases and let you take a look at all their cash right there in the middle of tempelhof nothing in real life is ever all that tidy there never are neat little clues that enable you to apprehend the crook with minutes to spare you sound almost sad about it she said i had one ace in the hole which i thought would make things a bit easier and the hole fell in is that it something like that the sound of footsteps in the outer office made me stop there was a knock at the door and a motorcyclist a corporal in the national socialist flying corps came in bearing a large buffcoloured envelope of the same sort as the one i had consigned earlier to the wastepaper basket the corporal clicked his heels and asked me if i was herr bernhard gunther i said that i was took the envelope from the corporals gauntleted hands and signed his receipt slip after which he gave the hitler salute and walked smartly out again i opened the air ministry envelope it contained several typewritten pages that made up the transcript of calls jeschonnek and haupthändler had made the previous day of the two jeschonnek the diamond dealer had been the busier speaking to various people regarding the illegal purchase of a large quantity of american dollars and british sterling bullseye i said reading the transcript of the last of jeschonneks calls this had been to haupthändler and of course it also showed up in the transcript of the other mans calls it was the piece of evidence i had been hoping for the evidence that turned theory into fact establishing a definite link between sixs private secretary and the diamond dealer better than that they discussed the time and place for a meeting well said inge unable to restrain her curiosity a moment longer i grinned at her my ace in the hole someone just dug it out theres a meet arranged between haupthändler and jeschonnek at an address in grünewald tonight at five jeschonneks going to be carrying a whole bagful of foreign currency thats a hell of an informant you have there she said frowning who is it hanussen the clairvoyant my man is more of an impresario i said he books the turns and this time anyway i get to watch the show and he just happens to have a few friendly stormtroopers on the staff to show you to the right seat is that it you wont like it if i start to scowl it will be heartburn all right i lit a cigarette mentally i tossed a coin and lost i would tell it to her straight you remember the dead man in the servicelift like i just found out i had leprosy she said shuddering visibly hermann goering hired me to try and find him i paused waiting for her comment and then shrugged under her bemused stare thats it i said he agreed to put a tap on a couple of telephones jeschonneks and haupthändlers i picked up the transcript and waved it in front of her face and this is the result amongst other things it means that i can now afford to tell his people where to find von greis inge said nothing i took a long angry drag at my cigarette and then stubbed it out like i was hammering a lectern let me tell you something you dont turn him down not if you want to finish your cigarette with both lips no i suppose not believe me hes not a client that i would have chosen his idea of a retainer is a thug with a machinepistol but why didnt you tell me about it bernie when goering takes someone like me into his confidence the table stakes are high i thought it was safer for you that you didnt know but now well i cant very well avoid it can i once again i brandished the transcript at her inge shook her head of course you couldnt refuse him i didnt mean to appear awkward its just that i was well a bit surprised and thank you for wanting to protect me bernie im just glad that you can tell someone about that poor man ill do it right now i said rienacker sounded tired and irritable when i called him i hope youve got something pushbelly he said because fat hermanns patience is worn thinner than the jam in a jewish bakers spongecake so if this is just a social call then im liable to come and visit you with some dogshit on my shoes whats the matter with you rienacker i said you having to share a slab in the morgue or something cut the cabbage gunther and get on with it all right keep your ears stiff i just found your boy and hes squeezed his last orange dead like atlantis youll find him piloting a servicelift in a deserted hotel on chamissoplatz just follow your nose and the papers theres a lot of burnt ash in the incinerator but thats about all any ideas on who killed him sorry i said but thats your job all i had to do was find our aristocratic friend and thats as far as it goes tell your boss hell be receiving my account in the post thanks a lot gunther said rienacker sounding less than pleased youve got i cut across him with a curt goodbye and hung up i left inge the keys to the car telling her to meet me in the street outside haupthändlers beach house at that afternoon i was intending to take the special sbahn to the reich sports field via the zoo station but first and so that i could be sure of not being followed i chose a particularly circuitous route to get to the station i walked quickly up königstrasse and caught a number two tram to spittel market where i strolled twice around the spindler brunnen fountain before getting onto the ubahn i rode one stop to friedrichstrasse where i left the ubahn and returned once more to street level during business hours friedrichstrasse has the densest traffic in berlin when the air tastes like pencil shavings dodging umbrellas and americans standing huddled over their baedekers and narrowly missing being run over by a rudesdorfer peppermint van i crossed tauberstrasse and jägerstrasse passing the kaiser hotel and the head office of the six steel works then continuing up towards unter den linden i squeezed between some traffic on französische strasse and on the corner of behrenstrasse ducked into the kaiser gallery this is an arcade of expensive shops of the sort that are much patronized by tourists and it leads onto unter den linden at a spot next to the hotel westminster where many of them stay if you are on foot it has always been a good place to shake a tail for good emerging on to unter den linden i crossed over the road and rode a cab to the zoo station where i caught the special train to the reich sports field the twostoreyhigh stadium looked smaller than i had expected and i wondered how all the people milling around its perimeter would ever fit in it was only after i had gone in that i realized that it was actually bigger on the inside than on the outside and this by virtue of an arena that was several metres below ground level i took my seat which was close to the edge of the cinder track and next to a matronly woman who smiled and nodded politely as i sat down the seat to my right which i imagined was to be occupied by marlene sahm was for the moment empty although it was already past two oclock just as i was looking at my watch the sky released the heaviest shower of the day and i was only too glad to share the matrons umbrella it was to be her good deed of the day she pointed to the west side of the stadium and handed me a small pair of binoculars that is where the führer will be sitting she said i thanked her and although i wasnt in the least bit interested i scanned a dais that was populated with several men in frockcoats and the ubiquitous complement of s s officers all of them getting as wet as i was inge would be pleased i thought of the führer himself there was no sign yesterday he didnt come until almost five oclock explained the matron although with weather as atrocious as this he could be forgiven for not coming at all she nodded down at my empty lap you dont have a programme would you care to know the order of events i said that i would but found to my embarrassment that she intended not to lend me her programme but to read it aloud the first events on the track this afternoon are the heats of the metre hurdles then we have the semifinals and final of the metres if youll allow me to say so i dont think the german has a chance against the american negro owens i saw him running yesterday and he was like a gazelle i was just about to start out on some unpatriotic remark about the socalled master race when marlene sahm sat down next to me so probably saving me from my own potentially treasonable mouth thank you for coming herr gunther and im sorry about yesterday it was rude of me you were only trying to help were you not certainly last night i couldnt sleep for thinking about what you said about and here she hesitated for a moment about eva paul pfarrs mistress she nodded is she a friend of yours not close friends you understand but friends yes and so early this morning i decided to put my trust in you i asked you to meet me here because im sure im being watched thats why im late too i had to make sure i gave them the slip the gestapo well i certainly dont mean the international olympic committee herr gunther i smiled at that and so did she no of course not i said quietly appreciating the way in which modesty giving way to impatience made her the more attractive beneath the terracottacoloured raincoat she was unbuttoning at the neck she wore a dress of dark blue cotton with a neckline that allowed me a view of the first few centimetres of a deep and wellsunburnt cleavage she started to fumble inside her capacious brownleather handbag so then she said nervously about paul after his death i had to answer a great many questions you know what about it was a stupid question but she didnt say so everything i think that at one stage they even got round to suggesting that i might be his mistress from out of the bag she produced a darkgreen desk diary and handed it to me but this i kept back its pauls desk diary or rather the one he kept himself his private one and not the official one that i kept for him the one that i gave to the gestapo i turned the diary over in my hands not presuming to open it six and now marlene it was odd the way people held things back from the police or maybe it wasnt it all depended on how well you knew the police why i said to protect eva then why didnt you simply destroy it safer for her and for you too i would have thought she frowned as she struggled to explain something she perhaps only half understood herself i suppose i thought that in the proper hands there might be something in it that would identify the murderer and what if it should turn out that your friend eva had something to do with it her eyes flashed and she spoke angrily i dont believe it for a second she said she wasnt capable of harming anyone pursing my lips i nodded circumspectly tell me about her all in good time herr gunther she said her mouth becoming compressed i didnt think marlene sahm was the type ever to be carried away by her passion or her tastes and i wondered whether the gestapo preferred to recruit this kind of woman or simply affected them that way first of all id like to make something clear to you be my guest after pauls death i myself made a few discreet inquiries as to evas whereabouts but without success but i shall come to that too before i tell you anything i want your word that if you manage to find her you will try to persuade her to give herself up if she is arrested by the gestapo it will go very badly for her this isnt a favour im asking you understand this is my price for providing you with the information to help your own investigation you have my word ill give her every chance i can but i have to tell you right now it looks as though she is in it up to her hatband i believe that shes planning to go abroad tonight so youd better start talking theres not much time for a moment marlene chewed her lip thoughtfully her eyes gazing emptily at the hurdlers as they came up to the starting line she remained oblivious of the buzz of excitement in the crowd that gave way to silence as the starter raised his pistol as he fired she began to tell me what she knew well for a start theres her name its not eva that was pauls name for her he was always doing that giving people new names he liked aryan names like siegfried and brünhilde evas real name was hannah hannah roedl but paul said that hannah was a jewish name and that he would always call her eva the crowd gave a great roar as the american won the first heat of the hurdles paul was unhappy with his wife but he never told me why he and i were good friends and he confided in me a great deal but i never heard him speak about his wife one night he took me to a gaming club and it was there that i ran across eva she was working there as a croupier i hadnt seen her in months we first met working for the revenue she was very good with figures i suppose thats why she became a croupier in the first place twice the pay and the chance to meet some interesting people i raised my eyebrows at that one i for one have never found the people who gamble in casinos to be anything less than dull but i said nothing not wishing to cut her thread anyway i introduced her to paul and you could see they were attracted paul was a handsome man and eva was just as goodlooking a real beauty a month later i met her again and she told me that she and paul were having an affair at first i was shocked and then i thought it was really none of my business for a while maybe as long as six months they were seeing quite a lot of each other and then paul was killed the diary should provide you with dates and all that sort of thing i opened the diary and turned to the date of pauls murder i read the entries written on the page according to this he had an appointment with her on the night of his death marlene said nothing i started to turn back the pages and heres another name i recognize i said gerhard von greis what do you know about him i lit a cigarette and added its time you told me all about your little department in the gestapo dont you think pauls department he was so proud of it you know she sighed profoundly a man of great integrity sure i said all the time he was with this other woman what he really wanted was to be back home with the wife in a funny way thats absolutely true herr gunther thats exactly what he wanted i dont think he ever stopped loving grete but for some reason he started hating her as well i shrugged well it takes all sorts maybe he just liked to wag his tail she stayed silent for a few minutes after that one and they ran the next heat of the hurdles much to the delight of the crowd the german runner nottbruch won the race the matron got very excited at that standing up in her seat and waving her programme marlene rummaged in her bag again and took out an envelope this is a copy of a letter originally empowering paul to set up his department she said handing it to me i thought you might like to see it it helps to put things in perspective to explain why paul did what he did i read the letter it went as follows the reichsführer ss and chief of the german police in the reich ministry of the interior okds gorv no berlin nw november unter den linden local tel trunk call express letter to hauptsturmführer doktor paul pfarr i write to you on a very serious matter i mean corruption amongst the servants of the reich one principle must apply public servants must be honest decent loyal and comradely to members of our own blood those individuals who offend against this principle who take so much as one mark will be punished without mercy i shall not stand idly by and watch the rot develop as you know i have already taken measures to root out corruption within the ranks of the s s and a number of dishonest men have been eliminated accordingly it is the will of the führer that you should be empowered to investigate and root out corruption in the german labour front where fraud is endemic to this end you are promoted to the rank of hauptsturmführer reporting directly to me wherever corruption forms we shall burn it out and at the end of the day we shall say that we performed this task in love of our people heil hitler signed heinrich himmler paul was very diligent marlene said arrests were made and the guilty punished eliminated i said quoting the reichsführer marlenes voice hardened they were enemies of the reich she said yes of course i waited for her to continue and seeing her rather unsure of me i added they had to be punished im not disagreeing with you please go on marlene nodded finally he turned his attention to the steel workers union and quite early on he became aware of certain rumours regarding his own fatherinlaw hermann six in the beginning he made light of it and then almost overnight he was determined to destroy him after a while it was nothing short of an obsession when was this i cant remember the date but i do remember that it was about the time that he started working late and not taking telephone calls from his wife and it wasnt long after that he started to see eva and exactly how was daddy six misbehaving corrupt d a f officials had deposited the steel workers union and welfare fund in sixs bank you mean he owns a bank as well a major shareholding in the deutsches kommerz in return six saw to it that these same officials were given cheap personal loans what did six get out of it by paying low interest on the deposit to the detriment of the workers the bank was able to improve the books nice and tidy then i said thats just the half of it she said with an outraged sort of chuckle paul also suspected that his fatherinlaw was skimming the unions funds and that he was churning the unions investments churning i said whats that repeatedly selling stocks and shares and buying others so that each time you can claim the legal percentages the commission if you like that would have been split between the bank and the union officials but trying to prove it was a different story she said paul tried to get a tap on sixs telephone but whoever it is that arranges these things refused paul said that somebody else was already tapping his phone and that they werent about to share so paul looked for another way to get to him he discovered that the prime minister had a confidential agent who had certain information that was compromising to six and for that matter to many others his name was gerhard von greis in sixs case goering was using this information to make him toe the economic line anyway paul arranged to meet von greis and offered him a lot of money to let him take a look at what he had on six but von greis refused paul said he was afraid she looked around as the crowd anticipating the semifinal of the metres grew more excited with the hurdles cleared off the track there were now several sprinters wanning up including the man the crowd had come to see jesse owens for a moment her attention was devoted entirely to the negro athlete isnt he superb she said owens i mean in a class of his own but paul did get hold of the papers didnt he she nodded paul was very determined she said distractedly at such times he could be quite ruthless you know i dont doubt it there is a department in the gestapo at prinz albrecht strasse which deals with associations clubs and the d a f paul persuaded them to issue a red tab on von greis so that he could be arrested immediately not only that but they saw to it that von greis was picked up by alarm command and taken to gestapo headquarters what is alarm command exactly i said killers she shook her head you wouldnt want to fall into their hands their brief was to scare von greis to scare him badly enough to convince him that himmler was more powerful than goering that he should fear the gestapo before he should fear the prime minister after all hadnt himmler taken control of the gestapo away from goering in the first place and then there was the case of goerings former chief of gestapo diels being sold down the river by his former master they said all of these things to von greis they told him that the same would happen to him and that his only chance was to cooperate otherwise he would find himself facing the displeasure of the reichsführer s s that would mean a k z for sure of course von greis was convinced what man in their hands would not have been he gave paul everything he had paul took possession of a number of documents which he spent several evenings examining at home and then he was killed and the documents were stolen yes do you know something of what was in these documents not in any detail i never saw them myself i only know what he told me he said that they proved beyond all shadow of a doubt that six was in bed with organized crime at the gun jesse owens was away to a good start and by the first thirty metres he was powering fluently into a clear lead in the seat next to me the matron was on her feet again she had been wrong i thought to describe owens as a gazelle watching the tall graceful negro accelerate down the track making a mockery of crackpot theories of aryan superiority i thought that owens was nothing so much as a man for whom other men were simply a painful embarrassment to run like that was the meaning of the earth and if ever there was a masterrace it was certainly not going to exclude someone like jesse owens his victory drew a tremendous cheer from the german crowd and i found it comforting that the only race they were shouting about was the one they had just seen perhaps i thought germany did not want to go to war after all i looked towards that part of the stadium that was reserved for hitler and other senior party officials to see if they were present to witness the depth of popular sentiment being demonstrated on behalf of the black american but of the leaders of the third reich there was still no sign i thanked marlene for coming and then left the stadium on the taxiride south towards the lakes i spared a thought for poor gerhard von greis picked up and terrified by the gestapo only to be released and almost immediately picked up tortured and killed by red dieters men now thats what i call unlucky we crossed wannsee bridge and drove along the coast a black sign at the head of the beach said no jews here which prompted the taxidriver to an observation thats a fucking laugh eh no jews here theres nobody here not with weather like this there isnt he uttered a derisive laugh for his own benefit opposite the swedish pavilion restaurant a few diehards still entertained hopes of the weather improving the taxidriver continued to pour scorn on them and the german weather as he turned into koblanck strasse and then down lindenstrasse i told him to pull up on the corner of hugovogel strasse it was a quiet wellordered and leafy suburb consisting of medium to largesized houses with neat front lawns and wellclipped hedges i spotted my car parked on the pavement but could see no sign of inge i looked around anxiously for her while i waited for my change feeling something was wrong i managed to overtip the driver who responded by asking me if i wanted him to wait i shook my head and then stepped back as he roared off down the road i walked down towards my car which was parked about thirty metres down the road from haupthändlers address i checked the door it wasnt locked so i sat inside and waited a while hoping that she might come back i put the desk diary that marlene sahm had given me inside the glovebox and then felt around under the seat for the gun i kept there putting it into my coat pocket i got out of the car the address i had was a dirtybrown twostorey affair with a rundown dilapidated look about it the paint was peeling from the closed shutters and there was a for sale sign in the garden the place looked as though it hadnt been occupied in a long time just the kind of place youd choose to hide out in a patchy lawn surrounded the house and a short wall separated it from the pavement on which a bright blue adler was parked facing downhill i stepped over the wall and went round the side stepping carefully over a rusting lawnmower and ducking under a tree near the back corner of the house i took out the walther and pulled back the slide to load the chamber and cock the weapon bent almost double i crept along beneath the level of the window to the back door which was slightly ajar from somewhere inside the bungalow i could hear the sound of muffled voices i pushed the door open with the muzzle of my gun and my eyes fell upon a trail of blood on the kitchen floor i walked quietly inside my stomach falling uncomfortably away beneath me like a coin dropped down a well worried that inge might have decided to take a look around on her own and been hurt or worse i took a deep breath and pressed the cold steel of the automatic against my cheek the chill of it ran through the whole of my face down the nape of my neck and into my soul i bent down in front of the kitchen door to look through the keyhole on the other side of the door was an empty uncarpeted hallway and several closed doors i turned the handle the voices were coming from a room at the front of the house and were clear enough for me to identify them as belonging to haupthändler and jeschonnek after a couple of minutes there was a womans voice too and for a moment i thought it was inges until i heard this woman laugh now that i was more impatient to know what had become of inge than i was to recover sixs stolen diamonds and collect the reward i decided that it was time i confronted the three of them id heard enough to indicate that they werent expecting any trouble but as i came through the door i fired a shot over their heads in case they were in the mood to try something stay exactly where you are i said feeling that id given them plenty of warning and thinking that only a fool would pull a gun now gert jeschonnek was just such a fool its difficult at the best of times to hit a moving target especially one thats shooting back my first concern was to stop him and i wasnt particular how i did it as it turned out i stopped him dead i could have wished not to have hit him in the head only i wasnt given the opportunity having succeeded in killing one man i now had the other to worry about because by this time haupthändler was on me and wrestling for my gun as we fell to the floor he yelled to the girl who was standing lamely by the fireplace to get the gun he meant the one which had fallen from jeschonneks hand when i blew his brains out but for a moment the girl wasnt sure which gun it was that she was supposed to go for mine or the one on the floor she hesitated long enough for her lover to repeat himself and in the same instant i broke free of his grasp and whipped the walther across his face it was a powerful backhand that had the followthrough of a matchwinning tennis stroke and it sent him sprawling unconscious against the wall i turned to see the girl picking up jeschonneks gun it was no time for chivalry but then i didnt want to shoot her either instead i stepped smartly forward and socked her on the jaw with jeschonneks gun safely in my coat pocket i bent down to take a look at him you didnt have to be an undertaker to see that he was dead there are neater ways of cleaning a mans ears than a mm bullet i fumbled a cigarette into my dry mouth and sat down at the table to wait for haupthändler and the girl to come round i pulled the smoke through clenched teeth kippering my lungs and hardly exhaling at all except in small nervous puffs i felt like someone was playing the guitar with my insides the room was barely furnished with only a threadbare sofa a table and a couple of chairs on the table lying on a square of felt was sixs necklace i threw the cigarette away and tugged the diamonds towards me the stones clacking together like a handful of marbles felt cold and heavy in my hand it was hard to imagine a woman wearing them they looked about as comfortable as a canteen of cutlery next to the table was a briefcase i picked it up and looked inside it was full of money dollars and sterling as i had expected and two fake passports in the names of a herr and frau rolf teichmüller the names that i had seen on the airtickets in haupthändlers apartment they were good fakes but not hard to obtain provided you knew someone at the passport office and were prepared to pay some big expenses i hadnt thought of it before but now it seemed that with all the jews who had been coming to jeschonnek to finance their escapes from germany a fakepassport service would have been a logical and highly profitable sideline the girl moaned and sat up cradling her jaw and sobbing quietly she went to help haupthändler as he himself twisted over on to his side she held him by the shoulders as he wiped his bloody nose and mouth i flicked her new passport open i dont know that you could have described her as marlene sahm had done as a beauty but certainly she was goodlooking in a wellbred intelligent sort of way not at all the cheap partygirl id had in mind when id been told that she was a croupier im sorry i had to sock you frau teichmüller i said or hannah or eva or whatever it is you or somebody else is calling you at the moment she glared at me with more than enough loathing to dry her eyes and mine besides youre not so smart she said i cant see why these two idiots thought it was necessary to have you put out of the way right now i should have thought it was obvious haupthändler spat on the floor and said so what happens now i shrugged that depends maybe we can figure out a story crime of passion or something like that ive got friends down at the alex perhaps i can get you a deal but first youve got to help me there was a woman working with me tall brown hair wellbuilt and wearing a black coat now theres some blood on the kitchen floor thats got me worried about her especially as she seems to be missing i dont suppose you would know anything about that would you eva snorted with laughter go to hell said haupthändler on the other hand i said deciding to scare them a little premeditated murder well thats a capital crime almost certain when theres a lot of money involved i saw a man beheaded once at lake ploetzen prison goelpl the state executioner even wears white gloves and a tailcoat to do the job thats rather a nice touch dont you think drop the gun if you dont mind herr gunther the voice in the doorway was patient but patronizing as if addressing a naughty child but i did as i was told i knew better than to argue with a machine pistol and a brief glance at his boxingglove of a face told me that he wouldnt hesitate to kill me if i so much as told a bad joke as he came into the room two other men both carrying lighters followed come on said the man with the machine pistol on your feet you two eva helped haupthändler to stand and face the wall you too gunther the wallpaper was cheap flock a bit too dark and sombre for my taste i stared hard at it for several minutes while i waited to be searched if you know who i am then you know im a private investigator these two are wanted for murder i didnt see the india rubber so much as hear it sweep through the air towards my head in the split second before i hit the floor and lost consciousness i told myself that i was getting tired of being knocked out glockenspiel and big bass drum what was that tune again little anna of tharau is the one i love no not so much a tune as a number tram to the schonhauser alice depot the bell clanged and the car shook as we raced through schillerstrasse pankow breite strasse the giant olympic bell in the great clocktower tolling to the opening and closing of the games herr starter millers pistol and the crowd yelling as joe louis sprinted up towards me and then put me on the deck for the second time in the round a fourengined junkers monoplane roaring through the night skies to croydon taking my scrambled brains away with it i heard myself say just drop me off at lake ploetzen my head throbbed like a hot dobermann i tried raising it from the floor of the car and found that my hands were handcuffed behind me but the sudden violent pain in my head made me oblivious to anything else but not moving my head again a hundred thousand jackboots goosestepping their way up unter den linden with a man pointing a microphone down at them to pick up the aweinspiring sound of an army crunching like an enormous great horse an airraid alarm a barrage being laid down on the enemy trenches to cover the advance just as we were going over the top a big one exploded right above our heads and blew us all off our feet cowering in a shellhole full of incinerated frogs with my head inside a grand piano my ears ringing as the hammers hit the strings i waited for the sound of battle to end groggy i felt myself being pulled out of the car and then half carried half dragged into a building the handcuffs were removed and i was sat down on a chair and held there so as to stop me falling off it a man smelling of carbolic and wearing a uniform went through my pockets as he pulled their linings inside out i felt the collar of my jacket sticky against my neck and when i touched it i found that it was blood from where i had been sapped after that someone took a quick look at my head and said that i was fit enough to answer a few questions although he might just as well have said i was ready to putt the shot they got me a coffee and a cigarette do you know where you are i had to stop myself from shaking my head before mumbling that i didnt youre at the königs weg kripo stelle in the grunewald i sipped some of my coffee and nodded slowly i am kriminalinspektor hingsen said the man and this is wachmeister wentz he jerked his head at the uniformed man standing beside him the one who smelt of carbolic perhaps youd care to tell us what happened if your lot hadnt hit me so hard i might find it easier to remember i heard myself croak the inspektor glanced at the sergeant who shrugged blankly we didnt hit you he said whats that i said we didnt hit you gingerly i touched the back of my head and then inspected the dried blood on my fingers ends i suppose i did this when i was brushing my hair is that it you tell us said the inspektor i heard myself sigh what is going on here i dont understand youve seen my id havent you yes said the inspektor look why dont you start at the beginning assume we know absolutely nothing i resisted the rather obvious temptation and started to explain as best as i was able im working on a case i said haupthändler and the girl are wanted for murder now wait a minute he said whos haupthändler i felt myself frown and tried harder to concentrate no i remember now theyre calling themselves the teichmüllers now haupthändler and eva had two new passports which jeschonnek organized the inspektor rocked on his heels at that now were getting somewhere gert jeschonnek the body we found right he turned to his sergeant who produced my walther ppk at the end of a piece of string from out of a paper bag is this your gun herr gunther said the sergeant yes yes i said tiredly its all right i killed him it was selfdefence he was going for his gun he was there to make a deal with haupthändler or teichmüller as hes now calling himself once again i saw the inspektor and the sergeant exchange that look i was starting to get worried tell us about this herr teichmüller said the sergeant haupthändler i said correcting him angrily you have got him havent you the inspektor pursed his lips and shook his head the girl eva what about her he folded his arms and looked at me squarely now look gunther dont give us the cold cabbage a neighbour reported hearing a shot we found you unconscious a dead body and two pistols each of them fired and a lot of foreign currency no teichmüllers no haupthändler no eva no diamonds he shook his head the inspektor a fat greasy wearylooking man with tobaccostained teeth sat down opposite me and offered me another cigarette he took one himself and lit us both in silence when he spoke again his voice sounded almost friendly you used to be a bull didnt you i nodded painfully i thought i recognized the name you were quite a good one too as i recall thanks i said so i dont have to tell you of all people how this looks from my side of the chargesheet bad eh worse than bad the inspektor rolled his cigarette between his lips for a moment and winced as the smoke stung his eyeballs want me to call you a lawyer thanks no but as long as youre in the mood to do an exbull a favour there is one thing you could do ive got an assistant inge lorenz perhaps you would telephone her and let her know im being held he gave me a pencil and paper and i wrote down three phone numbers the inspektor seemed a decent sort of fellow and i wanted to tell him that inge had gone missing after driving my car to wannsee but that would have meant them searching my car and finding marlene sahms diary which would undoubtedly have incriminated her maybe inge had been taken ill and had caught a cab somewhere knowing that id be along to pick up the car maybe what about friends on the force somebody up at the alex perhaps bruno stahlecker i said he can vouch that im kind to children and stray dogs but thats about it too bad i thought for a moment about the only thing that i could do was call the two gestapo thugs who had ransacked my office and throw them what id learned it was a fair bet theyd be very unhappy with me and i guessed that calling them would as likely win me an allexpenses trip to a k z as letting the local inspektor charge me with gert jeschonneks murder im not a gambling man but they were the only cards i had kriminalkommissar jost drew thoughtfully on his pipe its an interesting theory he said dietz stopped playing with his moustache for long enough to snort contemptuously jost looked at his inspektor for a moment and then at me but as you can see my colleague finds it somewhat improbable thats putting it lightly mulemouth muttered dietz since scaring my secretary and smashing my last good bottle he seemed to have got uglier jost was a tall asceticlooking man with a face that wore a stags permanently startled expression and a scrawny neck that stuck out of his shirt collar like a tortoise in a rented shell he allowed himself a little razorblade of a smile he was about to put his subordinate very firmly in his place but then theory is not his strong point he said hes a man of action arent you dietz dietz glowered back and the kommissars smile widened a fraction then he removed his glasses and began to clean them in such a way as might serve to remind anyone else in the interrogationroom that he regarded his own intellectualism as something superior to a vitality that was merely physical replacing his glasses he removed his pipe and gave way to a yawn that bordered on the effete thats not to say that men of action do not have a place in sipo but after all is said and done it is the men of thought who must make the decisions why do you suppose that the germania life assurance company did not see fit to inform us of the existence of this necklace the way he moved imperceptibly on to his question almost took me unawares perhaps nobody asked them i said hopefully there was a long silence but the place was gutted said dietz in an anxious sort of way normally the insurance company would have informed us why should they i said there hadnt been a claim but just to be neat they retained me in case there should be are you telling us that they knew that there was a valuable necklace in that safe said jost and yet were prepared not to pay out on it that they were prepared to withhold valuable evidence but did you think to ask them i repeated again come now gentlemen these are businessmen were talking about not the winter relief why should they be in such a hurry to get rid of their money that they press someone to make a claim and take several hundred thousand reichsmarks off their hands and who should they pay out to the next of kin surely said jost without knowing who had title and to what hardly i said after all there were other items of value in that safe which had nothing to do with the six family is that not so jost looked blank no kommissar i think your men were too busy worrying about the papers belonging to herr von greis to bother with finding out what else might have been in herr pfarrs safe dietz didnt like that one bit dont get smart with us mulemouth he said youre in no position to charge us with incompetence weve got enough to kick you all the way to the nearest k z jost pointed the stem of his pipe at me in that at least he is right gunther he said whatever our shortcomings were you are the man with his neck on the block he sucked on his pipe but it was empty he started to fill it again well check your story he said and ordered dietz to telephone the lufthansa desk at tempelhof to see if there was a reservation for the evening flight to london in the name of teichimiller when dietz said there was jost lit his pipe between puffs he said well then gunther youre free to leave dietz was beside himself although that was only to be expected but even the grunewald station inspektor seemed rather puzzled at the kommissars decision for my part i was as taken aback as either of them at this unexpected turn of events unsteadily i got to my feet waiting for jost to give dietz the nod that would have him knock me down again but he just sat there puffing his pipe and ignoring me i crossed the room to the door and turned the handle as i went out i saw that dietz had to look away for fear that he might lose control and disgrace himself in front of his superior of the few pleasures that were left to me that evening the prospect of dietzs rage was sweet indeed as i was leaving the station the desksergeant told me that there had been no reply from any of the telephone numbers that id given him outside in the street my relief at being released quickly gave way to anxiety for inge i was tired and i thought i probably needed a few stitches in my head but when i hailed a cab i found myself telling the driver to take me to where inge had parked my car in wannsee there was nothing in the car that gave any clue as to her whereabouts and the police car parked in front of hauptandlers beach house cancelled any hope i might have entertained of searching the place for some trace of her always supposing that she had gone inside all i could do was drive around wannsee awhile on the chance that i might see her my apartment seemed especially empty even with the radio and all the lights turned on i telephoned inges apartment in charlottenburg but there was no reply i called the office i even called müller on the morgenpost but he knew as little about inge lorenz who her friends were if she had any family and where they lived as it seemed i did myself i poured myself a massive brandy and drank it in one gulp hoping to anaesthetize myself against a new kind of discomfort i was feeling the kind that was deep in my gut worry i boiled up some water for a bath by the time it was ready id had another large one and was getting ready for my third the tub was hot enough to parboil an iguana but preoccupied with inge and what might have happened i hardly noticed preoccupation submitted to puzzlement as i tried to fathom why it was that jost had let me go on the strength of an interrogation lasting hardly as much as one hour nobody could have persuaded me that he believed everything that i had told him despite his pretence to being something of a criminologist i knew his reputation and it wasnt that of a latterday sherlock holmes from what i had heard of him jost had the imagination of a gelded carthorse it went against everything he believed in to release me on such a desultory piece of crosschecking as a phone call to the lufthansa desk at tempelhof i dried myself and went to bed for a while i lay awake rummaging through the illfitting drawers in the dilapidated cabinet of my head hoping that i might find something that would make things appear clearer to me i didnt find it and i didnt think i was going to but if inge had been lying next to me i might have told her that my guess was that i was free because jost had superiors who wanted von greiss papers at any cost even if that meant using a suspected doublemurderer to do it i would also have told her that i was in love with her i awoke feeling hollower than a dugout canoe and disappointed that i didnt have a bad hangover to occupy my day how do you like that i muttered to myself as i stood by my bed and squeezed my skull in search of a headache i suck the stuff up like a hole in the ground and i cant even get a decent tomcat in the kitchen i made myself a pot of coffee that you could have eaten with a knife and fork and then i had a wash i made a bad job of shaving slapping on some cologne i nearly passed out there was still no reply from inges apartment cursing myself and my socalled speciality in finding missing persons i called bruno at the alex and asked him to find out if the gestapo might have arrested her it seemed the most logical explanation when a lamb is missing from the flock theres no need to go hunting tiger if you live on the same mountain as a wolf pack bruno promised to ask around but i knew that it might take several days to find out something nevertheless i hung about my apartment for the rest of the morning in the hope that bruno or inge herself might call i did a lot of staring at the walls and the ceiling and i even got to thinking about the pfarr case again by lunchtime i was in the mood to start asking more questions it didnt take a brick wall to fall on me to realize that there was one man who could provide a lot of the answers this time the huge wroughtiron gates to sixs property were locked a length of chain had been wrapped and padlocked around the centre bars and the small keep out sign had been replaced with one that read keep out no trespassers it was as if six had suddenly grown more nervous about his own security i parked close to the wall and having put the gun from my bedsidedrawer in my pocket i got out of the car and climbed onto the roof the top of the wall was easily reached and i pulled myself up to sit astride the parapet an elm tree provided an easy climb down to ground level there was little or no growl that i could recall and i hardly heard the sound of the dogs paws as they galloped across the fallen leaves at the last second i heard a heavy panting breath which made the hair on the back of my neck stand up on end the dog was already leaping at my throat as i fired the shot sounded small beneath the trees almost too small to kill something as fierce as the dobermann even as it fell dead at my feet the wind was already bearing the noise away and in the opposite direction from the house i let out the breath that unconsciously i had held while firing and with my heart beating like a fork in a bowlful of eggwhite i turned instinctively remembering that there had been not one but two dogs for a second or two the leaves rustling in the trees overhead camouflaged the others low growl the dog came forward uncertainly appearing in the clearing between the trees and keeping its distance from me i stepped back as slowly it approached its dead brother and when it dipped its head to sniff at the others open wound i raised my gun once more in a sudden gust of wind i fired the dog yelped as the bullet kicked it off its feet for a moment or two it continued breathing and then it lay still pocketing the gun i moved into the trees and walked down the long slope in the direction of the house somewhere the peacock was calling and i had half a mind to shoot that too if it were unlucky enough to be stumbled upon killing was very much on my mind it is quite common in a homicide for the murderer to get warmed up for the main event by disposing of a few innocent victims such as the family pets along the way detection is all about chainmaking manufacturing links with paul pfarr von greis bock mutschmann red dieter helfferich and hermann six i had a length of something strong enough to put my weight on paul pfarr eva haupthandler and jeschonnek was shorter and altogether different it wasnt that i intended killing six it was just that if i was unsuccessful in obtaining a few straight answers then i hadnt ruled it out as a possibility so it was with some embarrassment then that with these thoughts passing through my mind i came across the millionaire himself standing under a great fir tree smoking a cigar and humming quietly oh its you he said quite unperturbed to see me turn up on his property with a gun in my hand i thought it was the groundsman youll want some money i suppose for a brief moment i didnt know what to say to him then i said i shot the dogs i put the gun back into my pocket did you yes i thought i heard a couple of shots if he felt any fear or irritation at this piece of information he did not show it youd better come up to the house he said and began to walk slowly towards the house with me following a short way behind when we got within sight of the house i saw lise rudels blue bmw parked outside and i wondered if i would see her but it was the presence on the lawn of a large marquee that prompted me to break the silence between us planning a party er yes a party its my wifes birthday just a few friends you know so soon after the funeral my tone was bitter and i saw that six had noticed it too as he walked along he searched first the sky and then the ground for an explanation well im not he began and then one cant one cannot mourn ones loss indefinitely life must go on recovering some of his composure he added i thought that it would be unfair to my wife to cancel her plans and of course we both have a position in society we mustnt forget that must we i said leading us up to the front door he said nothing and i wondered if he was going to call for help he pushed it open and we stepped into the hall no butler today i observed its his day off said six hardly daring to catch my eye but there is a maid if you would like some refreshment you must be quite warm after your little excitement which one i said thanks to you ive had several little excitements he smiled thinly the dogs i mean oh yes the dogs yes i am quite warm as it happens they were big dogs but im quite a shot even though i say so myself we went in to the library i enjoy shooting myself but only for sport i dont suppose ive ever shot anything bigger than a pheasant yesterday i shot a man i said thats my second one in as many weeks since i started to work for you herr six its become a bit of a habit with me you know he stood awkwardly in front of me his hands clasped behind his neck he cleared his throat and threw the cigar butt into the cold fireplace when eventually he spoke he sounded embarrassed as though he were about to dismiss an old and faithful servant who had been caught stealing you know im glad you came he said as it happens i was going to speak to schemm my lawyer this afternoon and arrange for you to be paid but since you are here i can write you a cheque and so saying he went over to his desk with such alacrity that i thought he might have a gun in the drawer id prefer cash if you dont mind he glanced up at my face and then down at my hand holding the butt of the automatic in my jacket pocket yes of course you would the drawer stayed shut he sat down in his chair and rolled back a corner of the rug to reveal a small safe sunk in the floor now thats a handy little nut you cant be too careful these days i said relishing my own lack of tact you cant even trust the banks can you i peered innocently across the desk fireproof is it sixs eyes narrowed youll forgive me but i seem to have lost my sense of humour he opened the safe and withdrew several packets of banknotes i believe we said five per cent would close our account you could try it i said as he placed eight of the packets on the desk then he closed the safe rolled back the carpet and pushed the money towards me theyre all hundreds im afraid i picked up one of the bundles and tore the paper wrapping off just as long as theyve got herr liebigs picture on them i said smiling thinly six stood up i dont think we need ever meet again herr gunther arent you forgetting something he began to look impatient i dont think so he said testily oh but im sure you are i put a cigarette in my mouth and struck a match bending my head towards the flame i took a couple of quick puffs and then dropped the match into the ashtray the necklace six remained silent but then you already have it back dont you i said or at least you know where it is and who has got it his nose wrinkled with distaste as if it detected a bad smell youre not going to be tiresome about this are you herr gunther i do hope not and what about those papers the evidence of your involvement with organized crime that von greis gave to your soninlaw or do you imagine that red dieter and his associates are going to persuade the teichmüllers to tell them where they are is that it ive never heard of a red dieter or sure you have six hes a crook just like you during the steel strikes he was the gangster you paid to intimidate your workers six laughed and lit his cigar a gangster he said really herr gunther your imagination is running away with you now if you dont mind youve been very handsomely paid so if you will please leave i would be most grateful im a very busy man and i have a lot of things to do i guess things are difficult without a secretary to help what if i were to tell you that the man calling himself teichmüller the one that reds thugs are probably beating the shit out of right now is really your private secretary hjalmar haupthändler that is ridiculous he said hjalmar is visiting some friends in frankfurt i shrugged its a simple matter to get reds boys to ask teichmüller what his real name is perhaps hes already told them but then teichmüller is the name on his new passport so they could be forgiven for not believing him he purchased it from the same man he was planning to sell the diamonds to one for him and one for the girl six sneered at me and does this girl have a real name too he said oh yes her name is hannah roedl although your soninlaw preferred to call her eva they were lovers at least they were until she murdered him thats a lie paul never had a mistress he was devoted to my grete come off it six what did you do to them that made him turn his back on her that made him hate you bad enough to want to put you behind bars i repeat they were devoted to each other i admit its possible that they might have become reconciled to each other not long before they were killed with the discovery that your daughter was pregnant six laughed and so pauls mistress decided to get her own back now you really are being ridiculous he said you call yourself a detective and you dont know that my daughter was physically incapable of having children i felt my jaw are you sure about that good god man do you think its something that i might have forgotten of course im sure i walked round sixs desk and looked at the photographs that were arranged there i picked one of them up and stared grimly at the woman in the picture i recognized her immediately it was the woman from the beach house at wannsee the woman i had socked the woman who i had thought was eva and was now calling herself frau teichmüller the woman who in all probability had killed her husband and his mistress it was sixs only daughter grete as a detective you have to expect to make mistakes but it is nothing short of humiliating to come face to face with evidence of your own stupidity and it is all the more galling when you discover that the evidence has been staring you in the face all along herr six this is going to sound crazy i know but i now believe that at least until yesterday afternoon your daughter was alive and preparing to fly to london with your private secretary sixs face darkened and for a moment i thought he was going to attack me what the hell are you babbling about now you bloody fool he roared what do you mean alive my daughter is dead and buried i suppose that she must have come home unexpectedly and found paul in bed with his bit of brush both of them drunk as cats grete shot them both and then realizing what she had done she telephoned the only person she felt she could turn to haupthändler he was in love with her he would have done anything for her and that included helping her to get away with murder six sat down heavily he was pale and trembling i dont believe it he said but it was clear that he was finding my explanation only too plausible i expect it was his idea to burn the bodies and make it look like it was your daughter who had died in bed with her husband and not his mistress he took gretes weddingring and put it on the other womans finger then he had the bright idea of taking the diamonds out of the safe and making it look like a burglary thats why he left the door open the diamonds were to stake their new life somewhere new lives and new identities but what haupthändler didnt know was that somebody had already been in the safe that evening and removed certain papers that were compromising to you this fellow was a real expert a puzzler not long out of prison a neat worker too not the sort to use explosives or do anything untidy like leave a safe door open as drunk as they were ill bet that paul and eva never even heard him one of reds boys of course red used to carry out all your dodgy little schemes didnt he while goerings man von greis had these documents things were merely inconvenient the prime minister is a pragmatist he could use the evidence of your previous criminality to ensure that you were useful to him and make you toe the partys economic line but when paul and the black angels got hold of them that was altogether more uncomfortable you knew that paul wanted to destroy you backed into a corner you had to do something so as usual you got red dieter to take care of it but later on with paul and the girl dead and the diamonds gone from the safe it looked to you as though reds man had been greedy and that hed taken more than he was supposed to not unreasonably you concluded that it was he who had killed your daughter and so you told red to put things right red managed to kill one of the two burglars the man who had driven the car but he missed the other the one who had opened the safe who therefore still had the papers and you assumed the diamonds thats where i came in because you couldnt be sure that it wasnt red himself who had doublecrossed you and so you probably didnt tell him about the diamonds just as you didnt tell the police six took the dead cigar from out of the corner of his mouth and laid it unsmoked on the ashtray he was starting to look very old i have to hand it to you i said your reasoning was perfect find the man with the diamonds and you would find the man with the documents and when you found out that helfferich hadnt hazed you you put him on my tail i led him to the man with the diamonds and you thought the documents too at this very moment your german strength associates are probably trying to persuade herr and frau teichmüller to tell them where mutschmann is hes the man who really has the documents and naturally they wont know what the hell hes talking about red wont like that hes not a very patient man and im sure i dont have to remind you of all people of what that means the steel magnate stared into space as if he had not heard one word i had said i grabbed the lapels of his jacket hauled him to his feet and slapped him hard did you hear what i said these murderers these torturers have your daughter his mouth went as slack as an empty douchebag i slapped it again weve got to stop them so wheres he got them i let him go and pushed him away from me on the river he said the grosse zug near schmöckwitz i picked up the telephone whats the number six swore its not on the phone he gasped oh christ what are we going to do well have to go there i said we could drive there but it would be quicker by boat six sprang round the desk ive got a slipper at a mooring close by we can drive there in five minutes stopping only to collect the boat keys and a can of petrol we took the bmw and drove to the shores of the lake the water was busier than on the previous day a stiff breeze had encouraged the presence of a large number of small yachts and their white sails covered the surface of the water like the wings of hundreds of moths i helped six remove the green tarpaulin from the boat and poured petrol into the tank while he connected the battery and started the engine the slipper roared into life at the third time of asking and the fivemetre polishedwood hull strained at the mooring ropes eager to be upriver i threw six the first line and having untied the second i stepped quickly into the boat beside him then he wrenched the wheel to one side punched the throttle lever and we jerked forwards it was a powerful boat and as fast as anything that even the riverpolice might have had we raced up the havel towards spandau six holding the white steeringwheel grimly oblivious to the effect that the slippers enormous wake was having on the other waterway craft it slapped against the hulls of boats moored under trees or beside small jetties bringing their irate owners out on deck to shake their fists and utter shouts that were lost in the noise of the slippers big engine we went east on to the spree i hope to god were not too late shouted six he had quite recovered his former vigour and stared resolutely ahead of him the man of action with only a slight frown on his face to give a clue to his anxiety im usually an excellent judge of a mans character he said as if by way of explanation but if its any consolation to you herr gunther im afraid i gravely underestimated you i had not expected you to be as doggedly inquisitive frankly i thought youd do precisely what you were told but then youre not the kind of man who takes kindly to be being told what to do are you when you get a cat to catch the mice in your kitchen you cant expect it to ignore the rats in the cellar i suppose not he said we continued east upriver past the tiergarten and museum island by the time we turned south towards treptower park and kopenick i had asked him what grudge his soninlaw had had against him to my surprise he showed no reluctance to answer my question nor did he affect the indignant rosetinted viewpoint that had characterized all his previous remarks concerning members of his family living and dead as wellacquainted with my personal affairs as you are herr gunther you probably dont need to be reminded that lise is my second wife i married my first wife lisa in and the following year she became pregnant unfortunately things went badly and our child was stillborn not only that but there was no possibility of her having another child in the same hospital was an unmarried girl who had given birth to a healthy child at about the same time she had no way of looking after it so my wife and i persuaded her to let us adopt her daughter that was grete we never told her she was adopted while my wife was alive but after she died grete discovered the truth and set about trying to trace her real mother by this time of course grete was married to paul and was devoted to him for his part paul was never worthy of her i suspect he was rather more keen on my family name and money than he was on my daughter but to everyone else they must have seemed like a perfectly happy couple well all that changed overnight when grete finally tracked down her real mother the woman was a gypsy from vienna working in a bierkeller on potsdamer platz if it was a shock to grete it was the end of the world to that little shit paul something called racial impurity whatever that amounts to gypsies running the jews a close second for unpopularity paul blamed me for not having informed grete earlier but when i first saw her i didnt see a gypsy child but a beautiful healthy baby and a young mother who was as keen as lisa and i that we should adopt her and give her the best in life not that it would have mattered if shed been a rabbis daughter wed still have taken her well you remember what it was like then herr gunther people didnt make distinctions like they do these days we were all just germans of course paul didnt see it that way all he could think of was the threat grete now posed to his career in the s s and the party he laughed bitterly we came to grünau home of the berlin regatta club on a large lake on the other side of some trees a metre olympic rowing course had been marked out above the noise of the slippers engine could be heard the sound of a brass band and a publicaddress system describing the afternoons events there was no reasoning with him naturally i lost my temper with him and called him and his beloved führer all sorts of names after that we were enemies there was nothing i could do for grete i watched his hate breaking her heart i urged her to leave him but she wouldnt she refused to believe that he wouldnt learn to love her again and so she stayed with him but meanwhile he set out to destroy you his own fatherinlaw thats right said six while all the time he sat there in the comfortable home that my money had provided for them if grete did kill him as you say then he certainly had it coming if she hadnt done it i might have been tempted to have arranged it myself how was he going to finish you i asked what evidence was there that was so compromising to you the slipper reached the junction of longer see and seddinsee six throttled back and steered the boat south in the direction of the hilly peninsula that was schmöckwitz clearly your curiosity knows no bounds herr gunther but im sorry to disappoint you i welcome your assistance but i see no reason why i should answer all your questions i shrugged i dont suppose it matters much now i said the grosse zug was an inn on one of the two islands between the marshes of kopenick and schmöckwitz less than a couple of hundred metres in length and no more than fifty wide the island was tightly packed with tall pine trees close to the waters edge there were more signs saying private and keep out than on a fandancers dressingroom door what is this place this is the summer headquarters of the german strength ring they use it for their more secret meetings you can see why of course its so out of the way he started to drive the boat round the island looking for somewhere to moor on the opposite side we found a small jetty to which were tied several boats up a short grassy slope was a cluster of neatly painted boathouses and beyond it the grosse zug inn itself i collected up a length of rope and jumped off the slipper on to the jetty six cut the engine wed best be careful how we approach the place he said joining me on the jetty and tying up the front of the boat some of these fellows are inclined to shoot first and ask questions later i know just how they feel i said we walked off the jetty and up the slope towards the boathouses excepting the other boats there was nothing to indicate that there was anyone else on the islet but closer to the boathouses two armed men emerged from behind an upturned boat their faces wore expressions that were cool enough to cope with me telling them that i was carrying bubonic plague its the sort of confidence that only a sawnoff can give you thats far enough said the taller of the two this is private property who are you and what are doing here he didnt lift the gun from his forearm where it was cradled like a sleeping baby but then he did not have to lift it very far to get off a shot six made the explanations its desperately important that i see red he thumped his fist into the palm of his hand as he spoke it made him seem rather melodramatic i thought my name is hermann six i can assure you gentlemen hell want to see me but please hurry they stood there shuffling uncertainly the boss always tells us if hes expecting anyone and he didnt say anything about you two despite that you can depend on it that therell be hell to pay if he finds out you turned us away shotgun looked at his partner who nodded and walked away towards the inn he said well wait here while we check it out wringing his hands nervously six called out after him please hurry its a matter of life or death shotgun grinned at that i guessed he was used to matters of life and death where his boss was concerned six produced a cigarette and fed it nervously into his mouth he snatched it out again without lighting it please he said to shotgun are you holding a couple on the island a man and a woman the the the teichmüllers i said shotguns grin disappeared under a whole pantomine of dumb i dont know nothing he said dully we kept looking anxiously at the inn it was a twostorey affair whitepainted with neat black shutters a windowbox full of geraniums and a high mansard roof as we watched smoke started to come out of the chimney and when the door finally opened i half expected an old woman to come out carrying a tray of gingerbread shotguns pitman beckoned us forward we moved indianfile through the door with shotgun bringing up the rear the two stumpy barrels gave me an itch in the back of my neck if you have ever seen someone shot with a sawnoff at close range you would know why there was a small hallway with a couple of hatstands only nobody had bothered to check his hat beyond that was a small room where somebody was playing the piano like he had a couple of fingers missing at the far end there was a round bar and some stools behind it were lots of sports trophies and i wondered who had won them and why the most murders in one year perhaps or the cleanest knockout with an india rubber i had a nominee for that award myself if i could find him but probably they had just bought them to make the place look more like what it was supposed to be the headquarters of an exconvicts welfare association shotguns partner grunted this way he said and led us towards a door beside the bar through the door the room was like an office a brass lamp hung from one of the beams on the ceiling there was a long walnut chaiselongue in the corner by the window and next to it a big bronze of a naked girl the sort that looks as though the model must have had a bad accident with a circular saw there was more art on the panelled walls but of the sort that normally you only find in the pages of midwives textbooks red dieter his black shirtsleeves rolled up and his collar off stood up from the greenleather sofa and flicked his cigarette into the fire glancing first at six and then at me he looked uncertain as to whether he ought to look welcoming or worried he didnt get time to make a choice six stepped forwards and caught him by the throat for gods sake what have you done with her from a corner of the room another man came to my assistance and each of us taking one of the old mans arms we pulled him off hold up hold up yelled red he straightened his jacket and tried to control his natural indignation then he glanced around his person as if to check that his dignity was still intact six continued to shout my daughter what have you done with my daughter the gangster frowned and looked quizzically at me whats he fucking talking about the two people your boys snatched from the beach house yesterday i said urgently what have you done with them look theres no time for an explanation now but the girl is his daughter he looked incredulous you mean shes not dead after all he said come on man i said red swore his face darkened like dying gaslight his lips quivering like he had just chewed on broken glass a thin blue vein stood off his square forehead like a piece of ivy on a brick wall he pointed at six keep him here he growled red shouldered his way through the men outside like an angry wrestler if this is one of your tricks gunther ill personally fillet your fucking nose im not that stupid but as it happens there is one thing thats puzzling me at the front door red stopped and glared at me his face was the colour of blood almost purple with rage and whats that i had a girl working with me name of inge lorenz she disappeared from the area of the beach house in wannsee not long before your boys tapped me on the head so why ask me youve already kidnapped two people so a third along the way might not be too much for your conscience to bear red almost spat in my face whats a fucking conscience then he said and carried on through the door outside the inn i hurried after him in the direction of one of the boathouses a man came out buttoning up his flies misinterpreting his bosss purposeful stride he grinned you come to give her one as well boss red drew level with the man looked blankly at him for a second and then punched him hard in the stomach shut your stupid mouth he roared and kicked his way through the boathouse door i stepped over the mans gasping body and followed him inside i saw a long rack on which were laid several eightoar boats and tied to it was a man stripped to the waist his head hung down and there were numerous burns on his neck and shoulders i guessed that it was haupthändler although as i came closer i could see that his face was so badly contused as to be unrecognizable two men stood idly by paying no attention to their captive they were both smoking cigarettes and one of them wore a set of brass knuckles wheres the fucking girl screamed red one of haupthandlers torturers jabbed a thumb across his shoulder next door with my brother hey boss said the other man this coat still wont talk do you want us to work on him some more leave the poor bastard alone he growled he knows nothing it was almost dark in the adjoining boathouse and it took several seconds for our eyes to become accustomed to the gloom franz where the fuck are you we heard a soft groan and the slap of flesh against flesh then we saw them an enormous figure of a man his trousers round his ankles bent over the silent and naked body of hermann sixs daughter tied face down over an upturned boat get away from her you big ugly bastard yelled red the man who was the size of a luggage locker made no move to obey the order not even when it was repeated at greater volume and at closer range eyes shut his shoebox of a head lying back on the parapet that was his shoulders his enormous penis squeezing in and out of grete pfarrs anus almost convulsively his knees bent like a man whose horse had escaped from underneath him franz stood his ground red punched him hard on the side of the head he might as well have been hitting a locomotive the very next second he pulled out a gun and almost casually blew his mans brains out franz dropped crosslegged to the ground a collapsing chimney of a man his head spurting a smokeplume of burgundy his still erect penis leaning to one side like the mainmast of a ship that has crashed onto the rocks red pushed the body to one side with the toe of his shoe as i started to untie grete several times he glanced awkwardly at the stripes that had been cut deep onto her buttocks and thighs with a short whip her skin was cold and she smelt strongly of semen there was no telling how many times she had been raped fuck look at the state of her groaned red shaking his head how can i let six see her like this lets hope shes alive i said taking off my coat and spreading it on the ground we laid her down and i pressed my ear to her naked breast there was a heartbeat but i guessed that she was in deep shock is she going to be all right red sounded naive like a schoolboy asking about his pet rabbit i looked up at him and saw that he was still holding the gun in his hand summoned by the shot several german strength men were standing awkwardly at the back of the boathouse i heard one of them say he killed franz and then another said there was no call to do it and i knew we were going to have trouble red knew it too he turned and faced them the girl is sixs daughter you all know six hes a rich and powerful man i told franz to leave her alone but he wouldnt listen she couldnt have taken any more hed have killed her shes only just alive now you didnt have to shoot franz said a voice yeah said another you could have slugged him what reds tone was incredulous his head was thicker than the oak on a nunnery door not now it isnt red bent down beside me with one eye on his men he murmured you got a lighter yes i said look we dont stand a chance in here nor does she weve got to get to a boat what about six i buttoned the coat over gretes naked body and gathered her up in my arms he can take his chances helfferich shook his head no ill go back for him wait for us on the jetty as long as you can if they start shooting then get the hell away and in case i dont i know nothing about your girl fleabite we walked slowly towards the door red leading the way his men stepped back sullenly to allow us through and once outside we separated and i walked back down the grassy slope to the jetty and to the boat i laid sixs daughter on the slippers back seat there was a rug in a locker and i took it out and put it over her still unconscious body i wondered whether if she came round i might have another chance to ask her about inge lorenz would haupthändler be any more cooperative i was just thinking about going back to get him when from the direction of the inn i heard several pistol shots i slipped the boats line started the engine and took the gun out of my pocket with my other hand i held onto the jetty to stop the boat drifting seconds later i heard another volley of shots and what sounded like a riveter working along the stern of the boat i rammed the throttle forwards and spun the wheel away from the jetty wincing with pain i glanced down at my hand imagining that i had been hit but instead i found an enormous splinter of wood from the jetty sticking out of the palm of my hand breaking off the largest part of it i turned and fired off the rest of my clip in the direction of the figures now appearing on the retreating jetty to my surprise they threw themselves on their bellies but behind me something heavier than a pistol had opened up it was only a warning burst but the big machinegun cut through the trees and the wood of the jetty like metallic rain drops sending up splinters chopping off branches and slicing through foliage looking to my front again i had just enough time to pull the throttle into reverse and steer away from the policelaunch then i cut the engine and instinctively raised my hands high above my head dropping my gun onto the floor of the boat as i did so it was then that i noticed the neat red castemark in the centre of gretes forehead from which a hairs breadth trickle of blood was now bisecting her lifeless features listening to the systematic destruction of another human spirit has a predictably lowering effect on ones own fibre i imagine that that was how it was intended to be the gestapo is nothing if not thoughtful they let you eavesdrop on anothers agony to soften you up on the inside and only then do they get to work on the outside there is nothing worse than a state of suspense about what is going to happen whether its waiting for the results of some tests at a hospital or the headsmans axe you just want to get it over with in my own small way it was a technique i had used myself at the alex when id let men suspects sweat themselves into a state where they were ready to tell you everything waiting for something lets your imagination step in to create your own private hell but i wondered what it was that they wanted from me did they want to know about six did they hope that i knew where the von greis papers were and what if they tortured me and i didnt know what they wanted me to tell them by the third or fourth day alone in my filthy cell i was beginning to wonder if my own suffering was to be an end in itself at other times i puzzled as to what had become of six and red helfferich who were arrested with me and of inge lorenz most of the time i just stared at the walls which were a kind of palimpsest for those previous unfortunates who had been its occupants oddly enough there was little or no abuse for the nazis more common were recriminations between the communists and the social democrats as to which of these two fallen women was responsible for allowing hitler to get elected in the first place the sozis blamed the pukers and the pukers blamed the sozis sleep did not come easily there was an evilsmelling pallet which i avoided on my first night of incarceration but as the days passed and the slopbucket became more malodorous i ceased to be so fastidious it was only on the fifth day when two s s guards came and hauled me out of my cell that i realized just how badly i smelled but it was nothing compared to their stink which is of death they frogmarched me through a long urinous passage to a lift and this took us up five floors to a quiet and wellcarpeted corridor which with its oakpanelled walls and gloomy portraits of the führer himmler canaris hindenburg and bismarck had the air of an exclusive gentlemans club we went through a double wooden door the height of a tram and into a large bright office where several stenographers were working they paid my filthy person no attention at all a young s s hauptsturmführer came round an ornate sort of desk to look disinterestedly at me whos this with a click of his heels one of the guards stood to attention and told the officer who i was wait there said the hauptsturmführer and walked over to a polished mahogany door on the other side of the room where he knocked and waited hearing a reply he poked his head round the door and said something then he turned and jerked his head at my guards who shoved me forwards it was a big plush office with a high ceiling and some expensive leather furniture and i saw that i wasnt going to get the routine gestapo chat over the kind of script that would have to involve the twin prompts of blackjack and brass knuckles not yet anyway they wouldnt risk spilling anything on the carpet at the far end of the office was a french window a set of bookshelves and a desk behind which sitting in comfortable armchairs were two s s officers these were tall sleek wellgroomed men with supercilious smiles hair the colour of tilsiter cheese and wellbehaved adams apples the taller of the pair spoke first to order the guards and their adjutant out of the room herr gunther please sit down he pointed to a chair in front of the desk i looked behind as the door shut and then shuffled forwards my hands in my pockets since they had taken away my shoelaces and braces at my arrest it was the only way i had of keeping my trousers up i hadnt met senior s s officers before and so i was not certain as to the rank of the two who faced me but i guessed that one was probably a colonel and the other the one who continued speaking was possibly a general neither one of them seemed to be any older than about thirtyfive smoke said the general he held out a box and then tossed me some matches i lit my cigarette and smoked it gratefully please help yourself if you want another thanks perhaps you would also like a drink i wouldnt say no to some champagne they both smiled simultaneously the second officer the colonel produced a bottle of schnapps and poured a glassful im afraid we dont run to anything so grand round here he said whatever youve got then the colonel stood up and brought me the drink i didnt waste any time with it i jerked it back cleaned my teeth and swallowed with every muscle in my neck and throat i felt the schnapps flush right the way down to my corns youd better give him another said the general he looks as though his nerves are a bit shaky i held out my glass for the refill my nerves are just fine i said nursing my glass i just like to drink part of the image eh and what image would that be why the private detective of course the shoddy little man in the barely furnished office who drinks like a suicide whos lost his nerve and who comes to the assistance of the beautiful but mysterious woman in black someone in the s s perhaps i suggested he smiled you might not believe it he said but i have a passion for detective stories it must be interesting his face was of an unusual construction its central feature was its protruding hawklike nose which had the effect of making the chin seem weak above the thin nose were glassy blue eyes set rather too close together and slightly slanting which lent him an apparently worldweary cynical air im sure that fairystories are a lot more interesting but not in your case surely in particular the case you have been working on for the germania life assurance company for which the colonel chipped in we may now substitute the name of hermann six the same type as his superior he was betterlooking if apparently less intelligent the general glanced over a file that was open on the desk in front of him if only to indicate that they knew everything there was to know about me and my business precisely so he murmured after a short while he looked up at me and said why ever did you leave kripo coal i said he stared blankly at me coal yeah you know mouse gravel money speaking of which i had marks in my pockets when i checked into this hotel id like to know whats happened to it and to a girl who was working with me name of inge lorenz shes disappeared the general looked at his junior officer who shook his head im afraid we know nothing about any girl herr gunther said the colonel people are always disappearing in berlin you of all people should know that as to your money however that is quite safe with us for the moment thanks and i dont mean to sound ungrateful but id sooner leave it in a sock underneath my mattress the general put his long thin violinists hands together as if he was about to lead us in prayer and pressed their fingertips against his lips meditatively tell me did you ever consider joining the gestapo he said i figured it was my turn to try a little smile you know this wasnt a bad suit before i was obliged to sleep in it for a week i may smell a bit but not that badly he gave an amused sort of sniff the ability to talk as toughly as your fictional counterpart is one thing herr gunther he said being it is quite another your remarks demonstrate either an astonishing lack of appreciation as to the gravity of your situation or real courage he raised his thin goldleaf eyebrows and started to toy with the german horsemans badge on his left breastpocket by nature i am a cynical man i think that all policemen are dont you so normally i would be inclined to favour the first assessment of your bravado however in this particular case it suits me to believe in the strength of your character please do not disappoint me by saying something really stupid he paused for a moment im sending you to a k z my flesh turned as cold as a butchers shopwindow i finished what was left of my schnapps and then heard myself say listen if its about that lousy milk bill they both started grinning a lot enjoying my obvious discomfort dachau said the colonel i stubbed out my cigarette and lit another they saw my hand shake as i held the match up dont worry said the general youll be working for me he came round the desk and sat on its edge in front of me and who are you i am obergruppenführer heydrich he waved his arm at the colonel and folded his arms and this is standartenführer sohst of alarm command pleased to meet you im sure i wasnt alarm command were the special gestapo killers that marlene sahm had talked about ive had my eye on you for some time he said and after that unfortunate little incident at the beach house in wannsee i have had you under constant observation in the hope that you might lead us to certain papers im sure you know the ones i mean instead you gave us the next best thing the man who planned their theft over the past few days while youve been our guest weve been checking your story it was the autobahn worker bock who told us where to look for this kurt mutschmann fellow the safecracker who now has the papers bock i shook my head i dont believe it he wasnt the sort to turn informer about a friend its quite true i can assure you oh i dont mean he told us exactly where to find him but he put us on the right track before he died you tortured him yes he told us that mutschmann had once told him that if he were ever really wanted so that he was desperate then he should probably think of hiding in a prison or a k z well of course with a gang of criminals looking for him not to mention ourselves then desperate is exactly what he must have been its an old trick explained sohst you avoid arrest for one thing by having yourself arrested for another we believe that mustchmann was arrested and sent to dachau three nights after the death of paul pfarr said heydrich with a thin smug smile he added indeed he was almost begging to be arrested it seems that he was caught redhanded painting k p d slogans on the wall of a kripo stelle in neukölln a k z isnt so bad if youre a kozi chuckled sohst in comparison with the jews and the queers hell probably be out in a couple of years i shook my head i dont understand i told them why dont you simply have the commandant at dachau question mutschmann what the hell do you need me for heydrich folded his arms and swung his jackbooted leg so that his toe was almost kicking my kneecap involving the commandant at dachau would also mean having to inform himmler which i dont want to do you see the reichsführer is an idealist he would undoubtedly see it as his duty to use these papers to punish those he perceived to be guilty of crimes against the reich i recalled himmlers letter to paul pfarr which marlene sahm had shown me at the olympic stadium and nodded i on the other hand am a pragmatist and would prefer to use the papers in a rather more tactical way as and where i require in other words youre not above a bit of blackmail yourself am i right heydrich smiled thinly you see through me so easily herr gunther but you must understand that this is to be an undercover operation strictly a matter for security on no account should you mention this conversation to anyone but there must be somebody among the s s at dachau that you can trust of course there is said heydrich but what do you expect him to do march up to mustchmann and ask him where he has hidden the papers come now herr gunther be sensible so you want me to find mustchmann and get to know him precisely so build his trust find out where hes hidden the papers and having done so you will identify yourself to my man but how will i recognize mutschmann the only photograph is the one on his prison record said sohst handing me a picture i looked at it carefully its three years old and his head will have been shaved of course so it doesnt help you much not only that but hes likely to be a great deal thinner a k z does tend to change a man there is however one thing that should help you to identify him he has a noticeable ganglion on his right wrist which he could hardly obliterate i handed back the photograph its not much to go on i said suppose i refuse you wont said heydrich brightly you see either way youre going to dachau the difference is that working for me youll be sure to get out again not to mention getting your money back i dont seem to have much choice heydrich grinned thats precisely the point he said you dont if you had a choice youd refuse anyone would which is why i cant send one of my own men that and the need for secrecy no herr gunther as an expoliceman im afraid you fit the bill perfectly you have everything to gain or to lose its really up to you ive taken better cases i said you must forget who you are now said sohst quickly we have arranged for you to have a new identity you are now willy krause and you are a blackmarketeer here are your new papers he handed me a new identity card theyd used my old police photograph there is one more thing said heydrich i regret that verisimilitude requires a certain amount of further attention to your appearance consistent with your having been arrested and interrogated its rare for a man to arrive at columbia haus without the odd bruise my men downstairs will take care of you in that respect for your own protection of course very thoughtful of you i said youll be held at columbia for a week and then transferred to dachau heydrich stood up may i wish you good luck i took hold of my trouser band and got to my feet remember this is a gestapo operation you must not discuss it with anyone heydrich turned and pressed a button to summon the guards just tell me this i said whats happened to six and helfferich and the rest of them i see no harm in telling you he said well then herr six is under housearrest he is not charged with anything as yet he is still too shocked at the resurrection and subsequent death of his daughter to answer any questions such a tragic case unfortunately herr haupthändler died in hospital the day before yesterday having never recovered consciousness as to the criminal known as red dieter helfferich he was beheaded at lake ploetzen at six oclock this morning and his entire gang sent to the k z at sachsenhausen he smiled sadly at me i doubt that any harm will come to herr six hes much too important a man to suffer any lasting damage because of what has happened so you can see of all the other leading players in this unfortunate affair you are the only one who is left alive it merely remains to be seen if you can conclude this case successfully not only as a matter of professional pride but also your personal survival the two guards marched me back to the elevator and then to my cell but only to beat me up i put up a struggle but weak from lack of decent food and proper sleep i was unable to put up more than a token resistance i might have managed one of them alone but together they were more than a match for me after that i was taken to the s s guardroom which was about the size of a meeting hall near the doublethick door sat a group of s s playing cards and drinking beer their pistols and blackjacks heaped on another table like so many toys confiscated by a strict schoolmaster facing the far wall and standing at attention in a line were about twenty prisoners whom i was ordered to join a young s s sturmann swaggered up and down its length shouting at some prisoners and booting many in the back or on the arse when an old man collapsed onto the stone floor the sturmann booted him into unconsciousness and all the time new prisoners were joining the line after an hour there must have been at least a hundred of us they marched us through a long corridor to a cobbled courtyard where we were loaded into green minnas no s s men came with us inside the vans but nobody said much each sat quietly alone with his own thoughts of home and loved ones whom he might never see again when we got to columbia haus we climbed out of the vans the sound of an aeroplane could be heard taking off from nearby tempelhof flying field and as it passed over the trojangrey walls of the old military prison to a man we all glanced wistfully up into the sky each of us wishing that he were among the planes passengers move you ugly bastards yelled a guard and with many kicks shoves and punches we were herded up to the first floor and paraded in five columns in front of a heavy wooden door a menagerie of warders paid us close and sadistic attention see that fucking door yelled the rottenführer his face twisted to one side with malice like a feeding shark in there we finish you as men for the rest of your days we put your balls in a vice see stops you getting homesick after all how can you want to go home to your wives and girlfriends if youve nothing left to go home with he roared with laughter and so did the menagerie some of whom dragged the first man kicking and screaming into the room and closed the door behind them i felt the other prisoners shake with fear but i guessed that this was the corporals idea of a joke and when eventually it came to my own turn i made a deliberate show of calm as they took me to the door once inside they took my name and address studied my file for several minutes and then having been abused for my supposed blackmarketeering i was beaten up again once in the main body of the prison i was taken painfully to my cell and on the way there i was surprised to hear a large choir of men singing if you still have a mother it was only later on that i discovered the reason for the choirs existence its performances were made at the behest of the s s to drown out the screams from the punishment cellar where prisoners were beaten on the bare buttocks with wet sjamboks as an exbull ive seen the inside of quite a few prisons in my time tegel sonnenburg lake ploetzen brandenburg zellengefängnis brauweiler every one of them is a hard place with tough discipline but none of them came close to the brutality and dehumanizing squalor that was columbia haus and it wasnt long before i was wondering if dachau could be any worse there were approximately a thousand prisoners in columbia for some like me it was a shortstay transit prison on the way to a k z for others it was a longstay transit camp on the way to a k z quite a few were only ever to get out in a pine box as a newcomer on a short stay i had a cell to myself but since it was cold at night and there were no blankets i would have welcomed a little human warmth around me breakfast was coarse rye wholemeal bread and ersatz coffee dinner was bread and potato gruel the latrine was a ditch with a plank laid across it and you were obliged to shit in the company of nine other prisoners at any one time once a guard sawed through the plank and some of the prisoners ended up in the cesspit at columbia haus they appreciated a sense of humour i had been there for six days when one night at around midnight i was ordered to join a vanload of prisoners for transport to putlitzstrasse railway station and from there to dachau dachau is situated some fifteen kilometres northwest of munich someone on the train told me that it was the reichs first k z this seemed to me to be entirely appropriate given munichs reputation as the birthplace of national socialism built around the remains of an old explosives factory it stands anomalously near some farmland in pleasant bavarian countryside actually the countryside is all there is thats pleasant about bavaria the people certainly arent i felt sure that dachau wasnt about to disappoint me in this respect or in any other at columbia haus they said that dachau was the model for all later camps that there was even a special school there to train s s men to be more brutal they didnt lie we were helped out of the wagons with the usual boots and riflebutts and marched east to the camp entrance this was enclosed by a large guardhouse underneath which was a gate with the slogan work makes you free in the middle of the iron grillework the legend was the subject of some contemptuous mirth among the other prisoners but nobody dared say anything for fear of getting a kicking i could think of lots of things that made you free but work wasnt one of them after five minutes in dachau death seemed a better bet they marched us to an open square which was a kind of parade ground flanked to the south by a long building with a highpitched roof to the north and running between seemingly endless rows of prison huts was a wide straight road lined with tall poplar trees my heart sank as i began to appreciate the full magnitude of the task that lay before me dachau was huge it might take months even to find mutschmann let alone befriend him convincingly enough to learn where he had hidden the papers i was beginning to doubt whether the whole exercise simply wasnt the grossest piece of sadism on heydrichs part the k z commander came out of the long hut to welcome us like everybody in bavaria he had a lot to learn about hospitality mostly he had punishments on offer he said that there were more than enough good trees around to hang every one of us he finished by promising us hell and i didnt doubt that he would be as good as his word but at least there was fresh air thats one of the two things you can say for bavaria the other has something to do with the size of their womens breasts they had the quaintest little tailors shop at dachau and a barbers shop i found a nice offthepeg in stripes a pair of clogs and then had a haircut id have asked for some oil on it but that would have meant pouring it on the floor things started to look up when i got three blankets which was an improvement on columbia and was assigned to an aryan hut this was quarters for men jewish huts contained three times that number it was true what they said theres always somebody else who is worse off than you that is unless you were unfortunate enough to be jewish the jewish population in dachau was never large but in all respects jews were the worst off except maybe the questionable means of attaining freedom in an aryan hut the death rate was one per night in a jewish hut it was nearer seven or eight dachau was no place to be a jew generally the prisoners reflected the complete spectrum of opposition to the nazis not to mention those against whom the nazis were themselves implacably hostile there were sozis and kozis trade unionists judges lawyers doctors school teachers army officers republican soldiers from the spanish civil war jehovahs witnesses freemasons catholic priests gypsies jews spiritualists homosexuals vagrants thieves and murderers with the exception of some russians and a few former members of the austrian cabinet everyone in dachau was german i met a convict who was a jew he was also a homosexual and if that werent enough he was also a communist that made three triangles his luck hadnt so much run out as jumped on a fucking motorcycle twice a day we had to assemble at the appellplatz for parade and after rollcall came the hindenburg alms floggings they fastened the man or woman to a block and gave you an average of twentyfive on the bare arse i saw several shit themselves during a beating the first time i was ashamed for them but after that someone told me it was the best way you had of spoiling the concentration of the man wielding the whip parade was my best chance for looking at all the other prisoners i kept a mental log of those men i had eliminated and within a month i had succeeded in ruling out over men i never forget a face thats one of the things that makes you a good bull and one of the things that had prompted me to join the force in the first place only this time my life depended on it but always there were newcomers to upset my methodology i felt like hercules trying to clean the shit out of the aegean stables how do you describe the indescribable how can you talk about something that made you mute with horror there were many more articulate than me who were simply unable to find the words it is a silence born of shame for even the guiltless are guilty shorn of all human rights man reverts back to the animal the starving steal from the starving and personal survival is the only consideration which overrides even censors the experience work sufficient to destroy the human spirit was the aim of dachau with death the unlookedfor byproduct survival was through the vicarious suffering of others you were safe for a while when it was another man who was being beaten or lynched for a few days you might eat the ration of the man in the next cot after he had expired in his sleep to stay alive it is first necessary to die a little soon after my arrival at dachau i was put in charge of a jewish workcompany building a workshop on the northwestern corner of the compound this involved filling handcarts with rocks weighing anything up to thirty kilos and pushing them up the hill out of the quarry and to the building site a distance of several hundred metres not all the s s in dachau were bastards some of them were comparatively moderate and managed to make money by running small businesses on the side using the cheap labour and pool of skills that the k z provided so it was in their interest not to work the prisoners to death but the s s supervising the building site were real bastards mostly bavarian peasants formerly unemployed theirs was a less refined type of sadism than that which had been practised by their urban counterparts at columbia but it was just as effective mine was an easy job as company leader i was not required myself to shift the blocks of stone but for the jews working in my kommando it was backbreaking work all the way the s s were always setting deliberately tight schedules for the completion of a foundation or a wall and failure to meet the schedule meant no food or water those who collapsed through exhaustion were shot where they fell at first i took a hand myself and the guards found this hugely amusing and it was not as if the work grew any lighter as a result of my participation one of them said to me what are you a jewlover or something i dont get it you dont have to help them so why do you bother for a moment i had no answer then i said you dont get it thats why i have to bother he looked rather puzzled and then frowned for a moment i thought he was going to take offence but instead he just laughed and said well its your fucking funeral after a while i realized that he was right the heavy work was killing me just like it was killing the jews in my kommando and so i stopped feeling ashamed i helped a convict who had collapsed hiding him under a couple of empty handcarts until he had sufficiently recovered to continue working and i kept on doing it although i knew i was risking a flogging there were informers everywhere in dachau the other convicts warned me about them which seemed ironic since i was half way to being one myself i wasnt caught in the act of hiding a jew who had collapsed but they started questioning me about it so i had to assume id been fingered just like id been warned i was sentenced to twentyfive strokes i didnt dread the pain so much as i dreaded being sent to the camp hospital after my punishment since the majority of its patients were suffering from dysentery and typhoid it was a place to avoid at all costs even the s s never went there it would be easy i thought to catch something and get sick then i might never find mutschmann parade seldom lasted longer than one hour but on the morning of my punishment it was more like three they strapped me to the whipping frame and pulled down my trousers i tried to shit myself but the pain was so bad that i couldnt concentrate enough to do it not only that but there was nothing to shit when id collected my alms they untied me and for a moment i stood free of the frame before i fainted for a long time i stared at the mans hand which dangled over the edge of the cot above me it never moved not even a twitch of fingers and i wondered if he were dead feeling unaccountably impelled to get up and look at him i raised myself up off my stomach and yelled with pain my cry summoned a man to the side of my cot jesus i gasped feeling the sweat start out on my forehead it hurts worse now than it did out there thats the medicine im afraid the man was about forty rabbittoothed and with hair that hed probably borrowed from an old mattress he was terribly emaciated with the kind of body that looked as though it belonged properly in a jar of formaldehyde and there was a yellow star sewn to his prison jacket medicine there was a loud note of incredulity in my voice as i spoke yes drawled the jew sodium chloride and then more briskly common salt to you my friend ive covered your stripes with it good god i said im not a fucking omelette that may be so he said but i am a fucking doctor it stings like a condom full of nettles i know but its about the only thing i can prescribe that will stop the weals going septic his voice was round and fruity like a funny actors youre lucky you i can fix i wish i could say the same for the rest of these poor bastards unfortunately theres only so much that one can do with a dispensary thats been stolen from a cookhouse i looked up at the bunk above me and the wrist which dangled over the edge never had there been an occasion when i had looked upon human deformity with such pleasure it was a right wrist with a ganglion the doctor lifted it out of my sight and stood on my cot to check on its owner then he climbed down again and looked at my bare arse youll do he said i jerked my head upwards whats wrong with him why has he been giving you trouble no i just wondered tell me have you had jaundice yes good he said dont worry you wont catch it just dont kiss him or try to fuck him all the same ill see that hes moved onto another bunk in case he pisses on you transmission is through excretory products transmission i said of what hepatitis ill get them to put you on the top bunk and him on the bottom you can give him some water if he gets thirsty sure i said whats his name the doctor sighed wearily i really havent the faintest idea later on when with a considerable degree of discomfort i had been moved by the medical orderlies on to the bunk above and its previous occupant had been moved below i looked down over the edge of my pallet at the man who represented my only way out of dachau it was not an encouraging sight from my memory of the photograph in heydrichs office it would have been impossible to identify mutschmann but for the ganglion so yellow was his pallor and so wasted his body he lay shivering under his blanket delirious with fever occasionally groaning with pain as cramp racked his insides i watched him for a while and to my relief he recovered consciousness but only long enough to try unsuccessfully to vomit then he was away again it was clear to me that mutschmann was dying apart from the doctor whose name was mendelssohn and three or four medical orderlies who were themselves suffering from a variety of ailments there were about sixty men and women in the camp hospital as hospitals went it was little more than a charnelhouse i learned that there were only two kinds of patient the sick who always died and the injured who sometimes also got sick that evening before it grew dark mendelssohn came to inspect my stripes in the morning ill wash your back and put some more salt on he said then he glanced disinterestedly down below at mutschmann what about him i said it was a stupid question and only served to arouse the jews curiosity his eyes narrowed as he looked at me since you ask ive told him to keep off alcohol spicy food and to get plenty of rest he said drily i think i get the picture im not a callous man my friend but there is nothing i can do to help him with a highprotein diet vitamins glucose and methionine he might have had a chance how long has he got he still manages to recover consciousness from time to time i nodded mendelssohn sighed difficult to say but once coma has set in a matter of a day or so i dont even have any morphine to give him in this clinic death is the usual cure that is available to patients ill bear it in mind dont get sick my friend theres typhus here the minute you find yourself developing a fever take two spoonfuls of your own urine it does seem to work if i can find a clean spoon ill do just that thanks for the tip well heres another since youre in such a good mood the only reason that the camp committee meets here is because they know the guards wont come unless they absolutely have to contrary to outward appearances the ss are not stupid only a madman would stay here for any longer than he has to as soon as you can get about without too much pain my advice to you is to get yourself out of here what makes you stay hippocratic oath mendelssohn shrugged never heard of it he said i slept for a while i had meant to stay awake and watch mutschmann in case he came round again i suppose i was hoping for one of those touching little scenes that you see in the movies when the dying man is moved to unburden his soul to the man crouching over his deathbed when i awoke it was dark and above the sound of the other inmates of the hospital coughing and snoring i heard the unmistakeable sound coming from the cot underneath of mutschmann retching i leaned over and saw him in the moonlight leaning on one elbow clutching his stomach you all right i said sure he wheezed like a fucking galapagos tortoise im going to live for ever he groaned again and painfully through clenched teeth said its these damned stomach cramps would you like some water water yes my tongue is as dry as he was overcome by another fit of retching i climbed down gingerly and fetched the ladle from a bucket near the bed mutschmann his teeth chattering like a telegraph button drank the water noisily when hed finished he sighed and lay back thanks friend he said dont mention it i said youd do the same for me i heard him cough his way through what sounded like a chuckle no i fucking wouldnt he rasped id be afraid of catching something whatever it is that ive got i dont suppose you know do you i thought for a moment then i told him youve got hepatitis he was silent for a couple of minutes and i felt ashamed i ought to have spared him that agony thanks for being honest with me he said whats up with you hindenburg alms what for helped a jew in my work kommando that was stupid he said theyre all dead anyway risk it for someone whos got half a chance but not for a jew their luck is long gone well yours didnt exactly win the lottery he laughed true enough he said i never figured on going sick i thought i was going to get through this fuckhole i had a good job in the cobblers shop its a tough break i admitted im dying arent i he said thats not what the doc says no need to give me the cold cabbage i can see it in the lead but thanks anyway jesus id give anything for a nail me too i said even a roll up would do he paused then he said theres something ive got to tell you i tried to conceal the urgency that was crowding my voicebox yes whats that then dont fuck any of the women in this camp im pretty sure thats how i got sick no i wont thanks for telling me the next day i sold my food ration for some cigarettes and waited for mutschmann to come out of his delirium it lasted most of the day when eventually he regained consciousness he spoke to me as if our previous conversation had been only a few minutes earlier hows it going how are the stripes painful i said getting off my bunk ill bet that bastard sergeant with the whip really lays it on like fuck he inclined his emaciated face towards me and said you know it seems to me that ive seen you somewhere well now lets see i said the rot weiss tennis club the herrenklub the excelsior maybe youre putting me on i lit one of the cigarettes and put it between his lips ill bet it was at the opera im a big fan you know or perhaps it was at goerings wedding his thin yellow lips stretched into something like a smile then he breathed in the tobacco smoke as if it was pure oxygen you are a fucking magician he said savouring the cigarette i took it from his lips for a second before putting it back again no it wasnt any of those places itll come to me sure it will i said earnestly hoping that it wouldnt for a moment i thought of saying tegel prison but rejected it sick or not he might remember differently and then id be finished with him what are you sozi kozi blackmarketeer i said how about you the smile stretched so that it was almost a rictus im hiding here from whom everyone he said well you sure picked one hell of a hiding place what are you crazy nobody can find me here he said let me ask you something where would you hide a raindrop i looked puzzled until he answered under a waterfall in case you didnt know it thats chinese philosophy i mean youd never find it would you no i suppose not but you must have been desperate i said getting sick was just unlucky but for that id have been out in a year or so by which time theyd have given up looking who would i said what are they after you for his eyelids flickered and the cigarette fell from his unconscious lips and onto the blanket i drew it up to his chin and tapped out the cigarette in the hope that he might come round again for long enough to smoke the other half during the night mutschmanns breathing grew shallower and in the morning mendelssohn pronounced that he was on the edge of coma there was nothing that i could do but lie on my stomach and look down and wait i thought of inge a lot but mostly i thought about myself at dachau the funeral arrangements were simple they burned you in the crematorium and that was it end of story but as i watched the poisons work their dreadful effect on kurt mutschmann destroying his liver and his spleen so that his whole body was filled with infection mostly my thoughts were of my fatherland and its own equally appalling sickness it was only now in dachau that i was able to judge just how much germanys atrophy had become necrosis and as with poor mutschmann there wasnt going to be any morphine for when the pain grew worse there were a few children in dachau born to women imprisoned there some of them had never known any other life than the camp they played freely in the compound tolerated by all the guards and even liked by some and they could go almost anywhere with the exception of the hospital barrack the penalty for disobedience was a severe beating mendelssohn was hiding a child with a broken leg under one of the cots the boy had fallen while playing in the prison quarry and had been there for almost three days with his leg in a splint when the s s came for him he was so scared he swallowed his tongue and choked to death when the dead boys mother came to see him and had to be told the bad news mendelssohn was the very model of professional sympathy but later on when she had gone i heard him weeping quietly to himself hey up there i gave a start as i heard the voice below me it wasnt that id been asleep i just hadnt been watching mutschmann as i should have been now i had no idea of the invaluable period of time for which he had been conscious i climbed down carefully and knelt by his cot it was still too painful to sit on my backside he grinned terribly and gripped my arm i remembered he said oh yes i said hopefully and what did you remember where i seen your face i tried to appear unconcerned although my heart was thumping in my chest if he thought that i was a bull then i could forget it an exconvict never befriends a bull it could have been the two of us washed away on some desert island and he would still have spat in my face oh i said nonchalantly where was that then i put his halfsmoked cigarette between his lips and lit it you used to be the housedetective he croaked at the adlon i once cased the place to do a job he chuckled hoarsely am i right youve got a good memory i said lighting one myself that was quite some time ago his grip tightened dont worry he said i wont tell anyone anyway its not like you were a bull is it you said you were casing the place what particular line of criminality were you in i was a nutcracker i cant say as i recall the hotel safe ever being robbed i said at least not as long as i was working there thats because i didnt take anything he said proudly oh i opened it all right but there was nothing worth taking seriously ive only got your word for that i said there were always rich people at the hotel and they always had valuables it was very rare that there wasnt something in that safe its true he said just my bad luck there really was nothing that i could take that i could ever have got rid of thats the point you see theres no point in taking something you cant shift all right i believe you i said im not boasting he said i was the best there wasnt anything i couldnt crack here i bet youd expect me to be rich wouldnt you i shrugged perhaps id also expect you to be in prison which you are its because i am rich that im hiding here he said i told you that didnt i you mentioned something about that yes i took my time before i added and what have you got that makes you so rich and wanted money jewels he croaked another short laugh better than that he said power in what shape or form papers he said take my word for it theres an awful lot of people whod pay big money to get their hands on what ive got whats in these papers his breathing was shallower than a der junggeselle covergirl i dont know exactly he said names addresses information but youre a clever sort of fellow you could work it you havent got them here have you dont be stupid he wheezed theyre safe on the outside i took the dead cigarette from his mouth and threw it onto the floor then i gave him the rest of mine itd be a shame for it never to be used he said breathlessly youve been good to me so im going to do you a favour make em sweat wont you thisll be worth a lorry load of gravel to you on the outside i bent forwards to hear him speak pick em up by the nose his eyelids flickered i took him by the shoulders and tried to shake him back to consciousness back to life i knelt there by him for some time in the small corner of me that still felt things there was a terrible and terrifying sense of abandonment mutschmann had been younger than i was and strong too it wasnt too difficult to imagine myself succumbing to illness i had lost a lot of weight i had bad ringworms and my teeth felt loose in their gums heydrichs man s s oberschutze burger was in charge of the carpenters shop and i wondered what would happen to me if i went ahead and gave him the codeword that would get me out of dachau what would heydrich do to me when he discovered that i didnt know where von greiss papers were send me back have me executed and if i didnt blow the whistle would it even occur to him to assume that i had been unsuccessful and that he should get me out from my short meeting with heydrich and what little i had heard of him it seemed unlikely to have got so near and failed at the last was almost more than i could bear after a while i reached forwards and drew the blanket over mutschmanns yellow face a short stub of a pencil fell onto the floor and i looked at it for several seconds before a thought crossed my mind and a glint of hope once more shone in my heart i drew the blanket back from mutschmanns body the hands were tightly bunched into fists one after the other i prised them open in mutschmanns left hand was a piece of brown paper of the sort that the prisoners in the cobblers shop used to wrap shoe repairs for the s s guards in i was too afraid of there being nothing to open the paper immediately as it was the writing was almost illegible and it took me almost an hour to decipher the notes contents it said lost property office berlin traffic dept saarlandstr you lost briefcase sometime july on leipzigerstr made of plain brown hide with brass lock inkstain on handle gold initials km contains postcard from america western novel old surehand karl may and business papers thanks km it was perhaps the strangest ticket home that anyone ever had it seemed that there were uniforms everywhere even the newspapersellers were wearing s a caps and greatcoats there was no parade and certainly there was nothing jewish on unter den linden that could be boycotted perhaps it was only now after dachau that i fully realized the true strength of the grip that national socialism had on germany i was heading towards my office situated incongruously between the greek embassy and schultzes art shop and guarded by two stormtroopers i passed the ministry of the interior from which himmler had issued his memo to paul pfarr regarding corruption a car drew up outside the front door and from it emerged two officers and a uniformed girl whom i recognized as marlene sahm i stopped and started to say hallo and then thought better of it she passed me by without a glance if she recognized me she did a good job disguising it i turned and watched her as she followed the two men inside the building i dont suppose i was standing there for more than a couple of minutes but it was long enough for me to be challenged by a fat man with a low brimmed hat papers he said abruptly not even bothering to show a sipo pass or warrant disc says who the man pushed his porky poorly shaven face at me and hissed says me listen i said youre sadly mistaken if you think you are possessed of what is cutely known as a commanding personality so cut the shit and lets see some id a sipo pass flashed in front of my nose you boys are getting lazy i said producing my papers he snatched them away for examination what are you doing hanging around here hanging whos hanging i said i stopped to admire the architecture why were you looking at those officers who got out of the car i wasnt looking at the officers i said i was looking at the girl i love women in uniforms on your way he said tossing my papers back at me the average german seems to be able to tolerate the most offensive behaviour from anyone wearing a uniform or carrying some sort of official insignia in everything except that i consider myself to be a fairly typical german because i have to admit that i am naturally disposed to be obstructive to authority i suppose you would say that its an odd attitude for an expoliceman on königstrasse the collectors for the winter relief were out in force shaking their little red collectingboxes under everyones noses although november was only a few days old in the early days the relief had been intended to help overcome the effects of unemployment and the depression but now and almost universally it was regarded as nothing more than financial and psychological blackmail by the party the relief raised funds but just as importantly it created an emotional climate in which people were trained to do without for the sake of the fatherland each week the collection was the charge of a different organization and this week it was the railwaymen the only railwayman i ever liked was my former secretary dagmarrs father i had no sooner bitten my lip and handed over pfennigs to one of them than farther up the road i was solicited by another the small glass badge you got for contributing didnt so much protect you from further harassment as mark you out as a good prospect still it wasnt that which made me curse the man fat as only a railwayman can be and push him out of my way but the sight of dagmarr herself disappearing round the sacrificial column that stands outside the town hall hearing my hurried footsteps she turned and saw me before i reached her we stood awkwardly in front of the urnlike monument with its huge whitelettered motto which read sacrifice for the winter relief bernie she said hallo i said i was just thinking about you feeling rather awkward i touched her on the arm i was sorry to hear about johannes she gave me a brave smile and drew her brown wool coat closer about her neck youve lost a lot of weight bernie have you been ill its a long story have you got time for a coffee we went to the alexanderquelle on alexanderplatz where we ordered real mocha and real scones with real jam and real butter they say that goerings got a new process that makes butter from coal it doesnt look like hes eating any of it then i laughed politely and you cant buy an onion anywhere in berlin father reckons theyre using them to make poison gas for the japs to use against the chinese after a while i asked her if she was able to discuss johannes im afraid theres not really much to tell she said how did it happen all i know is that he was killed in an airraid on madrid one of his comrades came to tell me from the reich i received a oneline message which read your husband died for germanys honour in a pigs eye i thought she sipped her coffee then i had to go and see someone at the air ministry and sign a promise that i wouldnt talk about what had happened and that i wouldnt wear mourning can you imagine that bernie i couldnt even wear black for my own husband it was the only way i could get a pension she smiled bitterly and added you are nothing your nation is everything well they certainly mean it she took out her handkerchief and blew her nose never underestimate the national socialists when it comes to the pantheistic i said individuals are an irrelevance these days your own mother takes your disappearance for granted nobody cares nobody except me i thought for several weeks after my release from dachau the disappearance of inge lorenz was my only case but sometimes even bernie gunther draws a blank looking for someone in germany in the late autumn of was like trying to find something in a great desk drawer that had crashed to the floor the contents spilled and then replaced according to a new order so that things no longer came easily to hand or even seemed to belong in there gradually my sense of urgency was worn away by the indifference of others inges former colleagues on the newspaper shrugged and said that really they hadnt known her all that well neighbours shook their heads and suggested that one needed to be philosophical about such things otto her admirer at the d a f thought shed probably turn up before very long i couldnt blame any of them to lose another hair from a head thats already lost so many seems merely inconvenient sharing quiet lonely evenings with a friendly bottle i often tried to imagine what might have become of her a car accident some kind of amnesia perhaps an emotional or mental breakdown a crime she had committed which necessitated an immediate and permanent disappearance but always i was led back to abduction and murder and the idea that whatever had happened had been related to the case i had been working on even after two months had passed when you might normally have expected the gestapo to have admitted to something bruno stahlecker lately transferred out of the city to a little kripo station of no account in spreewald failed to come up with any record of inge having been executed or sent to a k z and no matter how many times i returned to haupthändlers house in wannsee in the hope that i might find something that would provide me with a clue to what had happened there never was anything until inges lease expired i often went back to her apartment looking for some secret things she had not seen fit to share with me meanwhile the memory of her grew more distant having no photograph i forgot her face and came to realize how little i had really known about her beyond rudimentary pieces of information there had always seemed to be so much time to find out all there was to know as the weeks turned into months i knew my chances of finding inge grew smaller as an almost arithmetically inverse proportion and as the trail grew colder so did hope i felt i knew that i would never see her again dagmarr ordered some more coffee and we talked about what each of us had been doing but i said nothing of inge or of my time in dachau there are some things that cant be discussed over morning coffee hows business she asked i bought myself a new car an opel you must be doing all right then what about you i asked how do you live im back home with my parents i do a lot of typing at home she said students theses that sort of thing she managed a smile father worries about me doing it you see i like to type at night and the sound of my typewriter has brought the gestapo round three times in as many weeks theyre on the lookout for people writing opposition newspapers luckily the sort of stuff that im churning out is so worshipful of national socialism that theyre easy to get rid of but father worries about the neighbours he says theyll start to believe that the gestapo is after us for something after a while i suggested that we go to see a film yes she said but i dont think i could stand one of those patriotic films outside the café we bought a newspaper on the front page there was a photograph of the two hermanns six and goering shaking hands goering was grinning broadly and six wasnt smiling at all it looked like the prime minister was going to have his way regarding the supply of raw materials for the german steel industry after all i turned up the entertainments section how about the scarlet empress at the tauenzienpalast i said dagmarr said that shed seen it twice what about this one she said the greatest passion with ilse rudel thats her new picture isnt it you like her dont you most men seem to i thought of the young actor walther kolb who ilse rudel had sent to do murder for her and had himself been killed by me the linedrawing on the newspaper advertisement showed her wearing a nuns veil even when i had discounted my personal knowledge of her i thought the characterization questionable but nothing surprises me now ive grown used to living in a world that is out of joint as if it has been struck by an enormous earthquake so that the roads are no longer flat nor the buildings straight yes i said shes all right we walked to the cinema the red der stürmer showcases were back on the street corners and if anything streichers paper seemed more rabid than ever the pale criminal to jane much about your good people moves me to disgust and it is not their evil i mean how i wish they possessed a madness through which they could perish like this pale criminal truly i wish their madness were called truth or loyalty or justice but they possess their virtue in order to live long and in a miserable ease nietzsche part one you tend to notice the strawberry tart in kranzlers café a lot more when your diet forbids you to have any well lately ive begun to feel much the same way about women only im not on a diet so much as simply finding myself ignored by the waitress there are so many pretty ones about too women i mean although i could as easily fuck a waitress as any other kind of female there was one woman a couple of years ago i was in love with her only she disappeared well that happens to a lot of people in this city but since then its just been casual affairs and now to see me on unter den linden head one way and then the other you would think that i was watching a hypnotists pendulum i dont know maybe its the heat this summer berlins as hot as a bakers armpit or maybe its just me turning forty and going a bit coochiecoo near babies whatever the reason my urge to procreate is nothing short of bestial which of course women see in your eyes and then leave you well alone despite that in the long hot summer of bestiality was callously enjoying something of an aryan renaissance friday august just like a fucking cuckoo what is bruno stahlecker looked up from his newspaper hitler who else my stomach sank as it sensed another of my partners profound analogies to do with the nazis yes of course i said firmly hoping that my show of total comprehension would deter him from a more detailed explanation but it was not to be no sooner has he got rid of the austrian fledgling from the european nest than the czechoslovakia one starts to look precarious he smacked the newspaper with the back of his hand have you seen this bernie german troop movements on the border of the sudetenland yes i guessed thats what you were talking about i picked up the morning mail and sitting down started to sort through it there were several cheques which helped to take the edge off my irritation with bruno it was hard to believe but clearly hed already had a drink normally a couple of stops away from being monosyllabic which i prefer being a shade taciturn myself booze always made bruno chattier than an italian waiter the odd thing is that the parents dont notice the cuckoo keeps throwing out the other chicks and the foster parents keep on feeding it maybe they hope that hell shut up and go away i said pointedly but brunos fur was too thick for him to notice i glanced over the contents of one of the letters and then read it again more slowly they just dont want to notice whats in the post hmm oh some cheques bless the day that brings a cheque anything else a letter the anonymous kind someone wants me to meet him in the reichstag at midnight does he say why claims to have information about an old case of mine a missing person that stayed missing sure i remember them like i remember dogs with tails very unusual are you going i shrugged lately ive been sleeping badly so why not you mean apart from the fact that its a burntout ruin and it isnt safe to go inside well for one it could be a trap someone might be trying to kill you maybe you sent it then he laughed uncomfortably perhaps i should come with you i could stay out of sight but within earshot or gunshot i shook my head if you want to kill a man you dont ask him to the sort of place where naturally hell be on his guard i tugged open the drawer of my desk to look at there wasnt much difference between the mauser and the walther but it was the mauser that i picked up the pitch of the grip the general fit of the pistol made it altogether more substantial than the slightly smaller walther and it lacked for nothing in stoppingpower like a fat cheque it was a gun that always endowed me with a feeling of quiet confidencs when i slipped it into my coat pocket i waved the gun in brunos direction and whoever sent me the party invitation will know im carrying a lighter supposing theres more than one of them shit bruno theres no need to paint the devil on the wall i can see the risks but thats the business were in newspapermen get bulletins soldiers get dispatches and detectives get anonymous letters if id wanted sealingwax on my mail id have become a damned lawyer bruno nodded tugged a little at his eyepatch and then transferred his nerves to his pipe the symbol of our partnerships failure i hate the paraphernalia of pipesmoking the tobaccopouch the cleaner the pocketknife and the special lighter pipesmokers are the grandmasters of fiddling and fidgeting and as great a blight on our world as a missionary landing on tahiti with a boxful of brassieres it wasnt brunos fault for in spite of his drinking and his irritating little habits he was still the good detective id rescued from the obscurity of an outoftheway posting to a kripo station in spreewald no it was me that was at fault i had discovered myself to be as temperamentally unsuited to partnership as i would have been to the presidency of the deutsche bank but looking at him i started to feel guilty remember what we used to say in the war if its got your name and address on it you can be sure itll be delivered i remember he said lighting his pipe and returning to his völkischer beobachter i watched him reading it with bemusement you could as well wait for the towncrier as get any real news out of that true but i like to read a paper in the morning even if it is a crock of shit ive got into the habit we were both silent for a moment or two theres another one of those advertisements in here rolf vogelmann private investigator missing persons a speciality never heard of him sure you have there was another ad in last fridays classified i read it out to you dont you remember he took his pipe out of his mouth and pointed the stem at me you know maybe we should advertise bernie why weve got all the business we can handle and more things have never been better so who needs the extra expense anyway its reputation that counts in this line of business not column inches in the partys newspaper this rolf vogelmann obviously doesnt know what the hell hes doing think of all the jewish business that we get none of our clients reads that kind of shit well if you dont think we need it bemie like a third nipple some people used to think that was a sign of luck and quite a few who thought it reason enough to burn you at the stake the devils mark eh he chuckled hey maybe hitlers got one just as surely as goebbels has a cloven hoof shit theyre all from hell every damn one of them i heard my footsteps ringing on a deserted königsplatz as i approached what was left of the reichstag building only fismarck standing on his plinth hand on sword in front of the western doorway his head turned towards me seemed prepared to offer some challenge to my being there but as i recalled he had never been much of an enthusiast for the german parliament had never even set foot in the place and so i doubted that hed have been much inclined to defend the institution on which his statue had perhaps symbolically turned its back not that there was much about this rather florid renaissancestyle building that looked worth fighting for now its facade blackened by smoke the reichstag looked like a volcano which had seen its last and most spectacular eruption but the fire had been more than merely the burnt offering of the republic it was also the clearest piece of pyromancy that germany could have been given as to what adolf hitler and his third nipple had in store for us i walked up to the north side and what had been portal v the public entrance through which i had walked once before with my mother more than thirty years ago i left my flashlight in my coat pocket a man with a torch in his hand at night needs only to paint a few coloured circles on his chest to make a better target of himself and anyway there was more than enough moonlight shining through what was left of the roof for me to see where i was going still as i stepped through the north vestibule into what had once been a waitingroom i worked the mausers slide noisily to let whoever was expecting me know that i was armed and in the eerie echoing silence it sounded louder than a troop of prussian cavalry you wont need that said a voice from the galleried floor above me all the same ill just hang on to it awhile there might be rats about the man laughed scornfully the rats left here a long time ago a torch beam shone in my face come on up gunther seems like i should know your voice i said starting up the stairs im the same way sometimes i recognize my voice but i just dont seem to know the man using it theres nothing unusual in that is there not these days i took out my flashlight and pointed it at the man i now saw retreating into the room ahead of me im interested to hear it id like to hear you say that sort of thing over at prinz albrecht strasse he laughed again so you do recognize me after all i caught up with him beside a great marble statue of the emperor wilhelm i that stood in the centre of a great octagonallyshaped hall where my torch finally picked out his features there was something cosmopolitan about these although he spoke with a berlin accent some might even have said that he looked more than a little jewish if the size of his nose was anything to go by this dominated the centre of his face like the arm on a sundial and tugged the upper lip into a thin sneer of a smile his greying fair hair he wore closely cropped which had the effect of accentuating the height of his forehead it was a cunning wily sort efface and suited him perfectly surprised he said that the head of berlins criminal police should send me an anonymous note no that happens to me all the time would you have come if i had signed it probably not and if i had suggested that you come to prinz albrecht strasse instead of this place admit you were curious since when has kripo had to rely on suggestion to get people down to headquarters youve got a point his smirk broadening arthur nebe produced a hip flask from his coat pocket drink thanks i dont mind if i do i swigged a cheekful of the clear grain alcohol thoughtfully provided by the reichskriminaldirektor and then took out my cigarettes after i had lit us both i held the match aloft for a couple of seconds not an easy place to torch i said one man acting on his own hed have to have been a fairly agile sort of bugger and even then i reckon it would have taken van der lubbe all night to get this little campfire blazing i sucked at my cigarette and added the word is that fat hermann had a hand in it a hand holding a piece of burning tinder that is im shocked shocked to hear you make such a scandalous suggestion about our beloved prime minister but nebe was laughing as he said it poor old hermann getting the unofficial blame like that oh he went along with the arson but it wasnt his party whose was it then joey the cripp that poor fucking dutchman was an added bonus for him van der lubbe had the misfortune to have decided to set fire to this place on the same night as goebbels and his lads joey thought it was his birthday especially as lubbe turned out to be a bolshie only he forgot that the arrest of a culprit meant a trial which meant that there would have to be the irritating formality of producing evidence and of course right from the start it was obvious to a man with his head in a bag that lubbe couldnt have acted on his own so why didnt he say something at the trial they pumped him full of some shit to keep him quiet threatened his family you know the sort of thing nebe walked round a huge bronze chandelier that lay twisted on the dirty marble floor here i want to show you something he led the way into the great hall of the diet where germany had last seen some semblance of democracy rising high above us was the shell of what had once been the reichstags glass dome now all the glass was blown out and against the moon the copper girders resembled the web of some gigantic spider nebe pointed his torch at the scorched split beams that surrounded the hall theyre badly damaged by the fire but those half figures supporting the beams can you see how some of them are also holding up letters of the alphabet just about yes well some of them are unrecognizable but if you look hard you can still see that they spell out a motto not at one oclock in the morning i cant nebe ignored me it says country before party he repeated the motto almost reverently and then looked at me with what i supposed to be a meaning i sighed and shook my head oh that really knocks over the heap you arthur nebe the reichskriminaldirektor a beefsteak nazi well ill eat my broom brown on the outside yes he said i dont know what colour i am on the inside but its not red im no bolshevik but then its not brown either i am no longer a nazi shit youre one hell of a mimic then i am now i have to be to stay alive of course it wasnt always that way the police force is my life gunther i love it when i saw it corroded by liberalism during the weimar years i thought that national socialism would restore some respect for law and order in this country instead its worse than ever i was the one who helped get the gestapo away from the control of diels only to find him replaced with himmler and heydrich and and then the rain really started to come in at the eaves i get the picture the time is coming when everyone will have to do the same theres no room for agnosticism in the germany that himmler and heydrich have got planned for us itll be stand up and be counted or take the consequences but its still possible to change things from the inside and when the time is right well need men like you men on the force who can be trusted thats why ive asked you here to try and persuade you to come back me back in kripo you must be joking listen arthur ive built up a good business i make a very good living now why should i chuck all that away for the pleasure of being on the force again you might not have much choice in the matter heydrich thinks that you might be useful to him if you were back in kripo i see any particular reason theres a case he wants you to handle im sure i dont have to tell you that heydrich takes his fascism very personally he generally gets what he wants whats this case about i dont know what hes got in mind heydrich doesnt confide in me i just wanted to warn you so that youd be prepared so that you didnt do anything stupid like tell him to go to hell which might be your first reaction we both have great respect for your abilities as a detective it just happens that i also want somebody in kripo that i can trust well what it is to be popular youll give it some thought i dont see how i can avoid it itll make a change from the crossword i suppose anyway thanks for the red light arthur i appreciate it i wiped my dry mouth nervously you got any more of that lemonade i could use a drink now its not every day you get such good news nebe handed me his flask and i went for it like a baby after its mothers tit less attractive but damn near as comforting in your love letter you mentioned you had some information about an old case or was that your equivalent of the childmolesters puppy there was a woman you were looking for a while back a journalist thats quite a while back nearly two years i never found her one of my all too frequent failures perhaps you ought to let heydrich know that it might persuade him to let me off the hook do you want this or not well dont make me straighten my tie for it arthur theres not much but here it is a couple of months ago the landlord of the place where your client used to live decided to redecorate some of the apartments including hers bighearted of him in her toilet behind some kind of false panel he found a dopers kit no drugs but everything youd need to service a habit needles syringes the works now the tenant who took over the place from your client when she disappeared was a priest so it didnt seem likely that these needles were his right and if the lady was using dope then that might explain a lot wouldnt you say i mean you never can predict what a doper will do i shook my head she wasnt the type id have noticed something wouldnt i not always not if she was trying to wean herself off the stuff not if she were a strong sort of character well then it was reported and i thought youd like to know so now you can close that file with that sort of secret theres no telling what else she might have kept from you no its all right i got a good look at her nipples nebe smiled nervously not quite sure if i was telling him a dirty joke or not good were they her nipples just the two of them arthur but they were beautiful monday august the houses on herbertstrasse in any other city but berlin would each have been surrounded by a couple of hectares of shrublined lawn but as it was they filled their individual plots of land with little or no space for grass and paving some of them were no more than the frontgates width from the sidewalk architecturally they were a mixture of styles ranging from the palladian to the neogothic the wilhelmine and some that were so vernacular as to be impossible to describe judged as a whole herbertstrasse was like an assemblage of old fieldmarshals and grandadmirals in fulldressuniforms obliged to sit on extremely small and inadequate camp stools the great weddingcake of a house to which i had been summoned belonged properly on a mississippi plantation an impression enhanced by the black cauldron of a maid who answered the door i showed her my id and told her that i was expected she stared doubtfully at my identification as if she were himmler himself frau lange didnt say nothing to me about you i expect she forgot i said look she only called my office half an hour ago all right she said reluctantly youd better come in she showed me into a drawingroom that you could have called elegant but for the large and only partially chewed dogbone that was lying on the carpet i looked around for the owner but there was no sign of one dont touch anything said the black cauldron ill tell her youre here then muttering and grumbling like id got her out of the bath she waddled off to find her mistress i sat down on a mahogany sofa with dolphins carved on the armrests next to it was a matching table the top resting on dolphintails dolphins were a comic effect always popular with german cabinetmakers but personally id seen a better sense of humour in a threepfennig stamp i was there about five minutes before the cauldron rolled back in and said that frau lange would see me now we went along a long gloomy hallway that was home to a lot of stuffed fish one of which a fine salmon i stopped to admire nice fish i said whos the fisherman she turned impatiently no fisherman here she said just fish what a house this is for fish and cats and dogs only the cats is the worst at least the fish is dead you cant dust them cats and dogs almost automatically i ran my finger along the salmons cabinet there didnt seem to be a great deal of evidence that any kind of dusting took place and even on my comparatively short introduction to the lange household it was easy to see that the carpets were rarely if ever vacuumed after the mud of the trenches a bit of dust and a few crumbs on the floor dont offend me that much but all the same id seen plenty of homes in the worst slums of neukölln and wedding that were kept cleaner than this one the cauldron opened some glass doors and stood aside i went into an untidy sittingroom which also seemed to be part office and the doors closed behind me she was a large fleshy orchid of a woman fat hung pendulously on her peachcoloured face and arms making her look like one of those stupid dogs that is bred to have a coat several sizes too large for it her own stupid dog was altogether more shapeless than the illfitting sharpei she resembled its very good of you to come and see me at such short notice she said i uttered a few deferential noises but she had the sort of clout you can only get from living in a fancy address like herbertstrasse frau lange sat down on a greencoloured chaise longue and spread her dogs fur on her generous lap like a piece of knitting she intended to work on while explaining her problem to me i supposed her to be in her middle fifties not that it mattered when women get beyond fifty their age ceases to be of interest to anyone other than themselves with men the situation is entirely the opposite she produced a cigarette case and invited me to smoke adding as a proviso theyre menthol i thought it was curiosity that made me take one but as i sucked my first lungful i winced realizing that i had merely forgotten how disgusting a menthol tastes she chuckled at my obvious discomfort oh put it out man for gods sake they taste horrible i dont know why i smoke them really i dont have one of your own or ill never get your attention thanks i said stubbing it out in a hubcap of an ashtray i think i will and while youre at it you can pour us both a drink i dont know about you but i could certainly do with one she pointed to a great biedermeier secretaire the top section of which with its bronze ionic columns was an ancient greek temple in miniature theres a bottle of gin in that thing she said i cant offer you anything but lime juice to put in it im afraid its the only thing i ever drink it was a little early for me but i mixed two anyway i liked her for trying to put me at my ease even though that was supposed to be one of my own professional accomplishments except that frau lange wasnt in the least bit nervous she looked like the kind of lady who had quite a few professional accomplishments of her own i handed her the drink and sat down on a creaking leather chair that was next to the chaise are you an observant man herr gunther i can see whats happening in germany if thats what you mean it wasnt but im glad to hear it anyway no what i meant was how good are you at seeing things come now frau lange theres no need to be the cat creeping around the hot milk just walk right up and lap it i waited for a moment watching her grow awkward ill say it for you if you like you mean how good a detective am i im afraid i know very little of these matters no reason why you should but if i am to confide in you i feel i ought to have some idea of your credentials i smiled youll understand that mine is not the kind of business where i can show you the testimonials of several satisfied customers confidentiality is as important to my clients as it is in the confessional perhaps even more important but then how is one to know that one has engaged the services of someone who is good at what he does im very good at what i do frau lange my reputation is wellknown a couple of months ago i even had an offer for my business rather a good offer as it happened why didnt you sell in the first place the business wasnt for sale and in the second id make as bad an employee as i would an employer all the same its flattering when that sort of thing happens of course all this is quite beside the point most people who want the services of a private investigator dont need to buy the firm usually they just ask their lawyers to find someone youll find that im recommended by several law firms including the ones who dont like my accent or my manners forgive me herr gunther but in my opinion the law is a much overrated profession i cant argue with you there i never met a lawyer yet that wasnt above stealing his mothers savings and the mattress she was keeping them under in nearly all business matters i have found my own judgement to be a great deal more reliable what exactly is your business frau lange i own and manage a publishing company the lange publishing company as i said i havent often been wrong by trusting my own judgement herr gunther publishing is all about taste and to know what will sell one must appreciate something of the tastes of the people to whom one is selling now im a berliner to my fingertips and i believe i know this city and its people as well as anyone does so with reference to my original question which was to do with your being observant you will answer me this if i were a stranger in berlin how would you describe the people of this city to me i smiled whats a berliner eh thats a good question no clients ever asked me to leap through a couple of hoops to see how clever a dog i am before you know mostly i dont do tricks but in your case ill make an exception berliners like people to make exceptions for them i hope youre paying attention now because ive started my act yes they like to be made to feel exceptional although at the same time they like to keep up appearances mostly theyve got the same sort of look a scarf hat and shoes that could walk you to shanghai without a corn as it happens berliners like to walk which is why so many of them own a dog something vicious if youre masculine something cute if youre something else the men comb their hair more than the women and they also grow moustaches you could hunt wild pig in tourists think that a lot of berlin men like dressingup as women but thats just the ugly women giving the men a bad name not that there are many tourists these days national socialisms made them as rare a sight as fred astaire in jackboots the people of this town will take cream with just about anything including beer and beer is something they take very seriously indeed the women prefer a tenminute head on it just like the men and they dont mind paying for it themselves nearly everyone who drives a car drives much too fast but nobody would ever dream of running a red light theyve got rotten lungs because the air is bad and because they smoke too much and a sense of humour that sounds cruel if you dont understand it and even crueller if you do they buy expensive biedermeier cabinets as solid as blockhouses and then hang little curtains on the insides of the glass doors to hide what theyve got in there its a typically idiosyncratic mixture of the ostentatious and the private how am i doing frau lange nodded apart from the comment about berlins ugly women youll do just fine it wasnt pertinent now there youre wrong dont back down or i shall stop liking you it was pertinent youll see why in a moment what are your fees seventy marks a day plus expenses and what expenses might there be hard to say travel bribes anything that results in information you get receipts for everything except the bribes im afraid you have to take my word for those well lets hope that youre a good judge of what is worth paying for ive had no complaints and i assume youll want something in advance she handed me an envelope youll find a thousand marks in cash in there is that satisfactory to you i nodded naturally i shall want a receipt naturally i said and signed the piece of paper she had prepared very businesslike i thought yes she was certainly quite a lady incidentally how did you come to choose me you didnt ask your lawyer and i added thoughtfully i dont advertise of course she stood up and still holding her dog went over to the desk i had one of your business cards she said handing it to me or at least my son did i acquired it at least a year ago from the pocket of one of his old suits i was sending to the winter relief she referred to the welfare programme that was run by the labour front the d a f i kept it meaning to return it to him but when i mentioned it to him im afraid he told me to throw it away only i didnt i suppose i thought it might come in useful at some stage well i wasnt wrong was i it was one of my old business cards dating from the time before my partnership with bruno stahlecker it even had my previous home telephone number written on the back i wonder where he got it i said i believe he said that it was dr kindermanns kindermann ill come to him in a moment if you dont mind i thumbed a new card from my wallet its not important but ive got a partner now so youd better have one of my new ones i handed her the card and she placed it on the desk next to the telephone while she was sitting down her face adopted a serious expression as if she had switched off something inside her head and now id better tell you why i asked you here she said grimly i want you to find out whos blackmailing me she paused shifting awkwardly on the chaise longue im sorry this isnt very easy for me take your time blackmail makes anyone feel nervous she nodded and gulped some of her gin well about two months ago perhaps a little more i received an envelope containing two letters that had been written by my son to another man to dr kindermann of course i recognized my sons handwriting and although i didnt read them i knew that they were of an intimate nature my son is a homosexual herr gunther ive known about it for some time so this was not the terrible revelation to me that this evil person had intended he made that much clear in his note also that there were several more letters like the ones i had received in his possession and that he would send them to me if i paid him the sum of marks were i to refuse he would have no alternative but to send them to the gestapo im sure i dont have to tell you herr gunther that this government takes a less enlightened attitude towards these unfortunate young men than did the republic any contact between men no matter how tenuous is these days regarded as punishable for reinhard to be exposed as a homosexual would undoubtedly result in his being sent to a concentration camp for up to ten years so i paid herr gunther my chauffeur left the money in the place i was told and a week or so later i received not a packet of letters as i had expected but only one letter it was accompanied by another anonymous note which informed me that the author had changed his mind that he was poor that i should have to buy the letters back one at a time and that there were still ten of them in his possession since then i have received four back at a cost of almost marks each time he asks for more than the last does your son know about this no and for the moment at least i can see no reason why we should both suffer i sighed and was about to voice my disagreement when she stopped me yes youre going to say that it makes catching this criminal more difficult and that reinhard may have information which might help you youre absolutely right of course but listen to my reasons herr gunther first of all my son is an impulsive boy most likely his reaction would be to tell this blackmailer to go to the devil and not pay this would almost certainly result in his arrest reinhard is my son and as his mother i love him very dearly but he is a fool with no understanding of pragmatism i suspect that whoever is blackmailing me has a shrewd appreciation of human psychology he understands how a mother a widow feels for her only son especially a rich and rather lonely one like myself second i myself have some appreciation of the world of the homosexual the late dr magnus hirschfeld wrote several books on the subject one of which im proud to say i published myself its a secret and rather treacherous world herr gunther a blackmailers charter so it may be that this evil person is actually acquainted with my son even between men and women love can make a good reason for blackmail more so when there is adultery involved or race defilement which seems to be more a cause for concern to these nazis because of this when you have discovered the blackmailers identity i will tell reinhard and then it will be up to him what is to be done but until then he will know nothing of this she looked at me questioningly do you agree i cant fault your reasoning frau lange you seem to have thought this thing through very clearly may i see the letters from your son reaching for a folder by the chaise she nodded and then hesitated is that necessary reading his letters i mean yes it is i said firmly and do you still have the notes from the blackmailer she handed me the folder everything is in there she said the letters and the anonymous notes he didnt ask for any of them back no thats good it means were dealing with an amateur someone who had done this sort of thing before would have told you to return his notes with each payment to stop you accumulating any evidence against him yes i see i glanced at what i was optimistically calling evidence the notes and envelopes were all typewritten on good quality stationery without any distinctive features and posted at various districts throughout west berlin w wo w the stamps all commemorating the fifth anniversary of the nazis coming to power that told me something this anniversary had taken place on january so it didnt look like frau langes blackmailer bought stamps very often reinhard langes letters were written on the heavier weight of paper that only people in love bother to buy the kind that costs so much it just has to be taken seriously the hand was neat and fastidious even careful which was more than could be said of the contents an ottoman bathhouse attendant might not have found anything particularly objectionable about them but in nazi germany reinhard langes loveletters were certainly sufficient to earn their cheeky author a trip to a k z wearing a whole chestful of pink triangles this dr lanz kindermann i said reading the name on the limescented envelope what exactly do you know about him there was a stage when reinhard was persuaded to be treated for his homosexuality at first he tried various endocrine preparations but these proved ineffective psychotherapy seemed to offer a better chance of success i believe several highranking party members and boys from the hitler youth have undergone the same treatment kindermann is a psychotherapist and reinhard first became acquainted with him when he entered kindermanns clinic in wannsee seeking a cure instead he became intimately involved with kindermann who is himself homosexual pardon my ignorance but what exactly is psychotherapy i thought that sort of thing was no longer permitted frau lange shook her head im not exactly sure but i think that the emphasis is on treating mental disorders as part of ones overall physical health dont ask me how that differs from that fellow freud except that hes jewish and kindermann is german kindermanns clinic is strictly germans only wealthy germans with drink and drug problems those for whom the more eccentric end of medicine has some appeal chiropracty and that sort of thing or those just seeking an expensive rest kindermanns patients include the deputy führer rudolf hess have you ever met dr kindermann once i didnt like him hes a rather arrogant austrian arent they all i murmured think hed be the type to try a little blackmail after all the letters were addressed to him if it isnt kindermann then it has to be somebody who knows him or at least somebody who had the opportunity to steal the letters from him i confess that i hadnt suspected kindermann for the simple reason that the letters implicate both of them she thought for a moment i know it sounds silly but i never gave any thought as to how the letters came to be in somebody elses possession but now you come to mention it i suppose that they must have been stolen from kindermann i would think i nodded all right i said now let me ask you a rather more difficult question i think i know what youre going to say herr gunther she said heaving a great sigh have i considered the possibility that my own son might be the culprit she looked at me critically and added i wasnt wrong about you was i its just the sort of cynical question that i hoped you would ask now i know i can trust you for a detective being a cynic is like green fingers in a gardener frau lange sometimes it gets me into trouble but mostly it stops me from underestimating people so youll forgive me i hope if i suggest that this could be the best reason of all for not involving him in this investigation and that youve already thought of it i saw her smile a little and added you see how i dont underestimate you frau lange she nodded could he be short of money do you think no as a board director of the lange publishing company he draws a substantial salary he also has income from a large trust that was set up for him by his father its true he likes to gamble but worse than that for me is that he is the owner of a perfectly useless title called urania title a magazine about astrology or some such rubbish its done nothing but lose money since the day he bought it she lit another cigarette and sucked at it with lips puckered like she was going to whistle a tune and he knows that if he were ever really short of money then he would only have to come and ask me i smiled ruefully i know im not what you might call cute but have you ever thought of adopting someone like me she laughed at that and i added he sounds like a very fortunate young man hes very spoiled thats what he is and hes not so young any more she stared into space her eyes apparently following her cigarette smoke for a rich widow like myself reinhard is what people in business call a loss leader there is no disappointment in life that begins to compare with ones disappointment in ones only son really ive heard it said that children are a blessing as one gets older you know for a cynic youre beginning to sound quite sentimental i can tell youve no children of your own so let me put you right about one thing herr gunther children are the reflection of ones old age theyre the quickest way of growing old i know the mirror of ones decline mine most of all the dog yawned and jumped off her lap as if having heard it many times before on the floor it stretched and ran towards the door where it turned and looked back expectantly at its mistress unperturbed at this display of canine hubris she got up to let the brute out of the room so what happens now she said coming back to her chaise longue we wait for another note ill handle the next cash delivery but until then i think it might be a good idea if i were to check into kindermanns clinic for a few days id like to know a little more about your sons friend i suppose thats what you mean by expenses is it ill try to make it a short stay see that you do she said affecting a schoolmistressy sort of tone the kindermann clinic is a hundred marks a day i whistled very respectable and now i must excuse myself herr gunther she said i have a meeting to prepare for i pocketed my cash and then we shook hands after which i picked up the folder she had given me and pointed my suit at the door i walked back along the dusty corridor and through the hall a voice barked you just hang on there i got to let you out frau lange dont like it if i dont see her guests out myself i put my hand on the doorknob and found something sticky there your warm personality no doubt i jerked the door open irritatedly as the black cauldron waddled across the hall dont trouble i said inspecting my hand you just get on back to whatever it is that you do around this dustbowl been a long time with frau lange she growled she never had no complaints i wondered if blackmail came into it at all after all you have to have a good reason to keep a guarddog that doesnt bark i couldnt see where affection might possibly fit into it either not with this woman it was more probable that you could grow attached to a river crocodile we stared at each other for a moment after which i said does the lady always smoke that much the black thought for a moment wondering whether or not it was a trick question eventually she decided that it wasnt she always has a nail in her mouth and thats a fact well that must be the explanation i said with all that cigarette smoke around her i bet she doesnt even know youre there she swore under her searing breath and slammed the door in my face i had lots to think about as i drove back along kurfürstendamm towards the city centre i thought about frau langes case and then her thousand marks in my pocket i thought about a short break in a nice comfortable sanitarium at her expense and the opportunity it offered me temporarily at least to escape bruno and his pipe not to mention arthur nebe and heydrich maybe id even sort out my insomnia and my depression but most of all i thought of how i could ever have given my business card and home telephone number to some austrian flower id never even heard of wednesday august the area south of königstrasse in wannsee is home to all sorts of private clinics and hospitals the smart shiny kind where they use as much ether on the floors and windows as they do on the patients themselves as far as treatment is concerned they are inclined to be egalitarian a man could be possessed of the constitution of an african bull elephant and still they would be happy to treat him like he was shellshocked with a couple of lipsticked nurses to help him with the heavier brands of toothbrush and lavatory paper always provided he could pay for it in wannsee your bank balance matters more than your blood pressure kindermanns clinic stood off a quiet road in a large but wellbehaved sort of garden that sloped down to a small backwater off the main lake and included among the many elm and chestnut trees a colonnaded pier a boathouse and a gothic folly that was so neatly built as to take on a rather more sensible air it looked like a medieval telephone kiosk the clinic itself was such a mixture of gable halftimber mullion crenellated tower and turret as to be more rhine castle than sanitarium looking at it i half expected to see a couple of gibbets on the rooftop or hear a scream from a distant cellar but things were quiet with no sign of anyone about there was only the distant sound of a fourman crew on the lake beyond the trees to provoke the rooks to raucous comment as i walked through the front door i decided that there would probably be more chance of finding a few inmates creeping around outside about the time when the bats were thinking of launching themselves into the twilight my room was on the third floor with an excellent view of the kitchens at eighty marks a day it was the cheapest they had and skipping around it i couldnt help but wonder if for an extra fifty marks a day i wouldnt have rated something a little bigger like a laundrybasket but the clinic was full my room was all they had available said the nurse who showed me up there she was a cute one like a baltic fishwife but without the quaint country conversation by the time she had turned down my bed and told me to get undressed i was almost breathless with excitement first frau langes maid and then this one as much a stranger to lipstick as a pterodactyl it wasnt as if there werent prettier nurses about id seen plenty downstairs they must have figured that with a very small room the least they could do would be to give me a very large nurse in compensation what time does the bar open i said her sense of humour was no less pleasing than her beauty theres no alcohol allowed in here she said snatching the unlit cigarette from my lips and strictly no smoking dr meyer will be along to see you presently so whats he the secondclass deck wheres dr kindermann the doctor is at a conference in bad neuheim whats he doing there staying at a sanitarium when does he come back here the end of the week are you a patient of dr kindermann herr strauss no no im not but for eighty marks a day i had hoped i would be dr meyer is a very capable physician i can assure you she frowned at me impatiently as she realized that i hadnt yet made a move to get undressed and started to make a tutting noise that sounded like she was trying to be nice to a cockatoo clapping her hands sharply she told me to hurry up and get into bed as dr meyer would wish to examine me judging that she was quite capable of doing it for me i decided not to resist not only was my nurse ugly but she was also possessed of a bedside manner that must have been acquired in a market garden when shed gone i settled down to read in bed not the kind of read you would describe as gripping so much as incredible yes that was the word incredible there had always been weird occult magazines in berlin like zenit and hagal but from the shores of the maas to the banks of the memel there was nothing to compare with the grabbers that were writing for reinhard langes magazine urania leafing through it for just fifteen minutes was enough to convince me that lange was probably a complete spinner there were articles entitled wotanism and the real origins of christianity the superhuman powers of the lost citizens of atlantis the world ice theory explained esoteric breathing exercises for beginners spiritualism and race memory the hollowearth doctrine antisemitism as theocratic legacy etc for a man who could publish this sort of nonsense the blackmail of a parent i thought was probably the sort of mundane activity that occupied him between ariosophical revelations even dr meyer himself no obvious testament to the ordinary was moved to remark upon my choice of reading matter do you often read this kind of thing he asked turning the magazine over in his hands as if it had been a variety of curious artefact dug from some trojan ruin by heinrich schliemann no not really it was curiosity that made me buy it good an abnormal interest in the occult is often an indication of an unstable personality you know i was just thinking the same thing myself not everyone would agree with me in that of course but the visions of many modern religious figures st augustine luther are most probably neurotic in their origins is that so oh yes what does dr kindermann think oh kindermann holds some very unusual theories im not sure i understand his work but hes a very brilliant man he picked up my wrist yes indeed a very brilliant man the doctor who was swiss wore a threepiece suit of green tweed a great moth of a bowtie glasses and the long white chinbeard of an indian holy man he pushed up my pyjama sleeve and hung a little pendulum above the underside of my wrist he watched it swing and revolve for a while before pronouncing that the amount of electricity i was giving off indicated that i was feeling abnormally depressed and anxious about something it was an impressive little performance but none the less bulletproof given that most of the folk who checked into the clinic were probably depressed or anxious about something even if it was only their bill how are you sleeping he said badly couple of hours a night do you ever have nightmares yes and i dont even like cheese any recurring dreams nothing specific and what about your appetite i dont have one to speak of your sex life same as my appetite not worth mentioning do you think much about women all the time he scribbled a few notes stroked his beard and said im prescribing extra vitamins and minerals especially magnesium im also going to put you on a sugarfree diet lots of raw vegetables and kelp well help get rid of some of the toxins in you with a course of bloodpurification tablets i also recommend that you exercise theres an excellent swimmingpool here and you may even care to try a rainwater bath which youll find to be most invigorating do you smoke i nodded try giving up for a while he snapped his notebook shut well that should all help with your physical wellbeing along the way well see if we cant effect some improvement in your mental state with psychotherapeutic treatment exactly what is psychotherapy doctor forgive me but i thought that the nazis had branded it as decadent oh no no psychotherapy is not psychoanalysis it places no reliance on the unconscious mind that sort of thing is all right for jews but it has no relevance to germans as you yourself will now appreciate no psychotherapeutic treatment is ever pursued in isolation from the body here we aim to relieve the symptoms of mental disorder by adjusting the attitudes that have led to their occurrence attitudes are conditioned by personality and the relation of a personality to its environment your dreams are only of interest to me to the extent that you are having them at all to treat you by attempting to interpret your dreams and to discover their sexual significance is quite frankly nonsensical now that is decadent he chuckled warmly but thats a problem for jews and not you herr strauss right now the most important thing is that you enjoy a good nights sleep so saying he picked up his medical bag and took out a syringe and a small bottle which he placed on the bedside table whats that i said uncertainly hyoscine he said rubbing my arm with a pad of surgical spirit the injection felt cold as it crept up my arm like embalming fluid seconds after recognizing that i would have to find another night on which to snoop around kindermanns clinic i felt the ropes mooring me to consciousness slacken and i was adrift moving slowly away from the shore meyers voice already too far away for me to hear what he was saying after four days in the clinic i was feeling better than i had felt in four months as well as my vitamins and my diet of kelp and raw vegetables id tried hydrotherapy naturotherapy and a solarium treatment my state of health had been further diagnosed through examination of my irises my palms and my fingernails which revealed me as calciumdeficient and a technique of autogenic relaxation had been taught to me dr meyer was making progress with his jungian totality approach as he called it and was proposing to attack my depression with electrotherapy and although i hadnt yet managed to search kindermanns office i did have a new nurse a real beauty called marianne who remembered reinhard lange staying at the clinic for several months and had already demonstrated a willingness to discuss her employer and the affairs of the clinic she woke me at seven with a glass of grapefruit juice and an almost veterinary selection of pills enjoying the curve of her buttocks and the stretch of her pendulous breasts i watched her draw back the curtains to reveal a fine sunny day and wished that she could have revealed her naked body as easily and how are you this beautiful day i said awful she grimaced marianne you know its supposed to be the other way around dont you im the one who is supposed to feel awful and youre the one who should ask after my health im sorry herr strauss but i am bored as hell with this place well why dont you jump in here beside me and tell me all about it im very good at listening to other peoples problems ill bet youre very good at other things as well she said laughing i shall have to put bromide in your fruitjuice what would be the point of that ive already got a whole pharmacy swilling around inside of me i cant see that another chemical would make much difference youd be surprised she was a tall athleticlooking blonde from frankfurt with a nervous sense of humour and a rather selfconscious smile that indicated a lack of personal confidence which was strange given her obvious attractiveness a whole pharmacy she scoffed a few vitamins and something to help you sleep at night thats nothing compared with some of the others tell me about it she shrugged something to help them wake up and stimulants to help combat depression what do they use on the pansies oh them they used to give them hormones but it didnt work so now they try aversion therapy but despite what they say at the goering institute about it being a treatable disorder in private all the doctors say that the basic condition is hard to influence kindermann should know i think he might be a bit warm himself ive heard him tell a patient that psychotherapy is only helpful in dealing with the neurotic reactions that may arise from homosexuality that it helps the patient to stop deluding himself so then all he has to worry about is section whats that the section of the german penal code which makes it a criminal offence is that what happened to reinhard lange he was just treated for associated neurotic reactions she nodded and sat herself on the edge of my bed tell me about this goering institute any relation to fat hermann matthias goering is his cousin the place exists to provide psychotherapy with the protection of the goering name if it werent for him there would be very little mental health in germany worthy of the name the nazis would have destroyed psychiatric medicine merely because its leading light is a jew the whole thing is the most enormous piece of hypocrisy a lot of them continue privately to subscribe to freud while denouncing him in public even the socalled orthopaedic hospital for the s s near ravensbrück is nothing but a mental hospital for the s s kindermann is a consultant there as well as being one of the goering institutes founding members so who funds the institute the labour front and the luftwaffe of course the prime ministers pettycash box mariannes eyes narrowed you know you ask a lot of questions what are you a bull or something like that i got out of bed and slipped into my dressinggown i said something like that are you working on a case here her eyes widened with excitement something kindermann could be involved in i opened the window and leant out for a moment the morning air was good to breathe even the stuff coming up from the kitchens but a cigarette was better i brought my last packet in from the window ledge and lit one mariannes eyes lingered disapprovingly on the cigarette in my hand you shouldnt be smoking you know i dont know if kindermann is involved or not i said thats what i was hoping to find out when i came here well you dont have to worry about me she said fiercely i couldnt care what happens to him she stood up with her arms folded her mouth assuming a harder expression the man is a bastard you know just a few weeks ago i worked a whole weekend because nobody else was available he said hed pay me doubletime in cash but he still hasnt given me my money thats the kind of pig he is i bought a dress it was stupid of me i should have waited well now im behind with the rent i was debating with myself whether or not she was trying to sell me a story when i saw the tears in her eyes if it was an act it was a damn good one either way it deserved some kind of recognition she blew her nose and said would you give me a cigarette please sure i handed her the pack and then thumbed a match you know kindermann knew freud she said coughing a little with her first smoke at the vienna medical school when he was a student after graduating he worked for a while at the salzburg mental asylum hes from salzburg originally when his uncle died in he left him this house and he decided to turn it into a clinic it sounds like you know him quite well last summer his secretary was sick for a couple of weeks kindermann knew i had some secretarial experience and asked me to fill in a while while tarja was away i got to know him reasonably well well enough to dislike him im not going to stay here much longer ive had enough i think believe me there are plenty of others here who feel much the same way oh think anyone would want to get back at him anyone who might have a grudge against him youre talking about a serious grudge arent you not just a bit of unpaid overtime i suppose so i said and flicked my cigarette out of the open window marianne shook her head no wait she said there was someone about three months ago kindermann dismissed one of the male nurses for being drunk he was a nasty piece of work and i dont think anyone was sad to see him go i wasnt there myself but i heard that he used some quite strong language to kindermann when he left what was his name this male nurse hering klaus hering i think she looked at her watch hey ive got to be getting on with my work i cant stay talking to you all morning one more thing i said i need to take a look around kindermanns office can you help she started to shake her head i cant do it without you marianne tonight i dont know what if we get caught the we part doesnt come into it you keep a lookout and if someone finds you you say that you heard a noise and that you were investigating ill have to take my chances maybe ill say i was sleepwalking oh thats a good one come on marianne what do you say all right ill do it but leave it until after midnight thats when we lock up ill meet you in the solarium at around her expression changed as she saw me slide a fifty from my wallet i crushed it into the breast pocket of her crisp white uniform she took it out again i cant take this she said you shouldnt i held her fist shut to stop her returning the note look its just something to help tide you over at least until you get paid for your overtime she looked doubtful i dont know she said it doesnt seem right somehow this is as much as i make in a week itll do a lot more than just tide me over marianne i said its nice to make ends meet but its even nicer if you can tie a bow monday september the doctor told me that the electrotherapy has the temporary sideeffect of disturbing the memory otherwise i feel great bruno looked at me anxiously youre sure never felt better well rather you than me being plugged in like that he snorted so whatever you managed to find out while you were in kindermanns place is temporarily mislaid inside your head is that it its not quite that bad i managed to take a look around his office and there was a very attractive nurse who told me all about him kindermann is a lecturer at the luftwaffe medical school and a consultant at the partys private clinic in bleibtreustrasse not to mention his membership of the nazi doctors association and the herrenklub bruno shrugged the man is goldplated so what goldplated but not exactly treasured he isnt very popular with his staff i found out the name of someone who he sacked and who might be the type to bear him a grudge its not much of a reason is it being sacked according to my nurse marianne it was common knowledge that he got the push for stealing drugs from the clinic dispensary that he was probably selling them on the street so he wasnt exactly the salvation army type was he this fellow have a name i thought hard for a moment and then produced my notebook from my pocket its all right i said i wrote it down a detective with a crippled memory thats just great slow your blood down ive got it his name is klaus hering ill see if the alex has anything on him he picked up the telephone and made the call it only took a couple of minutes we paid a bull fifty marks a month for the service but klaus hering was clean so where is the money supposed to go he handed me the anonymous note which frau lange had received the previous day and which had prompted bruno to telephone me at the clinic the ladys chauffeur brought it round here himself he explained as i read over the blackmailers latest composition of threats and instructions a thousand marks to be placed in a gerson carrierbag and left in a wastepaper basket outside the chicken house at the zoo this afternoon i glanced out of the window it was another warm day and without a doubt there would be plenty of people at the zoo its a good place i said hell be hard to spot and even harder to tail there are as far as i remember four exits to the zoo i found a map of berlin in my drawer and spread it out on the desk bruno came and stood over my shoulder so how do we play it he asked you handle the drop ill play the sightseer want me to wait by one of the exits afterwards youve got a fourtoone chance which way would you choose he studied the map for a minute and then pointed to the canal exit lichtenstein bridge id have a car waiting on the other side in rauch strasse then youd better have a car there yourself how long do i wait i mean the zoos open until nine oclock at night for christs sake the aquarium exit shuts at six so my guess is that hell show up before then if only to keep his options open if you havent seen us by then go home and wait for my call i stepped out of the airshipsized glass shed that is the zoo station and walked across hardenbergplatz to berlin zoos main entrance which is just a short way south of the planetarium i bought a ticket that included the aquarium and a guidebook to make myself look more plausibly a tourist and made my way first to the elephant house a strange man sketching there covered his pad secretively and shied away at my approach leaning on the rail of the enclosure i watched this curious behaviour repeated again and again as other visitors came over until by and by the man found himself standing next to me again irritated at the presumption that i should be at all interested in his miserable sketch i craned my neck over his shoulder waving my camera close to his face perhaps you should take up photography i said brightly he snarled something and cowered away one for dr kindermann i thought a real spinner at any kind of show or exhibition it is always the people that present you with the most interesting spectacle it was another fifteen minutes before i saw bruno he hardly seemed to see me or the elephants as he walked by holding the small gerson store carrierbag that contained the money under his arm i let him get well in front and then followed outside the chicken house a small redbrick halftimbered building covered in ivy which looked more like a village beercellar than a home to wild fowl bruno stopped glanced around him and then dropped the bag into a wastepaper basket that was beside a gardenseat he walked quickly away east and in the direction of his chosen station at the exit on the landwehr canal a high crag of sandstone the habitat of a herd of barbary sheep was situated opposite the chicken house according to the guidebook it was one of the zoos landmarks but i thought it looked too theatrical to be a good imitation of the sort of place that would have been inhabited by these trotting rags in the wild it was more like something you would have found on the stage of some grossly overblown production of parsifal if such a thing were humanly possible i hovered there awhile reading about the sheep and finally taking several photographs of these supremely uninteresting creatures behind sheep rock was a high viewing tower from which it was possible to see the front of the chicken house indeed the whole of the zoo and i thought it looked like ten pfennigs wellspent for anyone wanting to make sure that he wasnt about to walk into a trap with this thought in mind i was meandering away from the chicken house and towards the lake when a youth of about eighteen with dark hair and a grey sports jacket appeared from the far side of the chicken house without even looking around he quickly picked the gerson bag out of the wastepaper basket and dropped it into another carrier this one from the kadewe store then he walked briskly past me and after a decent interval i followed outside the moorishstyle antelope house the youth paused briefly beside the group of bronze centaurs that stood there and giving the appearance of one engrossed in his guidebook i walked straight on to the chinese temple where hidden by several people i stopped to watch him out of the corner of my eye he came on again and i guessed that he was making for the aquarium and the south exit fish were the last thing that you expected to see in the great green building that connects the zoo with budapester strasse a lifesized stone iguanadon towered predatorily beside the door above which was the head of yet another dinosaur elsewhere the walls of the aquarium were covered with murals and stone reliefs that depicted the kind of prehistoric beasts which would have swallowed a shark whole it was to the aquariums other inhabitants the reptiles that these antediluvian decorations were in fact preferable seeing my man disappear through the front door and realizing that the aquariums dark interior would make it easy to lose him i quickened my pace once inside i saw how much more probable than possible this actually was since the sheer number of visitors made it difficult to see where he had gone assuming the worst i hurried towards the other door that led out on to the street and almost collided with the youth as he turned away from a tank that contained a creature that looked more like a floating mine than a fish for a few seconds he hesitated at the foot of the great marble stairs that led up to the reptiles before walking down to the exit and out of the aquarium and the zoo outside on budapester strasse i fell in behind a group of schoolchildren as far as ansbacher strasse where i got rid of the guidebook slipped into the raincoat i was carrying and turned up the brim of my hat minor alterations to your appearance are essential when following someone theres that and staying in the open its only when you start to cower in doorways that your man will get suspicious but this fellow never even looked back as he crossed wittenberg platz and went through the front door of kaufhaus des westens the kadewe berlins biggest department store i had thought that he had used the other carrier only to throw a tail off somebody who might have been waiting at one of the exits on the look out for a man carrying a gerson bag but now i realized that we were also in for a switch the beerrestaurant on kadewes third floor was full of lunchtime drinkers they sat stolidly facing plates of sausage and glasses of beer that were the height of table lamps the youth carrying the money wandered among the tables as if looking for someone and finally sat down opposite a man wearing a blue suit sitting alone he placed the carrierbag with the money beside another just like it on the floor finding an empty table i sat down just in sight of them and picked up a menu which i affected to study a waiter appeared i told him i hadnt made up my mind and he went away again now the man in the blue suit stood up laid some coins on the table and bending down picked up the carrier bag with the money neither one of them said a word when the blue suit went out of the restaurant i followed him obeying the cardinal rule of all cases involving ransom you always go after the money with its massive arched portico and twin minaretlike towers there was a monolithic almost byzantine quality about the metropol theatre on nollendorfplatz appearing on reliefs at the foot of the great buttresses were intertwined as many as twenty naked figures and it seemed like the ideal kind of place to try your hand at a spot of virgin sacrifice on the righthand side of the theatre was a big wooden gateway and through it the car park as big as a football pitch which backed on to several tall tenements it was to one of these buildings that i followed blue suit and the money i checked the names on the mailboxes in the downstairs hall and was pleased to find a k hering residing at number nine then i called bruno from a phone box at the ubahn station across the road when my partners old d k w pulled up at the wooden gate i got into the passenger seat and pointed across to the other side of the car park nearest to the tenements where there were still quite a few spaces left the ones nearer the theatre itself having been taken by those going to the eight oclock show thats our mans place there i said on the second floor number nine did you get a name its our friend from the clinic klaus hering thats nice and tidy what does he look like hes about my height thin wiry build fair hair rimless glasses aged about thirty when he went in he was wearing a blue suit if he leaves see if you cant get in there and find the pansys love letters otherwise just stay put im going to see the client for further instructions if shes got any ill be back tonight if not then ill relieve you at six oclock tomorrow morning any questions bruno shook his head want me to ring the wife no thanks katias used to my odd hours by now bernie anyway me not being there will help to clear the air i had another argument with my boy heinrich when i got back from the zoo what was it this time hes only gone and joined the motorized hitler youth thats all i shrugged he would have to have joined the regular hitler youth sooner or later the little swine didnt have to be in such a damned hurry to join thats all he could have waited to be taken in like the rest of the lads in his class come on look on the bright side theyll teach him how to drive and look after an engine theyll still turn him into a nazi of course but at least hell be a nazi with a skill sitting in a taxi back to alexanderplatz where i had left my car i reflected that the prospect of his son acquiring mechanical skills probably wasnt much of a consolation to a man who at the same age as heinrich had been a junior cycling champion and he was right about one thing heinrich really was a perfect little swine i didnt call frau lange to let her know i was coming and although it was only eight oclock by the time i got to herbertstrasse the house looked dark and uninviting as if those living there were out or had retired to bed but thats one of the more positive aspects of this job if youve cracked the case then you are always assured of a warm welcome no matter how unprepared they are for your arrival i parked the car went up the steps to the front door and pulled the bell almost immediately a light came on in the window above the door and after a minute or so the door opened to reveal the black cauldrons illtempered face do you know what time it is its just gone eight i said the curtains are going up at theatres all over berlin diners in restaurants are still scrutinizing the menu and mothers are just thinking that its about time their children were in bed is frau lange at home shes not dressed for no gentlemen callers well thats all right i havent brought her any flowers or chocolates and im certainly not a gentleman you spoke the truth there all right that one was for free just to put you in a good enough mood to do as youre told this is business urgent business and shell want to see me or know the reason why i wasnt let in so why dont you run along and tell her im here i waited in the same room on the sofa with the dolphin armrests i didnt like it any better the second time not least because it was now covered with the ginger hairs of an enormous cat which lay asleep on a cushion underneath a long oak sideboard i was still picking the hairs off my trousers when frau lange came into the room she was wearing a green silk dressinggown of the sort that left the tops of her big breasts on show like the twin humps of some pink seamonster matching slippers and she carried an unlit cigarette in her fingers the dog stood dumbly at her cornplastered heel its nose wrinkling at the overpowering smell of english lavender that trailed off frail langes body like an old featherboa her voice was even more masculine than i had remembered just tell me that reinhard had nothing to do with it she said imperiously nothing at all i said the seamonster sank a little as she breathed a sigh of relief thank god for that she said and do you know who it is that has been blackmailing me herr gunther yes a man who used to work at kindermanns clinic a male nurse called klaus hering i dont suppose that the name will mean much to you but kindermann had to dismiss him a couple of months ago my guess is that while he was working there he stole the letters that your son wrote to kindermann she sat down and lit her cigarette but if his grudge was against kindermann why pick on me im just guessing you understand but id say that a lot has to do with your wealth kindermanns rich but i doubt hes a tenth as rich as you frau lange whats more its probably mostly tied up in that clinic hes also got quite a few friends in the s s so hering may have decided that it was simply safer to squeeze you on the other hand he may have already tried kindermann and failed to get anywhere as a psychotherapist he could probably easily explain your sons letters as the fantasies of a former patient after all its not uncommon for a patient to grow attached to his doctor even somebody as apparently loathsome as kindermann youve met him no but thats what i hear from some of the staff working at the clinic i see well now what happens as i remember you said that would be up to your son all right supposing that he wants you to go on handling things for us after all youve made pretty short work of it so far what would your next course of action be right now my partner herr stahlecker is keeping our friend hering under surveillance at his apartment on nollendorfplatz as soon as hering goes out herr stahlecker will try and break in and recover your letters after that you have three possibilities one is that you can forget all about it another is that you can put the matter in the hands of the police in which case you run the risk of hering making allegations against your son and then you can arrange for hering to get a good oldfashioned hiding nothing too severe you understand just a good scare to warn him off and teach him a lesson personally i always favour the third choice who knows it might even result in your recovering some of your money oh id like to get my hands on that miserable man best leave that sort of thing to me eh ill call you tomorrow and you can tell me what you and your son have decided to do with any luck we may even have recovered the letters by then i didnt exactly need my arm twisted to have the brandy she offered me by way of celebration it was excellent stuff that should have been savoured a little but i was tired and when she and the seamonster joined me on the sofa i felt it was time to be going about that time i was living in a big apartment on fasanenstrasse a little way south of kurfürstendamm and within easy reach of all the theatres and better restaurants i never went to it was a nice quiet street all white mock porticoes and atlantes supporting elaborate facades on their wellmuscled shoulders cheap it wasnt but that apartment and my partner had been my only two luxuries in two years the first had been rather more successful for me than the second an impressive hallway with more marble than the pergamon altar led up to the second floor where i had a suite of rooms with ceilings that were as high as trams german architects and builders were never known for their pennypinching my feet aching like young love i ran myself a hot bath i lay there for a long time staring up at the stainedglass window which was suspended at right angles to the ceiling and which served quite redundantly to offer some cosmetic division of the bathrooms higher regions i had never ceased to puzzle as to what possible reason had prompted its construction outside the bathroom window a nightingale sat in the yards solitary but lofty tree i felt that i had a lot more confidence in his simple song than the one that hitler was singing i reflected that it was the kind of simplistic comparison my beloved pipesmoking partner might have relished tuesday september in the darkness the doorbell rang drunk with sleep i reached across to the alarm clock and picked it off the bedside table it said in the morning with still nearly an hour to go before i was supposed to wake up the doorbell rang again only this time it seemed more insistent i switched on a light and went out into the hall who is it i said knowing well enough that generally its only the gestapo who take a pleasure in disturbing peoples sleep haile selassie said a voice who the fuck do you think it is come on gunther open up we havent got all night yes it was the gestapo all right there was no mistaking their finishingschool manners i opened the door and allowed a couple of beer barrels wearing hats and coats to barge past me get dressed said one youve got an appointment shit i am going to have to have a word with that secretary of mine i yawned i forgot all about it funny man said the other what is this heydrichs idea of a friendly invitation save your mouth to suck on your cigarette will you now climb into your suit or well take you down in your fucking pyjamas i dressed carefully choosing my cheapest german forest suit and an old pair of shoes i stuffed my pockets with cigarettes i even took along a copy of the berlin illustrated news when heydrich invites you for breakfast its always best to be prepared for an uncomfortable and possibly indefinite visit immediately south of alexanderplatz on dircksenstrasse the imperial police praesidium and the central criminal courts faced each other in an uneasy confrontation legal administration versus justice it was like two heavyweights standing toe to toe at the start of a fight each trying to stare the other down of the two the alex also sometimes known as grey misery was the more brutal looking having a gothicfortress design with a domeshaped tower at each corner and two smaller towers atop the front and rear facades occupying some square metres it was an object lesson in strength if not in architectural merit the slightly smaller building that housed the central berlin courts also had the more pleasing aspect its neobaroque sandstone facade possessed something rather more subtle and intelligent than its opponent there was no telling which one of these two giants was likely to emerge the winner but when both fighters have been paid to take a fall it makes no sense to stick around and watch the end of the contest dawn was breaking as the car drew into alexs central courtyard it was still too early for me to have asked myself why heydrich should have had me brought here instead of sipo the security service headquarters in the wilhelmstrasse where heydrich had his own office my two male escorts ushered me to an interview room and left me alone there was a good deal of shouting going on in the room next door and that gave me something to think about that bastard heydrich never quite did it the way you expected i took out a cigarette and lit it nervously with the cigarette burning in a corner of my sourtasting mouth i stood up and went over to the grimy window all i could see were other windows like my own and on the rooftop the aerial of the police radio station i ground the cigarette into the mexico mixture coffeetin that served as an ashtray and sat down at the table again i was supposed to get nervous i was meant to feel their power that way heydrich would find me all the more inclined to agree with him when eventually he decided to show up probably he was still fast asleep in his bed if that was how i was supposed to feel i decided to do it differently so instead of breakfasting on my fingernails and wearing out my cheap shoes pacing round the room i tried a little selfrelaxation or whatever it was that dr meyer had called it eyes closed breathing deeply through my nose my mind concentrated on a simple shape i managed to remain calm so calm i didnt even hear the door after a while i opened my eyes and stared into the face of the bull who had come in he nodded slowly well youre a cool one he said picking up my magazine arent i just i looked at my watch half an hour had gone by you took your time did i im sorry glad you werent bored though i can see you expected to be here a while doesnt everyone i shrugged watching a boil the size of a wheelnut rub at the edge of his greasy collar when he spoke his voice came from deep within him his scarred chin dipping down to his broad chest like a cabaret tenor oh yes he said youre a private detective arent you a professional smartass do you mind me asking what kind of a living do you people make whats the matter the bribes not coming in regular enough for you he forced himself to smile through that one i do all right dont you find that it gets lonely i mean youre a bull down here youve got friends dont make me laugh ive got a partner so i get all the friendly shoulder to cry on i need right oh yes your partner that would be bruno stahlecker wouldnt it thats right i could give you his address if you like but i think hes married all right gunther youve proved youre not scared no need to make a performance out of it you were picked up at its now seven ask a policeman if you want the right time but you still havent asked anyone why youre here i thought thats what we were talking about were we assume im ignorant that shouldnt be too difficult for a smartass like you what did we say oh shit look this is your sideshow not mine so dont expect me to bring up the curtain and work the fucking lights you go right ahead with your act and ill just try to laugh and clap in the right places very well he said his voice hardening so where were you last night at home got an alibi yeah my teddy bear i was in bed asleep and before that i was seeing a client mind telling me who look i dont like this what are we trawling for tell me now or i dont say another lousy word weve got your partner downstairs whats he supposed to have done what hes done is get himself killed i shook my head killed murdered to be rather more precise thats what we usually call it in these sort of circumstances shit i said closing my eyes again thats my act gunther and i do expect you to help me with the curtain and the lights he jabbed a forefinger against my numb chest so lets have some fucking answers eh you stupid bastard you dont think i had anything to do with it do you christ i was the only friend he had when you and all your cute friends here at the alex managed to have him posted out to some backwater in spreewald i was the one who came through for him i was the one who appreciated that despite his awkward lack of enthusiasm for the nazis he was still a good bull i shook my head bitterly and swore again when did you last see him last night around eight oclock i left him in the car park behind the metropol on nollendorfplatz was he working yes doing what tailing someone no keeping someone under observation someone working in the theatre or living in the apartments i nodded which was it i cant tell you at least not until ive discussed it with my client the one you cant tell me about either who do you think you are a priest this is murder gunther dont you want to catch the man who killed your partner what do you think i think that you ought to consider the possibility that your client had something to do with it and then suppose he says herr gunther i forbid you to discuss this unfortunate matter with the police where does that get us he shook his head no fucking deal gunther you tell me or you tell the judge he stood up and went to the door its up to you take your time im not in any hurry he closed the door behind him leaving me with my guilt for ever having wished ill to bruno and his harmless pipe about an hour later the door opened and a senior s s officer came into the room i was wondering when youd show up i said arthur nebe sighed and shook his head im sorry about stahlecker he said he was a good man naturally youll want to see him he motioned me to follow him and then im afraid youll have to see heydrich beyond an outer office and an autopsytheatre where a pathologist stood working on the naked body of an adolescent girl was a long cool room with rows of tables stretching out in front of me on a few of them lay human bodies some naked some covered with sheets and some like bruno still clothed and looking more like items of lost luggage than anything human i walked over and took a long hard look at my dead partner the front of his shirt looked as though he had spilt a whole bottle of red wine on himself and his mouth gaped open like hed been stabbed sitting in a dentists chair there are lots of ways of winding up a partnership but they didnt come much more permanent than this one i never knew he wore a plate i said absently catching the glint of something metallic inside brunos mouth stabbed once through the pump they reckon under the ribs and up through the pit of the stomach i picked up each of his hands and inspected them carefully no protection cuts i said where did they find him metropol theatre car park said nebe i opened his jacket noticing the empty shoulderholster and then unbuttoned the front of his shirt which was still sticky with his blood to inspect the wound it was difficult to tell without seeing him cleaned up a bit but the entry looked split as if the knife had been rocked inside him whoever did it knew how to kill a man with a knife i said this looks like a bayonet wound i sighed and shook my head ive seen enough theres no need to put his wife through this ill make the formal identification does she know yet nebe shrugged i dont know he led the way back through the autopsytheatre but i expect someone will tell her soon enough the pathologist a young fellow with a large moustache had stopped work on the girls body to have a smoke the blood from his gloved hand had stained the cigarette paper and there was some of it on his lower lip nebe stopped and regarded the scene before him with more than a little distaste well he said angrily is it another one the pathologist exhaled lazily and pulled a face at this early stage it certainly looks that way he said shes wearing all the right accessories i see it was easily apparent that nebe didnt much care for the young pathologist i trust your report will be rather more detailed than the last one not to mention more accurate he turned abruptly and walked quickly away adding loudly over his shoulder and make sure i have it as soon as possible in nebes staffcar on the way to the wilhelmstrasse i asked him what it was all about back there in the autopsytheatre i mean my friend he said i think thats what youre about to find out the headquarters of heydrichs sd the security service at number wilhelmstrasse seemed innocuous enough from the outside even elegant at each end of an ionic colonnade was a square twostorey gatehouse and an archway that led into a courtyard behind a screen of trees made it difficult to see what lay beyond and only the presence of two sentries told you that here was an official building of some sort we drove through the gate past a neat shrublined lawn about the size of a tenniscourt and stopped outside a beautiful threestorey building with arched windows that were as big as elephants stormtroopers jumped to open the car doors and we got out the interior wasnt quite what i had expected of sipo hq we waited in a hall the central feature of which was an ornate gilt staircase decorated with fullyformed caryatids and enormous chandeliers i looked at nebe allowing my eyebrows to inform him that i was favourably impressed its not bad is it he said and taking me by the arm he led me to the french windows which looked out on to a magnificent landscaped garden beyond this to the west could be seen the modern outline of gropiuss europa haus while to the north the southern wing of gestapo headquarters on prinz albrecht strasse was clearly visible i had good reason to recognize it having once been detained there awhile at heydrichs order at the same time appreciating the difference between the sd or sipo as the security service was sometimes called and the gestapo was a rather more elusive matter even for some of the people who worked for these two organizations as far as i could understand the distinction it was just like bockwurst and frankfurter they have their special names but they look and taste exactly the same what was easy to perceive was that with this building the prinz albrecht palais heydrich had done very well for himself perhaps even better than his putative master himmler who now occupied the building next door to gestapo headquarters in what was formerly the hotel prinz albrecht strasse there was no doubt that the old hotel now called s shaus was bigger than the palais but as with sausage taste is seldom a question of size i heard arthur nebes heels click and looking round i saw that the reichs crown prince of terror had joined us at the window tall skeletally thin his long pale face lacking expression like some plaster of paris deathmask and his jack frost fingers clasped behind his ramrodstraight back heydrich stared outside for a moment or two saying nothing to either of us come gentlemen he said eventually its a beautiful day lets walk a bit opening the windows he led the way into the garden and i noticed how large were his feet and how bandy his legs as if he had been riding a lot if the silver horsemans badge on his tunic pocket was anything to go by he probably had in the fresh air and sunshine he seemed to become more animated like some kind of reptile this was the summer house of the first friedrich wilhelm he said expansively and more recently the republic used it for important guests such as the king of egypt and the british prime minister ramsay macdonald of course not that idiot with the umbrella i think its one of the most beautiful of all the old palaces i often walk here this garden connects sipo with gestapo headquarters so its actually very convenient for me and its especially pleasant at this time of year do you have a garden herr gunther no i said theyve always seemed like a lot of work to me when i stop work thats exactly what i do stop work not start digging in a garden thats too bad at my home in schlactensee we have a fine garden with its own croquet lawn are either of you familiar with the game no we said in unison its an interesting game i believe its very popular in england it provides an interesting metaphor for the new germany laws are merely hoops through which the people must be driven with varying degrees of force but there can be no movement without the mallet croquet really is a perfect game for a policeman nebe nodded thoughtfully and heydrich himself seemed pleased with this comparison he began to talk quite freely in brief about some of the things he hated freemasons catholics jehovahs witnesses homosexuals and admiral canaris the head of the abwehr german military secret intelligence and at length about some of the things that gave him pleasure the piano and the cello fencing his favourite nightclubs and his family the new germany he said is all about arresting the decline of the family you know and establishing a national community of blood things are changing for instance there are now only tramps in germany fewer than at the start of the year there are more marriages more births and half as many divorces you might well ask me why the family is so important to the party well ill tell you children the better our children the better the future for germany so when something threatens those children then we had better act quickly i found a cigarette and started to pay attention it seemed like he was coming to the point at last we stopped at a park bench and sat down me between heydrich and nebe the chickenliver in the blackbread sandwich you dont like gardens he said thoughtfully what about children do you like them i like them good he said its my own personal opinion that it is essential to like them doing what we do even the things we must do that are hard because they seem distasteful to us for otherwise we can find no expression for our humanity do you understand what i mean i wasnt sure i did but i nodded anyway may i be frank with you he said in confidence be my guest a maniac is loose on the streets of berlin herr gunther i shrugged not so as you would notice i said heydrich shook his head impatiently no i dont mean a stormtrooper beating up some old jew i mean a murderer hes raped and killed and mutilated four young german girls in as many months i havent seen anything in the newspapers about it heydrich laughed the newspapers print what we tell them to print and theres an embargo on this particular story thanks to streicher and his antisemitic rag it would only get blamed on the jews said nebe precisely so said heydrich the last thing i want is an antijewish riot in this city that sort of thing offends my sense of public order it offends me as a policeman when we do decide to clear out the jews it will be in a proper way not with a rabble to do it there are the commercial implications too a couple of weeks ago some idiots in nuremberg decided to tear down a synagogue one that just happened to be wellinsured with a german insurance company it cost them thousands of marks to settle the claim so you see race riots are very bad for business so why tell me i want this lunatic caught and caught soon gunther he looked drily at nebe in the best traditions of kripo a man a jew has already confessed to the murders however since he was almost certainly in custody at the time of the last murder it seems that he might actually be innocent and that an overzealous element in nebes beloved police force may quite simply have framed this man but you gunther you have no racial or political axe to grind and what is more you have considerable experience in this field of criminal investigation after all it was you was it not who apprehended gormann the strangler that may have been ten years ago but everyone still remembers the case he paused and looked me straight in the eye an uncomfortable sensation in other words i want you back gunther back in kripo and tracking down this madman before he kills again i flicked my cigarettebutt into the bushes and stood up arthur nebe stared at me dispassionately almost as if he disagreed with heydrichs wish to have me back on the force and leading the investigation in preference to any of his own men i lit another cigarette and thought for a moment hell there must be other bulls i said what about the one who caught kürten the beast of düsseldorf why not get him weve already checked up on him said nebe it would seem that peter kürten just gave himself up prior to that it was hardly the most efficient investigation isnt there anyone else nebe shook his head you see gunther said heydrich we come back to you again quite frankly i doubt that there is a better detective in the whole of germany i laughed and shook my head youre good very good that was a nice speech you made about children and the family general but of course we both know that the real reason youre keeping the lid on this thing is because it makes your modern police force look like a bunch of incompetents bad for them bad for you and the real reason you want me back is not because im such a good detective but because the rest are so bad the only sort of crimes that todays kripo is capable of solving are things like racedefilement or telling a joke about the führer heydrich smiled like a guilty dog his eyes narrowing are you refusing me herr gunther he said evenly id like to help really i would but your timing is poor you see ive only just found out that my partner was murdered last night you can call me oldfashioned but id like to find out who killed him ordinarily id leave it to the boys in the murder commission but given what youve just told me it doesnt sound too promising does it theyve all but accused me of killing him so who knows maybe theyll force me to sign a confession in which case ill have to work for you in order to escape the guillotine naturally id heard about herr stahleckers unfortunate death he said standing up again and of course youll want to make some inquiries if my men can be of any assistance no matter how incompetent then please dont hesitate however assuming for a moment that this obstacle were removed what would be your answer i shrugged assuming that if i refused i would lose my private investigators licence naturally gun permit driving licence no doubt wed find some excuse then probably i would be forced to accept excellent on one condition name it that for the duration of the investigation i be given the rank of kriminalkommissar and that i be allowed to run the investigation any way i want now wait a minute said nebe whats wrong with your old rank of inspector quite apart from the salary said heydrich gunther is no doubt keen that he should be as free as possible from the interference of senior officers hes quite right of course hell need that kind of rank in order to overcome the prejudices that will undoubtedly accompany his return to kripo i should have thought of it myself it is agreed we walked back to the palais inside the door an sd officer handed heydrich a note he read it and then smiled isnt that a coincidence he smiled it would seem that my incompetent police force has found the man who murdered your partner herr gunther i wonder does the name klaus hering mean anything to you stahlecker was keeping a watch on his apartment when he was killed that is good news the only sand in the oil is that this hering fellow would appear to have committed suicide he looked at nebe and smiled well we had better go and take a look dont you think arthur otherwise herr gunther here will think that we have made it up it is difficult to form any clear impression of a man who has been hanged that is not grotesque the tongue turgid and protruding like a third lip the eyes as prominent as a racing dogs balls these things tend to colour your thoughts a little so apart from the feeling that he wouldnt be winning the local debatingsociety prize there wasnt much to say about klaus hering except that he was about thirty years old slimly built fairhaired and thanks in part to his necktie getting on for tall the thing looked clearcut enough in my experience hanging is almost always suicide there are easier ways to kill a man i have seen a few exceptions but these were all accidental cases where the victim had encountered the mishap of vagal inhibition while going about some sadomasochistic perversion these sexual nonconformists were usually found naked or clothed in female underwear with a spread of pornographic literature to sticky hand and were always men in herings case there was no such evidence of death by sexual misadventure his clothes were such as might have been chosen by his mother and his hands which were loose at his sides were unfettered eloquence to the effect that his homicide had been selfinflicted inspector strunck the bull who had interrogated me back at the alex explained the matter to heydrich and nebe we found this mans name and address in stahleckers pocket he said theres a bayonet wrapped in newspaper in the kitchen its covered in blood and from the look of it id say it was the knife that killed him theres also a bloodstained shirt that hering was probably wearing at the time anything else said nebe stahleckers shoulderholster was empty general said strunck perhaps gunther might like to tell us if this was his gun or not we found it in a paper bag with the shirt he handed me a walther ppk i put the muzzle to my nose and sniffed the gunoil then i worked the slide and saw that there wasnt even a bullet in the barrel although the magazine was full next i pulled down the triggerguard brunos initials were scratched neatly on the black metal its brunos gun all right i said it doesnt look like he even got his hand on it id like to see that shirt please strunck glanced at his reichskriminaldirektor for approval let him see it inspector said nebe the shirt was from c a and heavily bloodstained around the stomach area and the right cuff which seemed to confirm the general setup it does look as though this was the man who murdered your partner herr gunther said heydrich he came back here and having changed his clothes had a chance to reflect upon what hed done in a fit of remorse he hanged himself it would seem so i said without much uncertainty but if you dont mind general heydrich id like to take a look round the place on my own just to satisfy my curiosity about one or two things very well dont be too long will you with heydrich nebe and the police gone from the apartment i took a closer look at klaus herings body apparently he had tied a length of electrical cord to the banister slipped a noose over his head and then simply stepped off the stair but only an inspection of herings hands wrists and neck itself could tell me if that had really been what happened there was something about the circumstances of his death something i couldnt quite put my finger on that i found questionable not least was the fact that he had chosen to change his shirt before hanging himself i climbed over the banister on to a small shelf that was made by the top of the stairwells wall and knelt down leaning forward i had a good view of the suspension point behind herings right ear the level of tightening of the ligature is always higher and more vertical with a hanging than with a case of strangulation but here there was a second and altogether more horizontal mark just below the noose which seemed to confirm my doubts before hanging himself klaus hering had been strangled to death i checked that herings shirt collar was the same size as the bloodstained shirt i had examined earlier it was then i climbed back over the banister and stepped down a few stairs standing on tiptoe i reached up to examine his hands and wrists prising the right hand open i saw the dried blood and then a small shiny object which seemed to be sticking into the palm i pulled it out of herings flesh and laid it carefully on to the flat of my hand the pin was bent probably from the pressure of herings fist and although encrusted with blood the deathshead motif was unmistakable it was an s s cap badge i paused briefly trying to imagine what might have happened certain now that heydrich must have had a hand in it back in the garden at the prinz albrecht palais had he not asked me himself what my answer to his proposition would be if the obstacle that was my obligation to find brunos murderer were removed and wasnt this as completely removed as it was possible to achieve no doubt he had anticipated what my answer would be and had already ordered herings murder by the time we went for our stroll with these and other thoughts i searched the apartment i was quick but thorough lifting mattresses examining cisterns rolling back rugs and even leafing through a set of medical textbooks i managed to find a whole sheet of the old stamps commemorating the fifth anniversary of the nazis coming to power which had consistently appeared on the blackmail notes to frau lange but of her sons letters to dr kindermann there was no sign friday september it felt strange being back in a casemeeting at the alex and even stranger hearing arthur nebe refer to me as kommissar gunther five years had elapsed since the day in june when no longer able to tolerate goerings police purges i had resigned my rank of kriminalinspektor in order to become the house detective at the adlon hotel another few months and they would have probably fired me anyway if anyone had said then that id be back at the alex as a member of kripos upper officer class while a national socialist government was still in power id have said that he was crazy most of the people seated round the table would almost certainly have expressed the same opinion if their faces were anything to go by now hans lobbes the reichskriminaldirektors number three and head of kripo executive count fritz von der schulenberg deputy to berlins police president and representing the uniformed boys of orpo even the three officers from kripo one from vice and two from the murder commission who had been assigned to a new investigating team that was at my own request to be a small one all regarded me with a mixture of fear and loathing not that i blamed them much as far as they were concerned i was heydrichs spy in their position i would probably have felt much the same way there were two other people in attendance at my invitation which compounded the atmosphere of distrust one of these a woman was a forensic psychiatrist from the berlin charité hospital frau marie kalau vom hofe was a friend of arthur nebe himself something of a criminologist and attached officially to police headquarters as a consultant in matters of criminal psychology the other guest was hans illmann professor of forensic medicine at the friedrich wilhelm university in berlin and formerly senior pathologist at the alex until his cool hostility to nazism had obliged nebe to retire him even by nebes own admission illmann was better than any of the pathologists currently working at the alex and so at my request he had been invited to take charge of the forensic medical aspects of the case a spy a woman and a political dissident it needed only the stenographer to stand and sing the red flag for my new colleagues to believe that they were the subject of a practical joke nebe finished his longwinded introduction of me and the meeting was in my hands i shook my head i hate bureaucracy i said i loathe it but what is required here is a bureaucracy of information what is relevant will become clear later on information is the lifeblood of any criminal investigation and if that information is contaminated then you poison the whole investigative body i dont mind if a mans wrong about something in this game were nearly always wrong until were right but if i find a member of my team knowingly submitting wrong information it wont be a matter for a disciplinary tribunal ill kill him thats information you can depend on id also like to say this i dont care who did it jew nigger pansy stormtrooper hitler youth leader civil servant motorway construction worker its all the same to me just as long as he did do it which leads me to the subject of josef kahn in case any of you have forgotten hes the jew who confessed to the murders of brigitte hartmann christiana schulz and zarah lischka currently hes a paragraph fiftyone in the municipal lunatic asylum at herzeberge and one of the purposes of this meeting is to evaluate that confession in the light of the fourth murdered girl lotte winter at this point let me introduce you to professor hans illmann who has kindly agreed to act as the pathologist in this case for those of you who dont know him hes one of the best pathologists in the country so were very fortunate to have him working with us illmann nodded by way of acknowledgement and carried on with his perfect rollup he was a slight man with thin dark hair rimless glasses and a small chin beard he finished licking the paper and poked the rollup into his mouth as good as any machinemade cigarette i marvelled quietly medical brilliance counted for nothing beside this kind of subtle dexterity professor illmann will take us through his findings after kriminalassistant korsch has read the relevant case note i nodded at the dark stocky young man sitting opposite me there was something artificial about his face as if it had been made up for him by one of the police artists from sipo technical services with three definite features and very little else eyebrows joined in the middle and perched on his overhanging brows like a falcon preparing for flight a wizards long crafty chin and a small fairbanksstyle moustache korsch cleared his throat and began speaking in a voice that was an octave higher than i was expecting brigitte hartmann he read aged fifteen of german parents disappeared may body found in a potato sack on an allotment in siesdorf june she lived with her parents on the britz housing estate south of neukölln and had walked from her home to catch the ubahn at parchimerallee she was going to visit her aunt in reinickdorf the aunt was supposed to meet her at holzhauser strasse station only brigitte never arrived the station master at parchimer didnt remember her getting on the train but said that hed had a night on the beer and probably wouldnt have remembered anyway this drew a guffaw from along the table drunken bastard snorted hans lobbes this is one of the two girls who have since been buried said illmann quietly i dont think theres anything i can add to the findings of the autopsy there you may proceed herr korsch christiane schulz aged sixteen of german parents disappeared june body found july in a tramway tunnel that connects treptower park on the righthand bank of the spree with the village of stralau on the other half way along the tunnel theres a maintenance point little more than a recessed archway thats where the trackman found her body wrapped in an old tarpaulin apparently the girl was a singer and often took part in the bdm the league of german girls evening radio programme on the night of her disappearance she had attended the funkturm studios on masurenstrasse and sang a solo the hitler youth song at seven oclock the girls father works as an engineer at the arado aircraft works in brandenburgneuendorf and was supposed to pick her up on his way home at eight oclock but the car had a flat tyre and he was twenty minutes late by the time he got to the studios christiane was nowhere to be seen and supposing that she had gone home on her own he drove back to spandau when by she still hadnt arrived and having contacted her closest friends he called the police korsch glanced up at illmann and then myself he smoothed the vain little moustache and turned to the next page in the file that lay open in front of him zarah lischka he read aged sixteen of german parents disappeared july body found august down a drain in the tiergarten close to the siegessäule the family lived in antonstrasse wedding the father works at the slaughterhouse on landsbergerallee the girls mother sent her down to some shops located on lindowerstrasse close to the sbahn station the shopkeeper remembers serving her she bought some cigarettes although neither one of her parents smokes some blueband and a loaf of bread then she went to the pharmacy next door the owner also remembers her she bought some schwarzkopf extra blonde hair colourant sixty out of every hundred german girls use it i told myself almost automatically it was funny the sort of junk i was remembering these days i dont think i could have told you much of what was really important in the world other than what was happening in the german sudeten areas the riots and the nationality conferences in prague it remained to be seen whether or not what was happening in czechoslovakia was the only thing that really mattered after all illmann stubbed out his cigarette and began to read his findings the girl was naked and there were signs that her feet had been bound she had sustained two knife wounds to the throat nevertheless there existed strong indications that she had also been strangled probably to silence her it is likely that she was unconscious when the murderer cut her throat the bruising bisected by the wounds suggests as much and this is interesting from the amount of blood still in her feet and the crusted blood found inside her nose and on her hair as well as the fact that the feet had been very tightly bound it is my finding that the girl was hanging upside down when her throat was cut like a pig jesus said nebe from my examination of the case notes of the previous two victims it seems highly probable that the same modus operandi was applied there too the suggestion made by my predecessor that these girls had their throats cut while they lay flat on the ground is patently nonsense and takes no account of the abrasions to the ankles or the amount of blood left in the feet indeed it seems nothing short of negligent that is noted said arthur nebe writing your predecessor is in my opinion also an incompetent the girls vagina was undamaged and not penetrated continued illmann however the anus gaped wide permitting the passage of two fingers tests for spermatozoa proved positive somebody groaned the stomach was flacid and was empty apparently brigitte ate apfelkraut and breadandbutter for lunch before going to the station all food had been digested at the time of death but apple is not easily digested absorbing water as it does thus i would put this girls death at between six and eight hours after she ate lunch and therefore a couple of hours after she was reported missing the obvious conclusion is that she was abducted and then later killed i looked at korsch and the last one please herr korsch lotte winter he said aged sixteen of german parents disappeared july her body found august she lived in pragerstrasse and attended the local grammar school where she was studying for her middle standard she left home to have a riding lesson with tattersalls at the zoo and never arrived her body was found inside the length of an old canoe in a boathouse near muggel lake our man gets around doesnt he said count von der schulenberg quietly like the black death said lobbes illmann took over once again strangled he said resulting in fractures of voice box hyoid thyroid cornua and alae indicating a greater degree of violence than in the case of the schulz girl this girl was stronger being more athletically inclined in the first place she may have put up more of a fight suffocation was the cause of death here although the carotid artery on the right side of her neck had been slashed as before the feet showed signs of having been tied together and there was blood in the hair and nostrils undoubtedly she was hanging upside down when her throat was cut and similarly her body was almost drained of blood sounds like a fucking vampire exclaimed one of the detectives from the murder commission he glanced at frau kalau vom hofe sorry he added she shook her head any sexual interference i asked because of the disagreeable odour the girls vagina had to be irrigated announced illmann to more groans and so no sperm could be found however the vaginal entrance did show scratch marks and there was a trace of bruising to the pelvis indicating that she had been penetrated and forcibly before her throat was cut i asked illmann nodded the room was silent for a moment illmann set about fixing another rollup and now another girl has disappeared i said is that not correct inspector deubel deubel shifted uncomfortably in his chair he was a big blond fellow with grey haunted eyes that looked as though they had seen too much latenight policework of the kind that requires you to wear thick leather protective gloves yes sir he said her name is irma hanke well since you are the investigating officer perhaps you would care to tell us something about her he shrugged shes from a nice german family aged seventeen lives in schloss strasse steglitz he paused as his eye nicked down his notes disappeared wednesday august having left the house to collect for the reich economy programme on behalf of the bdm he paused again and what was she collecting said the count old toothpaste tubes sir i believe that the metal is thank you inspector i know what the scrap value of toothpaste tubes is yes sir he glanced at his notes again she was reported as having been seen on feuerbachstrasse thorwaldsenstrasse and munster damm munster damm runs south beside a cemetery and the sexton there says he saw a bdm girl answering irmas description walking there at about pm he thought she was heading west in the direction of bismarckstrasse she was probably returning home having said to her parents that she would be back at around she never arrived of course any leads i asked none sir he said firmly thank you inspector i lit a cigarette and then held the match to illmanns rollup very well then i puffed so what we have are five girls all of them about the same age and all of them conforming to the aryan stereotype that we know and love so well in other words they all had blonde hair naturally or otherwise now after our third rhine maiden is murdered josef kahn gets himself arrested for the attempted rape of a prostitute in other words he tried to leave without paying typical jew said lobbes there were a few laughs at that as it happened kahn was carrying a knife quite a sharp one at that and he even has a minor criminal record for small theft and indecent assault very convenient so the arresting officer at grolmanstrasse police station namely one inspector willi oehme decides to turn a few cards and see if he cant make twentyone he has a chat with young josef whos a bit soft in the head and what with his honeytongue and his thick knuckles willi manages to persuade josef to sign a confession gentlemen here id like to introduce you all to frau kalau vom hofe i say frau as shes not allowed to call herself a doctor although she is one because she is very evidently a woman and we all know dont we that a womans place is in the home producing recruits for the party and cooking the old mans dinner she is in fact a psychotherapist and is an acknowledged expert on that unfathomable little mystery that we refer to as the criminal mind my eyes looked and licked at the creamy woman who sat at the far end of the table she wore a magnolia skirt and a white marocain blouse and her fair hair was pinned up in a tight bun at the back of her finely sculpted head she smiled at my introduction and took a file out of her briefcase and opened it in front of her when josef kahn was a child she said he contracted acute encephalitis lethargica which occurred in epidemic form among children in western europe between and this produced a gross change in his personality after the acute phase of the illness children may become increasingly restless irritable aggressive even and appear to lose all moral sense they beg steal lie and are often cruel they talk incessantly and become unmanageable at school and at home abnormal sexual curiosity and sexual problems are often observed postencephalitic adolescents sometimes show certain features of this syndrome especially the lack of sexual restraint and this is certainly true in josef kahns case he is also developing parkinsonism which will result in his increased physical debilitation count von der schulenberg yawned and looked at his wristwatch but the doctor was not deterred instead she seemed to find his bad manners amusing despite his apparent criminality she said i do not think that josef killed any of these girls having discussed the forensic evidence with professor illmann i am of the opinion that these killings show a level of premeditation of which kahn is simply incapable kahn is capable only of the kind of frenzied murder that would have had him leave the victim where she fell illmann nodded an analysis of his statement reveals a number of discrepancies with the known facts he said his statement says that he used a stocking for the strangulations the evidence however shows quite clearly that bare hands were used he says that he stabbed his victims in the stomach the evidence shows that none of them was stabbed that they were all slashed across the throat then there is the fact that the fourth murder must have occurred while kahn was in custody could this murder be the work of a different killer someone copying the first three no because there has been no press coverage of the first three to copy and no because the similarities between all four murders are too strong they are all the work of the same man he smiled at frau kalau vom hofe is there anything you wish to add to that madam only that that man could not possibly be josef kahn she said and that josef kahn has been the subject of a form of fraud that one might have thought was impossible in the third reich there was a smile on her mouth as she closed her file and sat back in her chair opening her cigarette case smoking like being a doctor was something else that women werent supposed to do but i could see that it wasnt the sort of thing that would have given her too many qualms it was the count who spoke next in the light of this information may one inquire of the reichskriminaldirektor if the ban on newsreporting that has applied in this case will now be lifted his belt creaked as he leant across the table apparently eager to hear nebes reply the son of a wellknown general who was now the ambassador to moscow young von der schulenberg was impeccably wellconnected when nebe didnt answer he added i dont see how one can possibly impress upon the parents of girls in berlin the need for caution without some sort of official statement in the newspapers naturally i will make sure that every anwärter on the force is made aware of the need for vigilance on the street however it would be easier for my men in orpo if there were some assistance from the reich ministry of propaganda its an accepted fact in criminology said nebe smoothly that publicity can act as an encouragement to a murderer like this as im sure frau kalau vom hofe will confirm thats correct she said mass murderers do seem to like to read about themselves in the newspapers however nebe continued i will make a point of telephoning the muratti building today and asking them if there is not some propaganda that can be directed towards young girls being made more aware of the need to be careful at the same time any such campaign would have to receive the blessing of the obergruppenführer he is most anxious that there is nothing said which might create a panic amongst german women the count nodded and now he said looking at me i have a question for the kommissar he smiled but i wasnt about to place too much reliance on it he gave every impression of having attended the same school in supercilious sarcasm as obergruppenführer heydrich mentally i lifted my guard in readiness for the first punch as the detective who ingeniously solved the celebrated case of gormann the strangler will he share with us now his initial thoughts in this particular case the colourless smile persisted beyond what might have seemed comfortable as if he was straining at his tight sphincter at least i assumed it was tight as the deputy of a former s a man count wolf von helldorf who was reputed to be as queer as the late s a boss ernst rohm schulenberg might well have had the kind of arse that would have tempted a shortsighted pickpocket sensing that there was even more to be made of this disingenuous line of inquiry he added perhaps an indication as to the kind of character we might be looking for i think i can help the administrative president there said frau kalau vom hofe the counts head jerked irritatedly in her direction she reached down into her briefcase and laid a large book on to the table and then another and another until there was a pile as high as one of von der schulenbergs highly polished jackboots anticipating just such a question i took the liberty of bringing along several books dealing with the psychology of the criminal she said heindls professional criminal wulffens excellent handbook of sexual delinquency hirschfelds sexual pathology f alexanders the criminal and his judges this was too much for him he collected his papers off the table and stood up smiling nervously another time perhaps frau vom hofe he said then he clicked his heels bowed stiffly to the room and left bastard muttered lobbes its quite all right she said adding some copies of the german police journal to the pile of textbooks you cant teach hans what he wont learn i smiled appreciating her cool resilience as well as the fine breasts which strained at the material of her blouse after the meeting was concluded i lingered there a little in order to be alone with her he asked a good question i said one to which i didnt have much of an answer thanks for coming to my assistance when you did please dont mention it she said starting to return some of her books to the briefcase i picked one of them up and glanced at it you know id be interested to hear your answer can i buy you a drink she looked at her watch yes she smiled id like that die letze instanz at the end of klosterstrasse on the old city wall was a local bar much favoured by bulls from the alex and court officials from the nearby court of last instance from which the place took its name inside it was all darkbrown woodpanelled walls and flagged floors near the bar with its great draught pump of yellow ceramic on top of which stood the figure of a seventeenthcentury soldier was a large seat made of green brown and yellow tiles all with moulded figures and heads it had the look of a very cold and uncomfortable throne and on it sat the bars owner warnstorff a paleskinned darkhaired man wearing a collarless shirt and a capacious leather apron that was also his bag of change when we arrived he greeted me warmly and showed us to a quiet table in the back where he brought us a couple of beers at another table a man was dealing vigorously with the biggest piece of pigs knuckle either of us had ever seen are you hungry i asked her not now ive seen him she said yes i know what you mean it does put you off rather doesnt it youd think he was trying to win the iron cross the way hes battling that joint she smiled and we were silent for a moment eventually she said do you think theres going to be a war i stared into the top of my beer as if expecting the answer to float to the surface i shrugged and shook my head i havent really been keeping that close an eye on things lately i said and explained about bruno stahlecker and my return to kripo but shouldnt i be asking you as the expert on criminal psychology you should have a better appreciation of the führers mind than most people would you say his behaviour was compulsive or irresistible within the definition of paragraph fiftyone of the criminal code it was her turn to search for inspiration in a glass of beer we dont really know each other well enough for this kind of conversation do we she said i suppose not i will say this though she said lowering her voice have you ever read mein kampf that funny old book they give free to all newlyweds its the best reason to stay single i can think of well i have read it and one of the things i noticed was that there is one passage as long as seven pages in which hitler makes repeated references to venereal disease and its effects indeed he actually says that the elimination of venereal disease is the task that faces the german nation my god are you saying that hes syphilitic im not saying anything im just telling you what is written in the führers great book but the books been around since the midtwenties if hes had a hot tail since then his syphilis would have to be tertiary it might interest you to know she said that many of josef kahns fellow inmates at the herzeberge asylum are those whose organic dementia is a direct result of their syphilis contradictory statements can be made and accepted the mood varies between euphoria and apathy and there is general emotional instability the classic type is characterized by a demented euphoria delusions of grandeur and bouts of extreme paranoia christ the only thing you left out was the crazy moustache i said i lit a cigarette and puffed at it dismally for gods sake change the subject lets talk about something cheerful like our massmurdering friend do you know im beginning to see his point i really am i mean these are tomorrows young mothers hes killing more childbearing machines to produce new party recruits me im all for these byproducts of the asphalt civilization theyre always on about the childless families with eugenically dud women at least until weve got rid of this regime of rubber truncheons whats one more psychopath among so many you say more than you know she said were all of us capable of cruelty every one of us is a latent criminal life is just a battle to maintain a civilized skin many sadistic killers find that its only occasionally that it comes off peter kürten for example he was apparently a man of such a kindly disposition that nobody who knew him could believe that he was capable of such horrific crimes as he committed she rummaged in her briefcase again and having wiped the table she laid a thin blue book between our two glasses this book is by carl berg a forensic pathologist who had the opportunity of studying kürten at length following his arrest ive met berg and respect his work he founded the düsseldorf institute of legal and social medicine and for a while he was the medicolegal officer of the düsseldorf criminal court this book the sadist is probably one of the best accounts of the mind of the murderer that has ever been written you can borrow it if you like thanks i will that will help you to understand she said but to enter into the mind of a man like kürten you should read this again she dipped into the bag of books les fleurs du mal i read by charles baudelaire i opened it and looked over the verses poetry i raised an eyebrow oh dont look so suspicious kommissar im being perfectly serious its a good translation and youll find a lot more in it than you might expect believe me she smiled at me i havent read poetry since i studied goethe at school and what was your opinion of him do frankfurt lawyers make good poets its an interesting critique she said well lets hope you think better of baudelaire and now im afraid i must be going she stood up and we shook hands when youve finished with the books you can return them to me at the goering institute on budapesterstrasse were just across the road from the zoo aquarium id certainly be interested to hear a detectives opinion of baudelaire she said it will be my pleasure and you can tell me your opinion of dr lanz kindermann kindermann you know lanz kindermann in a way she gave me a judicious sort of look you know for a police kommissar you are certainly full of surprises you certainly are sunday september i prefer my tomatoes when theyve still got some green left in them then theyre sweet and firm with smooth cool skins the sort you would choose for a salad but when a tomato has been around for a while it picks up a few wrinkles as it grows too soft to handle and even begins to taste a little sour its the same with women only this one was perhaps a shade green for me and possibly rather too cool for her own good she stood at my front door and gave me an impertinent sort of northtosouthandbackagain look as if she was trying to assess my prowess or lack of it as a lover yes i said what do you want im collecting for the reich she explained playing games with her eyes she held a bag of material out as if to corroborate her story the party economy programme oh the concierge let me in i can see that exactly what would you like she raised an eyebrow at that and i wondered if her father thought she wasnt still young enough for him to spank well what have you got there was a quiet mockery in her tone she was pretty in a sulky sultry sort of way in civilian clothes she might have passed for a girl of twenty but with her two pigtails and dressed in the sturdy boots long navy skirt trim white blouse and brown leather jacket of the bdm the league of german girls i guessed her to be no more than sixteen ill have a look and see what i can find i said half amused at her grownup manner which seemed to confirm what you sometimes heard of bdm girls which was that they were sexually promiscuous and just as likely to get themselves pregnant at hitler youth camp as they were to learn needlework first aid and german folk history i suppose you had better come in the girl sauntered through the door as if she were trailing a mink wrap and gave the hall a cursory examination she didnt seem to be much impressed nice place she murmured quietly i closed the door and laid my cigarette in the ashtray on the hall table wait here i told her i went into the bedroom and foraged under the bed for the suitcase where i kept old shirts and threadbare towels not to mention all my spare house dust and carpet fluff when i stood up and brushed myself off she was leaning in the doorway and smoking my cigarette insolently she blew a perfect smokering towards me i thought you faithandbeauty girls werent supposed to smoke i said trying to conceal my irritation is that a fact she smirked there are quite a few things were not encouraged to do were not supposed to do this were not supposed to do that just about everything seems to be wicked these days doesnt it but what i always say is if you cant do the wicked things when youre still young enough to enjoy them then whats the point of doing them at all she jerked herself away from the wall and stalked out quite the little bitch i thought following her into the sittingroom next door she inhaled noisily like she was sucking at a spoonful of soup and blew another smokering in my face if i could have caught it i would have wrapped it round her pretty little neck anyway she said i hardly think one little drummer is going to knock over the heap do you i laughed do i look like the sort of dogs ear who would smoke cheap cigarettes no i suppose not she admitted whats your name plato plato it suits you well plato you can kiss me if you want you dont creep around it do you havent you heard the nicknames they have for the bdm the german mattress league commodities for german men she put her arms about my neck and performed a variety of coquettish expressions shed probably practised in front of her dressingtable mirror her hot young breath tasted stale but i let myself equal the competence in her kiss just to be affable my hands squeezing at her young breasts kneading the nipples with my fingers then i cupped her chubby behind in both my moistening palms and drew her closer to what was increasingly on my mind her naughty eyes went round as she pressed herself against me i cant honestly say i wasnt tempted do you know any good bedtime stories plato she giggled no i said tightening my grip on her but i know plenty of bad ones the kind where the beautiful but spoilt princess gets boiled alive and eaten up by the wicked troll a vague glimmer of doubt began to grow in the bright blue iris of each corrupt eye and her smile was no longer wholly confident as i hauled up her skirt and started to tug her pants down oh i could tell you lots of stories like that i said darkly the sort of stories that policemen tell their daughters horrible gruesome stories that give girls the kind of nightmares which their fathers can be glad of stop it she laughed nervously youre frightening me certain now that things werent going quite to plan she reached desperately for her pants as i yanked them down her legs exposing the fledgling that nestled in her groin theyre glad because it means that their pretty little daughters will be much too scared to ever go into a strange mans house just in case he should turn into a wicked troll please mister dont she said i smacked her bare bottom and pushed her away so its lucky for you princess that im a detective and not a troll otherwise youd be ketchup youre a policeman she gulped tears welling up in her eyes thats right im a policeman and if i ever find you playing the apprentice snapper again ill see to it that your father takes a stick to you understand yes she whispered and quickly pulled up her pants i picked up the pile of old shirts and towels from where i had dropped them on the floor and pushed them into her arms now get out of here before i do the job myself she ran into the hall and out of the apartment in terror as if i had been niebelung himself after id closed the door on her the smell and touch of that delicious little body and the frustrated desire of it remained with me for as long as it took to pour myself a drink and take a cold bath that september it seemed that passion everywhere already smouldering like a rotten fusebox was easily ignited and i wished that the hot blood of sudeten germans in czechoslovakia could have been as easily dealt with as was my own excitation as a bull you learn to expect an increase in crime during hot weather in january and february even the most desperate criminals stay home in front of the fire reading professor bergs book the sadist later on that same day i wondered how many lives had been saved simply because it was too cold or too wet for kürten to venture out of doors still nine murders seven attempted murders and forty acts of arson was an impressive enough record according to berg kürten the product of a violent home had come to crime at an early age committing a string of petty larcenies and enduring several periods of imprisonment until at the age of thirtyeight he had married a woman of strong character he had always had sadistic impulses being inclined to torture cats and other dumb animals and now he was obliged to keep these tendencies in a mental straitjacket but when his wife was not at home kürtens evil demon at times grew too powerful to restrain and he was driven to commit the terrible and sadistic crimes for which he was to become infamous this sadism was sexual in its origin berg explained kürtens home circumstances had rendered him predisposed to a deviation of the sexual urge and his early experiences had all helped to condition the direction of that urge in the twelve months that separated kürtens capture and his execution berg had met frequently with kürten and found him to be a man of notable character and talent he was possessed of considerable charm and intelligence an excellent memory and keen powers of observation indeed berg was moved to remark upon the mans accessibility another outstanding characteristic was kürtens vanity which manifested itself in his smart wellcared for appearance and in his delight at having outwitted the düsseldorf police for as long as he had cared to do so bergs conclusion was not a particularly comfortable one for any civilized member of society kürten was not mad within the terms of paragraph fiftyone in that his acts were neither completely compulsive nor wholly irresistible so much as pure unadulterated cruelty if that wasnt bad enough reading baudelaire left me feeling as comfortable in my soul as a bullock in an abattoir it didnt require a superhuman effort of imagination to accept frau kalau vom hofes suggestion that this rather gothic french poet provided an explicit articulation of the mind of a landru a gormann or a kürten yet there was something more here something deeper and more universal than merely a clue as to the psyche of the mass murderer in baudelaires interest in violence in his nostalgia for the past and through his revelation of the world of death and corruption i heard the echo of a satanic litany that was altogether more contemporary and saw the pale reflection of a different kind of criminal one whose spleen had the force of law i dont have much of a memory for words i can barely remember the words of the national anthem but some of these verses stayed in my head like the persistent smell of mingled musk and tar that evening i drove down to see brunos widow katia at their home in berlinzehlendorf this was my second visit since brunos death and i brought some of his things from the office as well as a letter from my insurance company acknowledging receipt of the claim i had made on katias behalf there was even less to say now than before but nevertheless i stayed for a full hour holding katias hand and trying to swallow the lump in my throat with several glasses of schnapps hows heinrich taking it i said uncomfortably hearing the unmistakable sound of the boy singing in his bedroom he hasnt talked about it yet said katia her grief giving way a little to embarrassment i think he sings because he wants to escape from having to face up to it grief affects people very differently i said scraping around for some sort of excuse but i didnt think this was true at all to my own fathers premature death when i hadnt been much older than heinrich was now had been appended as its brutal corollary the inescapable logic that i was myself not immortal ordinarily i would not have been insensitive to heinrichs situation but why must he sing that song hes got it into his head that the jews had something to do with his fathers death thats absurd i said katia sighed and shook her head ive told him that bernie but he wont listen on my way out i lingered at the boys doorway listening to his strong young voice load up the empty guns and polish up the knives lets kill the jewish bastards who poison all our lives for a moment i was tempted to open the door and belt the young thug on the jaw but what was the point what was the point of doing anything but leave him alone there are so many ways of escaping from that which one fears and not the least of these is hatred monday september a badge a warrant card an office on the third floor and apart from the number of s s uniforms there were about the place it almost felt like old times it was too bad that there were not many happy memories but happiness was never an emotion in plentiful supply at the alex unless your idea of a party involved working on a kidney with a chairleg a couple of times men i knew from the old days stopped me in the corridor to say hallo and how sorry they were to hear about bruno but mostly i got the kind of looks that might have greeted an undertaker in a cancer ward deubel korsch and becker were waiting for me in my office deubel was explaining the subtle technique of the cigarette punch to his junior officers thats right he said when hes putting the nail in his guzzler you give him the uppercut an open jaw breaks real easy how nice to hear that criminal investigation is keeping up with modern times i said as i came through the door i suppose you learned that in the freikorps deubel the man smiled youve been reading my schoolreport sir ive been doing a lot of reading i said sitting down at my desk never been much of a reader myself he said you surprise me youve been reading that womans books sir said korsch the ones that explain the criminal mind this one doesnt take much explanation said deubel hes a fucking spinner maybe i said but were not about to catch him with blackjacks and brass knuckles you can forget all your usual methods cigarette punches and things like that i stared hard at deubel a killer like this is difficult to catch because for most of the time at least he looks and behaves like an ordinary citizen and with none of the hallmarks of criminality and no obvious motive we cant rely on informers to help us get on his track kriminalassistent becker on loan from department vb vice shook his head if youll forgive me sir he said thats not quite true dealing with sexual deviants there are a few informers buttfuckers and dollyboys its true but now and again they do come up with the goods ill bet they do deubel muttered all right i said well talk to them but first there are two aspects to this case that i want us all to consider one is that these girls disappear and then their bodies are found all over the city well that tells me that our killer is using a car the other aspect is that as far as i am aware weve never had any reports of anyone witnessing the abduction of a victim no reports of a girl being dragged kicking and screaming into the back of a car that seems to me to indicate that maybe they went willingly with the killer that they werent afraid now its unlikely that they all knew the killer but quite possibly they might have trusted him because of what he was a priest maybe said korsch or a youth leader or a bull i said its quite possible he could be any one of those things or all of them you think he might be disguising himself said korsch i shrugged i think that we have to keep an open mind about all of these things korsch i want you to check through the records and see if you cant match anyone with a record for sexual assault with either a uniform a church or a car licence plate he sagged a little its a big job i know so ive spoken to lobbes in kripo executive and hes going to get you some help i looked at my wristwatch kriminaldirektor müller is expecting you over in vc in about ten minutes so youd better get going nothing on the hanke girl yet i said to deubel when korsch had gone my men have looked everywhere he said the railway embankments the parks waste ground weve dragged the teltow canal twice theres not a lot more we can do he lit a cigarette and grimaced shes dead by now everyone knows it i want you to conduct a doortodoor inquiry throughout the area where she disappeared speak to everyone and i mean everyone including the girls schoolfriends somebody must have seen something take some photographs to jog a few memories if you dont mind me saying sir he growled thats surely a job for the uniformed boys in orpo those malletheads are good for arresting drunks and garterhandlers i said but this is a job requiring intelligence thats all pulling another face deubel stubbed out his cigarette in a way that let me know he wished the ashtray could have been my face and dragged himself reluctantly out of my office better mind what you say about orpo to deubel sir said becker hes a friend of dummy dalueges they were in the same stettin freikorps regiment the freikorps were paramilitary organizations of exsoldiers which had been formed after the war to destroy bolshevism in germany and to protect german borders from the encroachments of the poles kurt dummy daluege was the chief of orpo thanks i read his file he used to be a good bull but these days he works an easy shift and then pushes off home all eberhard deubel wants out of life is to live long enough to collect his pension and see his daughter grow up to marry the local bank manager the alex has got plenty like him i said youve got children havent you becker a son sir he said proudly norfried hes nearly two norfried eh that sounds german enough my wife sir shes very keen on this aryan thing of dr rosenbergs and how does she feel about you working in vice we dont talk much about what happens in my job as far as she is concerned im just a bull so tell me about these sexualdeviant informers while i was in section m the brothel surveillance squad we only used one or two he explained but meisingers queer squad use them all the time he depends on informers a few years ago there was a homosexual organization called the friendship league with about members well meisinger got hold of the entire list and still leans on a name now and then for information he also has the confiscated subscription lists of several pornographic magazines as well as the names of the publishers we might try a couple of them sir then there is reichsführer himmlers ferriswheel its an electrically powered rotating cardindex with thousands and thousands of names on it sir we could always see what came up on that it sounds like something a gypsy fortuneteller would use they say that himmlers keen on that shit and what about a man whos keen on nudging something where are all the bees in this city now that all the brothels have been closed down massage parlours you want to give a girl some bird youve got to let her rub your back first kuhn hes the boss of m he doesnt bother them much you want to ask a few snappers if theyd had to massage any spinners lately sir its as good a place to start as any i can think of well need an ewarrant a search for missing persons better go and get one becker becker was tall with small bored blue eyes a thin strawhat of yellow hair a doglike nose and a mocking almost manic smile his looked a cynical sort of face which was indeed the case in beckers everyday conversation there was more blasphemy against the divine beauty of life than you would have found among a pack of starving hyenas reasoning that it was still too early for the massagetrade we decided to try the dirtybook brigade first and from the alex we drove south to hallesches tor wende hoas was a tall grey building close to the sbahn railway we went up to the top floor where with manic smile firmly in place becker kicked in one of the doors a tubby prim little man with a monocle and a moustache looked up from his chair and smiled nervously as we walked into his office ah herr becker he said come in come in and youve brought a friend with you excellent there wasnt much room in the mustysmelling room tall stacks of books and magazines surrounded the desk and filing cabinet i picked up a magazine and started to flick through it hallo helmut becker chuckled picking up another he grunted with satisfaction as he turned the pages this is filthy he laughed help yourselves gentlemen said the man called helmut if theres anything special youre looking for just ask dont be shy he leant back in his chair and from the pocket of his dirty grey waistcoat he produced a snuff box which he opened with a flick of his dirty thumbnail he helped himself to a pinch an indulgence which was effected with as much offence to the ear as any of the printed matter that might have been available was to the eye in close but poorly photographed gynaecological detail the magazine i was looking at was partly given over to text that was designed to strain the flybuttons if it was to be believed young german nurses copulated with no more thought than the average alleycat becker tossed his magazine on to the floor and picked up another the virgins wedding night he read not your sort of thing herr becker helmut said the story of a dildo that ones not at all bad raped on the ubahn ah now that is good there is a girl in that one with the juiciest plum ive ever seen and youve seen a few havent you helmut the man smiled modestly and looked over beckers shoulder as he gave the photographs close attention rather a nice girlnextdoor type dont you think becker snorted if you happen to live next door to a fucking dog kennel oh very good helmut laughed and started to clean his monocle as he did so a long and extremely grey length of his lank brown hair disengaged itself from a poorly disguised baldpatch like a quilt slipping off a bed and dangled ridiculously beside one of his transparent red ears were looking for a man who likes mutilating young girls i said would you have anything catering for that sort of pervert helmut smiled and shook his head sadly no sir im afraid not we dont much care to deal for the sadistic end of the market we leave the whipping and bestiality to others like hell you do becker sneered i tried the filing cabinet which was locked whats in here a few papers sir the pettycash box the account books that sort of thing nothing to interest you i think open it really sir theres nothing of any interest the words dried in his mouth as he saw the cigarette lighter in my hand i thumbed the bezel and held it underneath the magazine id been reading it burned with a slow blue flame becker how much would you say this magazine was oh theyre expensive sir at least ten reichsmarks each there must be a couple of thousands worth of stock in this rathole easily be a shame if there was a fire i hope hes insured you want to see inside the cabinet said helmut you only had to ask he handed becker the key as i dropped the blazing magazine harmlessly into the metal wastepaper bin there was nothing in the top drawer besides a cash box but in the bottom drawer was another pile of pornographic magazines becker picked one up and turned back the plain front cover virgin sacrifice he said reading the title page take a look at this sir he showed me a series of photographs depicting the degradation and punishment of a girl who looked to be of highschool age by an old and ugly man wearing an illfitting toupee the weals his cane had left on her bare backside seemed very real indeed nasty i said you understand i am merely the distributor helmut said blowing his nose on a filthy handkerchief not the manufacturer one photograph was particularly interesting in it the naked girl was bound hand and foot and lying on a church altar like a human sacrifice her vagina had been penetrated with an enormous cucumber becker looked fiercely at helmut but you know who produced it dont you helmut remained silent only until becker grabbed him by the throat and started to slap him across the mouth please dont hit me youre probably enjoying it you ugly little pervert he snarled wanning to his work come on talk to me or youll talk to this he snatched a short rubber truncheon from his pocket and pressed it against helmuts face it was poliza shouted helmut becker squeezed his face say again theodor poliza hes a photographer he has a studio on schiffbauerdamm next to the comedy theatre hes the one you want if youre lying to us helmut said becker grinding the rubber against helmuts cheek well be back and well not only set fire to your stock but you with it i hope youve got that he pushed him away helmut dabbed at his bleeding mouth with the handkerchief yes sir he said i understand when we were outside again i spat into the gutter gives you a nasty taste in the mouth doesnt it sir makes me glad i didnt have a daughter really it does id like to have said that i agreed with him there only i didnt we drove north what a city it was for its public buildings as immense as grey granite mountains they built them big just to remind you of the importance of the state and the comparative insignificance of the individual that just shows you how this whole business of national socialism got started its hard not to be overawed by a government any government that is accommodated in such grand buildings and the long wide avenues that ran straight from one district to another seemed to have been made for nothing else but columns of marching soldiers quickly recovering my stomach i told becker to stop the car at a cookedmeat shop on friedrichstrasse and bought us both a plate of lentil soup standing at one of the little counters we watched berlin housewives lining up to buy their sausage which lay coiled on the long marble counter like the rusted springs from some enormous motor car or grew off the tiled walls in great bunches like overripe bananas becker may have been married but he hadnt lost his eye for the ladies passing some sort of nearly obscene comment about most of the women who came into the shop while we were there and it hadnt escaped my attention that hed helped himself to a couple of pornographic magazines how could it have he didnt try to hide them slap a mans face make his mouth bleed threaten him with an india rubber call him a filthy degenerate and then help yourself to some of his dirty books thats what being in kripo was all about we went back to the car do you know this poliza character i said weve met he said what can i tell you about him except that hes shit on your shoe the comedy theatre on schiffbauerdamm was on the north side of the spree a towertopped relic ornamented with alabaster tritons dolphins and assorted naked nymphs and polizas studio was in a basement nearby we went down some stairs and into a long alleyway outside the door to polizas studio we were met by a man wearing a creamcoloured blazer a pair of green trousers a cravat of lime silk and a red carnation no amount of care or expense had been spared with his appearance but the overall effect was so lacking in taste that he looked like a gypsy grave poliza took one look at us and decided that we werent there selling vacuumcleaners he wasnt much of a runner his bottom was too big his legs were too short and his lungs were probably too hard but by the time we realized what was happening he was nearly ten metres down the alley you bastard muttered becker the voice of logic must have told poliza he was being stupid that becker and i were easily capable of catching him but it was probably so hoarsened by fear that it sounded as disquietingly unattractive as we ourselves must have appeared there was no such voice for becker hoarse or otherwise yelling at poliza to stop he broke into a smooth and powerful running action i struggled to keep up with him but after only a few strides he was well ahead of me another few seconds and he would have caught the man then i saw the gun in his hand a longbarrelled parabellum and yelled at both men to stop almost immediately poliza came to a halt he began to raise his arms as if to cover his ears against the noise of the gunshot turning as he collapsed blood and aqueous humour spilling gelatinously from the bullets exit wound in his eye or what was left of it we stood over polizas dead body what is it with you i said breathlessly have you got corns are your shoes too tight or maybe you didnt think your lungs were up to it listen becker ive got ten years on you and i could have caught this man if id been wearing a deepseadivers suit becker sighed and shook his head christ im sorry sir he said i only meant to wing him he glanced awkwardly at his pistol almost as if he didnt quite believe it could have just killed a man wing him what were you aiming at his earlobe listen becker when you try and wing a man unless youre buffalo bill you aim at his legs not try and give him a fucking haircut i looked around embarrassed almost expecting a crowd to have gathered but the alley stayed empty i nodded down at his pistol what is that cannon anyway becker raised the gun artillery parabellum sir shit havent you ever heard of the geneva convention thats enough gun to drill for oil i told him to go and telephone the cannedmeat wagon and while he was away i took a look around polizas studio there wasnt much to see an assortment of opencrotch shots drying on a line in the darkroom a collection of whips chains manacles and an altar complete with candlesticks of the sort that i had seen in the photographed series of the girl with the cucumber a couple of piles of magazines like the ones we had found back at helmuts office nothing to indicate that poliza might have murdered five schoolgirls when i went outside again i found that becker had returned with a uniformed policeman a sergeant the pair of them stood looking at polizas body like two small boys regarding a dead cat in the gutter the sergeant even poking at polizas side with the toe of his boot right through the window i heard the man say with what sounded like admiration i never realized there was so much jelly in there its a mess isnt it said becker without much enthusiasm they looked up as i walked towards them wagon coming becker nodded good you can make your report later i spoke to the sergeant until it arrives youll stay here with the body sergeant he straightened up yes sir you finished admiring your handiwork sir said becker then lets go we walked back to the car where are we going id like to check on a couple of these massage parlours evona wylezynskas the one to talk to she owns several places takes per cent of everything the girls make most likely shell be at her place on richard wagner strasse richard wagner strasse i said where the hell is that it used to be sesenheimerstrasse running on to spreestrasse you know where the opera house is i suppose that we should count ourselves lucky that its opera hitler loves and not football becker grinned driving there he seemed to recover some of his spirits do you mind if i ask you a really personal question sir i shrugged go right ahead but if it works out i might have to put my answer in an envelope and mail it to you instead well its this have you ever fucked a jew sir i looked at him trying to catch his eye but he kept both of them determinedly on the road no i cant say i have but it certainly wasnt the race laws that prevented it i guess i just never met one who wanted to fuck me so you wouldnt object if you got the chance i shrugged i dont suppose i would i paused waiting for him to go on but he didnt so i said why do you ask as a matter of fact becker smiled over the steeringwheel theres a little jewish snapper at this rubjoint were going to he said enthusiastically a real scorcher shes got a plum thats like the inside of a congereel just one long piece of suction muscle the kind to suck you in like a minnow and blow you right out of her arse best bit of damned plum ive ever had he shook his head doubtfully i dont reckon theres anything to beat a nice ripe jewess not even a niggerwoman or a chink i never knew you were so broadminded becker i said or so damned cosmopolitan christ i bet youve even read goethe becker laughed at that one he seemed to have quite forgotten poliza one thing about evona he said she wont talk unless we relax a little if you know what i mean have a drink take things easy act like were not in a hurry the minute we start to act like a couple of official stiffs in our trousers shell haul down the shutters and start polishing the mirrors in the bedrooms well theres a lot of people like that these days like i always say people wont put their fingers near the stove if they figure youre stewing a broth evona wylezynska was a pole with an eton crop smelling lightly of macassar oil and a dangerous crevasse of cleavage although it was only the midafternoon she wore a peignoir of peachcoloured voile over a matching heavy satin slip and highheeled slippers she greeted becker like he was there with a rent rebate darling emil she cooed such a long time since we seen you here where have you been hiding im off vice now he explained kissing her on the cheek what a shame and you were so good at it she gave me a litmuspaper sort of look as if i was something that might stain the expensive carpet and who is this youve brought us its all right evona hes a friend does your friend have a name and does he not know to take his hat off when he comes into a ladys house i let that one go and took it off bernhard gunther frau wylezynska i said and shook her hand pleased to meet you darling im sure her thickly accented languorous voice seemed to start somewhere near the bottom of her corset the faint outline of which i could just about make out underneath her slip by the time it got to her pouting mouth it had more tease than a fairys kitten the mouth was giving me quite a few problems too it was the kind of mouth that can eat a fivecourse dinner at kempinskis without spoiling its lipstick only on this occasion i seemed to be the preoccupation of its tastebuds she ushered us into a comfortable sittingroom that wouldnt have embarrassed a potsdam lawyer and stalked towards the enormous drinks tray what will you have gentlemen i have absolutely everything becker guffawed loudly theres no doubt about that he said i smiled thinly becker was starting to irritate me badly i asked for a scotch whisky and as evona handed me my glass her cold fingers touched mine she took a mouthful of her own drink as if it were unpleasant medicine to be hurried down and tugged me on to a big leather sofa becker chuckled and sat down on an armchair beside us and how is my old friend arthur nebe she asked noting my surprise she added oh yes arthur and i have known each other for many years ever since in fact when he first joined kripo hes much the same i said tell him to come and visit me sometime she said he can storm free with me any time he wants or just a nice massage yes thats it tell him to come here for a nice rub i give it to him myself she laughed loudly at the idea and lit a cigarette ill tell him i said wondering if i would and wondering if she really cared one way or the other and you emil maybe you would like a little company maybe you would both like a rub yourselves eh i was about to broach the real purpose of our visit but found that becker was already clapping his hands and chuckling some more thats it he said lets relax a little be nice and friendly he glanced at me meaningfully were not in a hurry are we sir i shrugged and shook my head just as long as we dont forget why we came i said trying not to sound like a prig evona wylezynska stood up and pressed a bell on the wall behind a curtain she made a tutting noise and said why not just forget everything thats why most of my gentlemen come here to forget about their cares while her back was turned becker frowned and shook his head at me i wasnt sure exactly what he meant evona took the nape of my neck in the palm of her hand and began to knead the flesh there with fingers that were as strong as blacksmiths pincers theres a lot of tension here bernhard she informed me seductively i dont doubt it you should see the cart theyve got me pulling down at the alex not to mention the number of passengers ive been asked to take it was my turn to glance meaningfully at becker then i took evonas fingers away from my neck and kissed them amicably they smelt of iodine soap and there are better olfactory aphrodisiacs than that evonas girls walked slowly into the room like a troupe of circus horses some were wearing just slips and stockings but mostly they were naked they took up positions around becker and myself and started to smoke or to help themselves to drinks almost as if we hadnt been there at all it was more female flesh than i had seen in a long time and i have to admit that my eyes would have branded the bodies of any ordinary women but these girls were used to being eyed and remained coolly undisturbed by our prurient stares one picked up a dining chair and setting it down in front of me sat astride it so that i had as perfect a view of her genitals as i could have been expected to have wished for she started flexing her bare buttocks against the seat of the chair for good measure almost immediately becker was on his feet and rubbing his hands together like the keenest of streettraders well this is very nice isnt it becker put his arms around a couple of the girls his face growing redder with excitement he glanced around the room and not finding the face he was looking for said tell me evona where is that lovely little childbearing machine of a jewess who used to work for you you mean esther im afraid she had to go away we waited but there was no sign of anything other than smoke coming from evonas mouth to expand upon what she had said thats too bad said becker i was telling my friend here just how nice she was he shrugged never mind plenty more where she came from eh ignoring the look on my face and still supported like a drunk by the two snappers he turned and walked down the creaking corridor and into one of the bedrooms leaving me alone with the rest of them and what is your preference bernhard evona snapped her fingers and waved one of her girls forward this one and esther are very much alike she said taking hold of the girls bare backside and turning it towards my face smoothing it with the palm of her hand she has two vertebrae too many so that her behind is a long way from her waist very beautiful do you not think very beautiful i said and patted the girls marblecool bottom politely but to be honest im the oldfashioned type i like a girl to have all her mind on me and not my wallet evona smiled no i did not think you were the type she smacked the girls behind like a favourite dog go on off you go all of you i watched them troop silently out of the room and felt something close to disappointment that i wasnt more like becker she seemed to sense this ambivalence you are not like emil he is attracted to any girl who will show him her fingernails i think that one would fuck a cat with a broken back hows your drink i swirled it demonstratively just fine i said well is there anything else that i can get you i felt her bosom press against my arm and smiled down at what was hanging in the gallery i lit a cigarette and looked her in the eye dont pretend to be disappointed if i say that all im after is some information she smiled checking her advance and reached for her drink what kind of information im looking for a man and before you rip a hole for the joke the man im after is a killer with four goals on the scoresheet how can i help you i run a whorehouse not a private detective agency its not uncommon for a man to use one of your girls roughly theres none of them wears velvet gloves bernhard ill tell you that much quite a lot of them figure that just because theyve paid for the privilege it gives them a licence to tear a girls underwear someone who went beyond what is considered to be a normal hazard of the profession then maybe one of your girls has had such a client or heard of someone who has tell me more about your killer i dont know much i sighed i dont know his name where he lives where he came from or what he looks like what i do know is that he likes tying up schoolgirls lots of men like tying girls up evona said dont ask me what they get out of it there are even some who like to whip girls although i dont permit that sort of thing that kind of pig should be locked away look anything might help right now theres not a great deal to go on evona shrugged and stubbed out her cigarette what the hell she said i was a schoolgirl myself once you said four girls it may even be five all aged about fifteen or sixteen nice families and bright futures until this maniac kidnaps them rapes them cuts their throats and then dumps their naked bodies evona looked thoughtful there was something she said carefully of course you realize that its unlikely that the sort of man who comes to my place or any place like it is not the sort of man who preys on young girls i mean the point of a place like this is to take care of a mans needs i nodded but i was thinking of kürten and of how his case contradicted her i decided not to press the point like i said its a long shot evona stood up and excused herself for a moment when she returned she was accompanied by the girl whose elongated backside i had been obliged to admire this time she was wearing a gown and seemed more nervous clothed than she had been while naked this is helene evona said sitting down again helene sit down and tell the kommissar about the man who tried to kill you the girl sat down on the chair where becker had been sitting she was pretty in a tired sort of way as if she didnt sleep enough or was using some sort of drug hardly daring to look me in the eye she chewed her lip and tugged at a length of her long red hair well go on evona urged he wont eat you he had that chance earlier on the man were looking for likes to tie girls up i told her leaning forward encouragingly then he strangles them or cuts their throats im sorry she said after a minute this is hard for me i wanted to forget all about it but evona says that some schoolgirls have been murdered i want to help really i do but its hard i lit a cigarette and offered her the packet she shook her head take your time helene i said is this a customer were talking about someone who came for a massage i wont have to go to court will i im not saying anything if it means standing up in front of a magistrate and saying im a partygirl the only person youll have to tell is me the girl sniffed without much enthusiasm well you seem all right i suppose she shot a look at the cigarette in rny hand can i change my mind about that nail sure i said and held out the packet the first drag seemed to galvanize her she smarted as she told the story embarrassed a little and probably a bit scared as well about a month ago i had a client in one evening i gave him a massage and when i asked him if he wanted me to dial his number he asked me if he could tie me up and then get himself frenched i said that it would cost him another twenty and he agreed so there i was trussed up like a roast chicken having finished frenching him and i ask him to untie me he gets this funny look in his eye and calls me a dirty whore or something like that well you get used to men going mean on you when youve finished like theyre ashamed of themselves but i could see that this one was different so i tried to stay calm then he got the knife out and start to lay it flat on my neck like he wanted me to be scared which i was fit to scream my lungs out of my throat only i didnt want to scare him into cutting me right away thinking that i might be able to talk him out of it she took another tremulous drag on her cigarette but that was just his cue to start throttling me him thinking that i was about to scream i mean he grabbed hold of my windpipe and starts to choke me if one of the other girls hadnt walked in there by mistake hed have scratched me out and no mistake i had the bruises on my neck for almost a week afterwards what happened when the other girl came in well i couldnt say for sure i was more concerned with drawing breath than seeing that he got a taxi home all right you know what i mean as far as i know he just snatched up his things and got his smell out the door what did he look like he had a uniform on what kind of uniform can you be a little more specific she shrugged who am i hermann goering shit i dont know what kind of uniform it was well was it green black brown or what come on girl think its important she took a fierce drag and shook her head impatiently an old uniform the sort they used to wear you mean like a war veteran yes thats the sort of thing only a bit more prussian i suppose you know the waxed moustache the cavalry boots oh yes i nearly forgot he had spurs on spurs yes like to ride a horse anything else you remember he had a wineskin on a string which he slung over his shoulder so that it looked like a bugle at his hip only he said that it was full of schnapps i nodded satisfied and leant back on the sofa wondering what it would have been like to have had her after all for the first time i noticed the yellowish discoloration of her hands which wasnt nicotine jaundice or her temperament but a clue that shed been working in a munitions factory in the same way id once identified a body pulled out of the landwehr another thing i had learned from hans illmann hey listen said helene if you get this bastard make sure that he gets all the usual gestapo hospitality wont you thumbscrews and rubber truncheons lady i said standing up you can depend on it and thanks for helping helene stood up her arms folded and shrugged yes well i was a schoolgirl myself once you know what i mean i glanced at evona and smiled i know what you mean i jerked my head at the bedrooms along the corridor when don juans concluded his investigations tell him that i went to question the headwaiter at peltzers then maybe i thought id talk to the manager at the winter garden and see what i could get out of him after that i might just head back to the alex and clean my gun who knows i may even find time to do a little police work along the way friday september where are you from gottfried the man smiled proudly eger in the sudetenland another few weeks and you can call it germany foolhardy is what i call it i said another few weeks and your sudetendeutsche partei will have us all at war martial law has already been declared in most sdp districts men must die for what they believe in he leant back on his chair and dragged a spur along the floor of the interrogation room i stood up loosening my shirt collar and moved out of the shaft of sunlight that shone through the window it was a hot day too hot to be wearing a jacket let alone the uniform of an old prussian cavalry officer gottfried bautz arrested early that same morning didnt seem to notice the heat although his waxed moustache was beginning to show signs of a willingness to stand easy what about women i asked do they have to die as well his eyes narrowed i think that you had better tell me why i have been brought here dont you herr kommissar have you ever been to a massage parlour on richard wagner strasse no i dont think so youre a difficult man to forget gottfried i doubt that you could have made yourself look any easier to remember than if you had rode up the stairs on a white stallion incidentally why do you wear the uniform i served germany and im proud of it why shouldnt i wear a uniform i started to say something about the war being over but there didnt seem like much point what with another one on the way and gottfried being such a spinner so i said were you at the massage parlour on richard wagner strasse or not maybe one doesnt always remember the exact locations of places like that i dont make a habit of spare me the character reference one of the girls there says that you tried to kill her thats preposterous shes quite adamant im afraid has this girl made a complaint against me yes she has gottfried bautz chuckled smugly come now herr kommissar we both know thats not true in the first place there hasnt been an identification parade and in the second even if there was theres not a snapper in the whole of germany who would report so much as a lost poodle no complaint no witness and i fail to see why were having this conversation at all she says that you tied her up like a hog nudged her mouth and then tried to strangle her she says she says look what is this shit its my word against hers youre forgetting the witness arent you gottfried the girl who came in while you were squeezing the shit out of the other one like i said youre not an easy man to forget im prepared to let a court decide who is telling the truth here he said me a man who fought for his country or a couple of stupid little honeybees are they prepared to do the same he was shouting now sweat starting off his forehead like pastryglaze youre just pecking at vomit and you know it i sat down again and aimed my forefinger at the centre of his face dont get smart gottfried not in here the alex breaks more skin that way than max schmelling and you dont always get to go back to your dressingroom at the end of the fight i folded my hands behind my head leant back and looked nonchalantly up at the ceiling take my word for it gottfried this little bee isnt so dumb that she wont do exactly what i tell her to do if i tell her to french the magistrate in open court shell do it understand you can go fuck yourself then he snarled i mean if youre going to custombuild me a cage then i dont see that you need me to cut you a key why the hell should i answer any of your questions please yourself im not in any hurry me ill go back home take a nice hot bath get a good nights sleep then ill come back here and see what kind of an evening youve had well what can i say they dont call this place grey misery for nothing all right all right he groaned go ahead and ask your lousy questions we searched your room like it not as much as the bugs you share with we found some rope my inspector thinks its the special strangling kind you buy at kadewe on the other hand it could be the kind you use to tie someone up or it could be the sort of rope i use in my job i work for rochlings furniture removals yes i checked but why take a length of rope home with you why not just leave it in the van i was going to hang myself what changed your mind i thought about it awhile and then things didnt seem quite so bad that was before i met you what about the bloodstained cloth we found in a bag underneath your bed that menstrual blood an acquaintance of mine she had a small accident i meant to burn it but i forgot can you prove that will this acquaintance corroborate your story unfortunately i cant tell you very much about her kommissar a casual thing you understand he paused but surely there are scientific tests which will substantiate what i say tests will determine whether or not it is human blood but i dont think theres anything as precise as you are suggesting i cant say for sure im not a pathologist i stood up again and went over to the window i found my cigarettes and lit one smoke he nodded and i threw the packet on to the table i let him get his first breath of it before i tossed him the grenade im investigating the murders of four possibly five young girls i said quietly thats why youre here now assisting us with our inquiries as they say gottfried stood up quickly his tongue tamping down his lower lip the cigarette rolling on the table where he had thrown it he started to shake his head and didnt stop no no no no youve got the wrong man i know absolutely nothing of this please youve got to believe me im innocent what about that girl you raped in dresden in you were in the cement for that werent you gottfried you see ive checked your record it was statutory rape the girl was under age thats all i didnt know she consented now lets see how old was she again fifteen sixteen thats about the same age as the girls whove beeh murdered you know maybe you just like them young you feel ashamed of what you are and transfer your guilt to them how can they make you do these things no its not true i swear it how can they be so disgusting how can they provoke you so shamelessly stop it for christs sake youre innocent dont make me laugh your innocence isnt worth shit in the gutter gottfried innocence is for decent lawabiding citizens not the kind of sewerrat like you who tries to strangle a girl in a massage parlour now sit down and shut up he rocked on his heels for a moment and then sat down heavily i didnt kill anyone he muttered whichever way you want to cut it im innocent i tell you that you may be i said but im afraid i cant plane a piece of wood without dropping a few shavings so innocent or not ive got to keep you for a while at least until i can check you out i picked up my jacket and walked to the door one last question for the moment i said i dont suppose you own a car do you on my pay you are joking arent you what about the furniture van are you the driver yes im the driver ever use it in the evenings he stayed silent i shrugged and said well i suppose i can always ask your employer its not allowed but sometimes i do use it yes do a bit of private contracting that sort of thing he looked squarely at me but i never used it to kill anyone in if thats what you were suggesting it wasnt as it happens but thanks for the idea i sat in arthur nebes office and waited for him to finish his telephone call his face was grave when finally he replaced the receiver i was about to say something when he raised his finger to his lips opened his desk drawer and took out a teacosy with which he covered the phone whats that for theres a wire on the telephone heydrichs i suppose but who can tell the teacosy keeps our conversation private he leant back in his chair underneath a picture of the führer and uttered a long and weary sigh that was one of my men calling from the berchtesgaden he said hitlers talks with the british prime minister dont seem to be going particularly well i dont think our beloved chancellor of germany cares if theres war with england or not hes conceding absolutely nothing of course he doesnt give a damn about these sudeten germans this nationalist thing is just a cover everyone knows it its all that austrohungarian heavy industry that he wants that he needs if hes going to fight a european war god i wish he had to deal with someone stronger than chamberlain he brought his umbrella with him you know bloody little bank manager do you think so id say the umbrella denotes quite a sensible sort of man can you really imagine hitler or goebbels ever managing to stir up a crowd of men carrying umbrellas its the very absurdity of the british which makes them so impossible to radicalize and why we should envy them its a nice idea he said smiling reflectively but tell me about this fellow youve arrested think he might be our man i glanced around the room for a moment hoping to find greater conviction on the walls and the ceiling and then lifted my hands almost as if i meant to disclaim gottfried bautzs presence in a cell downstairs from a circumstantial point of view he could fit the laundry list i rationed myself to one sigh but theres nothing that definitely connects him the rope we found in his room is the same type as the rope that was used to bind the feet of one of the dead girls but then its a very common type of rope we use the same kind here at the alex some cloth we found underneath his bed could be stained with blood from one of his victims equally it could be menstrual blood as he claims he has access to a van in which he could have transported and killed his victims relatively easily ive got some of the boys checking it over now but so far it appears to be as clean as a dentists fingers and then of course there is his record weve locked his door once before for a sexual offence a statutory rape more recently he probably tried to strangle a snapper hed first persuaded to be tied up so he could fit the psychological bill of the man were looking for i shook my head but thats more couldbe than fritz fucking lang what i want is some real evidence nebe nodded sagely and put his boots on the desk tapping his fingers ends together he said could you build a case break him hes not stupid it will take time im not that good an interrogator and im not about to take any shortcuts either the last thing i want on this case is broken teeth on the charge sheet thats how josef kahn got himself folded away and put in the costumehire hospital i helped myself from the box of american cigarettes on nebes desk and lit one with an enormous brass table lighter a present from goering the prime minister was always giving away cigarette lighters to people who had done him some small service he used them like a nanny uses boiled sweets incidentally has he been released yet nebes lean face adopted a pained expression no not yet he said i know its considered only a small detail the fact that he hasnt actually murdered anyone but dont you think its time he should be let out we still have some standards left dont we he stood up and came round the desk to stand in front of me youre not going to like this bernie he said no more than i do myself why should this be an exception i figure that the only reason there arent any mirrors in the lavatories is so that nobody has to look himself in the eye theyre not going to release him right nebe leant against the side of the desk folded his arms and stared at the toes of his boots for a minute worse than that im afraid hes dead what happened officially you can give it a shot josef kahn took his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed i can see how that would read nicely but you know different right i dont know anything for certain he shrugged so call it informed guesswork i hear things i read things and i make a few reasonable conclusions naturally as reichskriminaldirektor i have access to all kinds of secret decrees in the ministry of the interior he took a cigarette and lit it usually these are camouflaged with all sorts of neutralsounding bureaucratic names well then at the present moment theres a move to establish a new committee for the research of severe constitutional disease you mean like what this country is suffering from with the aim of encouraging positive eugenics in accordance with the führers thoughts on the subject he waved his cigarette at the portrait on the wall behind him whenever you read that phrase the führers thoughts on the subject one knows to pick up ones wellread copy of his book and there you will find that he talks about using the most modern medical means at our disposal to prevent the physically degenerate and mentally sick from contaminating the future health of the race well what the hell does that mean i had assumed it meant that such unfortunates would simply be prevented from having families i mean that does seem sensible doesnt it if they are incapable of looking after themselves then they can hardly be fit to bring up children it doesnt seem to have deterred the hitler youth leaders nebe snorted and went back round his desk youre going to have to watch your mouth bernie he said halfamused get to the funny bit well its this a number of recent reports complaints if you like made to kripo by those related to institutionalized people leads me to suspect that some sort of mercykilling is already being unofficially practised i leant forward and grasped the bridge of my nose do you ever get headaches i get headaches its smell that really sets them off paint smells pretty bad so does formaldehyde in the mortuary but the worst are those rotten pissing places you get where the dozers and rumsweats sleep rough thats a smell i can recall in my worst nightmares you know arthur i thought i knew every bad smell there was in this city but thats last months shit fried with last years eggs nebe pulled open a drawer and took out a bottle and two glasses he said nothing as he poured a couple of large ones i threw it back and waited for the fiery spirit to seek out what was left of my heart and stomach i nodded and let him pour me another i said just when you thought that things couldnt get any worse you find out that theyve always been a lot worse than you thought they were and then they get worse i drained the second glass and then surveyed its empty shape thanks for telling me straight arthur i dragged myself to my feet and thanks for the warmer please keep me informed about your suspect he said you might consider letting a couple of your men work a friendandfoe shift on him no rough stuff just a bit of the oldfashioned psychological pressure you know the sort of thing i mean incidentally how are you getting on with your team everything working out there no resentments or anything like that i could have sat down again and given him a list of faults there that were as long as a party rally but really he didnt need it i knew that kripo had a hundred bulls who were worse than the three i had in my squad so i merely nodded and said that everything was fine but at the door to nebes office i stopped and uttered the words automatically without even thinking i said it and not out of obligation in response to someone else in which situation i might have consoled myself with the excuse that i was just keeping my head down and avoiding the trouble of giving offence i said it first heil hitler heil hitler nebe didnt look up from whatever it was that he had started writing as he mumbled his reply so he didnt see my expression i couldnt say what it would have looked like but whatever my expression it was born of the realization that the only real complaint i had at the alex was going to be against myself monday september the telephone rang i wrestled my way across from the other side of the bed and answered it i was still registering the time while deubel was speaking it was two am say that again we think weve found the missing girl sir dead like a mouse in a trap theres no positive identification yet but it looks like all the rest of them sir ive called professor illmann hes on his way now where are you deubel zoo bahnhof it was still warm outside when i went down to the car and i opened the window to enjoy the night air as well as to help wake me up for everyone but herr and frau hanke asleep at their home in steglitz it promised to be a nice day i drove east along kurfürstendamm with its geometricshaped neonlit shops and turned north up joachimstaler strasse at the top of which loomed the great luminous greenhouse that was the zoo station in front were several police vans a redundant ambulance and a few drunks still intent on making a night of it being moved on by a bull inside i walked across the floor of the central ticket hall towards the police barrier that had been erected in front of the lost property and leftluggage areas i flashed my badge at the two men guarding the barrier and carried on through as i rounded the corner deubel met me halfway what have we got i said body of a girl in a trunk sir from the look and smell of her shes been in there sometime the trunk was in the leftluggage office the professor here yet him and the photographer they havent done much more than give her a dirty look we wanted to wait for you im touched by your thoughtfulness who found the mortal remains i did sir with one of the uniformed sergeants in my squad oh what did you do consult a medium there was an anonymous telephone call sir to the alex he told the desk sergeant where to find the body and the desk sergeant told my sergeant he rang me and we came straight down here we located the trunk found the girl and then i called you an anonymous caller you say what time was this about twelve i was just going off shift ill want to speak to the man who took that call you better get someone to check he doesnt go off duty either at least not until hes made his report how did you get in here the night stationmaster sir he keeps the keys in his office when they close the left luggage deubel pointed at a fat greasylooking man standing a few metres away chewing the skin on the palm of his hand thats him over there looks like were keeping him from his supper tell him i want the names and addresses of everyone who works in this section and what time they start work in the morning regardless of what hours they work i want to see them all here at the normal opening time with all their records and paperwork i paused for a moment steeling myself for what was about to follow all right i said show me where in the leftluggage office hans illmann sat on a large parcel labelled fragile smoking one of his rollups and watching the police photographer set up his flashlights and cameratripods ah the kommissar he said eyeing me and standing were not long here ourselves and i knew youd want us to wait for you dinners a little overcooked so youll need these he handed me a pair of rubber gloves and then looked querulously at deubel are you sitting down with us inspector deubel grimaced id rather not if you dont mind sir normally i would but ive got a daughter about that age myself i nodded youd better wake up becker and korsch and get them down here i dont see why we should be the only ones to lose our rat deubel turned to go oh inspector said illmann you might ask one of our uniformed friends to organize some coffee i work a great deal better when im awake also i need someone to take notes can your sergeant write legibly do you think i assume he does sir inspector the one assumption that it is safe to make with regard to the educational standards that prevail in orpo is that which allows only of the man being capable of completing a bettingslip find out for sure if you wouldnt mind id rather do it myself than later have to decipher the cyrillic scrawl of a more primitive lifeform yes sir deubel smiled thinly and went to carry out his orders i didnt think he was the sensitive type illmann commented watching him go imagine a detective not wanting to see the body its like a wine merchant declining to try a burgundy hes about to purchase unthinkable wherever do they find these faceslappers simple they just go out and shanghai all the men wearing leather shorts its what the nazis call natural selection on the floor at the back of the leftluggage office lay the trunk containing the body covered with a sheet we pulled up a couple of large parcels and sat down illmann drew back the sheet and i winced a little as the animalhouse smell rose up to greet me turning my head automatically towards the better air that lay behind my shoulder yes indeed he murmured its been a warm summer it was a fullsized steamer trunk and made of good quality blue leather with brass locks and studs the kind you see being loaded on to those highclass passenger liners that sail between hamburg and new york for its solitary occupant a naked girl of about sixteen years old there was only one kind of journey the more final kind which remained to be embarked upon partly swathed in what looked like a length of brown curtain material she lay on her back with her legs folded to the left a bare breast arching upwards as if there was something underneath her the head lay at an impossibly contradictory angle to the rest of her body the mouth open and almost smiling the eyes half closed and but for the dried blood in her nostrils and the rope around her ankles you might almost have thought the girl was in the first stages of awakening from a long sleep deubels sergeant a burly fellow with less neck than a hipflask and a chest like a sandbag arrived with a notebook and pencil and sat a little way apart from illmann and me sucking a sweet his legs crossed almost nonchalantly apparently undisturbed at the sight which lay before us illmann looked appraisingly at him for a moment and then nodded before beginning to describe what he saw an adolescent female he said solemnly about sixteen years of age naked and lying inside a large trunk of quality manufacture the body is covered partially with a length of brown cretonne and the feet are bound with a piece of rope he spoke slowly with pauses between the phrases in order to allow the sergeants handwriting to keep pace with him pulling the fabric away from the body reveals the head almost completely severed from the torso the body itself shows signs of advancing decomposition consistent with it having been in the trunk for at least four to five weeks the hands show no signs of defence wounds and im wrapping them for further examination of the fingers in the laboratory although since she clearly bit her nails i expect ill be wasting my time he took two thick paper bags out of his case and i helped him secure them over the dead girls hands hallo whats this do my eyes deceive me or is this a bloodstained blouse which i see before me it looks like her bdm uniform i said watching him pick up first the blouse and then a navy skirt how extraordinarily thoughtful of our friend to send us her laundry and just when i thought he was becoming just a little bit predictable first an anonymous telephone call to the alex and now this remind me to consult my diary and check that its not my birthday something else caught my eye and i leant forward and picked the small square piece of card out of the trunk irma hankes identity card i said well that saves me the trouble i suppose illmann turned his head towards the sergeant the trunk also contained the dead girls clothing and her identity card he dictated inside the card was a smudge of blood could that be a fingermark do you think i asked him he took the card out of my hand and looked carefully at the mark yes it could but i dont see the relevance an actual fingerprint would be a different story that would answer a lot of our prayers i shook my head its not an answer its a question why would a psycho bother to look at his victims identity i mean the blood indicates that she was probably already dead assuming its hers so why does our man feel obliged to find out her name perhaps in order that he might name her in his anonymous call to the alex yes but then why wait several weeks before making the call doesnt that strike you as strange you have a point there bernie he bagged the identity card and placed it carefully in his case before looking back into the trunk and what have we here he lifted up a small but heavylooking sack and glanced inside hows this for strange he held it open for my inspection it was the empty toothpaste tubes that irma hanke had been collecting for the reich economy programme our killer does seem to have thought of everything its almost as if the bastard were defying us to catch him he gives us everything think how smug hell be if we still cant nail him illmann dictated some more notes to the sergeant and then pronounced that he was finished with the preliminary sceneofcrime investigation and that it was now the photographers turn pulling our gloves off we moved away from the trunk and found that the stationmaster had provided coffee it was hot and strong and i needed it to take away the taste of death that was coating my tongue illmann rolled a couple of cigarettes and handed me one the rich tobacco tasted like barbecued nectar where does this leave your crazy czech he said the one who thinks hes a cavalry officer it seems that he really was a cavalry officer i said got a bit shellshocked on the eastern front and never quite recovered all the same hes no hop and skip and frankly unless i get some hard evidence im not confident of making anything stick to him and im not about to send anyone up on an alexanderplatzstyle confession not that hes saying anything mind hes been questioned the whole weekend and still maintains his innocence ill see if somebody from the leftluggage office here can identify him as the coat that left the trunk but if not then ill have to let him go i imagine that will upset your sensitive inspector chuckled illmann the one with the daughter from what he was saying to me earlier he was quite sure that it was only a matter of time before you had a case against him almost certainly he views the czechs conviction for statutory rape as the best reason why i should let him take the fellow into a quiet cell and tap dance all over him so strenuous these modern police methods wherever do they find the energy thats all they find energy for this is well past deubels bedtime as hes already reminded me some of these bulls think theyre working banking hours i waved him over have you ever noticed how most of berlins crimes seem to happen during the day surely youre forgetting the earlymorning knockup from your friendly neighbourhood gestapo man you never get anyone more senior than a kriminalassistent doing the a red tabs and only then if its someone important i turned to face deubel who was doing his best to act dogtired and ready for a hospital bed when the photographer has finished his portrait tell him i want a couple of shots of the trunk with the lid closed whats more i want the prints ready by the time the leftluggage staff turns up itll be something to help refresh their memories the professor here will be taking the trunk back to the alex as soon as the snaps are done what about the girls family sir it is irma hanke isnt it theyll need to make a formal identification of course but not until the professors had his way with her maybe even smartened her up a bit for her mother im not a mortician bernie he said coolly come on ive seen you sew up a bag of minced beef before now very well illmann sighed ill see what i can do i shall need most of the day however possibly until tomorrow have as long as you like but i want to tell them the news this evening so see if at least you can nail her head back on to her shoulders by then will you deubel yawned loudly all right inspector youve passed the audition the role of the tired man in need of his bed is yours god knows youve worked hard enough for it as soon as becker and korsch turn up you can go home but i want you to set up an identity parade later on this morning see if the men who work in this office cant remember our sudeten friend right sir he said already more alert now that his going home was imminent whats the name of that desk sergeant the one who took the anonymous call gollner not old tanker gollner yes sir youll find him at the police barracks sir apparently he said hed wait for us there as hed been pissed around by kripo before and didnt want to have to sit around all night waiting for us to show up same old tanker i smiled right id best not keep him waiting had i what shall i tell korsch and becker to do when they arrive deubel asked get korsch to go through the rest of the junk in this place see if we might not have been left any other kind gifts illmann cleared his throat it might be an idea if one of them were present to observe the autopsy he said becker can help you he seems to enjoy being around the female body not to mention his excellent qualifications in the matter of violent death just dont leave him alone with your cadaver professor hes just liable to shoot her or fuck her depending on the way hes feeling kleine alexander strasse ran northeast towards horst wessel platz and was where the police barracks for those stationed at the nearby alex was situated it was a big building with small apartments for married men and senior officers and single rooms for the rest despite the fact that he was no longer married wachmeister fritz tanker gollner had a small onebedroom apartment at the back of the barracks on the third floor in recognition of his long and distinguished service record a welltended window box was the apartments only concession to homeliness the walls being bare of anything except a couple of photographs in which gollner was being decorated he waved me to the rooms solitary armchair and sat himself on the edge of the neatly made bed heard you was back he said quietly leaning forwards he pulled out a crate from under the bed beer thanks he nodded reflectively as he pushed off the bottletops with his bare thumbs and its kommissar now i hear resigns as an inspector reincarnated as a kommissar makes you believe in fucking magic doesnt it if i didnt know you better id say you were in somebodys pocket arent we all in one way or another not me and unless youve changed not you either he swigged his beer thoughtfully tanker was an east fresian from emsland where it is said brains are as rare as fur on fish while he may not have been able to spell wittgenstein let alone explain his philosophy tanker was a good policeman one of the old school of uniformed bulls the firm but fair sort enforcing the law with a friendly box on the ear for young rowdies and less inclined to arrest a man and haul him off to the cells than give him an effective and administratively simple bedtimestory with his encyclopaediasized fist it was said of tanker that he was the toughest bull in orpo and looking at him sitting opposite me now in his shirt sleeves his great belt creaking under the weight of his even greater belly i didnt find this hard to believe certainly time had stood still with his prognathous features somewhere around one million years bc tanker could not have looked less civilized than if he had been wearing the skin of a sabretoothed tiger i found my cigarettes and offered him one he shook his head and took out his pipe if you ask me i said were every one of us in the back pocket of hitlers trousers and he means to slide down a mountain on his arse tanker sucked at the bowl of his pipe and started to fill it with tobacco when hed finished he smiled and raised his bottle then heres to stones under the fucking snow he belched loudly and lit his pipe the clouds of pungent smoke that rolled towards me like baltic fog reminded me of bruno it even smelt like the same foul mixture that he had smoked you knew bruno stahlecker didnt you tanker he nodded still drawing on the pipe through clenched teeth he said that i did i heard about what happened bruno was a good man he removed the pipe from his leathery old mouth and surveyed the progress of his smoke knew him quite well really we were both in the infantry together saw a fair bit of action too of course he wasnt much more than a spit of a lad then but it never seemed to bother him much the fighting i mean he was a brave one the funeral was last thursday id have gone too if i could have got the time he thought for a moment but it was all the way down in zehlendorf too far he finished his beer and opened another two bottles still they got the piece of shit who killed him i hear so thats all right then yes it certainly looks like it i said tell me about this telephone call tonight what time was this just before midnight sir fellow asks for the duty sergeant youre speaking to him i says listen carefully he says the missing girl irma hanke he says is to be found in a large blueleather trunk in the leftluggage at zoo bahnhof whos this i asks but hed hung up can you describe his voice id say it was an educated sort of voice sir and used to giving an order and having it carried out rather like an officer he shook his large head couldnt tell you how old though any accent just the trace of bavarian you sure about that my late wife was from nuremberg sir im sure and how would you describe his tone agitated disturbed at all he didnt sound like a spinner if thats what you mean sir he was as cool as the piss out of a frozen eskimo as i said just like an officer and he asked to speak to the duty sergeant those were his actual words sir any background noise traffic music that sort of thing nothing at all what did you do then after the call i telephoned the operator at the central telephone office on französische strasse she traced the number to a public telephone box outside bahnhof west kreuz i sent a squad car round there to seal it off until a team from d could get down there and have it checked out for piano players good man and then you called deubel yes sir i nodded and started on my second bottle of beer i take it orpo knows what this is all about von der schulenberg had all the hauptmanns into the briefingroom at the start of last week they passed on to us what a lot of the men already suspected that there was another gormann on the streets of berlin most of the lads figure thats why youre back on the force most of the civils weve got now couldnt detect coal on a slag heap but that gormann case well it was a good piece of work thanks tanker all the same sir it doesnt look like this little sudeten spinner youre holding could have done it does it if you dont mind me saying so not unless he had a telephone in his cell no still well see if the leftluggage people at zoo bahnhof like the look of him you never know he might have had an associate on the outside tanker nodded thats true enough he said anything is possible in germany just as long as hitler shits in the reich chancellery several hours later i was back at zoo bahnhof where korsch had already distributed photographs of the trunk to the assembled leftluggage staff they stared and stared shook their heads and scratched their grizzly chins and still none of them could remember anyone leaving a blueleather trunk the tallest of them a man wearing the longest khakicoloured boiler coat and who seemed to be in charge of the rest collected a notebook from under the metaltopped counter and brought it over to me presumably you record the names and addresses of those leaving luggage with you i said to him without much enthusiasm as a general rule killers leaving their victims as leftluggage at railway stations dont normally volunteer their real names and addresses the man in the khaki coat whose bad teeth resembled the blackened ceramic insulators on tram cables looked at me with quiet confidence and tapped the hard cover of his register with the quick of a fingernail itll be in here the one who left your bloody trunk he opened his book licked a thumb that a dog would have refused and began to turn the greasy pages on the trunk in your photograph theres a ticket he said and on that ticket is a number same one as whats chalked on the side of the item and that number will be in this book alongside a date a name and an address he turned several more pages and then traced down the page with his forefinger here we are he said the trunk was deposited here on friday august four days after she disappeared korsch said quietly the man followed his finger along a line to the facing page says here that the trunk belongs to a herr heydrich initial r of wilhelmstrasse number korsch snorted with laughter thank you i said to the man youve been most helpful i dont see whats funny grumbled the man as he walked away i smiled at korsch looks like someone has a sense of humour are you going to mention this in the report sir he grinned its material isnt it its just that the general wont like it hell be beside himself i should think but you see our killer isnt the only one who enjoys a good joke back at the alex i received a call from the head of what was ostensibly illmanns department vd forensics i spoke to an s shauptsturmführer dr schade whose tone was predictably obsequious no doubt in the belief that i had some influence with general heydrich the doctor informed me that a fingerprint team had removed a number of prints from the telephone box at west kreuz in which the killer had apparently called the alex these were now a matter for vc the records department as to the trunk and its contents he had spoken to kriminalassistent korsch and would inform him immediately if any fingerprints were discovered there i thanked him for his call and told him that my investigation was to receive top priority and that everything else would have to take second place within fifteen minutes of this conversation i received another telephone call this time from the gestapo this is sturmbannführer roth here he said section b kommissar gunther you are interfering with the progress of a most important investigation b i dont think i know that department are you calling from within the alex we are based at meinekestrasse investigating catholic criminals im afraid i know nothing of your department sturmbannführer nor do i wish to nevertheless i cannot see how i can possibly be interfering with one of your investigations the fact remains that you are it was you who ordered s shauptsturmführer dr schade to give your own investigation priority over any other thats right i did then you a kommissar should know that the gestapo takes precedence over kripo where the services of vd are required i know of no such thing but what great crime has been committed that might require your department to take precedence over a murder investigation charging a priest with a fraudulent transubstantiation perhaps or trying to pass off the communion wine as the blood of christ your levity is quite out of order kommissar he said this department is investigating most serious charges of homosexuality among the priesthood is that so then i shall certainly sleep more soundly in my bed tonight all the same my investigation has been given top priority by general heydrich himself knowing the importance that he attaches to apprehending religious enemies of the state i find that very hard to believe then may i suggest that you telephone the wilhelmstrasse and have the general explain it to you personally ill do that no doubt he will also be greatly disturbed at your failure to appreciate the menace of the third international conspiracy dedicated to the ruin of germany catholicism is no less a threat to reich security than bolshevism and world jewry you forgot men from outer space i said frankly i dont give a shit what you tell him vd is part of kripo not the gestapo and in all matters relating to this investigation kripo is to take priority in the services of our own department i have it in writing from the reichskriminaldirektor as does dr schade so why dont you take your socalled case and shove it up your arse a little more shit in there wont make much of a difference to the way you smell i slammed the receiver down on to its cradle there were after all a few enjoyable aspects to the job not least of these was the opportunity it afforded to piss on the gestapos shoes at the identity parade later that same morning the leftluggage staff failed to identify gottfried bautz as the man who had deposited the trunk containing irma hankes body and to deubels disgust i signed the order releasing him from custody its the law that all strangers arriving in berlin must be reported to a police station by their hotelier or landlord within six days in this way the resident registration office at the alex is able to give out the address of anyone resident in berlin for the price of fifty pfennigs people imagine that this law must be part of the nazi emergency powers but in truth it has existed for a while the prussian police was always so efficient my office was a few doors down from the registration office in room which meant that the corridor was always noisy with people and obliged me to keep my door shut no doubt this had been one of the reasons why i had been put here as far away from the offices of the murder commission as it was possible to be i suppose the idea was that my presence should be kept out of the way of other kripo personnel for fear that i might contaminate them with some of my more anarchic attitudes to police investigation or perhaps they had hoped that my insubordinate spirit might be broken by first being dramatically lowered even on a sunny day like this one was my office had a dismal aspect the olivegreen metal desk had more threadcatching edges than a barbedwire fence and had the single virtue of matching the worn linoleum and the dingy curtains while the walls were a couple of thousand cigarettes shade of yellow walking in there after snatching a few hours of sleep back at my apartment and presented with the sight of hans illmann waiting patiently for me with a dossier of photographs i didnt think that the place was about to get any more pleasant congratulating myself on having had the foresight to eat something before what promised to be an unappetizing meeting i sat down and faced him so this is where theyve been hiding you he said its supposed to be only temporary i explained just like me but frankly it suits me to be out of the way of the rest of kripo theres less chance of becoming a permanent fixture here again and i dare say that suits them too one would not have thought it possible to cause such aggravation throughout kripo executive from such a bureaucratic dungeon as this he laughed and stroking his chinbeard added you and a sturmbannführer from the gestapo have caused all sorts of problems for poor dr schade hes had telephone calls from lots of important people nebe müller even heydrich how very satisfying for you no dont shrug modestly like that you have my admiration bernie you really do i pulled open a drawer in my desk and took out a bottle and a couple of glasses lets drink to it i said gladly i could use one after the day ive had he picked up the full glass and sipped it gratefully you know i had no idea that there was a special department in the gestapo to persecute catholics nor had i but i cant say that it surprises me much national socialism permits only one kind of organized belief i nodded at the dossier on illmanns lap so what have you got victim number five is what we have got he handed me the dossier and started to roll himself a cigarette these are good i said flicking through its contents your man takes a nice photograph yes i thought youd appreciate them that one of the throat is particularly interesting the right carotid artery is almost completely severed thanks to one perfectly horizontal knife cut that means that she was flat on her back when he cut her all the same the greater part of the wound is on the righthand side of the throat so in all probability our man is righthanded it must have been some knife i said observing the depth of the wound yes it severed the larynx almost completely he licked his cigarette paper something extremely sharp like a surgical curette i should say at the same time however the epiglottis was strongly compressed and between that and the oesophagus on the right were haematomas as big as an orange pip strangled right very good illmann grinned but halfstrangled in actual fact there was a small quantity of blood in the girls partially inflated lungs so he throttled her into silence and later cut her throat she bled to death hanging upside down like a butchered calf same as all the others do you have a match i tossed my book across the desk what about her important little places did he fuck her fucked her and tore her up a bit in the process well youd expect that the girl was a virgin i should imagine there were even imprints of his fingernails on the mucous membrane but more importantly i found some foreign pubic hairs and i dont mean that they were imported from paris youve got a hair colour brown dont ask me for a shade i cant be that specific but youre sure theyre not irma hankes positive they stood out on her perfectly aryan fairhaired little plum like shit in a sugarbowl he leaned back and blew a cloud into the air above his head you want me to try and match one with a cutting from the bush of your crazy czech no i released him at lunchtime hes in the clear and as it happens his hair was fair i leafed through the typewritten pages of the autopsy report is that it not quite he sucked at his cigarette and then crushed it into my ashtray from his tweed huntingjacket pocket he produced a sheet of folded newspaper which he spread out on the desk i thought you ought to see this it was the front page of an old issue of der stürmer julius streichers antisemitic publication a flash across the top lefthand corner of the paper advertised it as a special ritual murder number not that one needed reminding the penandink illustration said it eloquently enough eight naked fairhaired german girls hanging upsidedown their throats slit and their blood spilling into a great communion plate that was held by an ugly caricature jew interesting dont you think he said streichers always publishing this sort of crap i said nobody takes it seriously illmann shook his head and reclaimed his cigarette im not for one minute saying that it should be i no more believe in ritual murder than i believe in adolf hitler the peacemaker but there is this drawing right he nodded which is remarkably similar to the method with which five german girls have already been killed he nodded again i glanced down the page at the article that accompanied the drawing and read the jews are charged with enticing gentile children and gentile adults butchering them and draining their blood they are charged with mixing this blood into their masses unleavened bread and using it to practise superstitious magic they are charged with torturing their victims especially the children and during this torture they scream threats curses and cast magic spells against the gentiles this systematic murder has a special name it is called ritual murder are you suggesting that streicher might have had something to do with these murders i dont know that im suggesting anything bernie i merely thought i ought to bring it to your attention he shrugged but why not after all he wouldnt be the first district gauleiter to commit a crime governor kube of kurmark for example there are quite a few stories about streicher that one hears i said in any other country streicher would be in prison can i keep this i wish you would its not the sort of thing that one likes to leave lying on the coffeetable he crushed out yet another cigarette and stood up to leave what are you going to do about streicher i dont exactly know i looked at my watch ill think about it after the formal id beckers on his way back here with the girls parents by now wed better get down to the mortuary it was something that becker said that made me drive the hankes home myself after herr hanke had positively identified the remains of his daughter its not the first time ive had to break bad news to a family he had explained in a strange way they always hope against hope clinging on to the last straw right up until the end and then when you tell them thats when it really hits them the mother breaks down you know but somehow these two were different its difficult to explain what i mean sir but i got the impression that they were expecting it after four weeks come on they had just resigned themselves to it thats all becker frowned and scratched the top of his untidy head no he said slowly it was stronger than that sir like they already knew for sure im sorry sir im not explaining it very well perhaps i shouldnt have mentioned it at all perhaps i am imagining it do you believe in instinct i suppose so good sometimes its the only thing a bull has got to go on and then hes got no choice but to trust in it a bull that doesnt trust a few hunches now and then doesnt ever take any chances and without taking them you cant ever hope to solve a case no you were right to tell me sitting beside me now as i drove southwest to steglitz herr hanke an accountant with the aeg works on seestrasse seemed anything but resigned to his only daughters death all the same i didnt discount what becker had told me i was keeping an open mind until i could form my own opinion irma was a clever girl hanke sighed he spoke with a rhineland accent with a voice that was just like goebbels clever enough to stay on at school and get her abitur which shed wanted to do but she was no bookbuffalo just bright and pretty with it good at sports she had just won her reich sports badge and her swimming certificate she never did any harm to anyone his voice was breaking as he added who could have killed her kommissar who would do such a thing thats what i intend to find out i said but hankes wife sitting in the back seat believed she already had the answer isnt it obvious who is responsible she said my daughter was a good bdm girl praised in her racialtheory class as the perfect example of the aryan type she knew her horst wessel and could quote whole pages of the führers great book so who do you think killed her a virgin but the jews who else but the jews would have done such things to her herr hanke turned in his seat and took his wife by the hand we dont know that silke dearhe said do we kommissar i think its very unlikely i said you see silke the kommissar doesnt believe it and neither do i i see what i see she hissed youre both wrong its as plain as the nose on a jews face who else but the jews dont you realize how obvious it is the accusation is loudly raised immediately anywhere in the world when a body is found which bears the marks of ritual murder this accusation is raised only against the jews i remembered the words of the article in der stürmer which i had folded in my pocket and as i listened to frau hanke it occurred to me that she was right but in a way she could hardly have dreamt of thursday september a whistle shrieked the train jolted and then we pulled slowly out of anhalter station on the sixhour journey that would take us to nuremberg korsch the compartments only other occupant was already reading his newspaper hell he said listen to this it says here that the soviet foreign minister maxim litvinoff declared in front of the league of nations in geneva that his government is determined to fulfil its existing treaty of alliance with czechoslovakia and that it will offer military help at the same time as france christ well really be in for it then with an attack on both fronts i grunted there was less chance of the french offering any real opposition to hitler than there was of them declaring prohibition litvinoff had chosen his words carefully nobody wanted war nobody but hitler that is hitler the syphilitic my thoughts returned to a meeting i had had the previous tuesday with frau kalau vom hofe at the goering institute i brought your books back i explained the one by professor berg was particularly interesting im glad you thought so she said how about the baudelaire that too although it seemed much more applicable to germany now especially the poems called spleen maybe now youre ready for nietzsche she said leaning back in her chair it was a pleasantly furnished bright office with a view of the zoo opposite you could just about hear the monkeys screaming in the distance her smile persisted she was better looking than i remembered i picked up the solitary photograph that sat on her desk and stared at a handsome man and two little boys your family yes you must be very happy i returned the picture to its position nietzsche i said changing the subject i dont know about that im not really much of a reader you see i dont seem to be able to find the time but i did look up those pages in mein kampf the ones about venereal disease mind you it meant that for a while i had to use a brick to wedge the bathroom window open she laughed anyway i think you must be right she started to speak but i raised my hand i know i know you didnt say anything you were just telling me what is written in the führers marvellous book not offering a psychotherapeutic analysis of him through his writing thats right i sat down and faced her across the desk but that sort of thing is possible oh yes indeed i handed her the page from der stürmer even with something like this she looked at me levelly and then opened her cigarette box i helped myself to one and then lit us both are you asking me officially she said no of course not then i should say that it would be possible in fact i should say that der stürmer is the work of not one but several psychotic personalities the socalled editorials these illustrations by fino god only knows what effect this sort of filth is having on people can you speculate a little the effect i mean she pursed her beautiful lips hard to evaluate she said after a pause certainly for weaker personalities this sort of thing regularly absorbed could be corrupting corrupting enough to make a man a murderer no she said i dont think so it wouldnt make a killer out of a normal man but for a man already disposed to kill i think its quite possible that this kind of story and drawing might have a profound effect on him and as you know from your own reading of berg kürten himself was of the opinion that the more salacious kind of crime reporting had very definitely affected him she crossed her legs the sibilance of her stockings drawing my thoughts to their tops to her garters and finally to the lacy paradise that i imagined existed there my stomach tightened at the thought of running my hand up her skirt at the thought of her stripped naked before me and yet still speaking intelligently to me exactly where is the beginning of corruption i see i said and what would be your professional opinion of the man who published this story i mean julius streicher a hatred like this is almost certainly the result of a great mental instability she paused for a moment can i tell you something in confidence of course you know that matthias goering the chairman of this institute is the prime ministers cousin yes streicher has written a lot of poisonous nonsense about medicine as a jewish conspiracy and psychotherapy in particular for a while the future of mental health in this country was in jeopardy because of him consequently dr goering has good reason to wish streicher out of the way and has already prepared a psychological evaluation of him at the prime ministers orders im sure that i could guarantee the cooperation of this institute in any investigation involving streicher i nodded slowly are you investigating streicher in confidence of course i dont honestly know right now lets just say that im curious about him do you want me to ask dr goering for help i shook my head not at this stage but thanks for the offer ill certainly bear it in mind i stood up and went to the door ill bet you probably think quite highly of the prime minister him being the patron of this institute am i right hes been good to us its true without his help i doubt there would be an institute naturally we think highly of him for that please dont think im blaming you im not but hasnt it ever occurred to you that your beneficent patron is just as likely to go and shit in someone elses garden as streicher is in yours have you ever thought about that it stikes me as how its a dirty neighbourhood were living in and that were all going to keep finding crap on our shoes until someone has the sense to put all the stray dogs in the public kennel i touched the brim of my hat to her think about it korsch twisted his moustache absently as he continued reading his newspaper i supposed that he had grown it in an effort to look more of a character in the same way as some men will grow a beard not because they dislike shaving a beard requires just as much grooming as a cleanshaven face but because they think it will make them seem like someone to be taken seriously but with korsch the moustache little more than the stroke of an eyebrowpencil merely served to underscore his shifty mien it made him look like a pimp an effect at odds with his character however which in a period of less than two weeks i had discovered to be a willing and reliable one noticing my attention he was moved to inform me that the polish foreign minister josef beck had demanded a solution to the problem of the polish minority in the olsa region of czechoslovakia just like a bunch of gangsters isnt it sir he said everyone wants his cut korsch i said you missed your vocation you should have been a newsreader on the radio sorry sir he said folding away his paper have you been to nuremberg before once just after the war i cant say i like bavarians much though how about you first time but i know what you mean about bavarians all that quaint conservatism its a lot of nonsense isnt it he looked out of the window for a minute at the moving picture that was the german countryside facing me again he said do you really think streicher could have something to do with these killings sir were not exactly tripping over the leads in this case are we nor would it appear that the gauleiter of franconia is what you would call popular arthur nebe even went so far as to tell me that julius streicher is one of the reichs greatest criminals and that there are already several investigations pending against him he was keen that we should speak to the nuremberg police president personally apparently theres no love lost between him and streicher but at the same time we have to be extremely careful streicher runs his district like a chinese warlord not to mention the fact that hes on firstname terms with the führer when the train reached leipzig a young s a naval company leader joined our compartment and korsch and i went in search of the dining car by the time we had finished eating the train was in gera close to the czech border but despite the fact that our s a travelling companion got off at that stop there was no sign of the troop concentrations we had heard about korsch suggested that the naval s a mans presence there meant that there was going to be an amphibious attack and this we both agreed would be the best thing for everyone given that the border was largely mountainous it was early evening by the time that the train got into the haupt station in central nuremberg outside by the equestrian statue of some unknown aristocrat we caught a taxi which drove us eastwards along frauentorgraben and parallel to the walls of the old city these are as high as seven or eight metres and dominated at intervals by big square towers this huge medieval wall and a great dry grassy moat that is as wide as thirty metres help to distinguish the old nuremberg from the new which with a singular lack of obtrusion surrounds it our hotel was the deutscher hof one of the citys oldest and best and our rooms commanded excellent views across the wall to the steep pitched rooftops and regiments of chimneypots which lay beyond at the beginning of the eighteenth century nuremberg was the largest city in the ancient kingdom of franconia as well as one of the principal marts of trade between germany venice and the east it was still the chief commercial and manufacturing city of southern germany but now it had a new importance as the capital of national socialism every year nuremberg played host to the great party rallies which were the brainchild of hitlers architect speer as thoughtful as the nazis were naturally you didnt have to go to nuremberg to see one of these overorchestrated events and in september people stayed away from cinemas in droves for fear of having to sit through the newsreels which would be made up of virtually nothing else by all accounts sometimes there were as many as a hundred thousand people at the zeppelin field to wave their flags nuremberg like any city in bavaria as i recall never did offer much in the way of real amusement since we werent appointed to meet martin the nuremberg chief of police until ten oclock the following morning korsch and i felt obliged to spend the evening in search of whatever entertainment there was especially because kripo executive was footing the bill it was a thought that had particular appeal for korch this isnt bad at all he said enthusiastically not only is the alex paying for me to stay in a cocksmart hotel but im also getting the overtime make the most of it i said its not often that fellows like you and me get to play the party bigshot and if hitler gets his war we may have to live on this little memory for quite a while a lot of bars in nuremberg had the look of places which might have been the headquarters of smaller trade guilds these were filled with militaria and other relics of the past and the walls were often adorned with old pictures and curious souvenirs collected by generations of proprietors which were of no more interest to us than a set of logarithm tables but at least the beer was good you could always say that about bavaria and at the blaue flasche on hall platz where we ended up for dinner the food was even better back at the deutscher hof we called in at the hotels café restaurant for a brandy and were met by an astonishing sight sitting at a corner table loudly drunk was a party of three that included a couple of brainlesslooking blondes and wearing the singlebreasted lightbrown tunic of an nsdap political leader the gauleiter of franconia julius streicher himself the waiter returning with our drinks smiled nervously when we asked him to confirm that it was indeed julius streicher sitting in the corner of the café he said that it was and quickly left as streicher started to shout for another bottle of champagne it wasnt difficult to see why streicher was feared apart from his rank which was powerful enough the man was built like a barefist fighter with hardly any neck at all his bald head small ears solidlooking chin and almost invisible eyebrows streicher was a paler version of benito mussolini his apparent belligerence was given greater force by an enormous rhinowhip which lay on the table before him like some long black snake he thumped the table with his fist so that all the glasses and cutlery rattled loudly what the fuck does a man have to do to get some fucking service around here he yelled at the waiter were dying of thirst he pointed at another waiter you i told you to keep a fucking eye on us you little cunt and the minute you saw an empty bottle to bring us another what are you stupid or something once again he banged the table with his fist much to the amusement of his two companions who squealed with delight and persuaded streicher to laugh at his own illtemper who does he remind you of said korsch al capone i said without thinking and then added actually they all remind me of al capone korsch laughed we sipped our brandies and watched the show which was more than we could have hoped for so early in our visit and by midnight streichers and our own were the only parties left in the café the others having been driven away by the gauleiters incessant cursing another waiter came to wipe our table and empty our ashtray is he always this bad i asked him the waiter laughed bitterly this this is nothing he said you should have seen him ten days ago after the party rallies were finally over he tore hell out of this place why do you let him come in here then said korsch the waiter looked at him pityingly are you kidding you just try stopping him the deutscher is his favourite wateringhole hed soon find some pretext on which to close us down if we ever kicked him out maybe worse than that who knows they say he often goes up to the palace of justice on furtherstrasse and whips young boys in the cells there well id hate to be a jew in this town said korsch too right said the waiter last month he persuaded a crowd of people to burn down the synagogue streicher now began to sing and accompanied himself with a percussion that was provided with his knife and fork and the tabletop from which he had thoughtfully removed the tablecloth the combination of his drumming accent drunkenness and complete inability to hold a tune not to mention the screeches and giggles of his two guests made it impossible for either korsch or myself to recognize the song but you could bet that it wasnt by kurt weill and it did have the effect of driving the two of us off to bed the next morning we walked a short way north to jakobs platz where opposite a fine church stands a fortress built by the old order of teutonic knights at its southeastern point it includes a domed edifice that is the elisabethkirche while at the southwestern point on the corner of schlotfegergasse is the old barracks now police headquarters as far as i was aware there wasnt another police hq in the whole of germany which had the facility of its own catholic church that way theyre sure to wring a confession out of you one way or the other korsch joked s sobergruppenführer dr benno martin whose predecessors as police president of nuremberg included heinrich himmler greeted us in his baronial topstorey office the look of the place was such that i half expected him to have a sabre in his hand and indeed when he turned to one side i noticed that he had a duelling scar on his cheek and how is berlin he asked quietly offering us a cigarette from his box his own smoke he fitted into a rosewood holder that was more like a pipe and which held the cigarette vertically at a rightangle to his face things are quiet i said but thats because everyone is holding their breath quite so he said and waved at the newspaper on his desk chamberlain has flown to bad godesberg for more talks with the führer korsch pulled the paper towards him and glanced at the headline he pushed it back again theres too much damned talk if you ask me said martin i grunted noncommittally martin grinned and laid his square chin on his hand arthur nebe tells me that youve got a psychopath stalking the streets of berlin raping and cutting the flower of german maidenhood he also tells me that youve a mind to take a look at germanys most infamous psychopath and see if they might at least be holding hands i refer of course to that pigs sphincter streicher am i right i met his cold penetrating gaze and held it i was willing to bet that the general was no altar boy himself nebe had described benno martin as an extremely capable administrator for a police chief in nazi germany that could have meant just about anything up to and including a torquemada thats right sir i said and showed him the der stürmer front page this illustrates exactly how five girls have been murdered with the exception of the jew catching the blood in the plate of course of course said martin but you havent ruled out the jews as a possibility no but but its the very theatricality of this same mode of killing that makes you doubt that it could be them am i right that and the fact that none of the victims has been jewish maybe he just prefers more attractive girls martin grinned maybe he just prefers blonde blueeyed girls to depraved jewish mongrels or maybe its just coincidence he caught my raised eyebrow but youre not the kind of man who believes much in coincidence kommissar are you not where murder is concerned sir no i see patterns where other people see coincidence or at least i try to i leant back in my chair crossing my legs are you acquainted with the work of carl jung on the subject sir he snorted with derision good god is that what kripo gets up to in berlin these days i think hed have made rather a good policeman sir i said smiling affably if you dont mind me saying so spare me the psychology lecture kommissar martin sighed just tell me which particular pattern you see that might involve our beloved gauleiter here in nuremberg well sir its this it has crossed my mind that someone might be trying to sew the jews into a very nasty bodybag now the general raised an eyebrow do you really care what happens to the jews sir i care what happens to fifteenyearold girls on their way home from school tonight i handed the general a sheet of typewritten paper these are the dates on which the five girls disappeared i hoped that you might be able to tell me if streicher or any of his associates were in berlin on any of these occasions martin glanced down the page i suppose that i can find out he said but i can tell you now that he is virtually persona non grata there hitler keeps him down here out of harms way so that the only people he can annoy are the ones of no account like myself of course thats not to say that streicher doesnt visit berlin in secret sometimes he does the führer enjoys streichers afterdinner conversation though i cannot imagine why since he also apparently enjoys my own he turned to the trolley of telephones that stood by his desk and called up his adjudant telling him to establish streichers whereabouts on the dates i had provided i was given to understand that you also had certain information regarding streichers criminal behaviour i said martin got up and went over to his filing cabinet laughing quietly he took out a file that was as thick as a shoe box and brought it back to the desk theres virtually nothing i dont know about that bastard he snarled his s s guards are my men his telephone is tapped and i have listening devices in all of his homes i even have photographers on constant vigil in a shop opposite a room where he sees a prostitute from time to time korsch breathed a curse that was both admiration and surprise so where do you want to start i could occupy one whole department with what that bastard gets up to in this town rape charges paternity suits assaults on young boys with that whip he carries bribery of public officials misappropriation of party funds fraud theft forgery arson extortion we are talking about a gangster gentlemen a monster terrorizing the people of this town never paying his bills driving businesses into bankruptcy wrecking the careers of honourable men who had the courage to cross him we had a chance to see him for ourselves i said last night at the deutscher hof he was boozing it up with a couple of ladies the generals look was scathing ladies youre joking of course theyd have certainly been nothing more than common prostitutes he introduces them to people as actresses but prostitutes is what they are streicher is behind most of the organized prostitution in this city he opened his boxfile and started to leaf through the complaintsheets indecent assaults criminal damage hundreds of charges of corruption streicher runs this city like his personal kingdom and gets away with it the rape charges sound interesting i said what happened there no evidence offered the victims were either bullied or bought you see streicher is a very rich man quite apart from what he makes as a district governor selling favours offices even he makes a fortune off that lousy newspaper of his its got a circulation of half a million which at thirty pfennigs a copy adds up to reichsmarks a week korsch whistled and thats not counting what he makes from the advertising oh yes streicher can buy himself an awful lot of favours anything more serious than the rape charges you mean has he murdered anyone yes well we wont count the lynchings of the odd jew here and there streicher likes to organize a nice pogrom for himself now and then quite apart from anything else it gives him a chance to pick up a bit of extra loot and well discount the girl who died in his house at the hands of a backstreet angelmaker streicher wouldnt be the first senior party member to procure an illegal abortion that leaves two unsolved homicides which point the finger at his having been involved one a waiter at a party streicher went to who decided to choose that occasion to commit suicide a witness saw streicher walking in the grounds with the waiter less than twenty minutes before the man was found drowned in the pond the other a young actress acquainted with streicher whose naked body was found in luitpoldhain park she had been flogged to death with a leather whip you know i saw the body there wasnt a centimetre of skin left on her he sat down again apparently satisfied with the effect his revelations had had on korsch and myself even so he could not resist adding a few more salacious details as they occurred to him and then there is streichers collection of pornography which he boasts is the largest in nuremberg boasting is what streicher is best at the number of illegitimate children he has fathered the number of wetdreams hes had that week how many boys he has whipped that day its even the sort of detail he includes in his public speeches i shook my head and heard myself sigh how did it ever get to be this bad how was it that a sadistic monster like streicher got to a position of virtually absolute power and how many others like him were there but perhaps the most surprising thing was that i still had the capacity to be surprised at what was happening in germany what about streichers associates i said the writers on der stürmer his personal staff if streicher is trying to hang one on the jews he could be using someone else to do the dirty work general martin frowned yes but why do it in berlin why not do it here i can think of a couple of good reasons i said who are streichers main enemies in berlin with the exception of hitler and possibly goebbels you can take your pick he shrugged goering most of all then himmler and heydrich thats what i thought youd say theres your first reason five unsolved murders in berlin would cause maximum embarrassment to at least two of his worst enemies he nodded and your second reason nuremberg has a history of jewbaiting i said pogroms are common enough here but berlin is still comparatively liberal in its treatment of jews so if streicher were to bring down the blame for these murders on to the heads of berlins jewish community then that would make things even harder for them as well perhaps for jews all over germany there might be something in that he admitted picking another cigarette and screwing it into his curious little holder but its going to take time to organize this kind of investigation naturally i assume that heydrich will ensure the full cooperation of the gestapo i think that the highest level of surveillance is warranted dont you kommissar thats certainly what ill be writing in my report sir the telephone rang martin answered it and then handed me the receiver berlin he said for you it was deubel theres another girl missing he said when around nine last night blonde blueeyed same age as the others no witnesses not so far well catch the afternoon train back i handed the receiver to martin it looks as if our killer was busy again last night i explained another girl disappeared around the time that korsch and myself were sitting in the café at the deutscher hof giving streicher an alibi martin shook his head it would have been too much to hope that streicher could have been absent from nuremberg on all your dates he said but dont give up we may even yet manage to establish some sort of coincidence affecting streicher and his associates which satisfies you and me not to mention this fellow jung saturday september steglitz is a prosperous middleclass suburb in southwest berlin the red bricks of the town hall mark its eastern side and the botanical gardens its west it was at this end near the botanical museum and the planzen physiological institute that frau hildegard steininger lived with her two children emmeline aged fourteen and paul aged ten herr steininger the victim of a fatal car crash had been some brilliant bank official with the privat kommerz and the type that was insured up to his hair follicles leaving his young widow comfortably off in a sixroom apartment in lepsius strasse at the top of a fourstorey building the apartment had a large wroughtiron balcony outside a small brownpainted french window and not one but three skylights in the sittingroom ceiling it was a big airy sort of place tastefully furnished and decorated and smelling strongly of the fresh coffee she was making im sorry to make you go through all this again i told her i just want to make absolutely sure we didnt miss anything she sighed and sat down at the kitchen table opening her crocodileleather handbag and finding a matching cigarette box i lit her and watched her beautiful face tense a little she spoke like shed rehearsed what she was saying too many times to play the part well on thursday evenings emmeline goes to a dancing class with herr wiechert in potsdam grosse weinmeisterstrasse if you want to know the address thats at eight oclock so she always leaves here at seven and catches a train from steglitz station which takes thirty minutes theres a change at wannsee i think well at exactly ten minutes past eight herr wiechert telephoned me to see if emmeline was sick as she hadnt arrived i poured the coffee and set two cups down on the table before sitting opposite her since emmeline is never ever late i asked herr wiechert to call again as soon as she arrived and indeed he did call again at and at nine oclock but on each occasion it was to tell me that there was still no sign of her i waited until and called the police she sipped her coffee with a steady hand but it wasnt hard to see that she was upset there was a wateriness in her blue eyes and in the sleeve of her bluecrepe dress could be seen a soddenlooking lace handkerchief tell me about your daughter is she a happy sort of girl as happy as any girl can be whos recently lost her daddy she moved her blonde hair away from her face something she must have done not once but fifty times while i was there and stared blankly into her coffee cup it was a stupid question i said im sorry i found my cigarettes and filled the silence with the scrape of a match and my embarrassed breath of satisfying tobacco smoke she attends the paulsen real gymnasium school doesnt she is everything all right there no problems with exams or anything like that no school bullies giving her any trouble shes not the brightest in her class perhaps said frau steininger but shes very popular emmeline has lots of friends and the bdm the what the league of german girls oh that everythings fine there too she shrugged and then shook her head exasperatedly shes a normal child kommissar emmeline isnt the kind to run away from home if thats what youre implying like i said im sorry to have to ask these questions frau steininger but they have to be asked im sure you understand its best that we know absolutely everything i sipped my coffee and then contemplated the grounds on the bottom of my cup what did a shape like a scallop shell denote i wondered i said what about boyfriends she frowned shes fourteen years old for gods sake angrily she stubbed out her cigarette girls grow up earlier than boys earlier than we like perhaps christ what did i know about it listen to me i thought the man with all the goddamned children shes not interested in boys yet i shrugged just tell me when you get tired of answering these questions lady and ill get out of your way im sure youve got lots more important things to do than help me to find your daughter she stared at me hard for a minute and then apologized can i see emmelines room please it was a normal room for a fourteenyearold girl at least normal for one who attended a feepaying school there was a large billposter for a production of swan lake at the paris opera in a heavy black frame above the bed and a couple of wellloved teddy bears sitting on the pink quilt i lifted the pillow there was a book there a tenpfennig romance of the sort you could buy on any street corner not exactly emil and the detectives i handed the book to frau steininger like i said girls grow up early did you speak to the technical boys i came through the door of my office at the same time as becker was coming out is there anything on that trunk yet or that length of curtain material becker turned on his heel and followed me to my desk the trunk was made by turner glanz sir finding his notebook he added friedrichstrasse number sounds cocksmart they keep a sales list im afraid not sir its a popular line apparently especially with all the jews leaving germany for america herr glanz reckons that they must sell three or four a week lucky him the curtain material is cheap stuff you can buy it anywhere he started to search through my intray go on im listening you havent read my report yet then does it sound like i have i spent yesterday afternoon at emmeline steiningers school the paulsen real gymnasium he found his report and waved it in front of my face that must have been nice for you all those girls perhaps you should read it now sir save me the trouble becker grimaced and looked at his watch well actually sir i was just about to go off im supposed to be taking my children to the funfair at luna park youre getting as bad as deubel wheres he as a matter of interest doing a bit of gardening shopping with the wife i think hes with the missing girls mother sir ive just come from seeing her myself never mind tell me what you found out and then you can clear off he sat down on the edge of my desk and folded his arms im sorry sir i was forgetting to tell you something else first were you indeed it seems to me that bulls forget quite a lot round the alex these days in case you need reminding this is a murder investigation now get off my desk and tell me what the hell is going on he sprang off my desk and stood to attention gottfried bautz is dead sir murdered it looks like his landlady found the body in his apartment early this morning korsch has gone over there to see if theres anything in it for us i nodded quietly i see i cursed and then glanced up at him again standing there in front of my desk like a soldier he was managing to look quite ridiculous for gods sake becker sit down before rigor mortis sets in and tell me about your report thank you sir he drew up a chair turned it around and sat with his forearms leaning on the back two things he said first most of emmeline steiningers classmates thought she had spoken about running away from home on more than one occasion apparently she and her stepmother didnt get along too well her stepmother she never mentioned that apparently her real mother died about twelve years ago and then the father died recently what else becker frowned you said that there were two things yes sir one of the other girls a jewish girl remembered something that happened a couple of months back she said that a man wearing a uniform stopped his car near the school gate and called her over he said that if she answered some questions hed give her a lift home well she says that she went and stood by his car and the man asked her what her name was she said that it was sarah hirsch then the man asked her if she was a jew and when she said that she was he just drove off without another word did she give you a description he pulled a face and shook his head too scared to say much at all i had a couple of uniformed bulls with me and i think they put her off can you blame her she probably thought you were going to arrest her for soliciting or something still she must be a bright one if shes at a gymnasium maybe she would talk if her parents were with her and if there werent any dummies with you what do you think im sure of it sir ill do it myself do i strike you as the avuncular type becker no youd better not answer that he grinned amiably all right thats all enjoy yourself thank you sir he stood up and went to the door and becker yes sir well done when hed gone i sat staring into space for quite a while wishing that it was me who was going home to take my children out for a saturday afternoon at luna park i was overdue for some time off myself but when youre alone in the world that sort of thing doesnt seem to matter as much i was balanced precariously on the edge of a pool of selfpity when there was knock at my door and korsch came into the room gottfried bautz has been murdered sir he said immediately yes i heard becker said you went to take a look what happened korsch sat down on the chair recently occupied by becker he was looking more animated than i had ever seen him before and clearly something had got him very excited someone thought his brains were lacking a bit of air so they gave him a special blowhole a real neat job between the eyes the forensic they had down there reckoned it was probably quite a small gun probably a six millimetre he shifted on his chair but this is the interesting part sir whoever plugged him first knocked him cold gottfrieds jaw was broken clean in two and there was a cigarette end in his mouth like hed bitten his smoke in half he paused waiting for me to pass it between my ears a little the other half was on the floor cigarette punch looks like it sir are you thinking what im thinking korsch nodded deliberately im afraid i am and heres another thing deubel keeps a sixshot little tom in his jacket pocket he says that its just in case he ever loses his walther a little tom fires the same size of round as killed the czech does he i raised my eyebrows deubel was always convinced that even if bautz had had nothing to do with our case he still belonged in the cement he tried to persuade becker to have a word with some of his old friends in vice he wanted becker to get them to red tab bautz on some pretext and have him sent to a k z but becker wasnt having any of it he said that they couldnt do it not even on the evidence of the snapper he tried to cut im very glad to hear it why wasnt i told about this before korsch shrugged have you mentioned any of this to the team investigating bautzs death i mean about deubels cigarette punch and the gun not yet sir then well handle it ourselves what are you going to do that all depends on whether or not he still has that gun if youd pierced bautzs ears what would you do with it find the nearest pigiron smelter precisely so if he cant show me that gun for examination then hes off this investigation that might not be enough for a court but it will satisfy me ive no use for murderers on my team korsch scratched his nose thoughtfully narrowly avoiding the temptation to pick it i dont suppose youve any idea where inspector deubel is do you someone looking for me deubel sauntered through the open door the beery stink that accompanied him was enough to explain where he had been an unlit cigarette in the corner of his crooked mouth he stared belligerently at korsch and then with unsteady distaste at me he was drunk been in the café kerkau he said his mouth refusing to move quite as he would have normally expected its all right you know its all right im off duty least for another hour anyway be fine by then dont you worry about me i can take care of myself what else have you been taking care of he straightened like a puppet jerking back on its unsteady legs been asking questions at the station where the steininger girl went missing thats not what i meant no no well what did you mean herr kommissar someone murdered gottfried bautz what that czech bastard he uttered a laugh that was part belch and part spit his jaw was broken there was a cigarette end in his mouth so whats that to do with me thats one of your little specialities isnt it the cigarette punch ive heard you say so yourself theres no fucking patent on it gunther he took a long drag on the dead cigarette aid narrowed his bleary eyes you accusing me of canning him can i see your gun inspector deubel for several seconds deubel stood sneering at me before reaching for his shoulder holster behind him korsch was slowly reaching for his own gun and he kept his hand on its handle until deubel had laid the walther ppk on my desk i picked it up and sniffed the barrel watching his face for some sign that he knew bautz had been killed with a gun of a much smaller calibre shot was he he smiled executed more like i said it looks like someone put one between his eyes while he was out cold im choked deubel shook his head slowly i dont think so youre just pissing on the wall gunther and hoping that some of it will splash my fucking trousers sure i didnt like that little czech just like i hate every pervert that touches kids and hurts women but that doesnt mean that i had anything to do with his murder theres an easy way of convincing me of that oh and whats that show me that gartergun you keep on you the little tom deubel raised his hands innocently what garter gun i havent got a gun like that the only lighter im carrying is there on the table everyone whos worked with you knows about that gun youve bragged about it often enough show me the gun and youre in the clear but if youre not carrying it then ill figure its because you had to get rid of it what are you talking about like i said i dont have korsch stood up he said come on eb you showed that gun to me only a couple of days ago you even said that you were never without it you piece of shit take his side against one of your own would you cant you see hes not one of us hes one of heydrichs fucking spies he doesnt give two farts about kripo thats not the way i see it korsch said quietly so how about it do we get to see the gun or not deubel shook his head smiled and wagged a finger at me you cant prove anything not a thing you know that dont you i pushed my chair away with the backs of my legs i needed to be on my feet to say what i was going to say maybe so all the same youre off this case i dont particularly give a damn what happens to you deubel but as far as im concerned you can slither back to whichever excremental corner of this place you came from im choosy about who i have to work with i dont like killers deubel bared his yellow teeth even further his grin looked like the keyboard of an old and badly out of tune piano hitching up his shiny flannel trousers he squared his shoulders and pointed his belly in my direction it was all i could do to resist slamming my fist right into it but starting a fight like that would probably have suited him very well you want to open your eyes gunther take a walk down to the cells and the interrogation rooms and see whats happening in this place choosy about who you work with you poor swine there are people being beaten to death here in this building probably as we speak do you think anyone really gives a damn about what happens to some cheap little pervert the morgue is full of them i heard myself reply with what sounded even to me like almost hopeless naiveté somebody has to give a damn otherwise were no better than criminals ourselves i cant stop other people from wearing dirty shoes but i can polish my own right from the start you knew that was the way i wanted it but you had to do it your own way the gestapo way that says a womans a witch if she floats and innocent if she sinks now get out of my sight before im tempted to see if my clout with heydrich goes as far as kicking your arse out of kripo deubel sniggered youre a renthole he said and having stared korsch out until his boozy breath obliged him to turn away deubel lurched away korsch shook his head i never liked that bastard he said but i didnt think he was he shook his head again i sat down wearily and reached for the desk drawer and the bottle i kept there unfortunately hes right i said filling a couple of glasses i met korschs quizzical stare and smiled bitterly charging a berlin bull with murder i laughed shit you might just as well try and arrest drunks at the munich beer festival sunday september is herr hirsch at home the old man answering the door straightened and then nodded i am herr hirsch he said you are sarah hirschs father yes who are you he must have been at least seventy bald with white hair growing long over the back of his collar and not very tall stooped even it was hard to imagine this man having fathered a fifteenyearold daughter i showed him my badge police i said please dont be alarmed im not here to make any trouble for you i merely wish to question your daughter she may be able to describe a man a criminal recovering a little of his colour after the sight of my credentials herr hirsch stood to one side and silently ushered me into a hall that was full of chinese vases bronzes bluepatterned plates and intricate balsawood carvings in glass cases these i admired while he closed and locked the front door and he mentioned that in his youth he had been in the german navy and had travelled widely in the far east aware now of the delicious smell that filled the house i apologized and said that i hoped i wasnt disturbing the family meal it will be a while yet before we sit down and eat said the old man my wife and daughter are still working in the kitchen he smiled nervously no doubt unaccustomed to the politeness of public officials and led me into a reception room now then he said you said that you wished to speak to my daughter sarah that she may be able to identify a criminal thats right i said one of the girls from your daughters school has disappeared its quite possible she was abducted one of the men questioning some of the girls in your daughters class discovered that several weeks ago sarah was herself approached by a strange man i should like to see if she can remember anything about him with your permission but of course ill go and fetch her he said and went out evidently this was a musical family beside a shiny black bechstein grand were several instrument cases and a number of musicstands close to the window which looked out on to a large garden was a harp and in most of the family photographs on the sideboard a young girl was playing a violin even the oil painting above the fireplace depicted something musical a piano recital i supposed i was standing looking at it and trying to guess the tune when herr hirsch returned with his wife and daughter frau hirsch was much taller and younger than her husband perhaps no more than fifty a slim elegant woman with a set of pearls to match she wiped her hands on her pinafore and then grasped her daughter by her shoulders as if wishing to emphasize her parental rights in the face of possible interference from a state which was avowedly hostile to her race my husband says that a girl is missing from sarahs class at school she said calmly which girl is it emmeline steininger i said frau hirsch turned her daughter towards her a little sarah she scolded why didnt you tell us that one of your friends had gone missing sarah an overweight but healthy attractive adolescent who could not have conformed less to stretchers racist stereotype of the jew being blueeyed and fairhaired gave an impatient toss of her head like a stubborn little pony shes run away thats all she was always talking about it not that i care much whats happened to her emmeline steiningers no friend of mine shes always saying bad things about jews i hate her and i dont care if her father is dead thats enough of that her father said firmly probably not caring to hear much about fathers who were dead it doesnt matter what she said if you know something that will help the kommissar to find her then you must tell him is that clear sarah pulled a face yes daddy she yawned and threw herself down into an armchair sarah really said her mother she smiled nervously at me shes not normally like this kommissar i must apologize thats all right i smiled sitting down on the footstool in front of sarahs chair on friday when one of my men spoke to you sarah you told him you remembered seeing a man hanging around near your school perhaps a couple of months ago is that right she nodded then id like you to try and tell me everything that you can remember about him she chewed her fingernail for a moment and inspected it thoughtfully well it was quite a while ago she said anything you might recall could help me for instance what time of day was it i took out my notebook and laid it on my thigh it was goinghome time as usual i was going home by myself she turned her nose up at the memory of it anyway there was this car near the school what kind of car she shrugged i dont know makes of cars or anything like that but it was a big black one with a driver in the front was he the one who spoke to you no there was another man in the back seat i thought they were policemen the one sitting in the back had the window down and he called to me as i came through the gate i was by myself most of the other girls had gone already he asked me to come over and when i did he told me that i was she blushed a little and stopped go on i said that i was very beautiful and that he was sure my father and mother were very proud to have a daughter like me she glanced awkwardly at her parents im not making it up she said with something approaching amusement honestly thats what he said i believe you sarah i said what else did he say he spoke to his driver and said wasnt i a fine example of german maidenhood or something stupid like that she laughed it was really funny she caught a look from her father that i didnt see and settled down again anyway it was something like that i cant remember exactly and did the driver say anything back to him he suggested to his boss that they could give me a ride home then the one in the back asked me if id like that i said that id never ridden in one of those big cars before and that id like to sarahs father sighed loudly how many times have we told you sarah not to if you dont mind sir i said firmly perhaps that can wait until later i looked back at sarah then what happened the man said that if i answered some questions correctly hed give me a ride just like a moviestar well first he asked me my name and when i told him he just sort of looked at me as if he were shocked of course it was because he realized that i was jewish and that was his next question was i jewish i almost told him i wasnt just for the fun of it but i was scared he would find out and that i would get into trouble and so i told him i was then he leant back in his seat and told the chauffeur to drive on not another word it was very strange as if i had vanished thats very good sarah now tell me you said you thought they were policemen were they wearing uniforms she nodded hesitantly lets start with the colour of these uniforms sort of greencoloured i suppose you know like a policeman only a bit darker what were their hats like like policemens hats no they were peaked hats more like officers daddy was an officer in the navy anything else badges ribbons collar insignia anything like that she kept shaking her head all right now the man who spoke to you what was he like sarah pursed her lips and then tugged at a length of her hair she glanced at her father older than the driver she said about fiftyfive sixty quite heavylooking not much hair or maybe it was just closely cropped and a small moustache and the other one she shrugged younger a bit palelooking fairhaired i cant remember much about him at all tell me about his voice this man sitting in the back of the car you mean his accent yes if you can i dont know for sure she said i find accents quite difficult to place i can hear that theyre different but i cant always say where the person is from she sighed deeply and frowned as she tried hard to concentrate it could have been austrian but i suppose it could just as easily have been bavarian you know oldfashioned austrian or bavarian i said writing in my notebook i thought about underlining the word bavarian and then thought better of it there was no point in giving it more emphasis than she had done even if bavarian suited me better instead i paused saving my last question until i was sure that she had finished her answer now think very clearly sarah youre standing by the car the window is down and youre looking straight into the car you see the man with the moustache what else can you see she shut her eyes tight and licking her lower lip she bent her brain to squeeze out one last detail cigarettes she said after a minute not like daddys she opened her eyes and looked at me they had a funny smell sweet and quite strong like bayleaves or oregano i scanned my notes and when i was sure that she had nothing left to add i stood up thank you sarah youve been a great help have i she said gleefully have i really you certainly have we all smiled and for a moment the four of us forgot who and what we were driving from the hirsch home i wondered if any of them realized that for once sarahs race had been to her advantage that being jewish had probably saved her life i was pleased with what i had learned her description was the first real piece of information in the case in the matter of accents her description tallied with that of tanker the desk sergeant who had taken the anonymous call but what was more important it meant that i was going to have to get the dates on which streicher had been in berlin from general martin in nuremberg after all monday september i looked out of the window of my apartment at the backs of the adjoining buildings and into several sittingrooms where each family was already grouped expectantly round the radio from the window at the front of my apartment i could see that fasanenstrasse was deserted i walked into my own sittingroom and poured myself a drink through the floor i could hear the sound of classical music coming from the radio in the pension below a little beethoven provided a nice top and tail for the radio speeches of the party leaders its just what i always say the worse the picture the more ornate the frame ordinarily im no listener to party broadcasts id sooner listen to my own wind but tonights was no ordinary party broadcast the führer was speaking at the sportspalast on potsdamerstrasse and it was widely held that he would declare the true extent of his intentions towards czechoslovakia and the sudetenland personally i had long ago come to the conclusion that for years hitler had been deceiving everyone with his speeches about peace and id seen enough westerns at the cinema to know that when the man in the black hat picks on the little fellow standing next to him at the bar hes really spoiling for a fight with the sheriff in this case the sheriff just happened to be french and it didnt take much to see that he wasnt much inclined to do anything but stay indoors and tell himself that the gunshots he could hear across the street were just a few firecrackers in the hope that i was wrong about this i turned on the radio and like million other germans waited to find out what would become of us a lot of women say that whereas goebbels merely seduces hitler positively fascinates its difficult for me to comment on this all the same there is no denying the hypnotic effect that the führers speeches seem to have on people certainly the crowd at the sportspalast seemed to appreciate it i expect you had to be there to get the real atmosphere like a visit to a sewage plant for those of us listening at home there was nothing to appreciate no hope in anything that the number one carpetchewer said there was only the dreadful realization that we were a little closer to war than we had been the day before tuesday september the afternoon saw a military parade on unter den linden one which looked more ready for war than anything ever seen before on the streets of berlin this was a mechanized division in full field equipment but to my astonishment there were no cheers no salutes and no waving of flags the reality of hitlers belligerence was in everyones mind and seeing this parade people just turned and walked away later that same day when at his own request i met arthur nebe away from the alex at the offices of gunther stahlecker private investigators the door was still awaiting the signwriter to come and change the name back to the original i told him what i had seen nebe laughed what would you say if i told you that the division you saw were this countrys probable liberators is the army planning a putsch i cant tell you very much except to say that high officers of the wehrmacht have been in contact with the british prime minister as soon as the british give the order the army will occupy berlin and hitler will be brought to trial when will that be as soon as hitler invades czechoslovakia the british will declare war that will be the time our time bernie didnt i tell you that kripo would be needing men like you i nodded slowly but chamberlain has been negotiating with hitler hasnt he thats the british way to talk to be diplomatic it wouldnt be cricket if they didnt try to negotiate nevertheless he must believe that hitler will sign some sort of treaty more importantly both chamberlain and daladier must themselves be prepared to sign some sort of treaty hitler wont walk away from the sudeten bernie and the british arent about to renege on their own treaty with the czechs i went over to the drinks cabinet and poured a couple if the british and french intended to keep their treaty then there would be nothing to talk about i said handing nebe a glass if you ask me theyre doing hitlers work for him my god what a pessimist you are all right let me ask you this have you ever been faced with the prospect of fighting someone you didnt want to fight someone larger than you perhaps it may be that you think youll get a good hiding it may be that you simply havent got the stomach for it you try and talk your way out of the situation of course the man who talks too much doesnt want to fight at all but we are not larger than the british and the french but they dont have the stomach for it nebe raised his glass to the british stomach then to the british stomach wednesday september general martin has supplied the information about streicher sir korsch looked at the telegraph he was holding on the five dates in question it would seem that streicher was known to be in berlin on at least two of them with regard to the other two that we dont know about martin has no idea where he was so much for his boast about his spies well there is one thing sir apparently on one of the dates streicher was seen coming from the furth aerodrome in nuremberg whats the flying time between here and nuremberg couple of hours at the most do you want me to check with tempelhof airport ive got a better idea get on to the propaganda boys at the muratti ask them to supply you with a nice photograph of streicher better ask for one of all the gauleiters so as not to draw too much attention to yourself say its for security up at the reichs chancellery that always sounds good when youve got it i want you to go and talk to the hirsch girl see if she cant identify streicher as the man in the car and if she does if she does then you and i are going to find that we have made a lot of new friends with one notable exception thats what i was afraid of thursday september chamberlain returned to munich he wanted to talk again the sheriff came too but it seemed that he was only going to look the other way when the shooting started mussolini polished his belt and his head and turned up to offer support to his spiritual ally while these important men came and went a young girl of little or no account in the general scheme of things disappeared while doing the family shopping at the local market moabit market was on the corner of bremerstrasse and arminius strasse a large redbrick building about the same size as a warehouse it was where the working class of moabit which means everyone who lived in the area bought their cheese fish cooked meats and other fresh provisions there were even one or two places where you could stand and drink a quick beer and eat a sausage the place was always busy and there were at least six ways in and out of the place its not somewhere that you just wander round most people are in a hurry with little time to stand and stare at things they cannot afford and anyway there is none of those sort of goods in moabit so my clothes and unhurried demeanour marked me out from the rest we knew that liza ganz had disappeared from there because that was where a fishmonger had found a shopping bag which lizas mother later identified as belonging to her apart from that nobody saw a damn thing in moabit people dont pay you much attention unless youre a policeman looking for a missing girl and even then its just curiosity friday september in the afternoon i was summoned to gestapo headquarters on prinz albrecht strasse glancing up as i passed through the main door i saw a statue sitting on a trucktyre of a scroll working at a piece of embroidery flying over her head were two cherubs one scratching his head and the other wearing a generally puzzled sort of expression my guess was that they were wondering why the gestapo should have chosen that particular building to set up shop on the face of it the art school formerly occupying number eight prinz albrecht strasse and the gestapo who were currently resident there didnt seem to have much in common beyond the rather obvious joke that everyone made about framing things but that particular day i was more puzzled as to why heydrich should have summoned me there instead of to the prinz albrecht palais on nearby wilhelmstrasse i didnt doubt that he had a reason heydrich had a reason for doing everything and i felt sure that i would dislike this one just as much as all the others id ever heard beyond the main door you went through a security check and walking on again you found yourself at the foot of a staircase that was as big as an aqueduct at the top of the flight you were in a vaulted waiting hall with three arched windows that were of locomotive proportions beneath each window was a wooden bench of the kind you see in church and it was there that i waited as instructed between each window on plinths sat busts of hitler and goering i wondered a bit at himmler leaving fat hermanns head there knowing how much they hated each other maybe himmler just admired it as a piece of sculpture and then maybe his wife was the chief rabbis daughter after nearly an hour heydrich finally emerged from the two double doors facing me he was carrying a briefcase and shooed away his s s adjutant when he caught sight of me kommissar gunther he said appearing to find some amusement at the sound of my rank in his own ears he ushered me forwards along the gallery i thought we could walk in the garden once again like the last time do you mind accompanying me back to the wilhelmstrasse we went through an arched doorway and down another massive set of stairs to the notorious south wing where what had once been sculptors workshops were now gestapo prison cells i had good reason to remember these having once been briefly detained there myself and i was quite relieved when we emerged through a door and stood in the open air once again you never knew with heydrich he paused there for a moment glancing at his rolex i started to say something but he raised his forefinger and almost conspiratorially pressed his finger to his thin lips we stood and waited but for what i had no idea a minute or so later a volley of shots rang out echoing away across the gardens then another and another heydrich checked his watch again nodded and smiled shall we he said striding on to the gravel pathway was that for my benefit i said knowing full well that it was the firing squad he chuckled no no kommissar gunther you imagine too much and anyway i hardly think that you of all people require an object lesson in power its just that i am particular about punctuality with kings this is said to be a virtue but with a policeman this is merely the hallmark of administrative efficiency after all if the führer can make the trains run on time the least i ought to be able to do is make sure that a few priests are liquidated at the proper appointed hour so it was an object lesson after all i thought heydrichs way of letting me know that he was aware of my disagreement with sturmbannführer roth from b whatever happened to being shot at dawn the neighbours complained you did say priests didnt you the catholic church is no less of an international conspiracy than bolshevism or judaism gunther martin luther led one reformation the führer will lead another he will abolish roman authority over german catholics whether the priests permit him or not but that is another matter and one best left to those who are well versed in its implementation no i wanted to tell you about the problem i have which is that i am under a certain amount of pressure from goebbels and his muratti hacks that this case you are working on be given publicity im not sure how much longer i can stave them off when i was given this case general i said lighting a cigarette i was against a ban on publicity now im convinced that publicity is exactly what our killer has been after all along yes nebe said you were working on the theory that this might be some sort of conspiracy engineered by streicher and his jewbaiting pals to bring down a pogrom on the heads of the capitals jewish community it sounds fantastic general only if you dont know streicher he stopped and thrusting his hands deep inside his trouser pockets he shook his head there is nothing about that bavarian pig that could possibly surprise me he kicked at a pigeon with the toe of his boot and missed but i want to hear more a girl has identified a photograph of streicher as possibly the man who tried to pick her up outside a school from which another girl disappeared last week she thinks that the man might have had a bavarian accent the desk sergeant who took an anonymous call tipping us off where exactly to find the body of another missing girl said that the caller had a bavarian accent then theres motive last month the people of nuremberg burnt down the citys synagogue but here in berlin there are only ever a few broken windows and assaults at the very worst streicher would love to see the jews in berlin getting some of what theyve had in nuremberg what is more der stürmers obsession with ritual murder leads me to make comparisons with the killers modus operandi you add all that to streichers reputation and it starts to look like something heydrich accelerated ahead of me his arms stiff at his sides as if he were riding in the vienna riding school and then turned to face me he was smiling enthusiastically i know one person who would be delighted to see streichers downfall that stupid bastard has been making speeches all but accusing the prime minister of being impotent goering is furious about it but you dont really have enough yet do you no sir for a start my witness is jewish heydrich groaned and of course the rest is largely theoretical nevertheless i like your theory gunther i like it very much id like to remind the general that it took me six months to catch gormann the strangler i havent yet spent a month on this case we dont have six months im afraid look here get me a shred of evidence and i can keep goebbels off my back but i need something soon gunther youve got another month six weeks at the outside do i make myself clear yes sir well what do you need from me round the clock gestapo surveillance of julius streicher i said a full undercover investigation of all his business activities and known associates heydrich folded his arms and took his long chin in his hand ill have to speak to himmler about that but it should be all right the reichsführer hates corruption even more than he loathes the jews well thats certainly comforting sir we walked on towards the prinz albrecht palais incidentally he said as we neared his own headquartersive just had some important news that affects us all the british and french have signed an agreement at munich the führer has got the sudeten he shook his head in wonder a miracle isnt it yes indeed i muttered well dont you understand there isnt going to be a war at least not for the present time i smiled awkwardly yes its really good news i understood perfectly there wasnt going to be a war there wasnt going to be any signal from the british and without that there wasnt going to be any army putsch either part two monday october the ganz family what remained of it following a second anonymous call to the alex informing us where the body of liza ganz was to be found lived south of wittenau in a small apartment on birkenstrasse just behind the robert koch hospital where frau ganz was employed as a nurse herr ganz worked as a clerk at the moabit district court which was also nearby according to becker they were a hardworking couple in their late thirties both of them putting in long hours so that liza ganz had often been left by herself but never had she been left as i had just seen her naked on a slab at the alex with a man stitching up those parts of her he had seen fit to cut open in an effort to determine everything about her from her virginity to the contents of her stomach yet it had been the contents of her mouth easier of access which had confirmed what i had begun to suspect what made you think of it bernie illmann had asked not everyone rolls up as good as you professor sometimes a little flake will stay on your tongue or under your lip when the jewish girl who said she saw our man said he was smoking something sweetsmelling like bayleaves or oregano she had to be talking about hashish thats probably how he gets them away quietly treats them all grownup by offering them a cigarette only its not the kind theyre expecting illmann shook his head in apparent wonder and to think that i missed it i must be getting old becker slammed the car door and joined me on the pavement the apartment was above a pharmacy i had a feeling i was going to need it we walked up the stairs and knocked on the door the man who opened it was dark and badtempered looking recognizing becker he uttered a sigh and called to his wife then he glanced back inside and i saw him nod grimly youd better come in he said i was watching him closely his face remained flushed and as i squeezed past him i could see small beads of perspiration on his forehead further into the place i caught a warm soapy smell and i guessed that hed only recently finished taking a bath closing the door herr ganz overtook and led us into the small sittingroom where his wife was standing quietly she was tall and pale as if she spent too much time indoors and clearly she had not long stopped crying the handkerchief was still wet in her hand herr ganz shorter than his wife put his arm around her broad shoulders this is kommissar gunther from the alex said becker herr and frau ganz i said im afraid you must prepare yourselves for the worst possible news we found the body of your daughter liza early this morning im very sorry becker nodded solemnly yes said ganz yes i thought so naturally there will have to be an identification i told him it neednt be right away perhaps later on when youve had a chance to draw yourselves together i waited for frau ganz to dissolve but for the moment at least she seemed inclined to remain solid was it because she was a nurse and rather more immune to suffering and pain even her own may we sit down yes please do said ganz i told becker to go and make some coffee for us all he went with some alacrity eager to be out of the griefstricken atmosphere if only for a moment or two where did you find her said ganz it wasnt the sort of question i felt comfortable answering how do you tell two parents that their daughters naked body was found inside a tower of car tyres in a disused garage on kaiser wilhelm strasse i gave him the sanitized version which included no more than the location of the garage at this there occurred a very definite exchange of looks ganz sat with his hand on his wifes knee she herself was quiet vacant even and perhaps less in need of beckers coffee than i was have you any idea who might have killed her he said were working on a number of possibilities sir i said finding the old police platitudes coming back to me once again were doing everything we can believe me ganzs frown deepened he shook his head angrily what i fail to understand is why there has been nothing in the newspapers its important that we prevent any copycat killings i said it often happens in this sort of case isnt it also important that you stop any more girls from being murdered said frau ganz her look was one of exasperation well its true isnt it other girls have been murdered thats what people are saying you may be able to keep it out of the papers but you cant stop people from talking there have been propaganda drives warning girls to be on their guard i said well they obviously didnt do any good did they said ganz liza was an intelligent girl kommissar not the kind to do anything stupid so this killer must be clever too and the way i see it the only way to put girls properly on their guard is to print the story in all its horror to scare them you may be right sir i said unhappily but its not up to me im only obeying orders that was the typically german excuse for everything these days and i felt ashamed using it becker put his head round the kitchen door could i have a word sir it was my turn to be glad to leave the room whats the matter i said bitterly forgotten how to boil a kettle he handed me a newspaper cutting from the beobachter take a look at this sir i found it in the drawer here it was an advertisement for a rolf vogelmann private investigator missing persons a speciality the same advertisement that bruno stahlecker had used to plague me with becker pointed to the date at the top of the cutting october he said four days after liza ganz disappeared it wouldnt be the first time that people got tired waiting for the police to come up with something i said after all thats how i used to make a comparatively honest living becker collected some cups and saucers and put them on to a tray with the coffee pot do you suppose that they might have used him sir i dont see any harm in asking ganz was unrepentant the sort of client i wouldnt have minded working for myself as i said kommissar there was nothing in the newspapers about our daughter and we saw your colleague here only twice so as time passed we wondered just what efforts were being made to find our daughter its the not knowing that gets to you we thought that if we hired herr vogelmann then at least we could be sure that someone was doing his best to try and find her i dont mean to be rude kommissar but thats the way it was i sipped my coffee and shook my head i quite understand i said id probably have done the same thing myself i just wish this vogelmann had been able to find her you had to admire them i thought they could probably illafford the services of a private investigator and yet they had still gone ahead and hired one it might even have cost them whatever savings they had when we had finished our coffee and were leaving i suggested that a police car might come round and bring herr ganz down to the alex to identify the body early the following morning thank you for your kindness kommissar said frau ganz attempting a smile everyones been so kind her husband nodded his agreement hovering by the open door he was obviously keen to see the back of us herr vogelmann wouldnt take any money from us and now youre arranging a car for my husband i cant tell you how much we appreciate it i squeezed her hand sympathetically and then we left in the pharmacy downstairs i bought some powders and swallowed one in the car becker looked at me with disgust christ i dont know how you can do that he said shuddering it works faster that way and after what we just went through i cant say that i notice the taste much i hate giving bad news i swept my mouth with my tongue for the residue well what did you make of that get the same hunch as before yes he was giving her all sorts of meaningful little looks so were you for that matter i said shaking my head in wonder becker grinned broadly she wasnt bad was she i suppose youre going to tell me what shed be like in bed right more your type id have thought sir oh what makes you say that you know the type that responds to kindness i laughed despite my headache more than she responds to bad news there we are with our big feet and long faces and all she can do is look like she was in the middle of her period shes a nurse theyre used to handling bad news that crossed my mind but i think shed done her crying already and quite recently what about irma hankes mother did she cry god no as hard as jew süss that one maybe she did sniff a little when i first showed up but they were giving off the same sort of atmosphere as the ganzes i looked at my watch i think we need a drink dont you we drove to the café kerkau on alexanderstrasse with sixty billiard tables it was where a lot of bulls from the alex went to relax when they came off duty i bought a couple of beers and carried them over to a table where becker was practising a few shots do you play he said are you stretching me out this used to be my sittingroom i picked up a stick and watched becker shoot the cue ball it hit the red banked off the cushion and hit the other white ball square care for a little bet not after that shot youve got a lot to learn about working a line now if youd missed it lucky shot thats all becker insisted he bent down and cued a wild one which missed by half a metre i clicked my tongue thats a billiard cue youre holding not a white stick stop trying to lay me down will you look if it makes you happy well play for five marks a game he smiled slightly and flexed his shoulders twenty points all right with you i won the break and missed the opening shot after that i might just as well have been babysitting becker hadnt been in the boy scouts when he was young that much was certain after four games i tossed a twenty on to the felt and begged for mercy becker threw it back its all right he said you let me lay you down thats another thing youve got to learn a bets a bet you never ever play for money unless you mean to collect a man that lets you off might expect you to let him off it makes people nervous thats all that sounds like good advice he pocketed the money its like business i continued you never work for free if you wont take money for your work then it cant have been worth much i returned my cue to the rack and finished my beer never trust anyone whos happy to do the job for nothing is that what youve learnt as a private detective no its what ive learnt as a good businessman but since you mention it i dont like the smell of a private investigator who tries to find a missing schoolgirl and then waives his fee rolf vogelmann but he didnt find her let me tell you something these days a lot of people go missing in this town and for lots of different reasons finding one is the exception not the rule if id torn up the bill of every disappointed client i had id have been washing dishes by now when youre private theres no room for sentiment the man who doesnt collect doesnt eat maybe this vogelmann character is just more generous than you were sir i shook my head i dont see how he can afford to be i said unfolding vogelmanns advertisement and looking at it again not with these overheads tuesday october it was her all right there was no mistaking that golden head and those wellsculpted legs i watched her struggle out of kade wes revolving door laden with parcels and carrierbags looking like she was doing her lastminute christmas shopping she waved for a taxi dropped a bag bent down to retrieve it and looked up to find that the driver had missed her it was difficult to see how youd have noticed hildegard steininger with a sack over your head she looked as though she lived in a beauty parlour from inside my car i heard her swear and drawing up at the curb i wound down the passenger window need a lift somewhere she was still looking around for another taxi when she answered no its all right she said as if i had cornered her at a cocktail party and she had been glancing over my shoulder to see if there might be someone more interesting coming along there wasnt so she remembered to smile briefly and then added well if youre sure its no trouble i jumped out to help her load the shopping millinery stores shoe shops a perfumers a fancy friedrichstrasse dressdesigner and kadewes famous food hall i figured she was the type for whom a chequebook provided the best kind of panacea for what was troubling her but then there are lots of women like that its no trouble at all i said my eyes following her legs as they swung into the car briefly enjoying a view of her stocking tops and garters forget it i told myself this one was too pricey besides she had other things on her mind like whether the shoes matched the handbag and what had happened to her missing daughter where to i said home she sighed like id suggested the palme dosshouse on frobelstrasse and then smiling a brave little smile she nodded we drove east towards bülowstrasse im afraid that i dont have any news for you i said fixing a serious expression to my features and trying to concentrate on the road rather than the memory of her thighs no i didnt think you did she said dully its been almost four weeks now hasnt it dont give up hope another sigh rather more impatient youre not going to find her shes dead isnt she why doesnt somebody just admit it shes alive until i find out different frau steininger i turned south down potsdamerstrasse and for a while we were both silent then i became aware of her shaking her head and breathing like she had walked up a flight of stairs whatever must you think of me kommissar she said my daughter missing probably murdered and here i am spending money as if i hadnt a care in the world you must think me a heartless sort of woman i dont think anything of the kind i said and started telling her how people dealt with these things in different ways and that if a bit of shopping helped to take her mind off her daughters disappearance for a couple of hours then that was perfectly all right and that nobody would blame her i thought i made a convincing case but by the time we reached her apartment in steglitz hildegard steininger was in tears i took hold of her shoulder and just squeezed it letting her go a bit before i said id offer you my handkerchief if i hadnt wrapped my sandwiches in it through her tears she tried a smile i have one she said and tugged a square of lace from out of her sleeve then she glanced over at my own handkerchief and laughed it does look as if youd wrapped your sandwiches in it after id helped to carry her purchases upstairs i stood outside her door while she found her key opening it she turned and smiled gracefully thank you for helping kommissar she said it really was very kind of you it was nothing i said thinking nothing of the sort not even an invitation in for a cup of coffee i thought when i was sitting in the car once more lets me drive her all this way and not even invited inside but then there are lots of women like that for whom men are just taxidrivers they dont have to tip the heavy scent of the ladys bajadi perfume was pulling quite a few funny faces at me some men arent affected by it at all but a womans perfume smacks me right in the leather shorts arriving back at the alex some twenty minutes later i think i must have sniffed down every molecule of that womans fragrance like a vacuum cleaner i called a friend of mine who worked at dorlands the advertising agency alex sievers was someone i knew from the war alex are you still buying advertising space for as long as the job doesnt require one to have a brain its always nice to talk to a man who enjoys his work fortunately i enjoy the money a whole lot better it went on like that for another couple of minutes until i asked alex if he had a copy of that mornings beobachter i referred him to the page with vogelmanns ad whats this he said i cant believe that there are people in your line of work who have finally staggered into the twentieth century that advertisement has appeared at least twice a week for quite a few weeks now i explained whats a campaign like that cost with that many insertions theres bound to be some sort of discount listen leave it with me i know a couple of people on the beobachter i can probably find out for you id appreciate it alex you want to advertise yourself maybe sorry alex but this is a case i get it spying on the competition eh something like that i spent the rest of that afternoon reading gestapo reports on streicher and his der stürmer associates of the gauleiters affair with one anni seitz and others which he conducted in secret from his wife kunigunde of his son lothars affair with an english girl called mitford who was of noble birth of stürmer editor ernst hiemers homosexuality of stürmer cartoonist philippe rupprechts illegal activities after the war in argentina and of how the stürmer team of writers included a man called fritz brand who was really a jew by the name of jonas wolk these reports made fascinating salacious reading of the sort that would no doubt have appealed to der stürmers own following but they didnt bring me any nearer to establishing a connection between streicher and the murders sievers called back at around five and said that vogelmanns advertising was costing something like three or four hundred marks a month when did he start spending that kind of mouse since the beginning of july only hes not spending it bernie dont tell me hes getting it for nothing no somebody else is picking up the bill oh who well thats the funny thing bernie can you think of any reason why the lange publishing company should be paying for a private investigators advertising campaign are you sure about that absolutely thats very interesting alex i owe you one just make sure that if you ever decide to do some advertising its me you speak to first all right you bet i put down the receiver and opened my diary my account for work done on frau gertrude langes behalf was at least a week overdue glancing at my watch i thought i could just about beat the westbound traffic they had the painters in at the house in herbertstrasse when i called and frau langes black maid complained bitterly about people coming and going all the time so that she was never off her feet you wouldnt have thought it to look at her she was even fatter than i remembered youll have to wait here in the hall while i go and see if shes available she told me everywhere else is being decorated dont touch anything mind she flinched as an enormous crash echoed through the house and mumbling about men with dirty overalls disrupting the place she went off in search of her mistress leaving me to tap my heels on the marble floor it seemed to make sense their decorating the place they probably did it every year instead of spring cleaning i ran my hand over an artdeco bronze of a leaping salmon that occupied the middle of a great round table i might have enjoyed its tactile smoothness if the thing hadnt been covered in dust i turned grimacing as the black cauldron waddled back into the hall she grimaced back at me and then down at my feet you see what your boots has gone and done to my clean floor she said pointing at the several black marks my heels had left i tutted with theatrical insincerity perhaps you can persuade her to buy a new one i said i was certain she swore under her breath before telling me to follow her we went along the same hallway that was a couple of coats of paint above gloomy to the double doors of the sittingroomoffice frau lange her chins and her dog were waiting for me on the same chaise longue except that it had been recovered with a shade of material that was easy on the eye only if you had a piece of grit in there on which to concentrate having lots of money is no guarantee of good taste but it can make the lack of it more glaringly obvious dont you own a telephone she boomed through her cigarette smoke like a foghorn i heard her chuckle as she added i think you must have once been a debtcollector or something then realizing what she had said she clutched at one of her sagging jowls oh god i havent paid your bill have i she laughed again and stood up im most awfully sorry thats all right i said watching her go to the desk and take out her chequebook and i havent yet thanked you properly for the speedy way in which you handled things ive told all my friends about how good you were she handed me the cheque ive put a small bonus on there i cant tell you how relieved i was to have done with that terrible man in your letter you said that it appeared as if he had hanged himself herr gunther saved somebody else the trouble eh she laughed again loudly like an amateur actress performing rather too vigorously to be wholly credible her teeth were also false thats one way of looking at it i said i didnt see any point in telling her about my suspicion that heydrich had had klaus hering killed with the aim of expediting my rejoining kripo clients dont much care for loose ends im not all that fond of them myself it was now that she remembered that her case had also happened to cost bruno stahlecker his life she let her laughter subside and fixing a more serious expression to her face she set about expressing her condolences this also involved her chequebook for a moment i thought about saying something noble to do with the hazards of the profession but then i thought of brunos widow and let her finish writing it very generous i said ill see that this gets to his wife and family please do she said and if theres anything else that i can do for them you will let me know wont you i said that i would there is something you can do for me herr gunther she said there are still the letters i gave you my son asked me if those last few could be returned to him yes of course id forgotten but what was that she said was it possible that she meant the letters i still held in the file back at my office were the only surviving letters or did she mean that reinhard lange already had the rest in which case how had he come by them certainly i had failed to find any more of the letters when i searched herings apartment what had become of them ill drop them round myself i said thank goodness he has the rest of them back safely yes isnt it she said so there it was he did have them i began to move towards the door well id better be getting along frau lange i waved the two cheques in the air and then slipped them into my wallet thanks for your generosity not at all i frowned as if something had occurred to me there is one thing that puzzles me i said something i meant to ask you about what interest does your company have in the rolf vogelmann detective agency rolf vogelmann she repeated uncomfortably yes you see i learnt quite by accident that the lange publishing company has been funding an advertising campaign for rolf vogelmann since july of this year i was merely wondering why you should have hired me when you might with more reason have hired him frau lange blinked deliberately and shook her head im afraid that i have absolutely no idea i shrugged and allowed myself a little smile well as i say it just puzzled me thats all nothing important do you sign all the company cheques frau lange i mean i just wondered if this might be something your son could have done on his own without informing you like buying that magazine you told me about now what was its name urania clearly embarrassed frau langes face was beginning to redden she swallowed hard before answering reinhard has signing power over a limited bank account which is supposed to cover his expenses as a company director however im at a loss to explain what this might relate to herr gunther well maybe he got tired of astrology maybe he decided to become a private investigator himself to tell the truth frau lange there are times when a horoscope is as good a way of finding something out as any other i shall make a point of asking reinhard about this when i next see him im indebted to you for the information would you mind telling me where you got it from the information sorry i make it a strict rule never to breach confidentiality im sure you understand she nodded curtly and bade me good evening back in the hall the black cauldron was still simmering over her floor you know what id recommend i said whats that she said sullenly i think you should give frau langes son a call at his magazine maybe he can work up a magic spell to shift those marks friday october when i first suggested the idea to hildegard steininger she had been less than enthusiastic let me get this straight you want to pose as my husband thats right in the first place my husband is dead and in the second you dont look anything like him herr kommissar in the first place im counting on this man not knowing that the real herr steininger is dead and in the second i dont suppose that he would have any more idea of what your husband might have looked like than i do exactly who is this rolf vogelmann anyway an investigation like this one is nothing more than a search for a pattern for a common factor here the common factor is that weve discovered vogelmann was retained by the parents of two other girls two other victims you mean she said i know that other girls have disappeared and then been found murdered you know there may be nothing about it in the papers but one hears things all the time two other victims then i admitted but surely thats just a coincidence listen i can tell you that ive thought of doing it myself you know paying someone to look for my daughter after all you still havent found a trace of her have you thats true but it may be more than just a coincidence thats what id like to find out supposing that he is involved what could he hope to gain from it were not necessarily talking about a rational person here so i dont know that gain will come into the equation well it all sounds very dubious to me she said i mean how did he get in touch with these two families he didnt they got in touch with him after seeing his newspaper advertisement doesnt that show that if he is a common factor then its not been through his own making perhaps he just wants it to look that way i dont know all the same id like to find out more even if its just to rule him out she crossed her long legs and lit a cigarette will you do it just answer this question first kommissar and i want an honest answer im tired of all the evasions do you think that emmeline can still be alive i sighed and then shook my head i think shes dead thank you there was silence for a moment is it dangerous what youre asking me to do no i dont think so then i agree now as we sat in vogelmanns waitingroom in his offices on nürnburgerstrasse under the eye of his matronly secretary hildegard steininger played the part of the worried wife to perfection holding my hand and occasionally smiling at me smiles of the kind that are normally reserved for a loved one she was even wearing her weddingring so was i it felt strange and tight on my finger after so many years id needed soap to slide it on through the wall could be heard the sound of a piano being played theres a music school next door explained vogelmanns secretary she smiled kindly and added he wont keep you waiting for very long five minutes later we were ushered into his office in my experience the private investigator is prone to several common ailments flat feet varicose veins a bad back alcoholism and god forbid venereal disease but none of them with the possible exception of the clap is likely to influence adversely the impression he makes on a potential client however there is one disability albeit a minor one which if found in a sniffer must give the client pause for thought and that is shortsightedness if you are going to pay a man fifty marks a day to trace your missing grandmother at the very least you want to feel confident that the man you are engaging to do the job is sufficiently eagleeyed to find his own cufflinks spectacles of bottleglass thickness such as those worn by rolf vogelmann must therefore be considered bad for business ugliness on the other hand where it stops short of some particular and gross physical deformity need be no professional disadvantage and so vogelmann whose unpleasant aspect was something more general was probably able to peck at some sort of a living i say peck and i choose my words carefully because with his unruly comb of curly red hair his broad beak of a nose and his great breastplate of a chest vogelmann resembled a breed of prehistoric cockerel and one that had positively begged for extinction hitching his trousers on to his chest vogelmann strode round the desk on big policemans feet to shake our hands he walked as if he had just dismounted a bicycle rolf vogelmann pleased to meet you both he said in a high strangulated sort of voice and with a thick berlin accent steininger i said and this is my wife hildegard vogelmann pointed at two armchairs that were ranged in front of a large desktable and i heard his shoes squeak as he followed us back across the rug there wasnt much in the way of furniture a hat stand a drinks trolley a long and batteredlooking sofa and behind it a table against the wall with a couple of lamps and several piles of books its good of you to see us this quickly hildegard said graciously vogelmann sat down and faced us even with a metre of desk between us i could still detect his yoghurtcurdling breath well when your husband mentioned that your daughter was missing naturally i assumed there would be some urgency he wiped a pad of paper with the flat of his hand and picked up a pencil exactly when did she go missing thursday september i said she was on her way to dancing class in potsdam and had left home we live in steglitz at seventhirty that evening her class was due to commence at eight only she never arrived hildegards hand reached for mine and i squeezed it comfortingly vogelmann nodded almost a month then he said ruminatively and the police the police i said bitterly the police do nothing we hear nothing there is nothing in the papers and yet one hears rumours that other girls of emmelines age have also disappeared i paused and that they have been murdered that is almost certainly the case he said straightening the knot in his cheap woollen tie the official reason for the press moratorium on the reporting of these disappearances and homicides is that the police wish to avoid a panic also they dont wish to encourage all the cranks which a case like this has a habit of producing but the real reason is that they are simply embarrassed at their own persistent inability to capture this man i felt hildegard squeeze my hand more tightly herr vogelmann she said its not knowing whats happened to her that is so hard to bear if we could just be sure of whether or not i understand frau steininger he looked at me am i to take it then that you wish me to try and find her would you herr vogelmann i said we saw your advertisement in the beobachter and really youre our last hope were tired of just sitting back and waiting for something to happen arent we darling yes yes we are do you have a photograph of your daughter hildegard opened her handbag and handed him a copy of the picture that she had earlier given to deubel vogelmann regarded it dispassionately pretty how did she travel to potsdam by train and you believe that she must have disappeared somewhere between your house in steglitz and the dancing school is that right i nodded any problems at home none hildegard said firmly at school then we both shook our heads and vogelmann scribbled a few notes any boyfriends i looked across at hildegard i dont think so she said ive searched her room and theres nothing to indicate that she had been seeing any boys vogelmann nodded sullenly and then was subject to a brief fit of coughing for which he apologized through the material of his handkerchief and which left his face as red as his hair after four weeks youll have checked with all her relations and schoolfriends that she hasnt been staying with them he wiped his mouth with his handkerchief naturally hildegard said stiffly weve asked everywhere i said ive been along every metre of that journey looking for her and found nothing this was almost literally true what was she wearing when she disappeared hildegard described her clothes what about money a few marks her savings were untouched all right ill ask around and see what i can find out you had better give me your address i dictated it for him and added the telephone number when hed finished writing he stood up arched his back painfully and then walked around a bit with his hands thrust deep into his pockets like an awkward schoolboy by now i had guessed him to be no more than forty go home and wait to hear from me ill be in touch in a couple of days or earlier if i find something we stood up to leave what do you think are the chances of finding her alive hildegard said vogelmann shrugged dismally ive got to admit that theyre not good but i will do my best whats your first move i said curious he checked the knot of his tie again and stretched his adams apple over the collar stud i held my breath as he turned to face me well ill start by getting some copies made of your daughters photograph and then put them into circulation this city has a lot of runaways you know there are a few children who dont much care for the hitler youth and that sort of thing ill make a start in that direction herr steininger he put his hand on my shoulder and accompanied us to the door thank you said hildegard youve been most kind herr vogelmann i smiled and nodded politely he bowed his head and as hildegard passed out of the door in front of me i caught him glancing down at her legs you couldnt blame him in her beige wool bolero dotted foulard blouse and burgundy wool skirt she looked like a years worth of war reparations it felt good just pretending to be married to her i shook vogelmanns hand and followed hildegard outside thinking to myself that if i were really her husband i would be driving her home to undress her and take her to bed it was an elegantly erotic daydream of silk and lace that i was conjuring up for myself as we left vogelmanns offices and went out into the street hildegards sexual appeal was something altogether more streamlined than steamy imaginings of bouncing breasts and buttocks all the same i knew that my little husband fantasy was short on probability since in all likelihood the real herr steininger had he been alive would almost certainly have driven his beautiful young wife home for nothing more stimulating than a cup of fresh coffee before returning to the bank where he worked the simple fact of the matter is that a man who wakes alone will think of having a woman just as surely as a man who wakes with a wife will think of having breakfast so what did you make of him she said when we were in the car driving back to steglitz i thought he wasnt as bad as he looked in fact he was quite sympathetic really certainly no worse than your own men kommissar i cant imagine why we bothered i let her go on like that for a minute or two it struck you as perfectly normal that there were so many obvious questions that he didnt ask she sighed like what he never mentioned his fee i dare say that if he thought we couldnt have afforded it then he would have brought it up and by the way dont expect me to take care of the account for this little experiment of yours i told her that kripo would pay for everything seeing the distinctive darkyellow of a cigarettevending van i pulled up and got out of the car i bought a couple of packs and threw one in the glovebox i tapped one out for her then myself and lit us both it didnt seem strange that he also neglected to ask how old emmeline was which school she attended what the name of her dancing teacher was where i worked that sort of thing she blew smoke out of both nostrils like an angry bull not especially she said at least not until you mentioned it she thumped the dashboard and swore but what if he had asked which school emmeline goes to what would you have done if hed turned up there and found out that my real husband is dead id like to know that he wouldnt have you seem very sure of that how do you know because i know how private detectives operate they dont like to walk right in after the police and ask all the same questions usually they like to come at a thing from the other side walk round it a bit before they see an opening so you think that this rolf vogelmann is suspicious yes i do enough to warrant detailing a man to keep an eye on his premises she swore again rather more loudly this time thats the second time i said whats the matter with you why should anything be the matter no indeed single ladies never mind people giving out their addresses and telephone numbers to those whom the police believe to be suspicious thats what makes living on ones own so exciting my daughter is missing probably murdered and now i have to worry that that horrible man might drop round one evening for a little chat about her she was so angry she almost sucked the tobacco out of the cigarette paper but even so this time when we arrived at her apartment in lepsius strasse she invited me inside i sat down on the sofa and listened to the sound of her urinating in the bathroom it seemed strangely out of character for her not to be at all selfconscious about such a thing perhaps she didnt care if i heard or not im not sure that she even bothered to close the bathroom door when she came back into the room she asked me peremptorily for another cigarette leaning forwards i waved one at her which she snatched from my fingers she lit herself with the table lighter and puffed like a trooper in the trenches i watched her with interest as she paced up and down in front of me the very image of parental anxiety i selected a cigarette myself and tugged a book of matches from my waistcoat pocket hildegard glanced fiercely at me as i bent my head towards the flame i thought detectives were supposed to be able to light matches with their thumbnails only the careless kind who dont pay five marks for a manicure i said yawning i guessed that she was working up to something but had no more idea of what it could be than i had of hitlers taste in softfurnishings i took another good look at her she was tall taller than the average man and in her early thirties but with the knockknees and turnedin toes of a girl half her age there wasnt much of a chest to speak of and even less behind the nose was maybe a bit too broad the lips a shade too thick and the cornflowerblue eyes rather too close together and with the possible exception of her temper there was certainly nothing delicate about her but there was no doubting her longlimbed beauty which had something in common with the fastest of fillies out at the hoppegarten probably she was just as difficult to hold on the rein and if you ever managed to climb into the saddle you could have done no more than hope that you got the trip as far as the winningpost cant you see that im scared she said stamping her foot on the polished wood floor i dont want to be on my own now where is your son paul hes gone back to his boardingschool anyway hes only ten so i cant see him coming to my assistance can you she dropped on to the sofa beside me well i dont mind sleeping in his room for a few nights i said if you really are scared would you she said happily sure i said and privately congratulated myself it would be my pleasure i dont want it to be your pleasure she said with just a trace of a smile i want it to be your duty for a moment i almost forgot why i was there i might even have thought that she had forgotten it was only when i saw the tear in the corner of her eye that i realized she really was afraid wednesday october i dont get it said korsch what about streicher and his bunch are we still investigating them or not yes i said but until the gestapo surveillance throws up something of interest to us theres not a lot we can do in that direction so what do you want us to do while youre looking after the widow said becker who was on the edge of allowing himself a smile i might have found irritating that is apart from checking the gestapo reports i decided not to be too sensitive about the matter that would have been suspicious in itself korsch i said i want you to keep your eye on the gestapo inquiry incidentally hows your man getting on with vogelmann he shook his head theres not a lot to report sir this vogelmann hardly ever leaves his office not much of a detective if you ask me it certainly doesnt look like it i said becker i want you to find me a girl he grinned and looked down at the toe of his shoe that shouldnt be too difficult for you any particular kind of girl sir aged about fifteen or sixteen blonde blueeyed bdm and i said feeding him the line preferably a virgin that last part might be a bit difficult sir shell have to have plenty of nerve are you thinking of staking her out sir i believe its always been the best way to hunt tiger sometimes the goat gets killed though sir said korsch as i said this girl will have to have guts i want her to know as much as possible if she is going to risk her life then she ought to know why shes doing it where exactly are we going to do this sir said becker you tell me think about a few places where our man might notice her a place where we can watch her without being seen ourselves korsch was frowning whats troubling you he shook his head with slow distaste i dont like it sir using a young girl as bait its inhuman what do you suggest we use a piece of cheese a main road becker said thinking out loud somewhere like hohenzollerndamm but with more cars to increase our chances of him seeing her honestly sir dont you think its just a bit risky of course it is but what do we really know about this bastard he drives a car he wears a uniform he has an austrian or bavarian accent after that everything is a maybe i dont have to remind you both that we are running out of time that heydrich has given me less than four weeks to solve this case well we need to get closer and we need to do it quickly the only way is to take the initiative to select his next victim for him but we might wait for ever said korsch i didnt say that it would be easy you hunt tiger and you can end up sleeping in a tree what about the girl korsch continued you dont propose to keep her at it night and day do you she can do it in the afternoons said becker afternoons and early evenings not in the dark so we can make sure he sees her and we see him youre getting the idea but where does vogelmann fit in i dont know a feeling in my socks thats all maybe its nothing but i just want to check it out becker smiled a bull has to trust a few hunches now and then he said i recognized my own uninspired rhetoric well make a detective out of you yet i told him she listened to her gigli gramophone records with the avidity of someone who is about to go deaf offering and requiring no more conversation than a railway ticketcollector by now i had realized that hildegard steininger was about as selfcontained as a fountainpen and i figured that she probably preferred the kind of man who could think of himself as little more than a blank sheet of writing paper and yet almost in spite of her i continued to find her attractive for my taste she was too much concerned with the shade of her goldspun hair the length of her fingernails and the state of her teeth which she was forever brushing too vain by half and too selfish twice over given a choice between pleasing herself and pleasing someone else she would have hoped that pleasing herself would have made everyone happy that she should have thought that one would almost certainly result from the other was for her as simple a reaction as a knee jerking under a patellahammer it was my sixth night staying at her apartment and as usual she had cooked a dinner that was nearly inedible you dont have to eat it you know she had said i was never much of a cook i was never much of a dinner guest i had replied and eaten most of it not for politeness sake but because i was hungry and had learnt in the trenches not to be too fussy about my food now she closed the gramophone cabinet and yawned im going to bed she said i tossed aside the book i was reading and said that i was going to turn in myself in pauls bedroom i spent a few minutes studying the map of spain that was pinned to the boys wall documenting the fortunes of the condor legions before turning out the light it seemed that every german schoolboy these days wanted to be a fighterpilot i was just settling down when there was a knock at the door may i come in she said hovering naked in the doorway for a moment or two she just stood there framed in the light from the hallway like some marvellous madonna almost as if she were allowing me to assess her proportions my chest and scrotum tightening i watched her walk gracefully towards me whereas her head and back were small her legs were so long that she seemed to have been created by a draughtsman of genius one hand covered her sex and this small shyness excited me very much i allowed it for a short time while i looked upon the rounded simple volumes of her breasts these were lightly almost invisibly nippled and the size of perfect nectarines i leant forwards pushed that modest hand away and then taking hold of her smooth flanks i pressed my mouth against the sleek filaments that mantled her sex standing up to kiss her i felt her hand reach down urgently for me and winced as she peeled me back it was too rough to be polite to be tender and so i responded by pushing her face first on to the bed pulling her cool buttocks towards me and moulding her into a position that pleased me she cried out at the moment when i plunged into her body and her long thighs trembled wonderfully as we played out our noisy pantomime to its barnstorming denouement we slept until dawn came creeping through the thin material of the curtains awake before her i was struck by her colour which was every bit as cool as her awakening expression which changed not a bit as she sought to find my penis with her mouth and then turning on to her back she pulled herself up the bed and laid her head on the pillow her thighs yawning open so that i could see where life begins and again i licked and kissed her there before acquainting it with the full rank of my ardour pressing myself into her body until i thought that only my head and shoulders would remain unconsumed finally when there was nothing left in either of us she wrapped herself round me and wept until i thought that she would melt saturday october i thought youd like the idea im not sure that i dont just give me a second to swill it around my head you dont want her hanging around somewhere just for the hell of it hell smell that shit in minutes and wont go near her its got to look natural i nodded without a great deal of conviction and tried to smile at the bdm girl becker had found she was an extraordinarily pretty adolescent and i wasnt sure what becker had been more impressed with her bravery or her breasts come on sir you know what its like he said these girls are always hanging around the der stürmer display cases on street corners they get a cheap thrill reading about jewish doctors interfering with mesmerized german virgins look at it this way not only will it stop her from getting bored but also if streicher or his people are involved then theyre more than likely going to take notice of her here in front of one of these stürmerkasten than anywhere else i stared uncomfortably at the elaborate redpainted case probably built by some loyal readers with its vivid slogans proclaiming german women the jews are your destruction and the three doublepage spreads from the paper under glass it was bad enough to ask a girl to act as bait without having to expose her to this kind of trash as well i suppose youre right becker you know i am look at her shes reading it already i swear she likes it whats her name ulrike i walked over to the stürmerkasten where she was standing singing quietly to herself you know what to do ulrike i said quietly not looking at her now that i was beside her but staring at the fips cartoon with its mandatory ugly jew no one could look like that i thought the nose was as big as a sheeps muzzle yes sir she said brightly there are lots of policemen around you cant see them but they are all watching you understand i saw her head nod in the reflection on the glass youre a very brave girl at that she started to sing again only louder and i realized that it was the hitler youth song our flag see before us fly our flag means an age without strife our flag leads us to eternity our flag means more to us than life i walked back to where becker was standing and got back into the car shes quite a girl isnt she sir she certainly is just make sure that you keep your flippers off her do you hear he was all innocence come on sir you dont think id try to bird that one do you he got into the driving seat and started the engine i think youd fuck your greatgrandmother if you really want my opinion i glanced over each shoulder where are your men sergeant hingsens on the first floor of that apartment building there he said and ive got a couple of men on the street one is tidying up the graveyard on the corner and the others cleaning windows over there if our man does show up well have him do the girls parents know about this yes rather publicspirited of them to give their permission wouldnt you say they didnt exactly do that sir ulrike informed them that she had volunteered to do this in the service of the führer and the fatherland she said that it would be unpatriotic to try and stop her so they didnt have much choice in the matter shes a forceful sort of girl i can imagine quite a swimmer too by all accounts a future olympic prospect her teacher reckons well lets just hope for a bit of rain in case she has to try and swim her way out of trouble i heard the bell in the hall and went to the window pulling it up i leant out to see who was working the bellpull even three storeys up i could recognize vogelmanns head of distinctive red hair thats a very common thing to do said hildegard lean out of a window like a fishwife as it happens i might just have caught a fish its vogelmann and hes brought a friend well you had better go and let them in hadnt you i walked out on to the landing and operated the lever that pulled the chain to open the street door and watched the two men climb up the stairs neither one of them said anything vogelmann came into hildegards apartment wearing his best undertakers face which was a blessing since the grim set to his halitosic mouth meant that for a while at least it stayed mercifully shut the man with him was shorter than vogelmann by a head and in his midthirties with fair hair blue eyes and an intense even academic air about him vogelmann waited until we were all seated before introducing the other man as dr otto rahn and promised to say more about him presently then he sighed loudly and shook his head im afraid that i have had no luck in the search for your daughter emmeline he said ive asked everyone i could possibly have asked and looked everywhere i could possibly have looked with no result it has been most disappointing he paused and added of course i realize that my own disappointment must count as nothing besides your own however i thought i might at least find some trace of her if there was anything anything at all that gave some clue as to what might have become of her then i would feel justified in recommending to you that i continue with my inquiries but theres nothing that gives me any confidence that i wouldnt be wasting your time and money i nodded with slow resignation thank you for being so honest herr vogelmann at least you can say we tried herr steininger vogelmann said im not exaggerating when i say that i have exhausted all the usual methods of inquiry he stopped to clear his throat and excusing himself dabbed at his mouth with a handkerchief i hesitate to suggest this to you herr and frau steininger and please dont think me facetious but when the usual has proved itself to be unhelpful there can surely be no harm in resorting to the unusual i rather thought that was why we consulted you in the first place hildegard said stiffly the usual as you put it was something that we expected from the police vogelmann smiled awkwardly ive expressed it badly he said i should perhaps have been talking in terms of the ordinary and the extraordinary the other man otto rahn came to vogelmanns assistance what herr vogelmann is trying to suggest with as much good taste as he can in the circumstances is that you consider enlisting the services of a medium to help you find your daughter his accent was educated and he spoke with the speed of a man from somewhere like frankfurt a medium i said you mean spiritualism i shrugged were not believers in that sort of thing i wanted to hear what rahn might have to say in order to sell us on the idea he smiled patiently these days its hardly a matter of belief spiritualism is now more of a science there have been some quite amazing developments since the war especially in the last decade but isnt this illegal i asked meekly im sure i read somewhere that count helldorf had banned all professional fortunetelling in berlin why as long ago as rahn was smooth and not at all deflected by my choice of phrase youre very wellinformed herr steininger and youre right the police president did ban them since then however the situation has been satisfactorily resolved and racially sound practitioners in the psychic sciences are incorporated in the independent professions sections of the german labour front it was only ever the mixed races the jews and the gypsies that gave the psychic sciences a bad name why these days the führer himself employs a professional astrologer so you see things have come a long way since nostradamus vogelmann nodded and chuckled quietly so this was the reason reinhard lange was sponsoring vogelmanns advertising campaign i thought to drum up a little business for the floating wineglass trade it looked like quite a neat operation too your detective failed to find your missing person after which through the mediation of otto rahn you were passed on to an apparently higher power this service probably resulted in your paying several times as much for the privilege of finding out what was already obvious that your loved one slept with the angels yes indeed i thought a neat piece of theatre i was going to enjoy putting these people away you can sometimes forgive a man who works a line but not the ones who prey on the grief and suffering of others that was like stealing the cushions off a pair of crutches peter said hildegard i dont see that we really have much to lose no i suppose not im so glad you think so said vogelmann one always hesitates to recommend such a thing but i think that in this case there is really little or no alternative what will it cost this is emmelines life were talking about hildegard snapped how can you mention money the cost is very reasonable said rahn im quite sure youll be entirely satisfied but lets talk about that at a later date the most important thing is that you meet someone who can help you there is a man a very great and gifted man who is possessed of enormous psychic ability he might be able to help this man as the last descendant of a long line of german men of wisdom has an ancestralclairvoyant memory that is quite unique in our time he sounds wonderful hildegard breathed he is said vogelmann then i will arrange for you to meet him said rahn i happen to know that he is free this coming thursday will you be available in the evening yes well be available rahn took out a notebook and started writing when hed finished he tore out the sheet and handed it to me here is the address shall we say eight oclock unless you hear from me before then i nodded excellent vogelmann stood up to leave while rahn bent and searched for something in his briefcase he handed hildegard a magazine perhaps this might also be of interest to you he said i saw them out and when i came back i found her engrossed in the magazine i didnt need to look at the front cover to know that it was reinhard langes urania nor did i need to speak to hildegard to know that she was convinced otto rahn was genuine thursday november the resident registration office turned up an otto rahn formerly of michelstadt near frankfurt now living at tiergartenstrasse a berlin west vc criminal records on the other hand had no trace of him nor did vc the department that compiled the wanted persons list i was just about to leave when the department director an s s sturmbannführer by the name of baum called me over to his office kommissar did i hear you asking that officer about somebody called otto rahn he asked i told him that i was interested in finding out everything i could about otto rahn which department are you with the murder commission he might be able to assist us with an inquiry so you dont actually suspect him of having committed a crime sensing that the sturmbannführer knew something about an otto rahn i decided to cover my tracks a little good grief no i said as i say its just that he may be able to put us in contact with a valuable witness why do you know someone by that name yes i do as a matter of fact he said hes more of an acquaintance really there is an otto rahn whos in the s s the old hotel prinz albrecht strasse was an unremarkable fourstorey building of arched windows and mock corinthian pillars with two long dictatorsized balconies on the first floor surmounted by an enormous ornate clock its seventy rooms meant that it had never been in the same league as the big hotels like the bristol or the adlon which was probably how it came to be taken over by the s s now called s shaus and situated next door to gestapo headquarters at number eight it was also headquarters to heinrich himmler in his capacity as reichsführers s in the personnel records department on the second floor i showed them my warrant and explained my mission im required by the s d to obtain a security clearance for a member of the s s in order that he may be considered for promotion to general heydrichs personal staff the s s corporal on duty stiffened at the mention of heydrichs name how can i help he said eagerly i require to see the mans file his name is otto rahn the corporal asked me to wait and then went into the next room where he searched for the appropriate filingcabinet here you are he said returning after a few minutes with the file im afraid that ill have to ask you to examine it here a file may be removed from this office only with the written approval of the reichsführer himself naturally i knew that i said coldly but im sure ill just need to take a quick look at it this is only a formal security check i stepped away and stood at a lectern on the far side of the office where i opened the file to examine its contents it made interesting reading s s unterscharführer otto rahn born february at michelstadt in odenwald studied philology at the university of heidelberg graduating in joined s s march promoted s s unterscharführer april posted s sdeaths head division oberbayern dachau concentration camp september seconded to race and resettlement office december public speaker and author of crusade against the grail amd lucifers servants there followed several pages of medical notes and character assessments and these included an evaluation from one s sgruppenführer theodor eicke which described rahn as diligent although given to some eccentricities by my reckoning that could have covered just about anything from murder to the length of his hair i returned rahns file to the desk corporal and made my way out of the building otto rahn the more i discovered about him the less inclined i was to believe that he was merely working some elaborate confidence trick here was a man interested in something else besides money a man for whom the word fanatic did not seem to be inappropriate driving back to steglitz i passed rahns house on tiergartenstrasse and i dont thnk i would have been surprised to see the scarlet woman and the great beast of the apocalypse come flying out the front door it was dark by the time we drove to caspartheyss strasse which runs just south of kurfürstendamm on the edge of grunewald it was a quiet street of villas which stop only a little way short of being something more grand and which are occupied largely by doctors and dentists number thirtythree next to a small cottagehospital occupied the corner of paulsbornerstrasse and was opposite a large florist where visitors to the hospital could buy their flowers there was a touch of the gingerbread man about the queerlooking house to which rahn had invited us the basement and groundfloor brickwork was painted brown and on the first and second floors it was creamcoloured a septagonally shaped tower occupied the east side of the house a timbered loggia surmounted by a balcony the centre portion and on the west side a mosscovered wooden gable overhung a couple of porthole windows i hope you brought a clove of garlic with you i told hildegard as i parked the car i could see she didnt much care for the look of the place but she remained obstinately silent still convinced that everything was on the level we walked up to a wroughtiron gate that had been fashioned with a variety of zodiacal symbols and i wondered what the two s s men standing underneath one of the gardens many spruce trees and smoking cigarettes made of it this thought occupied me for only a second before i moved on to the more challenging question of what they and the several party staff cars parked on the pavement were doing there otto rahn answered the door greeting us with sympathetic warmth and directed us into a cloakroom where he relieved us of our coats before we go in he said i should explain that there are a number of other people here for this seance herr weisthors prowess as a clairvoyant has made him germanys most important sage i think i mentioned that a number of leading party members are sympathetic to herr weisthors work incidentally this is his home and so apart from herr vogelmann and myself one of the other guests here tonight will probably be familiar to you hildegards jaw dropped not the führer she said rahn smiled no not he but someone very close to him he has requested that he be treated just like anyone else in order to facilitate a favourable atmosphere for the evenings contact so im telling you now in order that you wont be too surprised that it is the reichsführers s heinrich himmler to whom i am referring no doubt you saw the security men outside and were wondering what was going on the reichsführer is a great patron of our work and has attended many seances emerging from the cloakroom we went through a door soundproofed in buttonbacked padded green leather and into a large and simply furnished lshaped room across the thick green carpet was a round table at one end and a group of about ten people standing over a sofa and a couple of armchairs at the other the walls where they were visible between the light oak panelling were painted white and the green curtains were all drawn there was something classically german about this room which was the same thing as saying that it was about as warm and friendly as a swiss army knife rahn found us some drinks and introduced hildegard and me to the room i spotted vogelmanns red head first of all nodded to him and then searched for himmler since there were no uniforms to be seen he was rather difficult to spot in his dark doublebreasted suit taller than i had expected and younger too perhaps no more than thirtyseven or thirtyeight when he spoke he seemed a mildmannered sort of man and apart from the enormous gold rolex my overall impression was of a man you would have taken for a headmaster rather than the head of the german secret police and what was it about swiss wristwatches that made them so attractive to men of power but a wristwatch was not as attractive to this particular man of power as was hildegard steininger it seemed and the two of them were soon deep in conversation herr weisthor will come out presently rahn explained he usually needs a period of quiet meditation before approaching the spirit world let me introduce you to reinhard lange hes the proprietor of that magazine i left for your wife ah yes urania so there he was short and plump with a dimple in one of his chins and a pugnaciously pendant lower lip as if daring you to smack him or kiss him his fair hair was wellreceded although somewhat babyish about the ears he had hardly any eyebrows to speak of and the eyes themselves were halfclosed slitty even both of these features made him seem weak and inconstant in a nerolike sort of way possibly he was neither of these two things although the strong smell of cologne that surrounded him his selfsatisfied air and his slightly theatrical way of speaking did nothing to correct my first impression of him my line of work has made me a rapid and fairly accurate judge of character and five minutes conversation with lange were enough to convince me that i had not been wrong about him the man was a worthless little queer i excused myself and went to the lavatory i had seen beyond the cloakroom i had already decided to return to weisthors house after the seance and see if the other rooms were any more interesting than the one we were in there didnt appear to be a dog about the place so it seemed that all i had to do was prepare my entry i bolted the door behind me and set about releasing the windowcatch it was stiff and i had just managed to get it open when there was a knock at the door it was rahn herr steininger are you in there i wont be a moment well be starting in a moment or two ill be right there i said and leaving the window a couple of centimetres open i flushed the toilet and went back to rejoin the rest of the guests another man had come into the room and i realized that this must be weisthor aged about sixtyfive he wore a threepiece suit of lightbrown flannel and carried an ornate ivoryhandled stick with strange carvings on its shaft some of which matched his ring physically he resembled an older version of himmler with his small smudge of a moustache hamsterlike cheeks dyspeptic mouth and receding chin but he was stouter and whereas the reichsführer reminded you of a myopic rat weisthor had more of the beaver about his features an effect that was accentuated by the gap between his two front teeth you must be herr steininger he said pumping my hand permit me to introduce myself i am karl maria weisthor and i am delighted to have already had the pleasure of meeting your lovely wife he spoke very formally and with a viennese accent in that at least you are a very fortunate man let us hope that i may be of service to you both before the evening has ended otto has told me of your missing daughter emmeline and of how the police and our good friend rolf vogelmann have been unable to find her as i said to your wife i am sure that the spirits of our ancient german ancestors will not desert us and that they will tell us what has become of her as they have told us of other things before he turned and waved at the table shall we be seated he said herr steininger you and your wife will sit on either side of me everyone will join hands herr steininger this will increase our conscious power try not to let go no matter what you might see or hear as it can cause the link to be broken do you both understand we nodded and took our seats when the rest of the company had sat down i noticed that himmler had contrived to be sitting next to hildegard to whom he was paying close attention it struck me that i would tell it differently and that it would amuse heydrich and nebe if i told them i spent the evening holding hands with heinrich himmler thinking about it then i almost laughed and to cover my halfsmile i turned away from weisthor and found myself looking at a tall urbane siegfriedtype wearing evening dress with the kind of warm sensitive manner that comes only of bathing in dragons blood my name is kindermann he said sternly dr lanz kindermann at your service herr steininger he glanced down at my hand as if it had been a dirty dishcloth not the famous psychotherapist i said he smiled i doubt that you could call me famous he said but with some satisfaction all the same nevertheless i thank you for the compliment and are you austrian yes why do you ask i like to know something about the men whose hands i hold i offered and grasped his own firmly in a moment said weisthor i shall ask our friend otto to turn off the electric light but first of all i should like us all to close our eyes and to breathe deeply the purpose of this is to relax only if we are relaxed will spirits feel comfortable enough to contact us and offer us the benefit of what they are able to see it may help you to think of something peaceful such as a flower or a formation of clouds he paused so that the only sounds which could be heard were the deep breathing of the people around the table and the ticking of a clock on the mantelpiece i heard vogelmann clear his throat which prompted weisthor to speak again try and flow into the person next to you so that we may feel the power of the circle when otto turns off the light i shall go into trance and permit my body to be taken under the control of spirit spirit will control my speech my every bodily function so that i shall be in a vulnerable position make no sudden noise or interruption speak gently if you wish to communicate with spirit or allow otto to speak for you he paused again otto the lights please i heard rahn stand up as if rousing himself from a deep sleep and creep across the carpet from now on weisthor will not speak unless he is under spirit he said it will be my voice you hear speak to him in trance he turned off the light and after a few seconds i heard him return to the circle i stared hard into the darkness at where weisthor was sitting but try as i might i could see nothing but the strange shapes which play on the back of the retina when it is deprived of light whatever weisthor said about flowers or clouds i found it helped me to think of the mauser automatic at my shoulder and the nice formation of mm ammunition in the grip the first change that i was aware of was that of his breathing which became progressively slower and deeper after a while it was almost undetectable and but for his grip which had slackened considerably i might have said he had disappeared finally he spoke but it was in a voice that made my flesh creep and my hair prickle i have a wise king here from long long ago he said his grip tightening suddenly from a time when three suns shone in the northern sky he uttered a long sepulchral sigh he suffered a terrible defeat in battle at the hands of charlemagne and his christian army were you saxon rahn asked quietly aye saxon the franks called them pagans and put them to death for it agonizing deaths that were full of blood and pain he seemed to hesitate its difficult to say this he says that blood must be paid for he says that german paganism is grown strong again and must be revenged on the franks and their religion in the name of the old gods then he grunted almost as if he had been struck and went quiet again dont be alarmed rahn murmured spirit can leave quite violently sometimes after several minutes weisthor spoke again who are you he asked softly a girl will you tell us your name child no come now dont be afraid said rahn please come forward to us her name is emmeline said weisthor i heard hildegard gasp is your name emmeline steininger rahn asked if so then your mother and father are here to speak to you child she says that she is not a child whispered weisthor and that one of these two people is not her real parent at all i stiffened could it be genuine after all did weisthor really have mediumistic powers im her stepmother said hildegard tremulously and i wondered if she had recognized that weisthor should have said that neither of us was emmelines real parent she says that she misses her dancing but especially she misses you both we miss you too darling where are you emmeline i asked there was a long silence and so i repeated the question they killed her said weisthor falteringly and hid her somewhere emmeline you must try and help us said rahn can you tell us anything about where they put you yes ill tell them she says that outside the window theres a hill at the bottom of the hill is a pretty waterfall whats that a cross or maybe something else thats high like a tower is on top of the hill the kreuzberg i said is it the kreuzberg rahn asked she doesnt know the name whispered weisthor wheres that oh how terrible she says shes in a box im sorry emmeline but i dont think i can have heard you properly not in a box a barrel yes a barrel a rotten smelly old barrel in an old cellar full of rotten old barrels sounds like a brewery said kindermann could you be referring to the schultheiss brewery said rahn she thinks that it must be although it doesnt seem like a place where lots of people go some of the barrels are old and have holes in them she can see out of one of them no my dear it wouldnt be very good for holding beer i quite agree hildegard whispered something that i failed to hear courage dear lady rahn said courage then more loudly who was it that killed you emmeline and can you tell us why weisthor groaned deeply she doesnt know their names but she thinks that it was for the blood mystery how did you find out about that emmeline thats one of the many thousands of things you learn about when you die i see they killed her like they kill their animals and then her blood was mixed with the wine and the bread she thinks that it must have been for religious rites but not the sort she had ever seen before emmeline said a voice which i thought must be himmlers was it the jews who murdered you was it jews who used your blood another long silence she doesnt know said weisthor they didnt say who or what they were they didnt look like any of the pictures shes seen of jews whats that my dear she says that it might have been but she doesnt want to get anyone into trouble no matter what they did to her she says that if it was the jews then they were just bad jews and that not all jews would have approved of such a thing she doesnt want to say any more about that she just wants someone to go and get her out of that dirty barrel yes im sure someone will organize it emmeline dont worry tell her that i shall personally see to it that it happens tonight said himmler the child has my own word on that whats that you said all right emmeline says to thank you for trying to help her and she says to tell mother and father that she loves them very much indeed but not to worry about her now nothing can bring her back you should both get on with your lives and put what has happened behind you try and be happy emmeline has to go now goodbye emmeline sobbed hildegard goodbye i said once again there was silence but for the sound of the blood rushing in my ears i was glad of the darkness because it hid my face which must have shown my anger and afforded me an opportunity to breathe my way back to a semblance of quiet sadness and resignation if it hadnt been for the two or three minutes that elapsed from the end of weisthors performance and the raising of the lights i think that i would have shot them all where they sat weisthor rahn vogelmann lange shit id have murdered the whole dirty lot of them just for the sheer satisfaction of it id have made them take the barrel in their mouths and blown the backs of their heads on to each others faces an extra nostril for himmler a third eyesocket for kindermann i was still breathing heavily when the lights went up again but this was easily mistaken for grief hildegards face was shiny with tears which provoked himmler to put his arm around her catching my eye he nodded grimly weisthor was the last to get to his feet he swayed for a moment as if he would fall and rahn took hold of him by the elbow weisthor smiled and patted his friends hand gratefully i can see by your face my dear lady that your daughter came through she nodded i want to thank you herr weisthor thank you so much for helping us she sniffed loudly and found her handkerchief karl you were excellent tonight said himmler quite remarkable there was a murmur of assent from the rest of the table myself included himmler was still shaking his head in wonder quite quite remarkable he repeated you may all rest assured that i shall contact the proper authorities myself and order that a squad of police be sent immediately to search the schultheiss brewery for the unfortunate childs body himmler was staring at me now and i nodded dumbly in response to what he was saying but i dont doubt for a minute that they will find her there i have every confidence that what we have just heard was the child speaking to karl in order that both your minds may now be put at rest i think that the best thing for you to do now would be to go home and wait to hear from the police yes of course i said and walking round the table i took hildegard by the hand and led her away from the reichsführers embrace then we shook hands with the assembled company accepted their condolences and allowed rahn to escort us to the door what can one say he said with great gravitas naturally i am very sorry that emmeline has passed on to the other side but as the reichsführer himself said its a blessing that now you can know for sure yes hildegard sniffed its best to know i think rahn narrowed his eyes and looked slightly pained as he grasped me by the forearm i think its also best if for obvious reasons you were to say nothing of this evenings events to the police if they should come to say that they have indeed found her im afraid that they might make things very awkward for you if you seemed to know that she had been found before they did themselves as im sure you will appreciate the police arent very enlightened when it comes to understanding this sort of thing and might ask you all sorts of difficult questions he shrugged i mean we all have questions concerning what comes to us from the other side it is indeed an enigma to everyone and one to which we have very few answers at this stage yes i can see how the police might prove to be awkward i said you may depend on me to say nothing of what transpired this evening my wife as well herr steininger i knew you would understand he opened the front door please dont hesitate to contact us again if at some stage you would wish to contact your daughter but i should leave it for a while it doesnt do to summon spirit too regularly we said goodbye again and walked back to the car get me away from here bernie she hissed as i opened the door for her by the time i had started the engine she was crying again only this time it was with shock and horror i cant believe people could be so so evil she sobbed im sorry you had to go through that i said really i am id have given anything for you to have avoided it but it was the only way i drove to the end of the street and on to bismarkplatz a quiet intersection of suburban streets with a small patch of grass in the middle it was only now that i realized how close we were to frau langes house in herbertstrasse i spotted korschs car and pulled up behind it bernie do you think that the police will find her there yes i think they will but how could he fake it and know where she is how could he know those things about her her love of dancing because he or one of those others put her there probably they spoke to emmeline and asked her a few questions before they killed her just for the sake of authenticity she blew her nose and then looked up why have we stopped because im going back there to take a look around see if i can find out what their ugly little game is the car parked in front of us is driven by one of my men his name is korsch and hes going to drive you home she nodded please be careful bernie she said breathlessly her head dropping forwards on to her chest are you all right hildegard she fumbled for the doorhandle i think im going to be sick she fell sideways towards the pavement vomiting into the gutter and down her sleeve as she broke her fall with her hand i jumped out of the car and ran round to the passenger door to help her but korsch was there before me supporting her by the shoulders until she could draw breath again jesus christ he said what happened in there crouching down beside her i mopped the perspiration from hildegards face before wiping her mouth she took the handkerchief from my hand and allowed korsch to help her sit up again its a long story i said and im afraid that its going to have to wait awhile yet i want you to take her home and then wait for me at the alex get becker there as well ive a feeling were going to be busy tonight im sorry said hildegard im all right now she smiled bravely korsch and i helped her out and holding her by the waist we walked her to korschs car be careful sir he said as he got behind the driving wheel and started the engine i told him not to worry after they had driven away i waited in the car for half an hour or so and then walked back down caspartheyss strasse the wind was getting up a bit and a couple of times it rose to such a pitch in the trees that lined the dark street that had i been of a rather more fanciful disposition i might have imagined that it was something to do with what had taken place in weisthors house disturbing the spirits and that sort of thing as it was i was possessed of a sense of danger which the wind moaning across the cloudtumbling sky did nothing to alleviate and indeed this feeling was if anything made all the more acute by seeing the gingerbread house again by now the staff cars were gone from the pavement outside but i nevertheless approached the garden with caution in case the two s s men had remained behind for whatever reason having satisfied myself that the house was not guarded i tiptoed round to the side of the house and to the lavatory window i had left unlocked it was well that i stepped lightly because the light was on and from inside the small room could be heard the unmistakable sound of a man straining on the toiletbowl flattening myself in the shadows against the wall i waited until he finished and finally after what seemed like ten or fifteen minutes i heard the sound of the toilet flushing and saw the light go off several minutes passed before i judged it safe to go to the window and push it up the sash but almost immediately upon entering the lavatory i could have wished to have been elsewhere or at least wearing a gasmask since the fecal smell that greeted my nostrils was such as would have turned the stomachs of a whole clinicful of proctologists i suppose thats what bulls mean when they say that sometimes its a rotten job for my money having to stand quietly in a toilet where someone has just achieved a bowelmovement of truly gothic proportions is about as rotten as it can get the terrible smell was the main reason i decided to move out into the cloakroom rather more quickly than might have been safe and i was almost seen by weisthor himself as he trudged wearily past the open cloakroom door and across the hallway to a room on the opposite side quite a wind tonight said a voice which i recognized as belonging to otto rahn yes weisthor chuckled it all added to the atmosphere didnt it himmler will be especially pleased with this turn in the weather no doubt he will ascribe all sorts of supernatural wagnerian notions to it you were very good karl said rahn even the reichsführer commented on it but you look tired said a third voice which i took to be kindermanns youd better let me take a look at you i edged forward and looked through the gap between the cloakroom door and frame weisthor was taking off his jacket and hanging it over the back of a chair sitting down heavily he allowed kindermann to take his pulse he seemed listless and pale almost as if he really had been in contact with the spirit world he seemed to hear my thoughts faking it is almost as tiring as doing it for real he said perhaps i should give you an injection said kindermann a little morphine to help you sleep without waiting for a reply he produced a small bottle and a hypodermic syringe from a medical bag and set about preparing the needle after all we dont want you feeling tired for the forthcoming court of honour do we i shall want you there of course lanz said weisthor rolling back his own sleeve to reveal a forearm that was so bruised and scarred with puncture marks that it looked as if he had been tattooed i shant be able to get through it without cocaine i find it clarifies the mind wonderfully and i shall need to be so transcendentally stimulated that the reichsführers s will find what i have to say totally irresistible you know for a moment back there i thought you were actually going to make the revelation tonight said rahn you really teased him with all of that stuff about the girl not wanting to get anyone into trouble well frankly he more or less believes it now only when the time is right my dear otto said weisthor only when the time is right think how much more dramatic it will be to him when i reveal it in wewelsburg jewish complicity will have the force of spiritual revelation and we will be done with this nonsense of his about respecting property and the rule of law the jews will get whats coming to them and there wont be one policeman to stop it he nodded at the syringe and watched impassively as kindermann thrust the needle home sighing with satisfaction as the plunger was depressed and now gentlemen if you will kindly help an old man to his bed i watched as they each took an arm and walked him up the creaking stairs it crossed my mind that if kindermann or rahn were planning to leave then they might want to put on a coat and so i crept out of the cloakroom and went into the lshaped room where the bogus seance had been staged hiding behind the thick curtains in case either one of them should come in but when they came downstairs again they only stood in the hall and talked i missed half of what they said but the gist of it seemed to be that reinhard lange was reaching the end of his usefulness kindermann made a feeble attempt to apologize for his lover but his heart didnt seem to be in it the smell in the lavatory was a hard act to follow but what happened next was even more disgusting i couldnt see exactly what took place and there were no words to hear but the sound of two men engaged in a homosexual act is unmistakable and left me feeling utterly nauseated when finally they had brought their filthy behaviour to its braying conclusion and left chuckling like a couple of degenerate schoolboys i felt weak enough to have to open a window for some fresh air in the study next door i helped myself to a large glass of weisthors brandy which worked a lot better than a chestful of berlin air and with the curtains drawn i even felt relaxed enough to switch on the desklamp and take a good long look around the room before searching the drawers and cabinets it was worth a look too weisthors taste in decoration was no less eccentric than mad king ludwigs there were strangelooking calendars heraldic coats of arms paintings of standing stones merlin the sword in the stone the grail and the knights templar and photographs of castles hitler himmler and finally weisthor himself in uniform first as an officer in some regiment of austrian infantry and then in the uniform of a senior officer in the s s karl weisthor was in the s s i almost said it aloud it seemed so fantastic nor was he merely an nco like otto rahn but judging from the number of pips on his collar at least a brigadier and something else too why had i not noticed it before the physical similarity between weisthor and julius streicher it was true that weisthor was perhaps ten years older than streicher but the description given by the little jewish schoolgirl by sarah hirsch could just as easily have applied to weisthor as to streicher both men were heavy with not much hair and a small moustache and both men had strong southern accents austrian or bavarian she had said well weisthor was from vienna i wondered if otto rahn could have been the man driving the car everything seemed to fall in with what i already knew and my overhearing the conversation in the hallway confirmed my earlier suspicion that the motive behind the killings was to throw blame on to berlins jews yet somehow there still seemed to be more to it there had been himmlers involvement was i right in thinking that their secondary motive had been the enlistment of the reichsführers s as a believer in weisthors powers thereby ensuring the letters powerbase and prospects for advancement in the s s perhaps even at the expense of heydrich himself it was a fine piece of theorizing now all i needed to do was prove it and the evidence would have to be watertight if himmler was going to allow his own personal rasputin to be sent up for multiple murder the more so if it was likely to reveal the reichs chief of police as the gullible victim of an elaborate hoax i started to search weisthors desk thinking that even if i did find enough to nail weisthor and his evil scheme i wasnt about to make a penpal out of the man who was arguably the most powerful man in germany this was not a comfortable prospect it turned out that weisthor was a meticulous man with his correspondence and i found files of letters which included copies of those he had sent himself as well as those he had received sitting down at his desk i started to read them at random if i was looking for typedout admissions of guilt i was disappointed weisthor and his associates had developed that talent for euphemism that working in security or intelligence seems to encourage these letters confirmed everything i knew but they were so carefully phrased and included several codewords as to be open to more than one

believe that i have the solution anders has some experience of police matters and is confident that in a situation created out of project krist it would not be unusual for a citizen to solicit his own private agent of inquiry police efficiency being what it is it is therefore proposed that through the offices and finance of our good friend reinhard lange we purchase the services of a small private investigation agency and then simply advertise in the newspapers we are all of the opinion that the relevant parties will contact this same private detective who after a decent interval to apparently exhaust his putative inquiries will himself bring about our entry into this matter by whatever means is deemed appropriate in the main such men are motivated only by money and therefore provided that our operative is sufficiently remunerated he will believe only what he wishes to believe namely that we are a group of cranks should at any stage he prove troublesome i am certain that we will need only to remind him of the reichsführers interest in this matter to guarantee his silence i have drawn up a list of suitable candidates and with your permission i should like to contact these as soon as possible heil hitler yours otto rahn k m wiligut weisthor caspartheyss strasse berlin w to s sunterscharführer otto rahn tiergartenstrasse a berlin w july strictly confidential dear otto i have learnt from anders that the police are holding a jew on suspicion of certain crimes why did it not occur to any of us that the police being what they are they would frame some person albeit a jew for these crimes at the right time in our plan such an arrest would have been most helpful but right now before we have had a chance to demonstrate our power for the benefit of the reichsführer and hope to influence him accordingly it is nothing short of a nuisance however it occurs to me that we can actually turn this to our advantage another project krist incident while this jew is incarcerated will not only effect this mans release but will accordingly embarrass heydrich very badly indeed please see to it heil hitler weisthor s ssturmbannführer richard anders order of knights templar berlin

alexanderplatz did indeed receive an anonymous telephone call moreover a conversation with the reichsführers adjutant karl wolff indicates that it was he and not the reichsführer who made the said call he very much dislikes misleading the police in this fashion but he admits that he can see no other way of assisting with the inquiry and still preserve the necessity of the reichsführers

he may be weakening in his resolve to assist with the execution of project krist that what we are doing is in keeping with our ancient pagan heritage no longer seems to impress him as something unpleasant but none the less necessary whilst i do not for a moment believe that he would ever betray us i feel that he should no longer be a part of those project krist activities which perforce must take place within this clinic otherwise i continue to rejoice in your ancient spiritual heirloom and look forward to the day when we can continue to investigate our ancestors through your autogenic

too much by staying as long as i had more than that i realized that for perhaps the first time since coming out of the trenches in i was afraid friday november driving from weisthors house to the alex i tried to make some sense out of what i had discovered vogelmanns part was explained and to some extent that of reinhard lange and perhaps kindermanns clinic was where they had killed the girls what better place to kill someone than a hospital where people were always coming and going feet first certainly his letter to weisthor seemed to indicate as much there was a frightening ingenuity in weisthors solution after murdering the girls all of whom had been selected for their aryan looks their bodies were hidden so carefully as to be virtually impossible to find the more so when one took into account the lack of police manpower available to investigate something as routine as a missing person by the time the police realized that there was a massmurderer stalking the streets of berlin they were more concerned with keeping things quiet so that their failure to catch the killer did not look incompetent for at least as long as it took to find a convenient scapegoat such as josef kahn but what of heydrich and nebe i wondered was their attendance at this s s court of honour deemed mandatory merely by virtue of their senior rank after all the s s had its factions just like any other organization daluege for instance the head of orpo like his opposite number arthur nebe felt as illdisposed to himmler and heydrich as they felt towards him and quite clearly of course weisthor and his faction were antagonistic towards the jew heydrich heydrich a jew it was one of those neat pieces of counterpropaganda that relies on a massive contradiction to sound convincing id heard this rumour before as had most of the bulls around the alex and like them i knew where it originated admiral canaris head of the abwehr german military intelligence was heydrichs most bitter opponent and certainly the most powerful one or was there some other reason why heydrich was going to wewelsburg in a few days nothing to do with him was ever quite what it seemed to be although i didnt doubt for a minute that he would enjoy the prospect of himmlers embarrassment for him it would be nice thick icing on the cake that had as its main ingredient the arrest of weisthor and the other antiheydrich conspirators within the s s to prove it however i was going to need something else besides weisthors papers something more eloquent and unequivocal that would convince the reichsführer himself it was then that i thought of reinhard lange the softest excrescence on the maculate body of weisthors plot it certainly wasnt going to require a clean and sharp curette to cut him away i had just the dirty ragged thumbnail that would do the job i still had two of his letters to lanz kindermann back at the alex i went straight to the duty sergeants desk and found korsch and becker waiting for me with professor illmann and sergeant gollner another call yes sir said gollner right lets get going from the outside the schultheiss brewery in kreuzberg with its uniform red brick numerous towers and turrets as well as the fairsized garden made it seem more like a school than a brewery but for the smell which even at two am was strong enough to pinch the nostrils you might have expected to find rooms full of desks instead of beerbarrels we stopped next to the tentshaped gatehouse police becker yelled at the nightwatchman who seemed to like a beer himself his stomach was so big i doubt he could have reached the pockets of his overalls even if he had wanted to where do you keep the old beerbarrels what you mean the empties not exactly i mean the ones that probably need a bit of mending the man touched his forehead in a sort of salute right you are sir i know exactly what you mean this way if you please we got out of the cars and followed him back up the road we had driven along after only a short way we ducked through a green door in the wall of the brewery and went down a long and narrow passageway dont you keep that door locked i said no need said the nightwatchman nothing worth stealing here the beers kept behind the gate there was an old cellar with a couple of centuries of filth on the ceiling and the floor a bare bulb on the wall added a touch of yellow to the gloom here you are then said the man i guess this must be what youre looking for this is where they puts the barrels as needs repairing only a lot of them never get repaired some of these havent been moved in ten years shit said korsch there must be nearly a hundred of them at least laughed our guide well wed better get started then hadnt we i said what exactly are you looking for a bottleopener said becker now be a good fellow and run along will you the man sneered said something under his breath and then waddled off much to beckers amusement it was illmann who found her he didnt even take the lid off here this one its been moved recently and the lids a different colour from the rest he lifted the lid took a deep breath and then shone his torch inside its her all right i came over to where he was standing and took a look for myself and one for hildegard id seen enough photographs of emmeline around the apartment to recognize her immediately get her out of there as soon as you can professor illmann looked at me strangely and then nodded perhaps he heard something in my tone that made him think my interest was more than just professional he waved in the police photographer becker i said yes sir i need you to come with me on the way to reinhard langes address we called in at my office to collect his letters i poured us both a large glass of schnapps and explained something of what had transpired that evening langes the weak link i heard them say so whats more hes a lemonsucker i drained the glass and poured another inhaling deeply of it to increase the effect my lips tingling as i held it on my palate for a while before swallowing i shuddered a little as i let it slip down my backbone and said i want you to work a vicesquad line on him yes how heavy like a fucking waltzer becker grinned and finished his own drink roll him out flat i get the idea he opened his jacket and took out a short rubber truncheon which he tapped enthusiastically on the palm of his hand ill stroke him with this well i hope you know more about using that than you do that parabellum you carry i want this fellow alive scared shitless but alive to answer questions you get it dont worry he said im an expert with this little india rubber ill just break the skin youll see the bones we can leave until another time you give the word i do believe you like this dont you scaring the piss out of people becker laughed dont you the house was on lützowuferstrasse overlooking the landwehr canal and within earshot of the zoo where some of hitlers relations could be heard complaining about the standard of accommodation it was an elegant threestorey wilhelmine building orangepainted and with a big square oriel window on the first floor becker started to pull the bell as if he was doing it on piecework when he got tired of that he started on the door knocker eventually a light came on in the hall and we heard the scrape of a bolt the door opened on the chain and i saw langes pale face peer nervously round the side police said becker open up what is happening he swallowed what do you want becker took a step backwards mind out sir he said and then stabbed at the door with the sole of his boot i heard lange squeal as becker kicked it again at the third attempt the door flew open with a great splintering noise to reveal lange hurrying up the stairs in his pyjamas becker went after him dont shoot him for christs sake i yelled at becker oh god help lange gurgled as becker caught him by the bare ankle and started to drag him back twisting round he tried to kick himself free of beckers grip but it was to no avail and as becker pulled so lange bounced down the stairs on his fat behind when he hit the floor becker gripped at his face and stretched each cheek towards his ears when i say open the door you open the fucking door right then he put his whole hand over langes face and banged his head hard on the stair you got that queer lange protested loudly and becker caught hold of some of his hair and slapped him twice hard across the face i said have you got that queer yes he screamed thats enough i said pulling him by the shoulder he stood up breathing heavily and grinned at me you said a waltzer sir ill tell you when he needs some more of the same lange wiped his bleeding lip and inspected the blood that smeared the back of his hand there were tears in his eyes but he still managed to summon up some indignation look here he yelled what the hell is this all about what do you mean by barging in here like this tell him i said becker grabbed the collar of langes silk dressinggown and twisted it against his pudgy neck its a pink triangle for you my fat little fellow he said a pink triangle with bar if the letters to your bottomstroking friend kindermann are anything to go by lange wrenched beckers hand away from his neck and stared bitterly at him i dont know what youre talking about he hissed pink triangle what does that mean for gods sake paragraph of the german penal code i said becker quoted the section off by heart any male who indulges in criminally indecent activities with another male or who allows himself to participate in such activities will be punished with gaol he cuffed him playfully on the cheek with the backs of his fingers that means youre under arrest you fat buttfucker but its preposterous i never wrote any letters to anyone and im not a homosexual youre not a homosexual becker sneered and i dont piss out of my prick from his jacket pocket he produced the two letters id given him and brandished them in front of langes face and i suppose you wrote these to the toothfairy lange snatched at the letters and missed bad manners becker said cuffing him again only harder where did you get those i gave them to him lange looked at me and then looked again wait a minute he said i know you youre steininger you were there tonight at he stopped himself from saying where hed seen me thats right i was at weisthors little party i know quite a bit of whats been going on and youre going to help me with the rest youre wasting your time whoever you are im not going to tell you anything i nodded at becker who started to hit him again i watched dispassionately as first he coshed him across the knees and ankles and then lightly once on the ear hating myself for keeping alive the best traditions of the gestapo and for the cold dehumanized brutality i felt inside my guts i told him to stop waiting for lange to stop sobbing i walked around a bit peering through doors in complete contrast to the exterior the inside of langes house was anything but traditional the furniture rugs and paintings of which there were many were all in the most expensive modern style the kind thats easier to look at than to live with when eventually i saw that lange had drawn himself together a bit i said this is quite a place not my taste perhaps but then im a little oldfashioned you know one of those awkward people with rounded joints the type that puts personal comfort ahead of the worship of geometry but ill bet youre really comfortable here how do you think hell like the tank at the alex becker what the lockup very geometric sir all those iron bars not forgetting all those bohemian types wholl be in there and give berlin its worldfamous nightlife the rapists the murderers the thieves the drunks they get a lot of drunks in the tank throwingup everywhere its really awful sir thats right you know becker i dont think we can put someone like herr lange in there i dont think he would find it at all to his liking do you you bastards i dont think hed last the night sir especially if we were to find him something special to wear from his wardrobe something artistic as befits a man of herr langes sensitivity perhaps even a little makeup eh sir hed look real nice with a bit of lipstick and rouge he chuckled enthusiastically a natural sadist i think you had better talk to me herr lange i said you dont scare me you bastards do you hear you dont scare me thats very unfortunate because unlike kriminalassistant becker here i dont particularly enjoy the prospect of human suffering but im afraid i have no choice id like to do this straight but quite frankly i just dont have the time we dragged him upstairs to the bedroom where becker selected an outfit from langes walkin wardrobe when he found some rouge and lipstick lange roared loudly and took a swing at me no he yelled i wont wear this i caught his fist and twisted his arm behind him you snivelling little coward damn you lange youll wear it and like it or so help me well hang you upside down and cut your throat like all those girls your friends have murdered and then maybe well just dump your carcass in a beerbarrel or an old trunk and see how your mother feels about identifying you after six weeks i handcuffed him and becker started with the makeup when hed finished oscar wilde by comparison would have seemed as unassuming and conservative as a drapers assistant from hanover come on i growled lets get this kitkat showgirl back to her hotel we had not exaggerated about the night tank at the alex its probably the same in every big city police station but since the alex is a very big city police station indeed it followed that the tank there is also very big in fact it is huge as big as an average cinema theatre except that there are no seats nor are there any bunks or windows or ventilation theres just the dirty floor the dirty latrine buckets the dirty bars the dirty people and the lice the gestapo kept a lot of detainees there for whom there was no room at prinz albrecht strasse orpo put the nights drunks in there to fight puke and sleep it off kripo used the place like the gestapo used the canal as a toilet for its human refuse a terrible place for a human being even one like reinhard lange i had to keep reminding myself of what it was that he and his friends had done of emmeline steininger sitting in that barrel like so many rotten potatoes some of the prisoners whistled and blew kisses when they saw us bring him down and lange turned pale with fright my god youre not going to leave me here he said clutching at my arm then unpack it i said weisthor rahn kindermann a signed statement and you can get a nice cell to yourself i cant i cant you dont know what theyll do to me no i said and nodded at the men behind the bars but i know what theyll do to you the lockup sergeant opened the enormous heavy cage and stood back as becker pushed him into the tank his cries were still ringing in my ears by the time i got back to steglitz hildegard lay asleep on the sofa her hair spread across the cushion like the dorsal fin of some exotic golden fish i sat down ran my hand across its smooth silkiness and then kissed her forehead catching the drink on her breath as i did so stirring her eyes blinked open sad and crusted with tears she put her hand on my cheek and then on to the back of my neck pulling me down to her mouth i have to talk to you i said holding back she pressed her finger against my lips i know shes dead she said ive done all my crying theres no more water in the well she smiled sadly and i kissed each eyelid tenderly smoothing her scented hair with the palm of my hand nuzzling at her ear chewing the side of her neck as her arms held me close and closer still youve had a ghastly evening too she said gently havent you darling ghastly i said i was worried about you going back to that awful house lets not talk about it put me to bed bernie she put her arms around my neck and i gathered her up folding her against my body like an invalid and carrying her into the bedroom i sat her down on jhe edge of the bed and started to unbutton her blouse when that was off she sighed and fell back against the quilt slightly drunk i thought unzipping her skirt and tugging it smoothly down her stockinged legs pulling down her slip i kissed her small breasts her stomach and then the inside of her thighs but her pants seemed to be too tight or caught between her buttocks and resisted my pulling i asked her to lift her bottom tear them she said what tear them off hurt me bernie use me she spoke with breathless urgency her thighs opening and closing like the jaws of some enormous praying mantis hildegard she struck me hard across the mouth listen damn you hurt me when i tell you i caught her wrist as she struck again ive had enough for one evening i caught her other arm stop it please you must i shook my head but her legs wrapped around my waist and my kidneys winced as her strong thighs squeezed tight stop it for gods sake hit me you stupid ugly bastard did i tell you that you were stupid too a typical boneheaded bull if you were a man youd rape me but you havent got it in you have you if its a sense of grief youre after then well take a drive down to the morgue i shook my head and pushed her thighs apart and then away from me but not like this it should be with love she stopped writhing and for a moment seemed to recognize the truth of what i was saying smiling then raising her mouth to me she spat in my face after that there was nothing for it but to leave there was a knot in my stomach that was as cold and lonely as my apartment on fasanenstrasse and almost immediately i arrived home again i enlisted a bottle of brandy in dissolving it someone once said that happiness is that which is negative the mere abolition of desire and the extinction of pain the brandy helped a little but before i dropped off to sleep still wearing my overcoat and sitting in my armchair i think i realized just how positively i had been affected sunday november survival especially in these difficult times has to count as some sort of an achievement its not something that comes easily life in nazi germany demands that you keep working at it but having done that much youre left with the problem of giving it some purpose after all what good is health and security if your life has no meaning this wasnt just me feeling sorry for myself like a lot of other people i genuinely believe that there is always someone who is worse off in this case however i knew it for a fact the jews were already persecuted but if weisthor had his way their suffering was about to be taken to a new extreme in which case what did that say about them and us together in what condition was that likely to leave germany its true i told myself that it was not my concern and that the jews had brought it on themselves but even if that were the case what was our pleasure beside their pain was our life any sweeter at their expense did my freedom feel any better as a result of their persecution the more i thought about it the more i realized the urgency not only of stopping the killings but also of frustrating weisthors declared aim of bringing hell down on jewish heads and the more i felt that to do otherwise would leave me degraded in equal measure im no knight in shining armour just a weatherbeaten man in a crumpled overcoat on a street corner with only a grey idea of something you might as well go ahead and call morality sure im none too scrupulous about the things that might benefit my pocket and i could no more inspire a bunch of young thugs to do good works than i could stand up and sing a solo in the church choir but of one thing i was sure i was through looking at my fingernails when there were thieves in the store i tossed the pile of letters on to the table in front of me we found these when we searched your house i said a very tired and dishevelled reinhard lange regarded them without much interest perhaps youd care to tell me how these came to be in your possession theyre mine he shrugged i dont deny it he sighed and dropped his head on to his hands look ive signed your statement what more do you want ive cooperated havent i were nearly finished reinhard theres just a loose end or two i want tied up like who killed klaus hering i dont know what youre talking about youve got a short memory he was blackmailing your mother with these letters which he stole from your lover who also happened to be his employer he thought shed be better for the money i guess well to cut a long story short your mother hired a private investigator to find out who was squeezing her that person was me this was before i went back to being a bull at the alex shes a shrewd lady your mother reinhard pity you didnt inherit some of that from her anyway she thought it possible that you and whoever was blackmailing her might be sexually involved and so when i found out the name she wanted you to decide what to do next of course she wasnt to know that youd already acquired a private investigator in the ugly shape of rolf vogelmann or at least otto rahn had using money you provided coincidentally when rahn was looking around for a business to buy into he even wrote to me we never had the pleasure of discussing his proposition so it took me quite a while to remember his name anyway thats just by the by when your mother told you that hering was blackmailing her naturally you discussed the matter with dr kindermann and he recommended dealing with the matter yourselves you and otto rahn after all whats one more wetjob when youve done so many i never killed anyone i told you that but you went along with killing hering didnt you i expect you drove the car probably you even helped kindermann string up herings dead body and made it look like suicide no its not true wearing their s s uniforms were they he frowned and shook his head how could you know that i found an s s cap badge sticking in the flesh of herings palm ill bet he put up quite a struggle tell me did the man in the car put up much of a fight the man wearing the eyepatch the one watching herings apartment he had to be killed too didnt he just in case he identified you no all nice and neat kill him and make it look like hering did it and then get hering to hang himself in a fit of remorse not forgetting to take away the letters of course who killed the man in the car was that your idea no i didnt want to be there i grabbed him by the lapels picked him off his chair and started to slap him come on ive had just about enough of your whining tell me who killed him or ill have you shot within the hour lanz did it with rahn otto held his arms while kindermann he stabbed him it was horrible horrible i let him back down on the chair he collapsed forward on to the table and started to sob into his forearm you know reinhard youre in a pretty tight spot i said lighting a cigarette being there makes you an accomplice to murder and then theres you knowing about the murders of all these girls i told you he sniffed miserably they would have killed me i never went along with it but i was afraid not to that doesnt explain how you got into this in the first place i picked up langes statement and glanced over it dont think i havent asked myself the same question and did you come up with any answers a man i admired a man i believed in he convinced me that what we were doing was for the good of germany that it was our duty it was kindermann who persuaded me theyre not going to like that in court reinhard kindermann doesnt play a very convincing eve to your adam but its true i tell you that may be so but were fresh out of figleaves you want a defence you better think of something to improve on that thats good legal advice you can depend on it and let me tell you something youre going to need all the good advice you can get because the way i see it youre the only one whos likely to need a lawyer what do you mean ill be straight with you reinhard ive got enough in this statement of yours to send you straight to the block but the rest of them i dont know theyre all s s acquainted with the reichsführer weisthors a personal friend of himmlers and well i worry reinhard i worry that youll be the scapegoat that all of them will get away with it in order to avoid a scandal of course theyll probably have to resign from the s s but nothing more than that youll be the one who loses his head no it cant be true i nodded now if there was just something else besides your statement something that could let you off the hook on the murder charge of course youd have to take your chances on the para but you might get away with five years in a k z instead of an outright death sentence youd still have a chance i paused so how about it reinhard all right he said after a minute there is something talk to me he started hesitantly not quite sure whether or not he was right to trust me i wasnt sure myself lanz is austrian from salzburg that much i guessed he read medicine in vienna when he graduated he specialized in nervous diseases and took up a post at the salzburg mental asylum which was where he met weisthor or wiligut as he called himself in those days was he a doctor too god no he was a patient by profession a soldier in the austrian army but he is also the last in a long line of german wise men which dates back to prehistoric times weisthor possesses ancestral clairvoyant memory which enables him to describe the lives and religious practices of the early german pagans how very useful pagans who worshipped the germanic god krist a religion which was later stolen by the jews as the new gospel of jesus did they report this theft i lit another cigarette you wanted to know said lange no no please go on im listening weisthor studied runes of which the swastika is one of the basic forms in fact crystal shapes such as the pyramid are all rune types solar symbols thats where the word crystal comes from you dont say well in the early s weisthor began to exhibit signs of paranoid schizophrenia believing that he was being victimized by catholics jews and freemasons this followed the death of his son which meant that the line of the wiligut wise men was broken he blamed his wife and as time went by became increasingly violent finally he tried to strangle her and was later certified insane on several occasions during his confinement he tried to murder other inmates but gradually under the influence of drug treatment his mind was brought under control and kindermann was his doctor yes until weisthors discharge in i dont get it kindermann knew weisthor was a spinner and let him out lanzs approach to psychotherapy is antifreudian and he saw in jungs work material for the history and culture of a race his field of research has been to investigate the human unconscious mind for spiritual strata that might make possible a reconstruction of the prehistory of cultures thats how he came to work with weisthor lanz saw in him the key to his own branch of jungian psychotherapy which will he hopes enable him to set up with himmlers blessing his own version of a goering research institute thats another psychotherapeutic yes i know it well at first the research was genuine but then he discovered that weisthor was a fake that he was using his socalled ancestral clairvoyance as a way of projecting the importance of his ancestors in the eyes of himmler but by then it was too late and there was no price that lanz would not have paid to make sure of getting his institute what does he need an institute for hes got the clinic hasnt he thats not enough for lanz in his own field he wants to be remembered in the same breath as freud and jung what about otto rahn gifted academically but really little more than a ruthless fanatic he was a guard in dachau for a while thats the kind of man he is he stopped and chewed his fingernail might i have one of those cigarettes please i tossed him the packet and watched him light one with a hand that trembled as if he had a high fever to see him smoke it you would have thought it was pure protein is that it he shook his head kindermann still has weisthors medical case history which proves his insanity lanz used to say that it was his insurance to guarantee weisthors loyalty you see himmler cant abide mental illness some nonsense about racial health so if he were ever to get hold of that case history then then the game would be well and truly up so whats the plan sir himmler heydrich nebe theyve all gone to this s s court of honour at wewelsburg where the hell is wewelsburg becker said its quite near paderborn said korsch i propose to go after them see if i cant expose weisthor and the whole dirty business right in front of himmler ill take lange along for the ride just for evidentiary purposes korsch stood up and went to the door right sir ill get the car im afraid not i want you two to stay here becker groaned loudly but thats ridiculous it really is sir its asking for trouble it may not quite go the way im planning dont forget that this weisthor character is himmlers friend i doubt that the reichsführer will take too kindly to my revelations worse still he may dismiss them altogether in which case it would be better if there was only me to take the heat after all he can hardly kick me off the force since im only on it for as long as this case lasts and then im back to my own business but you two have careers ahead of you not very promising careers its true i grinned all the same it would be a shame for you both to earn himmlers displeasure when i can just as easily do that on my own korsch exchanged a short look with becker and then replied come on sir dont give us that cold cabbage its dangerous what youre planning we know it and you know it too not only that becker said but how will you get there with a prisoner wholl drive the car thats right sir its over three hundred kilometres to wewelsburg ill take a staff car suppose lange tries something on the way hell be handcuffed so i doubt ill have any trouble from him i shook my head and collected my hat and coat from the rack im sorry boys but thats the way its got to be i walked to the door sir said korsch he held out his hand i shook it then i shook beckers then i went to collect my prisoner kindermanns clinic looked just as neat and wellbehaved as it had the first time id been there in late august if anything it seemed quieter with no rooks in the trees and no boat on the lake to disturb them there was just the sound of the wind and the dead leaves it blew across the path like so many flying locusts i placed my hand in the small of langes back and pushed him firmly towards the front door this is most embarrassing he said coming here in handcuffs like a common criminal im well known here you know a common criminal is what you are lange want me to put a towel over your ugly head i pushed him again listen its only my good nature that stops me from marching you in there with your prick hanging out of your trousers what about my civil rights shit where have you been for the last five years this is nazi germany not ancient athens now shut your fucking mouth a nurse met us in the hallway she started to say hallo to lange and then saw the handcuffs i flapped my id in front of her startled features police i said i have a warrant to search dr kindermanns office this was true id signed it myself only the nurse had been in the same holiday camp as lange i dont think you can just walk in there she said ill have to lady a few weeks ago that little swastika you see on my identity card there was considered sufficient authority for german troops to march into the sudetenland so you can bet it will let me march into the good doctors underpants if i want it to i shoved lange forward again come on reinhard show me the way kindermanns office was at the back of the clinic as an apartment in town it would have been considered to be on the small side but as a doctors private room it was just fine there was a long low couch a nice walnut desk a couple of big modern paintings of the kind that look like the inside of a monkeys mind and enough expensively bound books to explain the countrys shoeleather shortage take a seat where i can keep an eye on you reinhard i told him and dont make any sudden moves i scare easily and then get violent to cover my embarrassment whats the word the rattledoctors use for that there was a large filing cabinet by the window i opened it and started to leaf through kindermanns files compensatory behaviour i said thats two words but i guess thats what it is all right you know you wouldnt believe some of the names that your friend kindermann has treated this filing cabinet reads like the guest list at a reich chancellery gala night wait a minute this looks like your file i picked it out and tossed it on to his lap why dont you see what he wrote about you reinhard perhaps it will explain how you got yourself in with these bastards in the first place he stared at the unopened file it really is very simple he said quietly as i explained to you earlier on i became interested in the psychic sciences as a result of my friendship with dr kindermann he raised his face to me challengingly ill tell you why you got yourself involved i said grinning back at him you were bored with all your money you dont know what to be at next thats the trouble with your kind the kind thats born into money you never learn its value they knew that reinhard and they played you for johann simple it wont work gunther youre talking rubbish am i youve read the file then youll know that for sure a patient ought never to see his doctors case notes it would be unethical of me to even open this it occurs to me that youve seen a lot more than just your doctors case notes reinhard and kindermann learnt his ethics with the holy inquisition i turned back to the filing cabinet and fell silent as i came across another name i recognized the name of a girl i had once wasted a couple of months trying to find a girl who had once been important to me ill admit that i was even in love with her the job is like that sometimes a person vanishes without trace the world moves on and you find a piece of information that at the right time would have cracked the case wide open aside of the obvious irritation you feel at remembering how wide of the mark youd really been mostly you learn to live with it my business doesnt exactly suit those who are disposed to be neat being a private investigator leaves you holding more loose ends than a blind carpetweaver all the same i wouldnt be human if i didnt admit to finding some satisfaction in tying them off yet this name the name of the girl that arthur nebe had mentioned to me all those weeks ago when we met late one night in the ruins of the reichstag meant so much more than just satisfaction in finding a belated solution to an enigma there are times when discovery has the force of revelation the bastard said lange turning the pages of his own case notes i was thinking the same thing myself a neurotic effeminate he quoted me how could he think such a thing about me i moved down to the next drawer only half listening to what he was saying you tell me hes your friend how could he say these things i dont believe it come on reinhard you know how it is when you swim with the sharks youve got to expect to get your balls bitten once in a while ill kill him he said flinging the case notes across the office not before i do i said finding weisthors file at last i slammed the drawer shut right ive got it now we can get out of this place i was about to reach for the doorhandle when a heavy revolver came through the door followed closely by lanz kindermann would you mind telling me what the hells going on here i stepped back into the room well this is a pleasant surprise i said we were just talking about you we thought you might have gone to your bible class in wewelsburg incidentally id be careful with that gun if i were you my men have got this place under surveillance theyre very loyal you know thats the way we are in the police these days id hate to think what theyd do if they found out that some harm had come to me kindermann glanced at lange who hadnt moved and then at the files under my arm i dont know what your game is herr steininger if that is your real name but i think that you had better put those down on the desk and raise your hands dont you i laid the files down on the desk and started to say something about having a warrant but reinhard lange had already taken the initiative if thats what you call it when youre misguided enough to throw yourself on to a man who is holding acalibre pistol cocked on you his first three or four words of bellowing outrage ended abruptly as the deafening gunshot blasted the side of his neck away gurgling horribly lange twisted around like a whirling dervish grasping frantically at his neck with his stillmanacled hands and decorating the wallpaper with red roses as he fell to the floor kindermanns hands were better suited to the violin than something as big as the and with the hammer down you need a carpenters forefinger to work a trigger that heavy so there was plenty of time for me to collect the bust of dante that sat on kindermanns desk and smash it into several pieces against the side of his head with kindermann unconscious i looked round to where lange had curled himself into the corner with his bloody forearm pressed against what remained of his jugular he stayed alive for only a minute or so and then died without speaking another word i removed the handcuffs and was transferring them to the groaning kindermann when summoned by the shot two nurses burst into the office and stared in terror at the scene that met their eyes i wiped my hands on kindermanns necktie and then went over to the desk before you ask your boss here just shot his pansy friend i picked up the telephone operator get me police headquarters alexanderplatz please i watched one nurse search for langes pulse and the other help kindermann on to the couch as i waited to be connected hes dead said the first nurse both of them stared suspiciously at me this is kommissar gunther i said to the operator at the alex connect me with kriminalassistant korsch or becker in the murder commission as quickly as possible if you please after another short wait becker came on to the line im at kindermanns clinic i explained we stopped to pick up the medical case history on weisthor and lange managed to get himself killed he lost his temper and a piece of his neck kindermann was carrying a lighter want me to organize the meat wagon thats the general idea yes only i wont be here when it comes im sticking to my original plan except that now im taking kindermann along with me instead of lange all right sir leave it to me oh incidentally frau steininger called did she leave a message no sir nothing at all no sir sir you know what that one needs if you dont mind me saying try and surprise me i reckon that she needs on second thoughts dont bother well you know the type sir not exactly becker no but while im driving ill certainly give it some thought you can depend on it i drove west out of berlin following the yellow signs indicating longdistance traffic heading towards potsdam and beyond it to hanover the autobahn branches off from the berlin circular road at lehnin leaving the old town of brandenburg to the north and beyond zeisar the ancient town of the bishops of brandenburg the road runs west in a straight line after a while i was aware of kindermann sitting upright in the back seat of the mercedes where are we going he said dully i glanced over my right shoulder with his hands manacled behind his back i didnt think hed be stupid enough to try hitting me with his head especially now it was bandaged something the two nurses from the clinic had insisted on doing before allowing me to drive the doctor away dont you recognize the road i said were on our way to a little town south of paderborn wewelsburg im sure you know it i didnt think you would want to miss your s s court of honour on my account out of the corner of my eye i saw him smile and settle back in the rear seat or at least as well as he was able to that suits me fine you know youve really inconvenienced me herr doktor shooting my star witness like that he was going to give a special performance for himmler its lucky he made a written statement back at the alex and of course youll have to understudy he laughed and what makes you think ill take to that role id hate to think what might happen if you were to disappoint me looking at you id say you were used to being disappointed perhaps but i doubt my disappointment will even compare with himmlers my life is in no danger from the reichsführer i can assure you i wouldnt place too much reliance on your rank or your uniform if i were you hauptsturmführer youll shoot just as easily as ernst rohm and all those s a men did i knew rohm quite well he said smoothly we were good friends it may interest you to know that thats a fact which is wellknown to himmler with all that such a relationship implies youre saying he knows youre a queer certainly if i survived the night of long knives i think i can manage to cope with whatever inconvenience youve arranged for me dont you the reichsführer will be pleased to read langes letters then if only to confirm what he already knows never underestimate the importance to a policeman of confirming information i dare say he knows all about weisthors insanity as well right what was insanity ten years ago merely counts as a treatable nervous disorder today psychotherapy has come a long way in a short time do you seriously believe that herr weisthor can be the first senior s s officer to be treated im a consultant at a special orthopaedic hospital at hohenlychen near ravensbruck concentration camp where many s s staff officers are treated for the prevailing euphemism that describes mental illness you know you surprise me as a policeman you ought to know how skilled the reich is in the practice of such convenient hypocrisies here you are hurrying to create a great big firework display for the reichsführer with a couple of rather damp little crackers he will be disappointed i like listening to you kindermann i always like to see another mans work i bet youre great with all those rich widows who bring their menstrual depressions to your fancy clinic tell me for how many of them do you prescribe cocaine cocaine hydrochloride has always been used as a stimulant to combat the more extreme cases of depression how do you stop them becoming addicted its true there is always that risk one has to be watchful for any sign of drug dependency thats my job he paused why do you ask just curious herr doktor thats my job at hohenwarhe north of magdeburg we crossed the elbe by a bridge beyond which on the right could be seen the lights of the almost completed rothensee ship elevator designed to connect the elbe with the mittelland canal some twenty metres above it soon we had passed into the next state of niedersachsen and at helmstedt we stopped for a rest and to pick up some petroleum it was getting dark and looking at my watch i saw that it was almost seven oclock having chained one of kindermanns hands to the door handle i allowed him to take a pee and attended to my own needs at a short distance then i pushed the spare wheel into the back seat beside kindermann and handcuffed it to his left wrist which left one hand free the mercedes is a big car however and he was far enough behind me not to worry about all the same i removed the walther from my shoulderholster showed it to him and then laid it beside me on the big bench seat youll be more comfortable like that i said but so much as pick your nose and youll get this i started the car and drove on what is the hurry kindermann said exasperatedly i fail to understand why youre doing this you could just as easily stage your performance on monday when everyone arrives back in berlin i really dont see the need to drive all this way itll be too late by then kindermann too late to stop the special pogrom that your friend weisthors got planned for berlins jews project krist isnt that what its called ah you know about that do you you have been busy dont tell me that youre a jewlover lets just say that i dont much care for lynchlaw and rule by the mob thats why i became a policeman to uphold justice if you want to call it that yes youre deluding yourself what rules is force human will and to build that collective will it must be given a focus what we are doing is no more than a child does with a magnifyingglass when it concentrates the light of the sun on to a sheet of paper and causes it to catch alight we are merely using a power that already exists justice would be a wonderful thing were it not for men herr look here what is your name the name is gunther and you can spare me the party propaganda these are facts gunther not propaganda youre an anachronism do you know that you are out of your time from the little history i know it seems to me that justice is never very fashionable kindermann if im out of my time if im out of step with the will of the people as you describe it then im glad the difference between us is that whereas you wish to use their will i want to see it curbed youre the worst kind of idealist youre naïve do you really think that you can stop whats happening to the jews youve missed that boat the newspapers already have the story about jewish ritual murder in berlin i doubt that himmler and heydrich could prevent what is going on even if they wanted to i might not be able to stop it i said but perhaps i can try and get it postponed and even if you do manage to persuade himmler to consider your evidence do you seriously think that hell welcome his stupidity being made public i doubt youll get much in the way of justice from the reichsführers s hell just sweep it under the carpet and in a short while it will all be forgotten as will the jews you mark my words people in this country have very short memories not me i said i never forget im a fucking elephant take this other patient of yours for instance i picked up one of the two files i had brought with me from kindermanns office and tossed it back over the seat you see until quite recently i was a private detective and what do you know it turns out that even though youre a lump of shit we have something in common your patient there was a client of mine he switched on the courtesy light and picked up the file yes i remember her a couple of years ago she disappeared it so happens she was in the vicinity of your clinic at the time i know that because she parked my car near there tell me herr doktor what does your friend jung have to say about coincidence er meaningful coincidence i suppose you mean its a principle he calls synchronicity that a certain apparently coincidental event might be meaningful according to an unconscious knowledge linking a physical event with a psychic condition its quite difficult to explain in terms that you would understand but i fail to see how this coincidence could be meaningful no of course you dont you have no knowledge of my unconscious perhaps thats just as well he was quiet for a long while after that north of brunswick we crossed the mittelland canal where the autobahn ended and i drove southwest towards hildesheim and hamelin not far now i said across my shoulder there was no reply i pulled off the main road and drove slowly for several minutes down a narrow path that led into an area of woodland i stopped the car and looked around kindermann was dozing quietly with a trembling hand i lit a cigarette and got out a strong wind was blowing now and an electrical storm was firing silver lifelines across the rumbling black sky maybe they were for kindermann after a minute or two i leant back across the front seat and picked up my gun then i opened the rear door and shook kindermann by the shoulder come on i said handing him the key to the handcuffs were going to stretch our legs again i pointed down the path which lay before us illuminated by the big headlights of the mercedes we walked to the edge of the beam where i stopped right thats far enough i said he turned to face me synchronicity i like that a nice fancy word for something thats been gnawing at my guts for a long time im a private man kindermann doing what i do makes me value my own privacy all the more for instance i would never ever write my home telephone number on the back of my business card not unless that someone was very special to me so when i asked reinhard langes mother just how she came to hire me in the first place instead of some other fellow she showed me just such a card which she got out of reinhards jacket pocket before sending his suit to the cleaners naturally i began to start thinking when she saw the card she was worried that he might be in trouble and mentioned it to him he said that he picked it off your desk i wonder if he had a reason for doing that perhaps not well never know i guess but whatever the reason that card put my client in your office on the day she disappeared and was never seen again now hows that for synchronicity look gunther it was an accident what happened she was an addict and how did she get that way id been treating her for depression shed lost her job a relationship had ended she needed cocaine more than seemed apparent at the time there was absolutely no way of knowing just by looking at her by the time i realized she was getting used to the drug it was too late what happened one afternoon she just turned up at the clinic in the neighbourhood she said and feeling low there was a job she was going for an important job and she felt that she could get it if i gave her a little help at first i refused but she was a very persuasive woman and finally i agreed i left her alone for a short while i think she hadnt used it in a long time and had less tolerance to her usual dose she must have aspirated on her own vomit i said nothing it was the wrong context for it to mean anything anymore revenge is not sweet its true flavour is bitter since pity is the most probable aftertaste what are you going to do he said nervously youre not going to kill me surely look it was an accident you cant kill a man for that can you no i said i cant not for that i saw him breathe a sigh of relief and walk towards me in a civilized society you dont shoot a man in cold blood except that this was hitlers germany and no more civilized than the very pagans venerated by weisthor and himmler but for the murders of all those poor bloody girls somebody has to i said i pointed the gun at his head and pulled the trigger once and then several times more from the narrow winding road wewelsburg looked like a fairly typical westphalian peasant village with as many shrines to the virgin mary on the walls and grass verges as there were pieces of farmmachinery left lying outside the halftimbered fairystory houses i knew i was in for something weird when i decided to stop at one of these and ask for directions to the s sschool the flying griffins runic symbols and ancient words of german that were carved or painted in gold on the black window casements and lintels put me in mind of witches and wizards and so i was almost prepared for the hideous sight that presented itself at the front door wreathed in an atmosphere of wood smoke and frying veal the girl was young no more than twentyfive and but for the huge cancer eating away at one whole side of her face you might have said that she was attractive i hesitated for no more than a second but it was enough to draw her anger well what are you staring at she demanded her distended mouth widening to a grimace that showed her blackened teeth and the edge of something darker and more corrupt and what time is this to be calling what is it that you want im sorry to disturb you i said concentrating on the side of her face that was unmarked by the disease but im a little lost and i was hoping you could direct me to the s sschool theres no school in wewelsburg she said eyeing me suspiciously the s sschool i repeated weakly i was told it was somewhere hereabouts oh that she snapped and turning in her doorway she pointed to where the road dipped down a hill there is your way the road bends right and left for a short way before you see a narrower road with a railing rising up a slope to your left laughing scornfully she added the school as you call it is up there and with that she slammed the door shut in my face it was good to be out of the city i told myself walking back to the mercedes country people have so much more time for the ordinary pleasantries i found the road with the railing and steered the big car up the slope and on to a cobbled esplanade it was easy enough to see now why the girl with the piece of coal in her mouth had been so amused for what met my eyes was no more what one would normally have recognized as a schoolhouse than a zoo was a petshop or a cathedral a meeting hall himmlers schoolhouse was in reality a decentsized castle complete with domed towers one of which loomed over the esplanade like the helmeted head of some enormous prussian soldier i drew up next to a small church a short distance away from the several troop trucks and staff cars that were parked outside what looked like the castle guardhouse on the eastern side for a moment the storm lit up the entire sky and i had a spectral blackandwhite view of the whole of the castle by any standard it was an impressivelooking place with rather more of the horror film about it than was entirely comfortable a proposition for the intendant trespasser this socalled schoolhouse looked like home from home for dracula frankenstein orlac and a whole forestful of wolfmen the sort of occasion where i might have been prompted to reload my pistol with nine millimetre cloves of snubnosed garlic almost certainly there were enough reallife monsters in the wewelsburg castle without having to worry about the more fanciful ones and i didnt doubt that himmler could have given doctor x quite a few pointers but could i trust heydrich i thought about this for quite a while finally i decided that i could almost certainly trust him to be ambitious and since i was effectively providing him with the means of destroying an enemy in the shape of weisthor i had no real alternative but to put myself and my information in his murdering white hands the little church bell in the clocktower was striking midnight as i steered the mercedes to the edge of the esplanade and beyond it the bridge curving left across the empty moat towards the castle gate an s s trooper emerged from a stone sentrybox to glance at my papers and to wave me on in front of the wooden gate i stopped and sounded the car horn a couple of times there were lights on all over the castle and it didnt seem likely that id be waking anyone dead or alive a small door in the gate swung open and an s s corporal came outside to speak to me after scrutinizing my papers in his torchlight he allowed me to step through the door and into the arched gateway where once again i repeated my story and presented my papers only this time it was for the benefit of a young lieutenant apparently in command of the guardduty there is only one way to deal effectively with arrogant young s s officers who look as though theyve been specially issued with the right shade of blue eyes and fair hair and that is to outdo them for arrogance so i thought of the man i had killed that evening and fixed the lieutenant with the sort of cold supercilious stare that would have crushed a hohenzollern prince i am kommissar gunther i rapped at him and im here on extremely pressing sipo business affecting reich security which requires the immediate attention of general heydrich please inform him at once that i am here youll find that he is expecting me even to the extent that he has seen fit to provide me with the password to the castle during these court of honour proceedings i uttered the word and watched the lieutenants arrogance pay homage to my own let me stress the delicacy of my mission lieutenant i said lowering my voice it is imperative that at this stage only general heydrich or his aide be informed of my presence here in the castle it is quite possible that communist spies may already have infiltrated these proceedings do you understand the lieutenant nodded curtly and ducked back into his office to make the telephone call while i walked to the edge of the cobbled courtyard that lay open to the cold night sky the castle seemed smaller from the inside with three roofed wings joined by three towers two of them domed and the short but wider third castellated and furnished with a flagpole where an s s penant fluttered noisily in the strengthening wind the lieutenant came back and to my surprise stood to attention with a click of his heels i guessed that this probably had more to do with what heydrich or his aide had said than with my own commanding personality kommissar gunther he said respectfully the general is finishing dinner and asks you to wait in the sittingroom that is in the west tower would you please follow me the corporal will attend to your vehicle thank you lieutenant i said but first i have to remove some important documents that i left on the front seat having recovered my briefcase which contained weisthors medical casehistory langes statement and the langekindermann letters i followed the lieutenant across the cobbled courtyard towards the west wing from somewhere to our left could be heard the sound of men singing sounds like quite a party i said coldly my escort grunted without much enthusiasm any kind of party is better than latenight guardduty in november we went through a heavy oak door and entered the great hall all german castles should be so gothic every teutonic warlord should live and strut in such a place each inquisitorial aryan bully should surround himself with as many emblems of unsparing tyranny aside from the great heavy rugs the thick tapestries and the dull paintings there were enough suits of armour musketstands and wallmounted cutlery to have fought a war with king gustavus adolphus and the whole swedish army in contrast the sittingroom which we reached by a wooden spiral staircase was furnished plainly and commanded a spectacular view of a small airfields landing lights a couple of kilometres away help yourself to a drink said the lieutenant opening the cabinet if theres anything else you need sir just ring the bell then he clicked his heels again and disappeared back down the staircase i poured myself a large brandy and tossed it straight back i was tired after the long drive with another glass in my hand i sat stiffly in an armchair and closed my eyes i could still see the startled expression on kindermanns face as the first bullet struck between the eyes weisthor would be missing him and his bag of drugs badly by now i thought i could have used an armful myseif i sipped some more of the brandy ten minutes passed and i felt my head nodding i fell asleep and my nightmares terrifying gallop brought me before beast men preachers of death scarlet judges and the outcasts of paradise monday november by the time i finished telling heydrich my story the generals normally pale features were flushed with excitement i congratulate you gunther he said this is much more than i had expected and your timing is perfect dont you agree nebe yes indeed general it may surprise you gunther heydrich said but reichsführer himmler and myself are currently in favour of maintaining police protection for jewish property if only for reasons of public order and commerce you let a mob run riot on the streets and it wont just be jewish shops that are looted it will be german ones too to say nothing of the fact that the damage will have to be made good by german insurance companies goering will be beside himself and who can blame him the whole idea makes a mockery of any economic planning but as you say gunther were himmler to be convinced by weisthors scheme then he would certainly be inclined to waive that police protection in which case i should have to go along with that position so we have to be careful how we handle this himmler is a fool but hes a dangerous fool we have to expose weisthor unequivocally and in front of as many witnesses as possible he paused nebe the reichskriminaldirektor stroked the side of his long nose and nodded thoughtfully we shouldnt mention himmlers involvement at all if we can possibly avoid it general he said im all for exposing weisthor in front of witnesses i dont want that dirty bastard to get away with it but at the same time we should avoid embarrassing the reichsführer in front of the senior s s staff hell forgive us destroying weisthor but he wont forgive us making an ass of him i agree said heydrich he thought for a moment this is sipo section six isnt it nebe nodded wheres the nearest s d main provincial station to wewelsburg bielefeld nebe replied right i want you to telephone them immediately have them send a full company of men here by dawn he smiled thinly just in case weisthor manages to make this jew allegation against me stick i dont like this place weisthor has lots of friends here in wewelsburg he even officiates at some of the ludicrous s s wedding ceremonies that take place here so we might need to mount a show of force the castle commandant taubert was in sipo prior to this posting said nebe im pretty certain we can trust him good but dont tell him about weisthor just stick to gunthers original story about k p d infiltrators and have him keep a detachment of men on full alert and while youre about it youd better have him organize a bed for the kommissar by god hes earned it the room next to mine is free general i think its the henry i of saxony room nebe grinned madness heydrich laughed im in the king arthur and the grail room but who knows perhaps today i shall at least defeat morgana le fay the courtroom was on the ground floor of the west wing with the door to one of the adjoining rooms open a crack i had a perfect view of what went on in there the room itself was over forty metres long with a bare polished wooden floor panelled walls and a high ceiling complete with oak beams and carved gargoyles dominating was a long oak table that was surrounded on all four sides with highbacked leather chairs on each of which was a silver disk and what i presumed to be the name of the s s officer who was entitled to sit there with the black uniforms and all the ritualistic ceremony that attended the commencement of the court proceedings it was like spying on a meeting of the grand lodge of freemasons first on the agenda that morning was the reichsführers approval of plans for the development of the derelict north tower these were presented by landbaumeister bartels a fat owlish little man who sat between weisthor and rahn weisthor himself seemed nervous and was quite obviously feeling the lack of his cocaine when the reichsführer asked him his opinion of the plans weisthor stammered his answer in er in terms of the er cult importance of the er castle he said and er its magical importance in any er in any future conflict between er east and west er heydrich interrupted and it was immediately apparent that it was not to help the brigadeführer reichsführer he said coolly since this is a court and since we are all of us listening to the brigadeführer with enormous fascination it would i believe be unfair to you all to permit him to go any further without acquainting you of the very serious charges that have to be made against him and his colleague unterscharfuhrer rahn what charges are these said himmler with some distaste i know nothing of any charges pending against weisthor nor even of any investigation affecting him that is because there was no investigation of weisthor however a completely separate inquiry has revealed weisthors principal role in an odious conspiracy that has resulted in the perverted murders of seven innocent german schoolgirls reichsführer roared weisthor i protest this is monstrous i quite agree said heydrich and you are the monster weisthor rose to his feet his whole body shaking you lying little kike he spat heydrich merely smiled a lazy little smile kommissar he said loudly would you please come in here now i walked slowly into the room my shoes sounding on the wooden floor like some nervous actor about to audition for a play every head turned as i came in and as fifty of the most powerful men in germany focused their eyes on me i could have wished to have been anywhere else but there weisthors jaw dropped as himmler half rose to his feet what is the meaning of this himmler growled some of you probably know this gentleman as herr steininger heydrich said smoothly the father of one of the murdered girls except that he is nothing of the kind he works for me tell them who you really are gunther kriminalkommissar bernhard gunther murder commission berlinalexanderplatz and tell these officers if you will why you have come here to arrest one karl maria weisthor also known as karl maria wiligut also known as jarl widar otto rahn and richard anders all for the murders of seven girls in berlin between may and september liar rahn shouted jumping to his feet along with another officer whom i supposed to be anders sit down said himmler i take it that you believe that you can prove this kommissar if id been karl marx himself he couldnt have regarded me with more hatred i believe i can sir yes this had better not be one of your tricks heydrich himmler said a trick reichsführer he said innocently if its tricks youre looking for these two evil men had them all they sought to pass themselves off as mediums to persuade weakerminded people that it was the spirits who were informing them where the bodies of the girls they themselves had murdered were hidden away and but for kommissar gunther here they would have attempted the same insane trick with this company of officers reichsführer weisthor spluttered this is utterly preposterous where is the proof you mentioned heydrich i said insane i meant exactly that naturally there is no one here who could have fallen for such a ludicrous scheme as theirs however it is characteristic of those who are insane to believe in the right of what they are doing he retrieved the file containing weisthors medical case history from underneath his sheaf of papers and laid it in front of himmler these are the medical case notes of karl maria wiligut also known as karl maria weisthor which until recently were in the possession of his doctor hauptsturmführer lanz kindermann no yelled weisthor and lunged for the file restrain that man screamed himmler immediately the two officers standing beside weisthor caught him by the arms rahn reached for his holster only i was quicker working the mausers slide as i laid the muzzle against his head touch it and ill ventilate your brain i said and then relieved him of his gun heydrich carried on apparently undisturbed by any of this commotion you had to hand it to him he was as cool as a north sea salmon and just as slippery in november wiligut was committed to a lunatic asylum in salzburg for the attempted murder of his wife upon examination he was declared insane and remained institutionalized under the care of dr kindermann until following his release he changed his name to weisthor and the rest you undoubtedly know reichsführer himmler glanced at the file for a minute or so finally he sighed and said is this true karl weisthor held between two s s officers shook his head i swear its a lie on my honour as a gentleman and an officer roll up his left sleeve i said the man is a drug addict for years kindermann has been giving him cocaine and morphine himmler nodded at the men holding weisthor and when they revealed his horribly blackandblue forearm i added if youre still not convinced i have a twentypage statement made by reinhard lange himmler kept on nodding he stepped round his chair to stand in front of his brigadeführer the sage of the s s and slapped him hard across the face then again get him out of my sight he said he is confined to quarters until further notice rahn anders that goes for you too he raised his voice to an almost hysterical pitch get out i say you are no longer members of this order all three of you will return your deaths head rings your daggers and your swords i shall decide what to do with you later arthur nebe called the guard that was waiting in readiness and when they appeared ordered them to escort the three men to their rooms by now almost every s s officer at the table was openmouthed with astonishment only heydrich stayed calm his long face betraying no more sign of the undoubted satisfaction he was feeling at the sight of his enemies rout than if he had been made of wax with weisthor rahn and anders sent out under guard all eyes were now on himmler unfortunately his eyes were very much on me and i holstered my gun feeling that the drama had yet to end for several uncomfortable seconds he simply stared no doubt remembering how at weisthors house i had seen him the reichsführers s and chief of the german police gullible fooled sold fallible for the man who saw himself in the role of the nazi pope to hitlers antichrist it was too much to bear placing himself close enough to me to smell the cologne on his closely shaven punctilious little face and blinking furiously his mouth twisted into a rictus of hatred he kicked me hard on the shin i grunted with pain but stood still almost to attention youve ruined everything he said shaking everything do you hear i did my job i growled i think he might have booted me again but for heydrichs timely interruption i can certainly vouch for that he said perhaps under the circumstances it would be best if this court were postponed for an hour or so at least until youve had a chance to recover your composure reichsführer the discovery of so gross a treason within a forum that is as close to the reichsführers heart as this one will doubtless have come as a profound shock to him as indeed it has been to us all there was a murmur of agreement at these remarks and himmler seemed to regain control of himself colouring a little possibly with some embarrassment he twitched and nodded curtly youre quite right heydrich he muttered a terrible shock yes indeed i must apologize to you kommissar as you say you merely did your duty well done and with that he turned on his not inconsiderable heel and marched smartly out of the room accompanied by several of his officers heydrich started to smile a slow curling sort of smile that got no further than the corner of his mouth then his eyes found mine and steered me towards the other door arthur nebe followed leaving the remaining officers to talk loudly among themselves its not many men who live to receive a personal apology from heinrich himmler heydrich said when the three of us were alone in the castle library i rubbed my shin painfully well im sure ill make a note of that in my diary tonight i said its all ive ever dreamed of incidentally you didnt mention what happened to kindermann lets just say that he was shot while trying to escape i said im sure that you of all people must know what i mean thats unfortunate he could still have been useful to us he got what a murderer properly has coming to him someone had to i dont suppose any of those other bastards will ever get theirs the s s brotherhood and all that eh i paused and lit a cigarette what will happen to them you can depend on it that theyre finished in the s s you heard himmler say so himself well how ghastly for them all i turned to nebe come on arthur will weisthor get anywhere near a courtroom or a guillotine i dont like it any more than you do he said grimly but weisthor is too close to himmler he knows too much heydrich pursed his lips otto rahn on the other hand is merely an nco i dont think the reichsführer would mind if some sort of accident were to befall him i shook my head bitterly well at least theres an end to their dirty little plot at least well be spared another pogrom for a while anyway heydrich looked uncomfortable now nebe got up and looked out of the library window for christs sake i yelled you dont mean to say that its going to go ahead heydrich winced visibly look we all know that the jews had nothing to do with the murders oh yes he said brightly thats certain and they wont be blamed you have my word on it i can assure you that tell him said nebe he deserves to know heydrich thought for a moment and then stood up he pulled a book from off the shelf and examined it negligently yes youre right nebe i believe he probably does tell me what we received a telex before the court convened this morning said heydrich by sheer coincidence a young jewish fanatic has made an attempt on the life of a german diplomat in paris apparently he wished to protest against the treatment of polish jews in germany the führer has sent his own personal physician to france but it is not expected that our man will live as a result goebbels is already lobbying the führer that if this diplomat should die then certain spontaneous expressions of german public outrage be permitted against jews throughout the reich and youll all look the other way is that it i dont approve of lawlessness said heydrich weisthor gets his pogrom after all you bastards not a pogrom heydrich insisted looting will not be permitted jewish property will merely be destroyed the police will ensure that there is no plunder and nothing will be permitted which in any way endangers the security of german life or property how can you control a mob directives will be issued offenders will be apprehended and dealt with directives i flung my cigarettes against the bookcase for a mob thats a good one every police chief in germany will receive a telex with guidelines suddenly i felt very tired i wanted to go home to be taken away from all of this just talking about such a thing made me feel dirty and dishonest i had failed but what was infinitely worse it didnt seem as if id ever been meant to succeed a coincidence heydrich had called it but a meaningful coincidence according to jungs idea no it couldnt be there was no meaning in anything anymore thursday november spontaneous expressions of the german peoples anger that was how the radio put it i was angry all right but there was nothing spontaneous about it id had all night to get worked up a night in which id heard windows breaking and obscene shouts echoing up the street and smelt the smoke of burning buildings shame kept me indoors but in the morning which came bright and sunny through my curtains i felt i had to go out and take a look for myself i dont suppose i shall ever forget it ever since a broken window had been something of an occupational hazard for any jewish business as synonymous with nazism as a jackboot or a swastika this time however it was something altogether different something much more systematic than the occasional vandalism of a few drunken sa thugs on this occasion there had occurred a veritable walpurgisnacht of destruction glass lay everywhere like the pieces of a huge icy jigsaw cast down to the earth in a fit of pique by some illtempered prince of crystal only a few metres from the front door to my building were a couple of dress shops where i saw a snails long silvery trail rising high above a tailors dummy while a giant spiders web threatened to envelope another in razorsharp gossamer further on at the corner of kurfürstendamm i came across an enormous mirror that lay in a hundred pieces presenting shattered images of myself that ground and cracked underfoot as i picked my way along the street for those like weisthor and rahn who believed in some symbolic connection between crystal and some ancient germanic christ from which it derived its name this sight must have seemed exciting enough but for a glazier it must have looked like a licence to print money and there were lots of people out sightseeing who said as much at the northern end of fasanenstrasse the synagogue close to the sbahn railway was still smouldering a gutted blackened ruin of charred beams and burnedout walls im no clairvoyant but i can say that every honest man who saw it was thinking the same thing i was how many more buildings would end up the same way before hitler was finished with us there were stormtroopers a couple of truckloads of them in the next street and they were testing some more windowpanes with their boots cautiously deciding to go another way i was just about to turn back when i heard a voice i halfrecognized get out of here you jewish bastards the young man yelled it was bruno stahleckers fourteenyearold son heinrich dressed up in the uniform of the motorized hitler youth i caught sight of him just as he hurled a large stone through another shop window he laughed delightedly at his own handiwork and said fucking jews looking around for the approval of his young comrades he saw me instead as i walked over to him i thought of all the things i would have said to him if i had been his father but when i was close to him i smiled i felt more like giving him a good jawwhistler with the back of my hand hallo heinrich his fine blue eyes looked at me with sullen suspicion i suppose you think you can tell me off he said just because you were a friend of my fathers me i dont give a shit what you do oh so what do you want i shrugged and offered him a cigarette he took one and i lit us both then i threw him the box of matches here i said you might need these tonight maybe you could try the jewish hospital see you are going to give me a lecture on the contrary i came to tell you that i found the men who murdered your father you did some of heinrichs friends who were now busy looting the clothes shop yelled to him to come and help i wont be long he called back to them then he said to me where are they the men who killed my father one of them is dead i shot him myself good good i dont know what is going to happen to the other two that all depends really on what on the s s whether they decide to courtmartial them or not i watched his handsome young face crease with puzzlement oh didnt i tell you yes these men the ones who murdered your father in such a cowardly fashion they were all s s officers you see they had to kill him because he would probably have tried to stop them breaking the law they were evil men you see heinrich and your father always did his best to put away evil men he was a damned good policeman i waved my hand at all the broken windows i wonder what he would have thought of all this heinrich hesitated a lump rising in his throat as he considered the implications of what i had told him itwasnt it wasnt the jews who killed him then the jews good gracious no i laughed where on earth did you get such an idea it was never the jews i shouldnt believe everything you read in der stürmer you know it was with a considerable want of alacrity that heinrich returned to his friends when he and i had finished speaking i smiled grimly at this sight reflecting that propaganda works both ways almost a week had passed since id seen hildegard on my return from wewelsburg i tried telephoning her a couple of times but she was never there or at least she never answered finally i decided to drive over and see her driving south on kaiserallee through wilmersdorf and friedenau i saw more of the same destruction more of the same spontaneous expressions of the peoples rage shop signs carrying jewish names torn down and new antisemitic slogans freshly painted everywhere and always the police standing by doing nothing to prevent a shop being looted or to protect its owner from being beatenup close to waghäuselerstrasse i passed another synagogue ablaze the fireservice watching to make sure the flames didnt spread to any of the adjoining buildings it was not the best day to be thinking of myself i parked close to her apartment building on lepsius strasse let myself in through the main door with the street key she had given me and walked up to the third floor i used the door knocker i could have let myself in but somehow i didnt think shed appreciate that considering the circumstances of our last meeting after a while i heard footsteps and the door was opened by a young s s major he could have been something straight out of one of irma hankes racialtheory classes pale blond hair blue eyes and a jaw that looked like it had been set in concrete his tunic was unbuttoned his tie was loose and it didnt look like he was there to sell copies of the s s magazine who is it darling i heard hildegard call i watched her walk towards the door still searching for something in her handbag not looking up until she was only a few metres away she was wearing a black tweed suit a silvery crepe blouse and a black feathered hat that plumed off the front of her head like smoke from a burning building it was an image that i find hard to put out of my mind when she saw me she stopped her perfectly lipsticked mouth slackening a little as she tried to think of something to say it didnt need much explaining thats the thing about being a detective i catch on real fast i didnt need a reason why perhaps he made a better job of slapping her around than i had him being in the s s and all whatever the reason they made a handsomelooking couple which was the way they faced me off hildegard threading her arm eloquently through his i nodded slowly wondering whether i should mention catching her stepdaughters murderers but when she didnt ask i smiled philosophically just kept nodding and then handed her back the keys i was half way down the stairs when i heard her call after me im sorry bernie really i am i walked south to the botanical gardens the pale autumn sky was filled with the exodus of millions of leaves deported by the wind to distant corners of the city away from the branches which had once given life here and there stonefaced men worked with slow concentration to control this arboreal diaspora burning the dead from ash oak elm beech sycamore maple horsechestnut lime and weepingwillow the acrid grey smoke hanging in the air like the last breath of lost souls but always there were more and more still so that the burning middens seemed never to grow any smaller and as i stood and watched the glowing embers of the fires and breathed the hot gas of deciduous death it seemed to me that i could taste the very end of everything authors note otto rahn and karl maria weisthor resigned from the s s in february rahn an experienced outdoors traveller died from exposure while walking in the mountains near kufstein less than one month afterwards the circumstances of his death have never been properly explained weisthor was retired to the town of goslar where he was cared for by the s s until the end of the war he died in a public tribunal consisting of six gauleiters was convened on february for the purpose of investigating the conduct of julius streicher the party tribunal concluded that streicher was unfit for human leadership and the gauleiter of franconia retired from public duties the kristallnacht pogrom of and november resulted in jewish deaths synagogues burnt down and the destruction of jewish businesses it has been estimated that the amount of glass destroyed was equal to half the annual plateglass production of belgium whence it had originally been imported damages were estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars where insurance monies were paid to jews these were confiscated as compensation for the murder of the german diplomat von rath in paris this fine totalled million a german requiem for jane and in memory of my father it is not what they built it is what they knocked down it is not the houses it is the spaces between the houses it is not the streets that exist it is the streets that no longer exist it is not your memories which haunt you it is not what you have written down it is what you have forgotten what you must forget what you must go on forgetting all your life from a german requiem by james fenton part one berlin these days if you are a german you spend your time in purgatory before you die in earthly suffering for all your countrys unpunished and unrepented sins until the day when with the aid of the prayers of the powers or three of them anyway germany is finally purified for now we live in fear mostly it is fear of the ivans matched only by the almost universal dread of venereal disease which has become something of an epidemic although both afflictions are generally held to be synonymous it was a cold beautiful day the kind you can best appreciate with a fire to stoke and a dog to scratch i had neither but then there wasnt any fuel about and i never much liked dogs but thanks to the quilt i had wrapped around my legs i was warm and i had just started to congratulate myself on being able to work from home the sittingroom doubled as my office when there was a knock at what passed for the front door i cursed and got off my couch this will take a minute i shouted through the wood so dont go away i worked the key in the lock and started to pull at the big brass handle it helps if you push it from your side i shouted again i heard the scrape of shoes on the landing and then felt a pressure on the other side of the door finally it shuddered open he was a tall man of about sixty with his high cheekbones thin short snout oldfashioned sidewhiskers and angry expression he reminded me of a mean old king baboon i think i must have pulled something he grunted rubbing his shoulder im sorry about that i said and stood aside to let him in theres been quite a bit of subsidence in the building the door needs rehanging but of course you cant get the tools i showed him into the sittingroom still were not too badly off here weve had some new glass and the roof seems to keep out the rain sit down i pointed to the only armchair and resumed my position on the couch the man put down his briefcase took off his bowler hat and sat down with an exhausted sigh he didnt loosen his grey overcoat and i didnt blame him for it i saw your little advertisement on a wall on the kurfürstendamm he explained you dont say i said vaguely recalling the words i had used on a small square of card the previous week kirstens idea with all the notices advertising lifepartners and marriagemarkets that covered the walls of berlins derelict buildings i had supposed that nobody would bother to read it but she had been right after all my name is novak he said dr novak i am an engineer a process metallurgist at a factory in wernigerode my work is concerned with the extraction and production of nonferrous metals wernigerode i said thats in the harz mountains isnt it in the eastern zone he nodded i came to berlin to deliver a series of lectures at the university this morning i received a telegram at my hotel the mitropa i frowned trying to remember it its one of those bunkerhotels said novak for a moment he seemed inclined to tell me about it and then changed his mind the telegram was from my wife urging me to cut short my trip and return home any particular reason he handed me the telegram it says that my mother is unwell i unfolded the paper glanced at the typewritten message and noted that it actually said she was dangerously ill im sorry to hear it dr novak shook his head you dont believe her i dont believe my wife ever sent this he said my mother may indeed be old but she is in remarkably good health only two days ago she was chopping wood no i suspect that this has been cooked up by the russians to get me back as quickly as possible why there is a great shortage of scientists in the soviet union i think that they intend to deport me to work in one of their factories i shrugged then why allow you to travel to berlin in the first place that would be to grant the soviet military authority a degree of efficiency which it simply does not possess my guess is that an order for my deportation has only just arrived from moscow and that the sma wishes to get me back at the earliest opportunity have you telegraphed your wife to have this confirmed yes she replied only that i should come at once so you want to know if the ivans have got her ive been to the military police here in berlin he said but his deep sigh told me with what success no they wont help i said you were right to come here can you help me herr gunther it means going into the zone i said half to myself as if i needed some persuasion which i did to potsdam theres someone i know i can bribe at the headquarters of the group of soviet forces in germany itll cost you and i dont mean a couple of candybars he nodded solemnly you wouldnt happen to have any dollars i suppose dr novak he shook his head then theres also the matter of my own fee what would you suggest i nodded at his briefcase what have you got just papers im afraid you must have something think perhaps something at your hotel he lowered his head and uttered another sigh as he tried to recall a possession that might be of some value look herr doktor have you asked yourself what you will do if it turns out your wife is being held by the russians yes he said gloomily his eyes glazing over for a moment this was sufficiently articulate things did not look good for frau novak wait a moment he said dipping his hand inside the breast of his coat and coming up with a gold fountainpen theres this he handed me the pen its a parker eighteen carat i quickly appraised its worth about fourteen hundred dollars on the black market i said yes thatll take care of ivan they love fountainpens almost as much as they love watches i raised my eyebrows suggestively im afraid i couldnt part with my watch said novak it was a present from my wife he smiled thinly as he perceived the irony i nodded sympathetically and decided to move things along before guilt got the better of him now as to my own fee you mentioned metallurgy you wouldnt happen to have access to a laboratory would you but of course and a smelter he nodded thoughtfully and then more vigorously as the light dawned you want some coal dont you can you get some how much do you want fifty kilos would be about right very well be back here in twentyfour hours i told him i should have some information by then thirty minutes later after leaving a note for my wife i was out of the apartment and on my way to the railway station in late berlin still resembled a colossal acropolis of fallen masonry and ruined edifice a vast and unequivocal megalith to the waste of war and the power of tonnes of high explosive unparalleled was the destruction that had been rained on the capital of hitlers ambition devastation on a wagnerian scale with the ring come full circle the final illumination of that twilight of the gods in many parts of the city a street map would have been of little more use than a windowcleaners leather main roads meandered like rivers around high banks of debris footpaths wound precipitously over shifting mountains of treacherous rubble which sometimes in wanner weather yielded a clue unmistakable to the nostrils that something other than household furniture was buried there with compasses in short supply you needed a lot of nerve to find your way along facsimile streets on which only the fronts of shops and hotels remained standing unsteadily like some abandoned filmset and you needed a good memory for the buildings where people still lived in damp cellars or more precariously on the lower floors of apartment blocks from which a whole wall had been neatly removed exposing all the rooms and life inside like some giant dolls house there were few who risked the upper floors not least because there were so few undamaged roofs and so many dangerous staircases life amidst the wreckage of germany was frequently as unsafe as it had been in the last days of the war a collapsing wall here an unexploded bomb there it was still a bit of a lottery at the railway station i bought what i hoped might just be a winning ticket that night on the last train back to berlin from potsdam i sat in a carriage by myself i ought to have been more careful only i was feeling pleased with myself for having successfully concluded the doctors case but i was also tired since this business had taken almost the whole day and a substantial part of the evening not the least part of my time had been taken up in travel generally this took two or three times as long as it had done before the war and what had once been a halfhours journey to potsdam now took nearer two i was closing my eyes for a nap when the train started to slow and then juddered to a halt several minutes passed before the carriagedoor opened and a large and extremely smelly russian soldier climbed aboard he mumbled a greeting at me to which i nodded politely but almost immediately i braced myself as swaying gently on his huge feet he unslung his mosin nagant carbine and operated the bolt action instead of pointing it at me he turned and fired his weapon out of the carriage window and after a brief pause my lungs started to move again as i realized that he had been signalling to the driver the russian burped sat down heavily as the train started to move again swept off his lambskin cap with the back of his filthy hand and leaning back closed his eyes i pulled a copy of the britishrun telegraf out of my coatpocket keeping one eye on the ivan i pretended to read most of the news was about crime rape and robbery in the eastern zone were as common as the cheap vodka which as often as not occasioned their commission sometimes it seemed as if germany was still in the bloody grip of the thirty years war i knew just a handful of women who could not describe an incident in which they had been raped or molested by a russian and even if one makes an allowance for the fantasies of a few neurotics there was still a staggering number of sexrelated crimes my wife knew several girls who had been attacked only quite recently on the eve of the thirtieth anniversary of the russian revolution one of these girls raped by no less than five red army soldiers at a police station in rangsdorff and infected with syphilis as a result tried to bring criminal charges but found herself subjected to a forcible medical examination and charged with prostitution but there were also some who said that the ivans merely took by force that which german women were only too willing to sell to the british and the americans complaints to the soviet kommendatura that you had been robbed by red army soldiers were equally in vain you were likely to be informed that all the german people have is a gift from the people of the soviet union this was sufficient sanction for indiscriminate robbery throughout the zone and you were sometimes lucky if you survived to report the matter the depredations of the red army and its many deserters made travel in the zone only slightly less dangerous than a flight on the hindenburg travellers on the berlinmagdeburg railway had been stripped naked and thrown off the train and the road from berlin to leipzig was so dangerous that vehicles often drove in convoy the telegraf had reported a robbery in which four boxers on their way to a fight in leipzig had been held up and robbed of everything except their lives most notorious of all were the seventyfive robberies committed by the blue limousine gang which had operated on the berlinmichendorf road and which had included among its leaders the vicepresident of the sovietcontrolled potsdam police to people who were thinking of visiting the eastern zone i said dont and then if they still wanted to go i said dont wear a wristwatch the ivans like to steal them dont wear anything but your oldest coat and shoes the ivans like quality dont argue or answer back the ivans dont mind shooting you if you must talk to them speak loudly of american fascists and dont read any newspaper except their own taegliche rundschau this was all good advice and i would have done well to have taken it myself for suddenly the ivan in my carriage was on his feet and standing unsteadily over me vi vihodeetye are you getting off i asked him he blinked crapulously and then stared malevolently at me and my newspaper before snatching it from my hands he was a hilltribesman type a big stupid chechen with almondshaped black eyes a gnarled jaw as broad as the steppes and a chest like an upturned churchbell the kind of ivan we made jokes about how they didnt know what lavatories were and how they put their food in the toilet bowls thinking that they were refrigerators some of these stories were even true lzhy lies he snarled brandishing the paper in front of him his open drooling mouth showing great yellow kerbstones of teeth putting his boot on the seat beside me he leaned closer lganyo he repeated in tones lower than the smell of sausage and beer which his breath carried to my helplessly flaring nostrils he seemed to sense my disgust and rolled the idea of it around in his grizzled head like a boiled sweet dropping the telegraf to the floor he held out his horny hand ya hachoo padarok he said and then slowly in german i want present i grinned at him nodding like an idiot and realized that i was going to have to kill him or be killed myself padarok i repeated padarok i stood up slowly and still grinning and nodding gently pulled back the sleeve of my left arm to reveal my bare wrist the ivan was grinning too by now thinking he was on to a good thing i shrugged oo menya nyet chasov i said explaining that i didnt have a watch to give him shto oo vas yest what have you got nichto i said shaking my head and inviting him to search my coat pockets nothing shto oo vas yest he said again more loudly this time it was i reflected like me talking to poor dr novak whose wife i had been able to confirm was indeed being held by the mvd trying to discover what he could trade nichto i repeated the grin disappeared from the ivans face he spat on the carriage floor vroon liar he growled and pushed me on the arm i shook my head and told him that i wasnt lying he reached to push me again only this time he checked his hand and took hold of the sleeve with his dirty finger and thumb doraga expensive he said appreciatively feeling the material i shook my head but the coat was black cashmere the sort of coat i had no business wearing in the zone and it was no use arguing the ivan was already unbuckling his belt ya hachoo vashi koyt he said removing his own wellpatched greatcoat then stepping to the other side of the carriage he flung open the door and informed me that either i could hand over the coat or he would throw me off the train i had no doubt that he would throw me out whether i gave him my coat or not it was my turn to spit nu nyelzya nothing doing i said you want this coat you come and get it you stupid fucking svinya you ugly dumb kryestyanin come on take it from me you drunken bastard the ivan snarled angrily and picked up his carbine from the seat where he had left it that was his first mistake having seen him signal to the enginedriver by firing his weapon out of the window i knew that there could not be a live cartridge in the breech it was a deductive process he made only a moment behind me but by the time he was working the bolt action a second time i had buried the toe of my boot in his groin the carbine clattered to the floor as the ivan doubled over painfully and with one hand reached between his legs with the other he lashed out hard catching me an agonizing blow on the thigh that left my leg feeling as dead as mutton as he straightened up again i swung with my right and found my fist caught firmly in his big paw he snatched at my throat and i headbutted him full in the face which made him release my fist as he instinctively cupped his turnipsized nose i swung again and this time he ducked and seized me by the coat lapels that was his second mistake but for a brief puzzled halfsecond i did not realize it unaccountably he cried out and staggered back from me his hands raised in the air in front of him like a scrubbedup surgeon his lacerated fingertips pouring with blood it was only then that i remembered the razorblades i had sewn under my lapels many months before for just this eventuality my flying tackle carried him crashing to the floor and half a torsos length beyond the open door of the fastmoving train lying on his bucking legs i struggled to prevent the ivan pulling himself back into the carriage hands that were sticky with blood clawed at my face and then fastened desperately round my neck his grip tightened and i heard the air gurgle from my own throat like the sound of an espressomachine i punched him hard under the chin not once but several times and then pressed the heel of my hand against it as i sought to push him back into the racing night air the skin on my forehead tightened as i gasped for breath a terrible roaring filled my ears as if a grenade had burst directly in front of my face and for a second his fingers seemed to loosen i lunged at his head and connected with the empty space that was now mercifully signalled by an abruptly terminated stump of bloody human vertebra a tree or perhaps a telegraph pole had neatly decapitated him my chest a heaving sack of rabbits i collapsed back into the carriage too exhausted to yield to the wave of nausea that was beginning to overtake me but after only a few seconds more i could no longer resist it and summoned forward by the sudden contraction of my stomach i vomited copiously over the dead soldiers body it was several minutes before i felt strong enough to tip the corpse out of the door with the carbine quickly following i picked the ivans malodorous greatcoat off the seat to throw it out as well but the weight of it made me hesitate searching the pockets i found a czechoslovakianmade automatic a handful of wristwatches probably all stolen and a halfempty bottle of moscowskaya after deciding to keep the gun and the watches i uncorked the vodka wiped the neck and raised the bottle to the freezing nightsky alia rasi bo sun god save you i said and swallowed a generous mouthful then i flung the bottle and the greatcoat off the train and closed the door back at the railway station snow floated in the air like fragments of lint and collected in small skislopes in the angle between the station wall and the road it was colder than it had been all week and the sky was heavy with the threat of something worse a fog lay on the white streets like cigar smoke drifting across a well starched tablecloth close by a streetlight burned with no great intensity but it was still bright enough to light up my face for the scrutiny of a british soldier staggering home with several bottles of beer in each hand the bemused grin of intoxication on his face changed to something more circumspect as he caught sight of me and he swore with what sounded like fright i limped quickly past him and heard the sound of a bottle breaking on the road as it slipped from nervous fingers it suddenly occurred to me that my hands and face were covered with the ivans blood not to mention my own i must have looked like julius caesars last toga ducking into a nearby alley i washed myself with some snow it seemed to remove not only the blood but the skin as well and probably left my face looking every bit as red as before my icy toilette completed i walked on as smartly as i was able and reached home without further adventure it had gone midnight by the time i shouldered open my front door at least it was easier getting in than out expecting my wife to be in bed i was not surprised to find the apartment in darkness but when i went into the bedroom i saw that she was not there i emptied my pockets and prepared for bed laid out on the dressingtable the ivans watches a rolex a mickey mouse a gold patek and a doxas were all working and adjusted to within a minute or two of each other but the sight of so much accurate timekeeping seemed only to underline kirstens lateness i might have been concerned for her but for the suspicion i held as to where she was and what she was doing and the fact that i was worn through to my tripe my hands trembling with fatigue my cortex aching as if i had been pounded with a meattenderizer i crawled to bed with no more spirit than if i had been driven from among men to eat grass like an ox i awoke to the sound of a distant explosion they were always dynamiting dangerous ruins a wolfs howl of wind whipped against the window and i pressed myself closer to kirstens warm body while my mind slowly decoded the clues that led me back into the dark labyrinth of doubt the scent on her neck the cigarette smoke sticking to her hair i had not heard her come to bed gradually a duet of pain between my right leg and my head began to make itself felt and closing my eyes again i groaned and rolled wearily on to my back remembering the awful events of the previous night i had killed a man worst of all i had killed a russian soldier that i had acted in selfdefence would i knew be a matter of very little consequence to a soviet appointed court there was only one penalty for killing soldiers of the red army now i asked myself how many people might have seen me walking from potsdamer railway station with the hands and face of a south american headhunter i resolved that for several months at least it might be better if i were to stay out of the eastern zone but staring at the bombdamaged ceiling of the bedroom i was reminded of the possibility that the zone might choose to come to me there was berlin an open patch of lathing on an otherwise immaculate expanse of plasterwork while in the corner of the bedroom was the bag of blackmarket builders gypsum with which i was one day intending to cover it over there were few people myself included who did not believe that stalin was intent on a similar mission to cover over the small bare patch of freedom that was berlin i rose from my side of the bed washed at the ewer dressed and went into the kitchen to find some breakfast on the table were several grocery items that had not been there the night before coffee butter a tin of condensed milk and a couple of bars of chocolate all from the post exchange or px the only shops with anything in them and shops that were restricted to american servicemen rationing meant that the german shops were emptied almost as soon as the supplies came in any food was welcome with cards totalling less than calories a day between kirsten and me we often went hungry i had lost more than fifteen kilos since the end of the war at the same time i had my doubts about kirstens method of obtaining these extra supplies but for the moment i put away my suspicions and fried a few potatoes with ersatz coffeegrounds to give them some taste summoned by the smell of cooking kirsten appeared in the kitchen doorway enough there for two she asked of course i said and set a plate in front of her now she noticed the bruise on my face my god bernie what the hell happened to you i had a runin with an ivan last night i let her touch my face and demonstrate her concern for a brief moment before sitting down to eat my breakfast bastard tried to rob me we slugged it out for a minute and then he took off i think he must have had a busy evening he left some watches behind i wasnt going to tell her that he was dead there was no sense in us both feeling anxious i saw them they look nice must be a couple of thousand dollars worth there ill go up to the reichstag this morning and see if i cant find some ivans to buy them be careful he doesnt come there looking for you dont worry ill be all right i forked some potatoes into my mouth picked up the tin of american coffee and stared at it impassively a bit late last night werent you you were sleeping like a baby when i got home kirsten checked her hair with the flat of her hand and added we were very busy yesterday one of the yanks took the place over for his birthday party i see my wife was a schoolteacher but worked as a waitress at an american bar in zehlendorf which was open to american servicemen only underneath the overcoat which the cold obliged her to wear about our apartment she was already dressed in the red chintz frock and tiny frilled apron that was her uniform i weighed the coffee in my hand did you steal this lot she nodded avoiding my eye i dont know how you get away with it i said dont they bother to search any of you dont they notice a shortage in the storeroom she laughed youve no idea how much food there is in that place those yanks are on over calories a day a gi eats your monthly meat ration in just one night and still has room for icecream she finished her breakfast and produced a packet of lucky strike from her coat pocket want one did you steal those as well but i took one anyway and bowed my head to the match she was striking always the detective she muttered adding rather more irritatedly as a matter of fact these were a present from one of the yanks some of them are just boys you know they can be very kind ill bet they can i heard myself growl they like to talk thats all im sure your english must be improving i smiled broadly to defuse any sarcasm that was in my voice this was not the time not yet anyway i wondered if she would say anything about the bottle of chanel that i had recently found hidden in one of her drawers but she did not mention it long after kirsten had gone to the snack bar there was a knock at the door still nervous about the death of the ivan i put his automatic in my jacket pocket before going to answer it whos there dr novak our business was swiftly concluded i explained that my informer from the headquarters of the gsov had confirmed with one telephone call on the landline to the police in magdeburg which was the nearest city in the zone to wernigerode that frau novak was indeed being held in protective custody by the mvd upon novaks return home both he and his wife were to be deported immediately for work vital to the interests of the peoples of the union of soviet socialist republics to the city of kharkov in the ukraine novak nodded grimly that would follow he sighed most of their metallurgical research is centred there what will you do now i asked he shook his head with such a look of despondency that i felt quite sorry for him but not as sorry as i felt for frau novak she was stuck well you know where to find me if i can be of any further service to you novak nodded at the bag of coal i had helped him carry up from his taxi and said from the look of your face i should imagine that you earned that coal lets just say that burning it all at once wouldnt make this room half as hot i paused its none of my business dr novak but will you go back youre right its none of your business i wished him luck anyway and when he was gone carried a shovelful of coal into the sittingroom and with a care that was only disturbed by my growing anticipation of being once more warm in my home i built and lit a fire in the stove i spent a pleasant morning laid up on the couch and was almost inclined to stay at home for the rest of the day but in the afternoon i found a walkingstick in the cupboard and limped up to the kurfürstendamm where after queuing for at least half an hour i caught a tram eastwards black market shouted the conductor when we came within sight of the old ruined reichstag and the tram emptied itself no german however respectable considered himself to be above a little blackmarketeering now and again and with an average weekly income of about marks enough to buy a packet of cigarettes even legitimate businesses had plenty of occasions to rely on blackmarket commodities to pay employees people used their virtually useless reichsmarks only to pay the rent and to buy their miserable ration allowances for the student of classical economics berlin presented the perfect model of a business cycle that was determined by greed and need in front of the blackened reichstag on a field the size of a football pitch as many as a thousand people were standing about in little knots of conspiracy holding what they had come to sell in front of them like passports at a busy frontier packets of saccharine cigarettes sewingmachine needles coffee ration coupons mostly forged chocolate and condoms others wandered around glancing with deliberate disdain at the items held up for inspection and searching for whatever it was they had come to buy there was nothing that couldnt be bought here anything from the titledeeds to some bombedout property to a fake denazification certificate guaranteeing the bearer to be free of nazi infection and therefore employable in some capacity that was subject to allied control be it orchestra conductor or roadsweeper but it wasnt just germans who came to trade far from it the french came to buy jewellery for their girlfriends back home and the british to buy cameras for their seaside holidays the americans bought antiques that had been expertly faked in one of the many workshops off savignyplatz and the ivans came to spend their months of backpay on watches or so i hoped i took up a position next to a man on crutches whose tin leg stuck out of the top of the haversack he was carrying on his back i held up my watches by their straps after a while i nodded amicably at my onelegged neighbour who apparently had nothing which he could display and asked him what he was selling he jerked the back of his head at his haversack my leg he said without any trace of regret thats too bad his face registered quiet resignation then he looked at my watches nice he said there was an ivan round here about fifteen minutes ago who was looking for a good watch for per cent ill see if i can find him for you i tried to think how long i might have to stand there in the cold before making a sale five i heard myself say if he buys the man nodded and lurched off a moving tripod in the direction of the kroll opera house ten minutes later he was back breathing heavily and accompanied by not one but two russian soldiers who after a great deal of argument bought the mickey mouse and the gold patek for when they had gone i peeled nine of the greasy bills off the wad i had taken from the ivans and handed them over maybe you can hang on to that leg of yours now maybe he said with a sniff but later on i saw him sell it for five cartons of winston i had no more luck that afternoon and having fastened the two remaining watches to my wrists i decided to go home but passing close to the ghostly fabric of the reichstag with its brickedup windows and its precariouslooking dome my mind was changed by one particular piece of graffiti that was daubed there reproducing itself on the lining of my stomach what our women do makes a german weep and a gi come in his pants the train to zehlendorf and the american sector of berlin dropped me only a short way south of kronprinzenallee and johnnys american bar where kirsten worked less than a kilometre from us military headquarters it was dark by the time i found johnnys a bright noisy place with steamedup windows and several jeeps parked in front a sign above the cheaplooking entrance declared that the bar was only open to first three graders whatever they were outside the door was an old man with a stoop like an igloo one of the citys many thousands of tipcollectors who made a living from picking up cigaretteends like prostitutes each tipcollector had his own beat with the pavements outside american bars and clubs the most coveted of all where on a good day a man or woman could recover as many as a hundred butts a day enough for about ten or fifteen whole cigarettes and worth a total of about five dollars hey uncle i said to him want to earn yourself four winston i took out the packet i had bought at the reichstag and tapped four into the palm of my hand the mans rheumy eyes travelled eagerly from the cigarettes to my face whats the job two now two when you come and tell me when this lady comes out of here i gave him the photograph of kirsten i kept in my wallet very attractive piece he leered never mind that i jerked my thumb at a dirtylooking café further up kronprinzenallee in the direction of the us military hq see that café he nodded ill be waiting there the tipcollector saluted with his finger and quickly trousering the photograph and the two winston he started to turn back to scan his flagstones but i held him by the grubby handkerchief he wore tied round his stubbly throat dont forget now will you i said twisting it tight this looks like a good beat so ill know where to go looking if you dont remember to come and tell me got that the old man seemed to sense my anxiety he grinned horribly she might have forgotten you sir but you can rest assured that i wont his face a garage floor of shiny spots and oily patches reddened as for a moment i tightened my grip see that you dont i said and let him go feeling a certain amount of guilt for handling him so roughly i handed him another cigarette by way of compensation and discounting his exaggerated endorsements of my own good character i walked up the street to the dingy café for what felt like hours but wasnt quite two i sat silently nursing a large and inferiortasting brandy smoking several cigarettes and listening to the voices around me when the tipcollector came to fetch me his scrofulous features wore a triumphant grin i followed him outside and back into the street the lady sir he said pointing urgently towards the railway station she went that way he paused as i paid him the balance of his fee and then added with her schätzi a captain i think anyway a handsome young fellow whoever he is i didnt stay to hear any more and walked as briskly as i was able in the direction which he had indicated i soon caught sight of kirsten and the american officer who accompanied her his arm wrapped around her shoulders i followed them at a distance the full moon affording me a clear view of their leisurely progress until they came to a bombedout apartment block with six layers of flakypastry floors collapsed one on top of the other they disappeared inside should i go in after them i asked myself did i need to see everything bitter bile percolated up from my liver to break down the fatty doubt that lay heavy in my gut like mosquitoes i heard them before i saw them their english was more fluent than my understanding but she seemed to be explaining that she could not be late home two nights in a row a cloud drifted across the moon darkening the landscape and i crept behind an enormous pile of scree where i thought i might get a better view when the cloud sailed on and the moonlight shone undiminished through the bare rafters of the roof i had a clear sight of them silent now for a moment they were a facsimile of innocence as she knelt before him while he laid his hands upon her head as if delivering holy benediction i puzzled as to why kirstens head should be rocking on her shoulders but when he groaned my understanding of what was happening was as swift as the feeling of emptiness which accompanied it i stole silently away and drank myself stupid i spent the night on the couch an occurrence which kirsten asleep in bed by the time i finally staggered home would have wrongly attributed to the drink on my breath i feigned sleep until i heard her leave the apartment although i could not escape her kissing me on the forehead before she went she was whistling as she stepped down the stairs and into the street i got up and watched her from the window as she walked north up fasanenstrasse towards zoo station and her train to zehlendorf when i lost sight of her i set about trying to salvage some remnant of myself with which i could face the day my head throbbed like an excited dobermann but after a wash with an icecold flannel a couple of cups of the captains coffee and a cigarette i started to feel a little better still i was much too preoccupied with the memory of kirsten frenching the american captain and thoughts of the harm i could bring to him to even remember the harm i had already caused a soldier of the red army and i was not as careful in answering a knock at the door as i should have been the russian was short and yet he stood taller than the tallest man in the red army thanks to the three gold stars and lightblue braid border on his greatcoats silver epaulettes identifying him as a palkovnik a colonel of the mvd the soviet secret political police herr gunther he asked politely i nodded sullenly angry with myself for not having been more careful i wondered where i had left the dead ivans gun and if i dared to make a break for it or would he have men waiting at the foot of the stairs for just such an eventuality the officer took off his cap clicked his heels like a prussian and headbutted the air palkovnik poroshin at your service may i come in he did not wait for an answer he wasnt the type who was used to waiting for anything other than his own wind no more than about thirty years old the colonel wore his hair long for a soldier pushing it clear of his pale blue eyes and back over his narrow head he rendered the veneer of a smile as he turned to face me in my sittingroom he was enjoying my discomfort it is herr bernhard gunther is it not i have to be sure knowing my name like that was a bit of a surprise and so was the handsome gold cigarettecase which he flicked open in front of me the tan on the ends of his cadaverous fingers suggested that he didnt bother with selling cigarettes as much as smoking them and the mvd didnt normally bother to share a smoke with a man they were about to arrest so i took one and owned up to my name he fed a cigarette into his lantern jaw and produced a matching dunhill to light us both and you are a he winced as the smoke billowed into his eye shpek what is the german word private detective i said translating automatically and regretting my alacrity almost at the very same moment poroshins eyebrows lifted on his high forehead well well he remarked with a quiet surprise that turned quickly first to interest and then sadistic pleasure you speak russian i shrugged a little but that is not a common word not for someone who only speaks a little russian shpek is also the russian word for salted pig fat did you know that as well no i said but as a soviet prisoner of war i had eaten enough of it smeared on coarse black bread to know it only too well did he guess that nye shooti seriously he grinned i bet you do just as id bet you know that im mvd eh now he laughed out loud do you see how good at my job i am i havent been talking to you for five minutes and already im able to say that you are keen to conceal that you speak good russian but why why dont you tell me what you want colonel come now he said as an intelligence officer it is only natural for me to wonder why you of all people must understand that kind of curiosity yes smoke trailed from his sharks fin of a nose as he pursed his lips in a rictus of apology it doesnt do for germans to be too curious i said not these days he shrugged and wandered over to my desk and looked at the two watches that were lying on it perhaps he murmured thoughtfully i hoped that he wouldnt presume to open the drawer where i now remembered i had put the dead ivans automatic trying to steer him back to whatever it was he had wanted to see me about i said isnt it true that all private detective and information agencies are forbidden in your zone at last he came away from the desk vyerno quite right herr gunther and that is because such institutions serve no purpose in a democracy poroshin tuttutted as i started to interrupt no please dont say it herr gunther you were going to say that the soviet union can hardly be called a democracy but if you did the comrade chairman might hear you and send terrible men like me to kidnap you and your wife of course we both know that the only people making a living in this city now are the prostitutes the blackmarketeers and the spies there will always be prostitutes and the blackmarketeers will last only for as long as the german currency remains unreformed that leaves spying thats the new profession to be in herr gunther you should forget about being a private detective when there are so many new opportunities for people like yourself that sounds almost as if you are offering me a job colonel he smiled wryly not a bad idea at that but it isnt why i came he looked behind him at the armchair may i sit down be my guest im afraid i cant offer you much besides coffee thank you no i find it a rather excitable drink i arranged myself on the couch and waited for him to start there is a mutual friend of ours emil becker who has got himself into the devils kitchen as you say becker i thought for a moment and recalled a face from the russian offensive of and before that in the reichskriminal police the kripo i havent seen him in a long time i wouldnt call him a friend exactly but whats he done what are you holding him for poroshin shook his head you misunderstand he isnt in trouble with us but with the americans to be precise their vienna military police so if you havent got him and the americans have he must have actually committed a crime poroshin ignored my sarcasm he has been charged with the murder of an american officer an army captain well weve all felt like doing that at some time i shook my head at poroshins questioning look no it doesnt matter what matters here is that becker did not kill this american he said firmly he is innocent nevertheless the americans have a good case and he will certainly hang if someone does not help him i dont see what i can do he wishes to engage you in your capacity as a private detective naturally to prove him innocent for this he will pay you generously win or lose the sum of i heard myself whistle thats a lot of money half to be paid now in gold the balance payable upon your arrival in vienna and whats your interest in all this colonel he flexed his neck across the tight collar of his immaculate tunic as i said becker is a friend do you mind explaining how he saved my life herr gunther i must do whatever i can to help him but it would be politically difficult for me to assist him officially you understand how do you come to be so familiar with beckers wishes in this affair i can hardly imagine that he telephones you from an american gaol he has a lawyer of course it was beckers lawyer who asked me to try and find you and to ask you to help your old comrade he was never that its true we once worked together but old comrades no poroshin shrugged as you wish five thousand dollars where does becker get he is resourceful man thats one word for it whats he doing now he runs an import and export business here and in vienna a nice enough euphemism blackmarket i suppose poroshin nodded apologetically and offered me another cigarette from his gold case i smoked it with slow deliberation wondering what small percentage of all this might be on the level well what do you say i cant do it i said eventually ill give you the polite reason first i stood up and went to the window in the street below stood a shiny new bmw with a russian pennant on the bonnet leaning on it was a big toughlooking red army soldier colonel poroshin it wouldnt have escaped your attention that its not getting any easier to get in or out of this city after all you have berlin surrounded with half the red army but quite apart from the ordinary travel restrictions affecting germans things do seem to have got quite a lot worse during the last few weeks even for your socalled allies and with so many displaced persons trying to enter austria illegally the austrians are quite happy that journeys there should be discouraged all right thats the polite reason but none of this is a problem poroshin said smoothly for an old friend like emil i will gladly pull a few wires rail warrants a pink pass tickets it can all be easily fixed you can trust me to handle all the necessary arrangements well i suppose thats the second reason why im not going to do it the less polite reason i dont trust you colonel why should i you talk about pulling a few strings to help emil but you could just as easily pull them the other way things are rather fickle on your side of the fence i know a man who came back from the war to find communist party officials living in his house officials for whom nothing was simpler than to pull a few strings in order to ensure his committal to a lunatic asylum just so they could keep the house and only a month or two ago i left a couple of friends drinking in a bar in your sector of berlin only to learn later that minutes after i had gone soviet forces surrounded the place and pressed everyone in the bar into a couple of weeks of forced labour so i repeat colonel i dont trust you and see no reason why i should for all i know i might be arrested the minute i step into your sector poroshin laughed out loud but why why should you be arrested i never noticed that you need much of a reason i shrugged exasperatedly maybe because im a private detective for the mvd thats as good as being an american spy i believe that the old concentration camp at sachsenhausen which your people took over from the nazis is now full of germans whove been accused of spying for the americans if you will permit me one small arrogance herr gunther do you seriously believe that i an mvd palkovnik would consider that the matter of your deception and arrest was more important than the affairs of the allied control council youre a member of the kommendatura i was surprised i have the honour to be intelligence officer to the soviet deputy military governor you may inquire at the council headquarters in elsholzstrasse if you dont believe me he paused waiting for some reaction from me come now what do you say when i still said nothing he sighed and shook his head ill never understand you germans you speak the language well enough dont forget mara was a german yes but he was also a jew your countrymen spent twelve years trying to make those two circumstances mutually exclusive thats one of the things i cant understand change your mind i shook my head very well the colonel showed no sign of being irritated at my refusal he looked at his watch and then stood up i must be going he said taking out a notebook he started to write on a piece of paper if you do change your mind you can reach me at this number in karlshorst thats ask for general kaverntsevs special security section and theres my home telephone number as well poroshin smiled and nodded at the note as i took it from him if you should be arrested by the americans i wouldnt let them see that if i were you theyll probably think youre a spy he was still laughing about that as he went down the stairs for those who had believed in the fatherland it was not the defeat which gave the lie to that patriarchal view of society but the rebuilding and with the example of berlin ruined by the vanity of men could be learned the lesson that when a war has been fought when the soldiers are dead and the walls are destroyed a city consists of its women i walked towards a grey granite canyon which might have concealed a heavily worked mine from where a short train of brickladen trucks was even now emerging under the supervision of a group of rubblewomen on the side of one of their trucks was chalked no time for love you didnt need reminding in view of their dusty faces and wrestlers bodies but they had hearts as big as their biceps smiling through their catcalls and whistles of derision where were my hands now that the city needed to be reconstructed and waving my walkingstick like a sicknote i carried on until i came to pestalozzistrasse where friedrich korsch an old friend from my days with kripo and now a kommissar with berlins communistdominated police force had told me that i could find emil beckers wife number was a damaged fivestorey building of basinflats with paper windows and inside the front doorway smelling heavily of burnt toast was a sign which warned unsafe staircase in use at visitors own risk fortunately for me the names and apartmentnumbers that were chalked on the wall inside the door told me that frau becker lived on the ground floor i walked down a dark dank corridor to her door between it and the landing washbasin an old woman was picking large chunks of fungus off the damp wall and collecting them in a cardboard box are you from the red cross she asked i told her i wasnt knocked at the door and waited she smiled its all right you know were really quite welloff here there was a quiet insanity in her voice i knocked again more loudly this time and heard a muffled sound and then bolts being drawn on the other side of the door we dont go hungry said the old woman the lord provides she pointed at her shards of fungus in the box look there are even fresh mushrooms growing here and so saying she pulled a piece of fungus from the wall and ate it when the door finally opened i was momentarily unable to speak from disgust frau becker catching sight of the old woman brushed me aside and stepped smartly into the corridor where with many loud insults she shooed the old woman away filthy old baggage she muttered shes always coming into this building and eating that mould the womans mad a complete spinner something she ate no doubt i said queasily frau becker fixed me with the awl of her bespectacled eye now who are you and what do you want she asked brusquely my name is bernhard gunther i started heard of you she snapped youre with kripo i was youd better come in she followed me into the icycold sittingroom slammed the door shut and closed the bolts as if in mortal fear of something noticing how this took me aback she added by way of explanation cant be too careful these days no indeed i looked around at the loathsome walls the threadbare carpet and the old furniture it wasnt much but it was neatly kept there was little she could have done about the damp charlottenburgs not too badly off i offered by way of mitigation in comparison with some areas maybe so she said but i can tell you if youd come after dark and knocked till kingdom come i wouldnt have answered we get all sorts of rats round here at night so saying she picked up a large sheet of plywood from off the couch and for a moment in the gloom of the place i thought she was working on a jigsawpuzzle then i saw the numerous packets of olleschau cigarette papers the bags of butts the piles of salvaged tobacco and the serried ranks of rerolls i sat down on the couch took out my winston and offered her one thanks she said grudgingly and threaded the cigarette behind her ear ill smoke it later but i didnt doubt that she would sell it with the rest whats the going rate for one of those recycled nails about marks she said i pay my collectors five us for tips that rolls about twenty good ones sell them for about ten us what are you writing an article about it for the tagesspiegel spare me the victor gollanczsave berlin routine herr gunther youre here about that lousy husband of mine arent you well i havent seen him in a long while and i hope i never clap eyes on him again i expect you know hes in a viennese gaol do you yes i do you may as well know that when the american mps came to tell me hed been arrested i was glad i could forgive him for deserting me but not our son there was no telling if frau becker had turned witch before or after her husband had jumped his wifes bail but on first acquaintance she wasnt the type to have persuaded me that her absconding husband had made the wrong choice she had a bitter mouth prominent lower jaw and small sharp teeth no sooner had i explained the purpose of my visit than she started to chew the air around my ears it cost me the rest of my cigarettes to placate her enough to answer my questions exactly what happened can you tell me the mps said that he shot and killed an american army captain in vienna they caught him redhanded apparently thats all i was told what about this colonel poroshin do you know anything about him you want to know if you can trust him or not thats what you want to know well hes an ivan she sneered thats all you should need to know she shook her head and added impatiently oh they knew each other here in berlin because of one of emils rackets penicillin i think it was emil said that poroshin caught syphilis off some girl he was keen on more like the other way round i thought anyway this was the worst kind of syphilis the sort that makes you swell up salvarsan didnt seem to work emil got them some penicillin well you know how rare that is the good stuff i mean that could be one reason why poroshins trying to help emil theyre all the same these russians its not just their brains that are in their balls its their hearts too poroshins gratitude comes straight from his scrotum and another reason her brow darkened you said that could be one reason well of course it cant simply be a matter of pulling poroshins tail out of the fire can it i wouldnt be at all surprised if emil had been spying for him got any evidence for that did he see much of poroshin when he was still here in berlin i cant say he did i cant say he didnt but hes not charged with anything besides murder hes not been charged with spying what would be the point theyve got enough to hang him as it is thats not the way it works if he had been spying they would have wanted to know everything those american mps would have asked you a lot of questions about your husbands associates did they she shrugged not that i can remember if there was any suspicion of spying they would have investigated it if only to find out what sort of information he might have got hold of did they search this place frau becker shook her head either way i hope he hangs she said bitterly you can tell him that if you see him i certainly wont when did you last see him a year ago he came back from a soviet pow camp in july and he legged it three months later and when was he captured february at briansk her mouth tightened to think that i waited three years for that man all those other men who i turned away i kept myself for him and look what happened a thought seemed to occur to her theres your evidence for spying if you need any how was it that he managed to get himself released eh answer me that how did he get home when so many others are still there i stood up to leave perhaps the situation with my own wife made me more inclined to take beckers part but i had heard enough to realize that he would need all the help he could get possibly more if this woman had anything to do with it i said i was in a soviet prisonerofwar camp myself frau becker for less time than your husband as it happens it didnt make me a spy lucky maybe but not a spy i went to the door opened it and hesitated shall i tell you what it did make me with people like the police with people like you frau becker with people like my own wife whos hardly let me touch her since i came home shall i tell you what it made me it made me unwelcome it is said that a hungry dog will eat a dirty pudding but hunger doesnt just affect your standards of hygiene it also dulls the wits blunts the memory not to mention the sexdrive and generally produces a feeling of listlessness so it was no surprise to me that there had been a number of occasions during the course of when with senses pinched from want of nourishment i had nearly met with an accident it was for this very reason i decided to reflect upon my present rather irrational inclination which was to take beckers case after all with the benefit of a full stomach formerly berlins finest most famous hotel the adlon was now little more than a ruin somehow it remained open to guests with fifteen available rooms which because it was in the soviet sector were usually taken by russian officers a small restaurant not only survived in the basement but did brisk business too a result of it being exclusive to germans with food coupons who might therefore lunch or dine there without fear of being thrown off a table in favour of some more obviously affluent americans or british as happened in most other berlin restaurants the adlons improbable entrance was underneath a pile of rubble on wilhelmstrasse only a short distance away from the führerbunker where hitler had met his death and which could be toured for the price of a couple of cigarettes in the hand of any one of the policemen who were supposed to keep people out of it all berlins bulls were doubling as touts since the end of the war i ate a late lunch of lentil soup turnip hamburger and tinned fruit and having sufficiently turned over beckers problem in my metabolized mind i handed over my coupons and went up to what passed for the hotel reception desk to use the telephone my call to the soviet military authority the sma in karlshorst was connected quickly enough but i seemed to wait forever to be put through to colonel poroshin nor did speaking in russian speed the progress of my call it merely earned me a look of suspicion from the hotel porter when finally i got through to poroshin he seemed genuinely pleased that i had changed my mind and told me that i should wait by the picture of stalin on unter den linden where his staff car would collect me in fifteen minutes the afternoon had turned as raw as a boxers lip and i stood in the door of the adlon for ten minutes before heading back up the small service stairs and towards the top of the wilhelmstrasse then with the brandenburg gate at my back i walked up to the housesized picture of the comrade chairman that dominated the centre of the avenue flanked by two smaller plinths each bearing the soviet hammer and sickle as i waited for the car stalin seemed to watch me a sensation which i supposed was intended the eyes were as deep black and unpleasant as the inside of a postmans boot and under the cockroach moustaches the smile was hard permafrost it always amazed me that there were people who referred to this murdering monster as uncle joe he seemed to me to be about as avuncular as king herod poroshins car arrived its engine drowned by the noise of a squadron of yak fighters passing overhead i climbed aboard and rolled helplessly in the back seat as the broadshouldered tatarfaced driver hit the bmws accelerator sending the car speeding east towards alexanderplatz and beyond to the frankfurter allee and karlshorst i always thought that german civilians were forbidden to ride in staff cars i said to the driver in russian true he said but the colonel said that if we are stopped im just to say that youre being arrested the tatar laughed uproariously at my look of obvious alarm and i could only console myself with the fact that while we were driving at such a speed it was unlikely that we could be stopped by anything other than an antitank gun we reached karlshorst minutes later a villa colony with a steeplechase course karlshorst nicknamed the little kremlin was now a completely isolated russian enclave which germans could only enter by special permit or the kind of pennant on the front of poroshins car we were waved through several checkpoints and finally drew up alongside the old st antonius hospital on zeppelin strasse now housing the sma for berlin the car ground to a halt in the shadow of a fivemetrehigh plinth on top of which was a big red soviet star poroshins driver sprang out of his seat opened my door smartly and ignoring the sentries squired me up the steps to the front door i paused in the doorway for a moment surveying the shiny new bmw cars and motorcycles in the car park someone been shopping i said from the bmw factory at eisenbach said my driver proudly now russian with this depressing thought he left me in a waitingroom that smelled strongly of carbolic the rooms only concession to decoration was another picture of stalin with a slogan underneath that read stalin the wise teacher and protector of the working people even lenin portrayed in a smaller frame alongside the wise one seemed from his expression to have one or two problems with that particular sentiment i met these same two popular faces hanging on the wall of poroshins office on the top floor of the sma building the young colonels neatly pressed olivebrown tunic was hanging on the back of the glass door and he was wearing a circassianstyle shirt belted with a black strap but for the polish on his soft calfleather boots he might have passed for a student at moscow university he set down his mug and stood up from behind his desk as the tatar ushered me into his office sit down please herr gunther said poroshin pointing at a bentwood chair the tatar waited to be dismissed poroshin lifted his mug and held it up for my inspection would you like some ovaltine herr gunther ovaltine no thanks i hate the stuff do you he sounded surprised i love it its kind of early to be thinking of going to bed isnt it poroshin smiled patiently perhaps you would prefer some vodka he pulled open his desk drawer and took out a bottle and a glass which he placed on the desk in front of me i poured myself a large one out of the corner of my eye i saw the tatar rub his thirst with the back of his paw poroshin saw it too he filled another glass and laid it on the filing cabinet so that it was immediately next to the mans head you have to train these cossack bastards like dogs he explained for them drunkenness is an almost religious ordinance isnt that so yeroshka yes sir he said blankly he smashed a bar up assaulted a waitress punched a sergeant and but for me he might have been shot still might be shot eh yeroshka the minute you touch that glass without my permission understand yes sir poroshin produced a big heavy revolver and laid it on the desk to emphasize his point then he sat down again i imagine you know quite a lot about discipline with your record herr gunther where did you say you served during the war i didnt say he leaned back in his chair and swung his boots on to the desk the vodka trembled over the edge of my glass as they thudded down on the blotter no you didnt did you but i imagine that with your qualifications you would have served in some intelligence capacity what qualifications come now youre being too modest your spoken russian your experience with kripo ah yes emils lawyer told me about that im told that you and he were once part of the berlin murder commission and you a kommissar too thats quite senior isnt it i sipped my vodka and tried to keep calm i told myself that i ought to have expected something like this i was just an ordinary soldier obeying orders i said i wasnt even a party member so few were it would now seem i find that really quite remarkable he smiled and raised a salutary index finger be as coy as you like herr gunther but i shall find out about you mark my words if only to satisfy my curiosity sometimes curiosity is a bit like yeroshkas thirst i said best left unsatisfied unless its the disinterested intellectual kind of curiosity that belongs properly to the philosophers answers have a habit of disappointing i finished the glass and laid it on the blotter next to his boots but i didnt come here with a cipher in my socks to play your afternoons vexed question colonel so how about you feed me with one of those lucky strikes you were smoking this morning and satisfy my curiosity at least as far as telling me one or two facts about this case poroshin leaned forward and knocked open a silver cigarette box on the desk help yourself he said i took one and lit it with a fancy silver lighter that was cast in the shape of a field gun then i looked at it critically as if judging its value in a pawnshop he had irritated me and i wanted to kick back at him somehow youve got some nice loot i said this is a german field gun did you buy it or was there nobody at home when you called poroshin closed his eyes snorted a little laugh then got up and went over to the window he drew up the sash and unbuttoned his fly thats the trouble with drinking all that ovaltine he said apparently unperturbed by my attempt to insult him it goes straight through you when he started to pee he glanced back across his shoulder at the tatar who remained standing by the filing cabinet and the glass of vodka which stood on it drink it and get out pig the tatar didnt hesitate he emptied the glass with one jerk of his head and stepped swiftly out of the office closing the door behind him if you saw how peasants like him leave the toilets here you would understand why i prefer to piss out of the window said poroshin buttoning himself he closed the window and resumed his seat the boots thudded back on to the blotter my fellow russians can make life in this sector rather trying at times thank god for people like emil he is a most amusing man to have around on occasion and very resourceful too there is simply nothing that he cannot get hold of what is the word you have for these blackmarket types swing heinis yes swings if one wanted entertainment emil would be the swing to arrange it he laughed fondly at the thought of him which was more than i could do i never met a man who knew so many girls of course they are all prostitutes and chocoladies but that is not such a great crime these days is it it depends on the chocolady i said also emil is most ingenious at getting things across the border the green frontier you call it dont you i nodded through the woods an accomplished smuggler hes made a great deal of money until this happened he was living very well in vienna a big house a fine car and an attractive girlfriend have you ever made use of his services and i dont mean his acquaintance with chocoladies poroshin confined himself to repeating that emil could get hold of anything does that include information he shrugged now and again but whatever emil does he does for money i find it hard to believe he would not have also been doing things for the americans in this case however he had a job from an austrian a man called könig who was in the advertising and publicity business the company was called reklaue werbe zentrale and they had offices here in berlin and in vienna könig wanted emil to collect layouts from the vienna office to bring to berlin on a regular basis he said that the work was too important to trust to the post or to a courier and könig couldnt go himself as he was awaiting denazification of course emil suspected that the parcels contained things besides advertisements but the money was good enough for him to ask no questions and since he came to and from berlin on a fairly regular basis anyway it wasnt going to cause him any extra problems or so he thought for a while emils deliveries went without a problem when he was bringing cigarettes or some such contraband into berlin he would also bring one of königs parcels he handed them over to a man called eddy holl and collected his money it was as simple as that well one night emil was in berlin and went to a nightclub in berlinschönberg called the gay island by accident he met this man eddy holl he was drunk and introduced him to an american army captain called linden eddy described emil to captain linden as their vienna courier the next day eddy telephoned emil and apologised for being drunk and suggested that it would be better for all their sakes if emil forgot all about captain linden several weeks later when emil was back in vienna he got a call from this captain linden who said that he would like to meet him again so they met at some bar and the american started to ask questions about the advertising firm reklaue werbe there wasnt much that emil could tell him but lindens being there worried him he thought that if linden was in vienna that there might not be any more need for his own services it would be a shame he thought to see the end of such easy money so he followed linden around vienna for a while after a couple of days linden met another man and followed by emil they went to an old film studio minutes later emil heard a shot and the man came out alone emil waited until this man was gone then he went in and found captain lindens dead body and a load of stolen tobacco naturally enough he did not inform the police emil tries to have as little to do with them as possible the next day könig and a third man came to see him dont ask me his name i dont know they said that an american friend had gone missing and that they were worried something might have happened to him in view of the fact that emil had once been a detective with kripo would he for a substantial reward look into it for them emil agreed seeing an easy way to make some money and perhaps an opportunity to help himself to some of the tobacco after a day or so and having had the studio watched for a while emil and a couple of his boys decided it was safe to go back there with a van they found the international patrol waiting for them emils boys were a couple of pleasureshooters and got themselves killed emil was arrested does he know who tipped them off i asked my people in vienna to find that out it seems the tipoff was anonymous poroshin smiled appreciatively now heres the good part emils gun is a walther p he took it with him to the studio but when he was arrested and surrendered it he noticed that it wasnt his p after all this one had a german eagle on the handgrip and there was another important difference the local ballistics expert quickly identified this as the same gun that had shot and killed captain linden someone switched it for beckers own gun eh i said yes its not the sort of thing youd notice right away is it very neat a man conveniently carrying the murder weapon returns to the scene of the crime ostensibly to collect his stolen tobacco quite a strong case there id say i took a last puff of my cigarette before extinguishing it in poroshins silver deskashtray and helping myself to another im not sure what i would be able to do i said turning water into wine isnt in my normal line of work emil is anxious so his lawyer dr liebl tells me that you should find this man könig he seems to have disappeared ill bet he has do you think it was könig who made the switch when he came to beckers house it certainly looks that way könig or perhaps the third man do you know anything about könig or this publicity firm nyet there was a knock at the door and an officer came into poroshins office we have am kupfergraben on the line sir he announced in russian they say its urgent i pricked up my ears am kupfergraben was the location of berlins biggest mvd gaol with so many displaced and missing persons in my line of work it paid to keep your ears open poroshin glanced at me almost as if he knew what i was thinking and then said to the other officer it will have to wait jegoroff any other calls zaisser from k if that nazi bastard wants to speak to me he can damn well wait outside my door tell him that now leave us please he waited until the door had closed behind his subordinate k mean anything to you gunther should it not yet no but in time who knows he did not elaborate but instead glanced at his wristwatch we really must get on i have an appointment this evening jegoroff will arrange all your necessary papers pink pass travel permit a ration card an austrian identity card do you have a photograph never mind jegoroff will have one taken oh yes i think it would be a good idea if you were to have one of our new tobacco permits it allows you to sell cigarettes throughout the eastern zone and obliges all soviet personnel to be of assistance to you wherever it is possible it might just get you out of any trouble i thought the black market was illegal in your zone i said curious as to the reason for this blatant piece of official hypocrisy it is illegal poroshin said without any trace of embarrassment this is an officially licensed black market it allows us to raise some foreign currency rather a good idea dont you think naturally we will supply you with a few cartons of cigarettes to make it look convincing you seem to have thought of everything what about my money it will be delivered to your home at the same time as your papers the day after tomorrow and where is the money coming from this dr liebl or from your cigarette concessions liebl will be sending me money until then this matter will be handled by the sma i didnt like this much but there wasnt much of an alternative take money from the russians or go to vienna and trust that the money would be paid in my absence all right i said just one more thing what do you know about captain linden you said that becker met him in berlin was he stationed here yes i was forgetting him wasnt i poroshin stood up and went over to the filing cabinet on which the tatar had left his empty glass he opened one of the drawers and fingered his way across the tops of his files until he found the one he was searching for captain edward linden he read coming back to his chair born brooklyn new york february graduated cornell university with a degree in german serving th counterintelligence corps formerly th infantry stationed at camp king interrogation centre oberusel as denazification officer currently attached to us documents centre in berlin as crowcass liaison officer crowcass is the central registry of war crimes and security suspects of the united states army its not very much im afraid he dropped the file open in front of me the strange greeklooking letters covered no more than half a sheet of paper im not much good with cyrillic i said poroshin did not look convinced what exactly is the united states documents centre its a building in the american sector near the edge of the grünewald the berlin documents centre is the depository for nazi ministerial and party documents captured by the americans and the british towards the end of the war its quite comprehensive theyve got the complete nsdap membership records which makes it easy to find out when people lie on their denazification questionnaires ill bet theyve even got your name there somewhere like i said i was never a party member no he grinned of course not poroshin took the file and returned it to the filing cabinet you were only obeying orders it was plain he didnt believe me any more than he believed that i was unable to decipher st cyrils byzantine alphabet in that at least he would have been justified and now if you have no more questions i really must leave you i am due at the state opera in the admiralspalast in half an hour he took off his belt and yelling the names of yeroshka and jegoroff slipped into his tunic have you ever been to vienna he asked fixing the cross belt under his epaulette no never the people are just like the architecture he said inspecting his appearance in the windows reflection they are all front everything thats interesting about them seems to be on the surface inside theyre very different now theres a people i could really work with all viennese were born to be spies you were late again last night i said i didnt wake you did i she slid naked out of bed and went over to the fulllength mirror in the corner of our bedroom anyway you were kind of late yourself the other night she started to examine her body its so nice having a warm house again where on earth did you find the coal a client watching her standing there stroking her pubic hair and flattening her stomach with the palm of her hand lifting her breasts scrutinizing her tight finelylined mouth with its waxy sheen concave cheeks and shrinking gums and finally twisting around to assess her gently sagging bottom her bony hand with the rings on the fingers slightly looser than before pulling at the flesh of one buttock i didnt need to be told what was going through her mind she was an attractive mature woman intent on making full use of what time she had left feeling hurt and irritated i jackknifed out of bed to find my leg buckling beneath me you look fine i said wearily and limped into the kitchen that sounds a little short for a love sonnet she called out there were some more px goods on the kitchen table a couple of cans of soup a bar of real soap a few saccharine cards and a packet of condoms still naked kirsten followed me into the kitchen and watched me examining her haul was it just the one american or were there more i see youve been busy again i said picking up the packet of parisians how many calories are these she laughed behind her hand the manager keeps a load under the counter she sat down on a chair i thought it would be nice you know its been quite a while since we did anything she let her thighs yawn as if to let me see a little more of her theres time now if you want it was quickly done expedited with an almost professional nonchalance on her part as if she had been administering an enema no sooner had i finished than she was heading towards the bathroom with hardly a blush on her cheek carrying the used parisian as if it were a dead mouse she had found under the bed half an hour later dressed and ready to leave for work she paused in the sittingroom where i had stoked the ashes in the stove and was now adding some more coal for a moment she watched me bring the fire to life again youre good at that she said i couldnt tell whether any sarcasm was intended then she gave me a peremptory kiss and went out the morning was colder than a mohels knife and i was glad to start the day in a reading library on hardenbergstrasse the library assistant was a man with a mouth so badly scarred that it was impossible to say where his lips were until he started to speak no he said in a voice that belonged properly to a sealion there are no books about the bdc but there have been a couple of newspaper articles published in the last few months one in the telegraf i think and the other in the military government information bulletin he collected his crutches and shouldered his onelegged way to a cabinet housing a large cardindex where as he had remembered he found references for both these articles one published in the telegraf in may an interview with the centres commanding officer a lieutenantcolonel hans w helm the other an account of the centres early history written by a junior staff member in august i thanked the assistant who told me where to find the librarys copies of both publications lucky for you that you came today he said im travelling to giessen tomorrow to have my artificial leg fitted reading the articles i realized that i had never thought the americans were capable of such efficiency admittedly there had been a certain amount of luck involved in the accumulation of some of the centres documentary collections for example troops of the us seventh army had stumbled on the complete nazi party membership records at a paper mill near munich where they were about to be pulped but staff at the centre had set about the creation and organization of the most comprehensive archive so that it could be determined with complete accuracy exactly who was a nazi as well as the nsdap master files the centre included in its collection the nsdap membership applications party correspondence ss service records reich security office records ss racial records proceedings of the supreme party court and the peoples court everything from the membership files of the national socialist schoolteachers organization to a file detailing expulsions from the hitler youth another thought occurred to me as i left the library and made my way to the railway station i would never have believed that the nazis could have been stupid enough to have recorded their own activities in such comprehensive and incriminating detail i left the ubahn a stop too early as it turned out at a station in the american sector which for no reason to do with their occupation of the city was called uncle toms hut and walked down argentinische allee surrounded by the tall fir trees of the grünewald and only a short distance from a small lake the berlin documents centre stood in wellguarded grounds at the end of wasserkäfersteig a cobblestoned culdesac inside a wire fence the centre comprised a number of buildings but the main part of the bdc appeared to be a twostorey affair at the end of a raised pathway painted white and with green shutters on the windows it was a nicelooking place although i soon remembered it as the headquarters of the old forschungsamt the nazis telephonetapping centre the soldier at the gatehouse a big gaptoothed negro eyed me suspiciously as i halted at his checkpoint he was probably more used to dealing with people in cars or military vehicles than with a lone pedestrian what do you want fritzy he said clapping his woolly gloves together and stamping his boots to keep warm i was a friend of captain lindens i said in my halting english i have just heard the terrible news and i came to say how sorry my wife and i were he was kind to us both gave us px you know from my pocket i produced the short letter i had composed on the train perhaps you would be kind enough to deliver this to colonel helm the soldiers tone changed immediately yes sir ill give it to him he took the letter and regarded it awkwardly very kind of you to think of him it is just a few marks for some flowers i said shaking my head and a card my wife and i wanted something on captain lindens grave we would go to the funeral if it was in berlin but we thought that his family would be taking him home well no sir he said the funerals in vienna this friday morning family wanted it that way less trouble than shipping a body all the way home i guess i shrugged for a berliner that might as well be in america travel is not easy these days i sighed and glanced at my watch i had better be getting along i have quite a walk ahead of me when i turned to walk away i groaned and clutching my knee and affecting a broad grimace i sat squarely down on the road in front of the barrier my stick clattering on the cobbles beside me quite a performance the soldier sidestepped his checkpoint are you all right he said collecting my stick and helping me to my feet a bit of russian shrapnel it gives me some trouble now and again ill be all right in a minute or two hey come on in to the gatehouse and sit down for a couple of minutes he led me round the barrier and through the little door of his hut thank you it is very kind of you kind nothing any friend of captain lindens i sat down heavily and rubbed my almost painless knee did you know him well me im just a pfc i cant say i knew him but i used to drive him now and again i smiled and shook my head could you speak more slowly please my english is not so good i drove him now and again the soldier said more loudly and he imitated the action of turning a steeringwheel you say that he gave you px yes he was very kind yeah that sounds like linden always had plenty of px to give away he paused as a thought occurred to him there was one particular couple well he was like a son to them always taking them care packages perhaps you know them the drexlers i frowned and rubbed my jaw thoughtfully not the couple who live in i snapped my fingers as if the street name were on the tip of my tongue where is it now steglitz he said prompting me handjery strasse i shook my head no i must be thinking of someone else sorry hey dont mention it i suppose the police must have asked you a lot of questions about captain lindens murder nope they asked us nothing on account of the fact that they already got the guy who did it theyve got someone that is good news who is he some austrian but why did he do it did he say nope crazy i guess how dyou meet the captain anyway i met him at a nightclub the gay island yeah i know it never go there myself me i prefer those places down on the kudamm ronnys bar and the club royale but linden used to go to the gay island a lot he had a lot of german friends i guess and thats where they liked to go well he spoke such good german that he did sir like a native my wife and i used to wonder why he never had a regular girl we even offered to introduce him to some nice girls from good families the soldier shrugged too busy i guess he chuckled he sure had plenty of others gee that man liked to frat after a moment i realized he meant fraternize which was the euphemism in general military usage for what another american officer was doing to my wife i squeezed my knee experimentally and stood up sure youre all right now said the soldier yes thank you you have been most kind kind nothing any friend of captain lindens i inquired after the drexlers at the steglitz local post office on sintenis platz a quiet peaceful square once covered in grass and now given over to the cultivation of things edible the postmistress a woman with an enormous ionic curl on either side of her head informed me crisply that her office knew of the drexlers and that like most people in the area they collected their mail from the office therefore she explained their precise address on handjery strasse was not known but she did add that the drexlers usually considerable mail was now even larger in view of the fact that it was several days since they had bothered to collect it she used the word bothered with more than a little distaste and i wondered if there was some reason she should have disliked the drexlers my offer to deliver their mail was swiftly rebuffed that would not have been proper but she told me that i could certainly remind them to come and take it away as it was becoming a nuisance next i decided to try at the schönberg police praesidium on nearby grünewald strasse walking there under the uneasy shadow of gorgonzola walls that leaned forwards as if permanently on tiptoe past buildings otherwise unscathed but with just a corner balustrade missing like an illicitly sampled wedding cake took me right by the gay island nightclub where becker had reportedly met captain linden it was a dreary cheerlesslooking place with a cheap neon sign and i felt almost glad that it was closed the bull on the desk at the police praesidium had a face as long as a mandarins thumbnail but he was an obliging sort of fellow and while he consulted the local registration records he told me that the drexlers were not unknown to the schönberg police theyre a jewish couple he explained lawyers quite well known around here you might even say that they were notorious oh whys that its not that they break any laws you understand the sergeants wurstsized finger found their name in his ledger and traversed the page to the street and the number here we are handjery strasse number seventeen thank you sergeant so what is it about them are you a friend of theirs he sounded circumspect no im not well sir its just that people dont like that kind of thing they want to forget about what happened i dont think theres any good in raking over the past like that forgive me sergeant but what is it that they do exactly they hunt socalled nazi warcriminals sir i nodded yes i can see how that might not make them very popular with the neighbours it was wrong what happened but we have to rebuild start again and we can hardly do that if the war follows us around like a bad smell i needed some more information from him so i agreed then i asked about the gay island its not the sort of place id let my missus catch me in sir its run by a sparkler called kathy fiege the place is full of them but theres never any trouble there apart from the occasional drunken yank not that you can call that trouble and if the rumours are true well all be yanks soon leastways all of us in the american sector eh i thanked him and walked to the station door one more thing sergeant i said turning on my heels the drexlers do they ever find any warcriminals the sergeants long face took on an amused sly aspect not if we can help it sir the drexlers lived a short way south from the police praesidium in a recently renovated building close to the sbahn line and opposite a small school but there was no reply when i knocked at the door of their topfloor apartment i lit a cigarette to rid my nostrils of the strong smell of disinfectant that hung about the landing and knocked again glancing down i saw two cigaretteends lying unaccountably uncollected on the floor close to the door it didnt look as if anyone had been through the door in a while bending down to pick them up i found the smell even stronger dropping into a pressup position i pushed my nose up to the gap between floor and door and retched as the air inside the apartment caught my throat and lungs i rolled quickly away and coughed half my insides on to the stairs below when i had recovered my breath i stood up and shook my head it seemed hardly possible that anyone could live in such an atmosphere i glanced down the stairwell there was nobody about i stepped back from the door and kicked hard at the lock with my better leg but it budged hardly at all once more i checked the stairwell to see if the noise had drawn anyone out of their apartment and finding myself undetected i kicked again the door sprang open and a terrible pestilent smell flew forth so strong that i reeled back for a moment and almost fell downstairs pulling my coat lapel across my nose and mouth i bounded into the darkened apartment and spying the faint outline of a curtain valance i tore the heavy velvet drapes aside and threw open the window cold air stripped the tears from my eyes as i leaned into the fresh air children on their way home from school waved to me and weakly i waved back at them when i was sure that the draught between the door and the window had ventilated the room i ducked inside to find whatever i would find i didnt think it was the kind of smell that was meant to take care of any pest smaller than a rogue elephant i went over to the front door and pushed it back and forwards on its hinges to fan some more clean air through while i surveyed the desk the chairs the bookcases the filing cabinets and the piles of books and papers that filled the little room beyond was an open door and the edge of a brass bedstead my foot kicked something on the floor as i moved towards the bedroom a cheap tin tray of the kind you find in a bar or a café but for the congestion in the two faces that lay side by side on their pillows you might have thought they were still sleeping if your name is on someones deathcard there are worse ways than asphyxia while asleep to collect it i pulled back the quilt and undid herr drexlers pyjama top revealing a wellswollen stomach marbled with veins and blebs like a piece of blue cheese i pressed it with my forefinger it felt tight sure enough a harder pressure with my hand produced a fart from the corpse indicating a gaseous disruption of the internal organs it appeared as if the pair of them had been dead for at least a week i drew the quilt over them again and returned to the front room for a while i stared hopelessly at the books and papers which lay on the desk even making a desultory attempt to find some clue or other but since i had as yet only the vaguest appreciation of the puzzle i soon abandoned this as a waste of time outside under a motherofpearlcoloured sky i was just starting up the street towards the sbahn when something caught my eye there was so much discarded military equipment still lying about berlin that but for the manner of the drexlers death i should have paid the thing no regard lying on a heap of rubble that had collected in the gutter was a gasmask an empty tin can rolled to my feet as i tugged at the rubber strap rapidly colouring in the outline scenario of the murder i abandoned the mask and squatted down on to the backs of my legs to read the label on the rusting metallic curve zyklonb poisonous gas danger keep cool and dry protect from the sun and from naked flame open and use with extreme caution kaliwerke a g kolin in my minds eye i pictured a man standing outside the drexlers door it was late at night nervously he halfsmoked a couple of cigarettes before pulling on the gasmask checking the straps to make sure he had a tight fit then he opened the can of crystallized prussic acid tipped the pellets already liquefying on contact with the air on to the tray he had brought with him and quickly slid it under the door into the drexlers apartment the sleeping couple breathed deeply lapsing into unconsciousness as the zyklonb gas first used on human beings in the concentration camps started to block the uptake of oxygen in their blood small chance that the drexlers would have left a window open in this weather but perhaps the murderer laid something a coat or a blanket across the bottom of the door to prevent a draught of fresh air into the apartment or to prevent anyone else in the building from being killed one part in two thousand of the gas was lethal finally after fifteen or twenty minutes when the pellets were fully dissolved and the murderer was satisfied that the gas had done its silent deadly work that two more jews had for whatever reason joined the six million he would have collected up his coat his mask and his empty can perhaps he hadnt meant to leave the tray not that it mattered he would surely have worn gloves to handle the zyklonb and walked into the night you could almost admire its simplicity somewhere further up the street a jeep grumbled off into the snowcharged blackness i wiped the condensation off the window with my sleeve and saw the reflection of a face that i recognized herr gunther he said as i turned in my seat i thought it was you a thin layer of snow covered the mans head with its squaredoff skull and prominent perfectly round ears it reminded me of an icebucket neumann i said i thought you were dead for sure he wiped his head and took off his coat mind if i join you my girl hasnt turned up yet when did you ever have a girl neumann at least one you hadnt already paid for he twitched nervously look if youre going to be relax i said sit down i waved to the waiter what will you have just a beer thanks he sat down and with narrowed eyes regarded me critically you havent changed much herr gunther olderlooking a bit greyer and rather thinner than you used to be but still the same i hate to think what id be like if you thought i looked any different i said pointedly but what you say sounds like a fairly accurate description of eight years is that how long its been since we last met give or take a world war you still listening at keyholes herr gunther you dont know the half of it he snorted im a prison warder at tegel i dont believe it you youre as bent as a stolen rockingchair honest herr gunther its true the yanks have got me guarding nazi warcriminals and youre the hardlabour right neumann twitched again here comes your beer the waiter laid the glass in front of him i started to speak but the americans at the next table burst into loud laughter then one of them a sergeant said something else and this time even neumann laughed he said that he doesnt believe in fraternization neumann explained he said he doesnt want to treat any fräulein the way hed treat his brother i smiled and looked over at the americans did you learn to speak english working in tegel sure i learn a lot of things you were always a good informer for instance he lowered his voice i heard that the soviets stopped a british military train at the border to take off two cars containing german passengers the word is that its in retaliation for the establishment of bizonia he meant the merging of the british and american zones of germany neumann drank some of his beer and shrugged maybe there will be another war i dont see how i said nobodys got much stomach for another dose of it i dunno maybe he set his glass down and produced a box of snuff which he offered to me i shook my head and grimaced as i watched him take a pinch and slide it under his lip did you see any action during the war come on neumann you should know better nobody asks a question like that these days do you hear me asking how you got a denazification certificate ill have you know that i got that quite legitimately he fished out his wallet and unfolded a piece of paper i was never involved in anything free from nazi infection this says and thats what i am and proud of it i didnt even join the army only because they wouldnt have you free from nazi infection he repeated angrily must be about the only infection you never had what are you doing here anyway he sneered back i love coming to the gay island ive never seen you here before and ive been coming here a while yes it looks like the kind of place youd feel comfortable in but how do you afford it on a warders pay neumann shrugged evasively you must do a lot of errands for people i suggested well you have to dont you he smiled thinly ill bet youre here on a case arent you maybe i might be able to help like i say i come here a lot all right then i took out my wallet and held up a fivedollar bill you ever hear of a man called eddy holl he comes in here sometimes hes in the advertising and publicity business a firm called reklaue werbe zentrale neumann swallowed and stared dismally at the bill no he said reluctantly i dont know him but i could ask around the barmans a friend he might i already tried him not the talkative type but from what he did say i dont think he knew holl this advertising mob what did you say they were called reklaue werbe zentrale theyre in wilmersdorfer strasse i was there this afternoon according to them herr eddy holl is at the offices of their parent company in pullach well maybe he is in pullach ive never even heard of it i cant imagine the headquarters of anything being in pullach well youd be wrong all right i said im ready to be surprised neumann smiled and nodded at the five dollars i was slipping back into my wallet for five dollars i could tell you everything i know about it no cold cabbage he nodded and i tossed him the bill this had better be good pullach is a small suburb of munich it is also the headquarters of the postal censorship authorities of the united states army the mail for all the gis at tegel has to go through there is that it what do you want the average rainfall all right im not sure what that tells me but thanks anyway maybe i can keep my eyes open for this eddy holl why not im off to vienna tomorrow when i get there ill telegraph you with the address where ill be staying in case you get something cash on delivery christ i wish i was going i love vienna you never struck me as the cosmopolitan type neumann i dont suppose you fancy delivering a few letters when youre there do you ive got quite a few austrians on my landing what play postman for nazi warcriminals no thanks i finished my drink and looked at my watch you think shes coming this girl of yours i stood up to leave what time is it he said frowning i showed him the face of the rolex on my wrist i had more or less decided not to sell it neumann winced as he saw the time i expect she got held up i said he shook his head sadly she wont come now women i gave him a cigarette these days the only woman you can trust is another mans wife its a rotten world herr gunther yeah well dont tell anyone will you on the train to vienna i met a man who talked about what we had done to the jews look he said they cant blame us for what happened it was preordained we were merely fulfilling their own old testament prophecy the one about joseph and his brothers there you have joseph a repressive fathers youngest and most favoured son and whom we can take to be symbolic of the whole jewish race and then you have all the other brothers symbolic of gentiles everywhere but lets assume they are germans who are quite naturally jealous of the little velvet boy hes better looking than they are he has a coat of many colours my god no wonder they hate him no wonder they sell him into slavery but the important point to note is that what the brothers do is as much a reaction against a stern and authoritarian father a fatherland if you like as it is against an apparently overprivileged brother the man shrugged and started to knead the lobe of one of his questionmark shaped ears thoughtfully really when you think about it they ought to thank us how do you work that out i said with considerable want of faith had it not been for what josephs brothers did the children of israel would never have been enslaved in egypt would never have been led to the promised land by moses similarly had it not been for what we germans did the jews would never have gone back to palestine why even now they are on the verge of establishing a new state the mans little eyes narrowed as if he had been one of the few allowed a peek in gods deskdiary oh yes he said it was a prophecy fulfilled all right i dont know about any prophecy i growled and jerked my thumb at the scene skimming by the carriage window an apparently endless red army troop convoy moving south along the autobahn parallel to the railway line but it certainly looks like we ended up in the red sea it was well named this infinite column of savage omnivorous red ants ravaging the land and gathering all that they could carry more than their individual body weights to take back to their semipermanent workerrun colonies and like some brazilian planter who had seen his coffee crop devastated by these social creatures my hatred of the russians was tempered by an equal measure of respect for seven long years i had fought them killed them been imprisoned by them learned their language and finally escaped from one of their labour camps seven thin ears of corn blasted with the east wind devouring the seven good ears at the outbreak of the war i had been a kriminalkommissar in section of the rsha the reich main security office and automatically ranked as a full lieutenant in the ss apart from the oath of loyalty to adolf hitler my being an ssobersturmführer had not seemed much of a problem until june when arthur nebe formerly the director of the reichs criminal police and newly promoted ssgruppenführer was given command of an action group as part of the invasion of russia i was just one of the various police personnel who were drafted to nebes group the aim of which so i believed was to follow the wehrmacht into occupied white russia and combat lawbreaking and terrorism of whatever description my own duties at the groups minsk headquarters had involved the seizure of the records of the russian nkvd and the capture of an nkvd deathsquad that had massacred hundreds of white russian political prisoners to prevent them from being liberated by the german army but mass murder is endemic in any war of conquest and it soon became apparent to me that my own side was also arbitrarily massacring russian prisoners then came the discovery that the primary purpose of the action groups was not the elimination of terrorists but the systematic murder of jewish civilians in all my four years service in the first great war i never saw anything which had a more devastating effect on my spirit than what i witnessed in the summer of although i was not personally charged with the task of commanding any of these massexecution squads i reasoned that it could only be a matter of time before i was so ordered and as an inevitable corollary before i was shot for refusing to obey so i requested an immediate transfer to the wehrmacht and the front line as the commanding general of the action group nebe could have had me sent to a punishment battalion he could even have ordered my execution instead he acceded to my request for a transfer and after several more weeks in white russia during which time i assisted general gehlens foreign armies east intelligence section with the organization of the captured nkvd records i was transferred not to the front line but to the war crimes bureau of the military high command in berlin by that time arthur nebe had personally supervised the murders of over men women and children after my return to berlin i never saw him again years later i met an old friend from kripo who told me that nebe always an ambiguous sort of nazi had been executed in early as one of the members of count stauffenbergs plot to kill hitler it always gave me a strange kind of feeling to know that i very possibly owed my life to a massmurderer to my great relief the man with the curious line in hermeneutics left the train at dresden and i slept between there and prague but most of the time i thought about kirsten and the abruptly worded note i had left her explaining that i would be away for several weeks and accounting for the presence of the gold sovereigns in the apartment which constituted half of my fee for taking beckers case and which poroshin had taken it upon himself to deliver the previous day i cursed myself for not writing more for failing to say that there was nothing i wouldnt have done for her no herculean labour i would not have gladly performed on her behalf all of this she knew of course made manifest as it was in the packet of extravagantly worded letters that she kept in her drawer next to her unmentioned bottle of chanel the journey between berlin and vienna is a long time to spend brooding about the infidelity of your wife so it was just as well that poroshins aide had got me a ticket on a train that took the most direct route nineteen and a half hours via dresden prague and brno as opposed to the twentysevenandahalfhour train which went via leipzig and nuremberg with a screech of wheels the train drew slowly to a halt in franz josefs bahnhof mantling the platforms few occupants in a steamy limbo at the ticket barrier i presented my papers to an american mp and having explained my presence in vienna to his satisfaction walked into the station dropped my bag and looked around for some sign that my arrival was both expected and welcomed by someone in the small crowd of waiting people the approach of a mediumsized greyhaired man signalled that i was correct in the first of these calculations although i was soon to be apprised of the vanity of the second he informed me that his name was dr liebl and that he had the honour of acting as emil beckers legal representative i have a taxi waiting he said glancing uncertainly at my luggage even so it isnt very far to my offices and had you brought a smaller bag we might have walked there i know it sounds pessimistic i said but i rather thought id have to stay overnight i followed him across the station floor i trust that you had a good journey herr gunther im here arent i i said forcing an affable sort of chuckle how else does one define a good journey these days i really couldnt say he said crisply myself i never leave vienna he waved his hand dismissively at a group of raggedlooking dps who seemed to have camped out in the station today with the whole world on some kind of journey it seems imprudent that i should expect god to look out for the kind of traveller who would only wish to be able to return from whence he started he ushered me to a waiting taxi and i handed my bag to the driver and climbed into the back seat only to find the bag come after me again theres an extra charge for luggage carried outside liebl explained pushing the bag on to my lap as i said its not very far and taxis are expensive while youre here i recommend that you use the tramways its a very good service the car moved away at speed the first corner pressing us together like a couple of lovers in a cinema theatre liebl chuckled its also a lot safer viennese drivers being what they are i pointed to our left is that the danube good god no thats the canal the danube is in the russian sector further east he pointed to our right at a grimlooking building thats the police prison where our client is currently residing we have an appointment there first thing tomorrow after which you may wish to attend captain lindens funeral at the central cemetery liebl nodded back at the prison herr becker is not long in there as it happens the americans were initially disposed to treat the case as a matter of military security and as a result they held him in their pow cage at the stiftskaserne the headquarters of their military police in vienna i had the very devil of a job getting in and out of there i can tell you however the military government public safety officer has now decided that the case is one for the austrian courts and so hell be held there until the trial whenever that may be liebl leaned forwards tapped the driver on the shoulder and told him to make a right and head towards the general hospital now that were paying for this we may as well drop your bag off he said its only a short detour at least youve seen where your friend is so you can appreciate the gravity of his situation i dont wish to be rude herr gunther but i should tell you that i was against you coming to vienna at all it isnt as if there arent any private detectives here there are ive used many of them myself and they know vienna better than you i hope you wont mind me saying that i mean you dont know this city at all do you i appreciate your frankness dr liebl i said not appreciating it much at all and youre right i dont know this city as a matter of fact ive never been here in my life so let me speak frankly with twentyfive years of police work behind me im not particularly disposed to give much of a damn what you think why becker should hire me instead of some local sniffer is his business the fact that hes prepared to pay me generously is mine theres nothing in between for you or anyone else not now when you get to court ill sit on your lap and comb your hair if you want me to but until then you read your lawbooks and ill worry about what youre going to say thatll get the stupid bastard off good enough liebl growled his mouth teetering on the edge of a smile veracity becomes you rather well like most lawyers i have a sneaking admiration for people who seem to believe what they say yes i have a high regard for the probity of others if only because we lawyers are so brimful of artifice i thought you spoke plainly enough a mere feint i assure you he said loftily we left my luggage at a comfortablelooking pension in the th bezirk in the american sector and drove on to liebls office in the inner city like berlin vienna was divided among the four powers with each of them controlling a separate sector the only difference was that viennas inner city surrounded by the wide open boulevard of grand hotels and palaces that was called the ring was under the control of all four powers at once in the shape of the international patrol another more immediately noticeable difference was in the austrian capitals state of repair it was true the city had been bombed about a bit but compared with berlin vienna looked tidier than an undertakers shop window when at last we were sitting in liebls office he found beckers files and ran through the facts of the case with me naturally the strongest piece of evidence against herr becker is his possession of the murder weapon liebl said handing me a couple of photographs of the gun which had killed captain linden walther p i said ss handgrip i used one myself in the last year of the war they rattle a bit but once the unusual trigger pull is mastered you can generally shoot them fairly accurately i never much cared for the external hammer though no i prefer the ppk myself i handed back the pictures do you have any of the pathologists snaps of the captain liebl passed me an envelope with evident distaste funny how they look when theyre all cleaned up again i said as i looked at the photographs you shoot a man in the face with a and he looks no worse than if hed had a mole removed goodlooking son of a bitch ill say that much for him did they find the bullet next picture i nodded as i found it not much to kill a man i thought the police also found several cartons of cigarettes at herr beckers home said liebl cigarettes of the same kind that were in the old studio where linden was shot i shrugged he likes to smoke i dont see what a few boxes of nails can pin on him no then let me explain these were cigarettes stolen from the tobacco factory on thaliastrasse which is quite near the studio whoever stole the cigarettes was using the studio to store them when becker first found captain lindens body he helped himself to a few cartons before he went home that sounds like becker all right i sighed he always did have long fingers well its the length of his neck that matters now i need not remind you that this is a capital case herr gunther you can remind me of it as often as you think fit herr doktor tell me who owned the studio drittemann filmund senderaum gmbh at least that was the name of the company on the lease but nobody seems to remember any films being made there when the police searched the place they didnt find so much as an old spotlight could i get a look inside ill see if i can arrange it now if you have any more questions herr gunther i suggest that you save them until tomorrow morning when we see herr becker meanwhile there are one or two arrangements that you and i must conclude such as the balance of your fee and your expenses please excuse me for a moment while i get your money from the safe he stood up and went out of the room liebls practice in judengasse was on the first floor of a shoemakers shop when he came back into his office carrying two bundles of banknotes he found me standing at the window two thousand five hundred american dollars in cash as agreed he said coolly and austrian schillings to cover your expenses any more will need to be authorized by fräulein braunsteiner shes herr beckers girlfriend the costs of your accommodation will be taken care of by this office he handed me a pen will you sign this receipt please i glanced over the writing and signed id like to meet her i said id like to meet all beckers friends my instructions are that she will contact you at your pension i pocketed the money and returned to the window i trust that if the police pick you up with all those dollars i may rely on your discretion there are currency regulations which ill leave your name out of it dont worry as a matter of interest whats to stop me taking the money and returning home you merely echo my own warning to herr becker in the first place he said that you were an honourable man and that if you were paid to do a job you would do it not the type to leave him to hang he was quite dogmatic about it im touched i said and in the second place can i be frank why stop now very well herr becker is one of the worst racketeers in vienna despite his present predicament he is not entirely without influence in certain shall we say more nefarious quarters of this city his face looked pained i should be reluctant to say any more at the risk of sounding like a common thug thats quite candid enough herr doktor thank you he came over to the windowwhat are you looking at i think im being followed do you see that man the man reading the newspaper im sure i saw him at the railway station liebl removed his spectacles from his top pocket and bent them round his furry old ears he doesnt look austrian he pronounced finally what paper is he reading i squinted for a moment the wiener kurier hmm not a communist anyway hes probably an american a field agent from the special investigation section of their military police wearing plainclothes i believe that they are no longer required to wear uniform at least in vienna he removed his glasses and turned away i dare say itll be something routine theyll want to know all about any friend of herr becker you should expect to be pulled in sometime for questioning thanks for the warning i started to move away from the window but found my hand lingered on the big shutter with its solidlooking cross bar they certainly knew how to build these old places didnt they this thing looks as if it was meant to keep out an army not an army herr gunther a mob this was once the heart of the ghetto in the fifteenth century when the house was built they had to be prepared for the occasional pogrom nothing changes so very much does it i sat down opposite him and smoked a memphis from the packet i had brought from poroshins supplies i waved the packet at liebl who took one and put it carefully into a cigarettecase he and i hadnt had the best of starts it was time to repair a few bridges keep the pack i told him youre very kind he said handing me an ashtray in return watching him light one now i wondered what genealogy of debauch had jaspered his once handsome face his grey cheeks were heavily wrinked with almost glacial striations and his nose was slightly puckered as if someone had told a sick joke his lips were very red and very thin and he smiled like a wily old snake which only served to enhance the look of dissipation that the years and most probably the war had etched on his features he himself provided an explanation i was in a concentration camp for a while before the war i was a member of the christian social party you know people prefer to forget but there was a very great feeling for hitler in austria he coughed a little as the first smoke filled his lungs it is very convenient for us that the allies decided that austria was a victim of nazi aggression instead of a collaborator with it but it is also absurd we are perfect bureaucrats herr gunther it is remarkable the number of austrians who came to occupy crucial roles in the organization of hitlers crimes and many of these same men and quite a few germans are living right here in vienna even now the security directorate for upper austria is investigating the theft of a number of identity cards from the vienna state printing office so you can see that for those who wish to stay here there is always a means of doing so the truth is that these men these nazis enjoy living in my country they have five hundred years of jewhatred to make them feel at home i mention these things because as a pifke he smiled apologetically as a prussian you may find that you encounter a certain amount of hostility in vienna these days austrians tend to reject everything german they work very hard at being austrian an accent like yours might serve to remind some viennese that for seven years they were national socialists an unpalatable fact that most people now prefer to believe was little more than a bad dream ill bear it in mind when i finished my meeting with liebl i went back to the pension in skodagasse where i found a message from beckers girlfriend to say that that she would drop by around six to make sure that i was comfortable the pension caspian was a firstclass little place i had a bedroom with a small adjoining sittingroom and bathroom there was even a tiny covered veranda where i might have sat in summer the place was warm and there seemed to be a neverending supply of hot water an unaccustomed luxury i had not long finished a bath the duration of which even marat might have baulked at when there was a knock at my sittingroom door and glancing at my wristwatch i saw that it was almost six i slipped into my overcoat and opened the door she was small and brighteyed with a childs rosy cheeks and dark hair that looked as if it rarely felt a comb her welltoothed smile straightened a little as she saw my bare feet herr gunther she said hesitantly fräulein traudl braunsteiner she nodded come in im afraid i spent rather longer in the bath than i should have but the last time i had really hot water was when i came back from the soviet labour camp have a seat while i throw on some clothes when i came back into the sittingroom i saw that she had brought a bottle of vodka and was pouring two glasses out on a table by the french window she handed me my drink and we sat down welcome to vienna she said emil said i should bring you a bottle she kicked the bag by her leg actually i brought two theyve been hanging out of the window of the hospital all day so the vodka is nice and cold i dont like vodka any other way we clinked glasses and drank the bottom of her glass beating my own to the tabletop youre not unwell i hope you mentioned a hospital im a nurse at the general you can see it if you walk to the top of the street thats partly why i booked you in here because its so near but also because i know the owner frau blumweiss she was a friend of my mothers also i thought youd prefer to stay close to the ring and to the place where the american captain was shot thats in dettergasse on the other side of viennas outer ring the gürtel this place suits me very nicely to be honest its a lot more comfortable than what im used to at home back in berlin things are quite hard there i poured us another drink exactly how much do you know about what happened i know everything that dr liebl has told you and everything that emil will tell you tomorrow morning what about emils business traudl braunsteiner smiled coyly and uttered a little snigger theres not much i dont know about emils business either noticing a button that was hanging by a thread from her crumpled raincoat she tugged it off and pocketed it she was like a fine lace handkerchief that was in need of laundering being a nurse i guess im a little relaxed about that sort of thing black market ive stolen a few drugs myself i dont mind admitting it actually all the girls do it at some time or another for some its a simple choice sell penicillin or sell your body i guess we are lucky enough to have something else to sell she shrugged and swallowed her second vodka seeing people suffering and dying doesnt breed a very healthy respect for law and order she laughed apologetically moneys no good if youre not fit to spend it god what are the krupp family worth billions probably but theyve got one of them at an insane asylum here in vienna its all right i said i wasnt asking you to justify it to me but plainly she was trying to justify it to herself traudl tucked her legs underneath her behind she sat carelessly in the armchair not seeming to mind any more than i did that i could see her stockingtops and garters and the edge of her smooth white thighs what can you do she said biting her fingernail now and again everyone in vienna has to buy something thats a bit ressel park she explained that this was the citys main centre for the black market its the brandenburg gate in berlin i said and in front of the reichstag how funny she chuckled mischievously there would be a scandal in vienna if that sort of thing went on outside our parliament thats because you have a parliament here the allies just supervise but they actually govern in germany my view of her underwear disappeared now as she tugged at the hem of her skirt i didnt know that not that it would matter there would still be a scandal in vienna parliament or no parliament austrians are such hypocrites you would think they would feel easier about these things theres been a black market here since the habsburgs it wasnt cigarettes then of course but favours patronage personal contacts still count for a lot speaking of which how did you meet becker he fixed some papers for a friend of mine a nurse at the hospital and we stole some penicillin for him that was when there was still some about this wasnt long after my mother died her bright eyes widened as if she was struggling to comprehend something she threw herself under a tram forcing a smile and a bemused sort of laugh she managed to contain her feelings my mother was a very viennese type of austrian bernie were always committing suicide you know its a way of life for us anyway emil was very kind and great fun he took me away from my grief really ive no other family you see my father was killed in an airraid and my brother died in yugoslavia fighting the partisans without emil i really dont know what might have become of me if something were to happen to him now traudls mouth stiffened as she pictured the fate that seemed most likely to befall her lover you will do your best for him wont you emil said you were the only person he could trust to find something that might give him half a chance ill do everything i can for him traudl you have my word on that i lit us both a cigarette and handed one to her it may interest you to know that normally id convict my own mother if she were standing over a dead body with a gun in her hand but for what its worth i believe beckers story if only because its so plausibly bad at least until ive heard it from him that may not surprise you very much but it sure as hell impresses me only look at my fingertips theyre a little short on saintly aura and the hat on the sideboard there it wasnt meant for stalking deer so if im to guide him out of that condemned cell your boyfriend is going to have to find me a ball of thread tomorrow morning hed better have something to say for himself or this show wont be worth the price of the greasepaint the laws most terrible punishment is always what happens in a mans own imagination the prospect of ones own judicially executed killing is food for thought of the most ingeniously masochistic kind to put a man on trial for his life is to oil his mind with thoughts crueller than any punishment yet devised and naturally enough the idea of what it must be like to drop metres through a trapdoor to be brought up short of the ground by a length of rope tied round the neck takes its toll on a man he finds it hard to sleep loses his appetite and not uncommonly his heart starts to suffer under the strain of what his own mind has imposed even the most dull unimaginative intellect need only roll his head around on his shoulders and listen to the crunching gristle sound of his vertebrae in order to appreciate in the pit of his stomach the ghastly horror of hanging so i was not surprised to find becker a thinner etiolated sketch of his former self we met in a small barely furnished interview room at the prison on rossauer lande when he came into the room he silently shook me by the hand before turning to address the warder who had stationed himself against the door hey pepi becker said jovially do you mind he reached inside his shirt pocket and retrieved a packet of cigarettes which he tossed across the room the warder called pepi caught them with the tips of his fingers and inspected the brand have a smoke outside the door ok all right said pepi and left becker nodded appreciatively as the three of us seated ourselves round the table bolted to the yellowtiled wall dont worry he said to dr liebl all the warders are at it in here much better than the stiftskaserne i can tell you none of those fucking yanks could be greased theres nothing those bastards want that they cant get for themselves youre telling me i said and found my own cigarettes liebl shook his head when i offered him one these come from your friend poroshin i explained as becker slipped one out of the pack quite a fellow isnt he your wife thinks hes your boss becker lit us both and blew a cloud of smoke across my shoulder you spoke to ella he said but he didnt sound surprised apart from the five thousand shes the only reason im here i said with her on your case i decided you probably needed all the help you could get as far as shes concerned youre already swinging hates me that bad eh like a cold sore well shes got the right i guess he sighed and shook his head then he took a long nervous drag of his cigarette that barely left the paper on the tobacco for a moment he stared at me his bloodshot eyes blinking hard through the smoke after several seconds he coughed and smiled all at once go ahead and ask me all right did you kill captain linden as god is my witness no he laughed can i go now sir he took another desperate suck at his smoke you do believe me dont you bernie i believe youd have a better story if you were lying i credit you with that much sense but as i was saying to your girlfriend youve met traudl good shes great isnt she yes she is christ only knows what she sees in you she enjoys my afterdinner conversation of course thats why she doesnt like to see me locked up in here she misses our little fireside chats about wittgenstein the smile disappeared as his hand reached across the table and clutched at my forearm look youve got to get me out of here bernie the five thousand was just to get you in the game you prove that im innocent and ill treble your fee we both know that it isnt going to be easy becker misunderstood moneys not a problem ive got plenty of money theres a car parked in a garage in hernals with in the boot its yours if you get me off liebl winced as his client continued to demonstrate his apparent lack of business acumen really herr becker as your lawyer i must protest this is not the way to shut up becker said savagely when i want your advice ill ask for it liebl gave a diplomatic sort of shrug and leaned back on his chair look i said lets talk about a bonus when youre out the moneys fine youve already paid me well i wasnt talking about the money no what id like now are a few ideas so how about you start by telling me about herr könig where you met him what he looks like and whether you think he likes cream in his coffee ok becker nodded and ground his cigarette out on the floor he clasped and unclasped his hands and started to squeeze his knuckles uncomfortably probably he had been over the story too many times to feel happy about repeating it all right well then lets see i met helmut könig in the koralle thats a nightclub in the th bezirk porzellangasse he just came up and introduced himself said hed heard of me and wanted to buy me a drink so i let him we talked about the usual things the war me being in russia me being in kripo before the ss same as you really only you left didnt you bernie just keep to the point he said hed heard of me from friends he didnt say who there was some business hed like to put my way a regular delivery across the green frontier cash money no questions asked it was easy all i had to do was collect a small parcel from an office here in vienna and take it to another office in berlin but only when i was going anyway with a lorry load of cigarettes that kind of thing if id been picked up they probably wouldnt even have noticed königs parcel at first i thought it was drugs but then i opened one of the parcels it was just a few files party files army files ss files the old stuff i couldnt see what made it worth money to them was it always just files he nodded captain linden worked for the us documents centre in berlin i explained he was a nazihunter these files do you remember any names bernie they were tadpoles small fry ss corporals and army payclerks any nazihunter would just have thrown them back those fellows are after the big fish people like bormann and eichmann not fucking little payclerks nevertheless the files were important to linden whoever it was that killed him also arranged to have a couple of amateur detectives he knew murdered two jews who had survived the camps and were out to settle a few scores i found them dead a few days ago theyd been that way a while perhaps the files were for them so it would help if you could try and remember some of the names sure anything you say bernie ill try to fit it into my busy schedule you do that now tell me about könig what did he look like lets see he was about forty id say wellbuilt dark thick moustache weighed about ninety kilos oneninety tall wore a good tweed suit smoked cigars and always had a dog with him a little terrier he was austrian for sure sometimes he had a girl around her name was lotte i dont know her surname but she worked at the casanova club goodlooking bitch blonde thats all i remember you said that you talked about the war didnt he tell you how many medals he won yes he did then dont you think you should tell me i didnt think it was relevant ill decide whats relevant come on unpack it becker he stared at the wall and then shrugged as far as i remember he said he had joined the austrian nazi party when it was still illegal in later he got himself arrested for putting up posters so he escaped to germany to avoid arrest and joined the bavarian police in munich he joined the ss in and stayed in until the end of the war any rank he didnt say did he give you any indication of where he served and in what sort of capacity becker shook his head not much of a conversation you two had what were you reminiscing about the price of bread all right what about the second man the one who came to your home with könig and asked you to look for linden becker squeezed his temples ive tried to remember his name but it just wont come he said he was a bit more of the senior officer type you know very stiff and proper an aristocrat maybe again he was aged about forty tall thin cleanshaven balding wore a schiller jacket and a clubtie he shook his head im not very good on clubties it could have been herrenklub i dont know and the man you saw come out of the studio where linden was killed what did he look like he was too far away for me to see much except that he was quite short and very stocky he wore a dark hat and coat and he was in a hurry ill bet he was i said the publicity firm reklaue werbe zentrale its on mariahilferstrasse isnt it was becker said gloomily it closed not long after i was arrested tell me about it anyway was it always könig you saw there no it was usually a fellow called abs max abs he was an academiclooking type chinbeard little glasses you know becker helped himself to another of my cigarettes there was one thing i was meaning to tell you one time i was there i heard abs take a telephone call from a stonemason called pichler maybe he had a funeral i thought that maybe you could find pichler and find out about abs when you go to lindens funeral this morning at twelve oclock liebl said i thought that it might be worth a look bernie becker explained youre the client i said see if any of lindens friends show up and then see pichler most of viennas stonemasons are along the wall of the central cemetery so it shouldnt be all that difficult to find him maybe you can discover if max abs left an address when he ordered his piece of stone i didnt much care for having becker describe my mornings work for me like this but it seemed easier to humour him a man facing a possible death sentence can demand certain indulgences of his private investigator especially when theres cash up front so i said why not i love a good funeral then i stood up and walked about his cell a bit as if i were the one who was nervous about being caged in maybe he was just more used to it than me theres one thing still puzzling me here i said after a minutes thoughtful pacing whats that dr liebl told me that youre not without friends and influence in this city up to a point well how is it that none of your socalled friends tried to find könig or for that matter his girlfriend lotte whos saying they didnt are you going to keep it to yourself or do i have to give you a couple of bars of chocolate beckers tone turned placatory now its not certain what happened here bernie so i dont want you getting the wrong idea about this job theres no reason to suppose that cut the cold cabbage and just tell me what happened all right a couple of my associates fellows who knew what they were doing asked around about könig and the girl they checked a few of the nightclubs and he winced uncomfortably they havent been seen since maybe they doublecrossed me maybe they just left town or maybe they got the same as linden i suggested who knows but thats why youre here bernie i can trust you i know the kind of fellow you are i respect what you did back in minsk really i did youre not the kind to let an innocent man hang he smiled meaningfully i cant believe im the only one whos had a use for a man of your qualifications i do all right i said quickly not caring much for flattery least of all from clients like emil becker you know you probably deserve to hang i added even if you didnt kill linden there must have been plenty of others but i just didnt see it coming not until it was too late not like you you were clever and got out while you still had a choice i never had that chance it was obey orders or face a court martial and a firing squad i didnt have the courage to do anything other than what i did i shook my head i really didnt care any more perhaps youre right you know i am we were at war bernie he finished his cigarette and stood up to face me in the corner where i was leaning he lowered his voice as if he meant liebl not to hear look he said i know this is a dangerous job but only you can do it it needs to be done quietly and privately the way you do it best do you need a lighter i had left the gun id taken off the dead russian in berlin having had no wish to risk arrest for crossing a border with a pistol i doubted that poroshins cigarette pass could have sorted that out so i shrugged and said you tell me this is your city id say youll need one all right i said but for christs sake make it a clean one when we were outside the prison again liebl smiled sarcastically and said is a lighter what i think it is yes but its just a precaution the best precaution you can take while youre in vienna is to stay out of the russian sector especially late at night i followed liebls gaze across the road and beyond to the other side of the canal where a red flag fluttered in the early morning breeze there are a number of kidnapping gangs working for the ivans in vienna he explained they snatch anyone they think might be spying for the americans and in return theyre given blackmarket concessions to operate out of the russian sector which effectively puts them beyond the reach of the law they took one woman out of her own house rolled up in a carpet just like cleopatra well ill be careful not to fall asleep on the floor i said now how do i get to the central cemetery its in the british sector you need to take a from schwarzenbergplatz only your map calls it stalinplatz you cant miss it theres an enormous statue to the soviet soldier as liberator that we viennese call the unknown plunderer i smiled like i always say herr doktor we can survive defeat but heaven help us from another liberation the city of the other viennese was how traudl braunsteiner had described it this was no exaggeration the central cemetery was bigger than several towns of my acquaintance and quite a bit more affluent too there was no more chance of the average austrian doing without a headstone than there was of him staying out of his favourite coffee house it seemed there was nobody who was too poor for a decent piece of marble and for the first time i began to appreciate the attractions of the undertaking business a piano keyboard an inspired muse the introductory bars of a famous waltz there was nothing too ornate for viennas craftsmen no flatulent fable or overstated allegory that was beyond the dead hand of their art the huge necropolis even mirrored the religious and political divisions of its living counterpart with its jewish protestant and catholic sections not to mention those of the four powers there was quite a turnover of services at the firstwonderoftheworldsized chapel where lindens obsequies were heard and i found that i had missed the captains mourners there by only a few minutes the little cortege wasnt difficult to spot as it drove slowly across the snowbound park to the french sector where linden a catholic was to be buried but for one on foot as i was it was rather more difficult to catch up by the time i did the expensive casket was already being lowered slowly into the darkbrown trench like a dinghy let down into a dirty harbour the linden family arms interlinked in the manner of a squad of riotpolice faced its grief as indomitably as if there had been medals to be won the colour party raised their rifles and took aim at the floating snow it gave me an uncomfortable feeling as they fired and for just a moment i was back in minsk when on a walk to staff headquarters i had been summoned by the sound of gunshots climbing up an embankment i had seen six men and women kneeling at the edge of a mass grave already filled with innumerable bodies some of whom were still alive and behind them an ss firing squad commanded by a young police officer his name was emil becker are you a friend of his said a man an american appearing behind me no i said i came over because you dont expect to hear gunfire in a place like this i couldnt tell if the american had been at the funeral already or if he had followed me from the chapel he didnt look like the man who had been standing outside liebls office i pointed at the grave tell me whos the a fellow called linden it is difficult for someone who does not speak german as a first language so i might have been mistaken but there seemed to be no trace of emotion in the americans voice when i had seen enough and having ascertained that there was nobody even vaguely resembling könig among the mourners not that i really expected to see him there i walked quietly away to my surprise i found the american walking alongside me cremation is so much kinder to the thoughts of the living he said it consumes all sorts of hideous imaginings for me the putrefaction of a loved one is quite unthinkable it remains in the thoughts with the persistence of a tapeworm death is quite bad enough without letting the maggots make a meal of it i should know ive buried both parents and a sister but these people are catholics they dont want anything to jeopardize their chances of bodily resurrection as if god is going to bother with he waved his arm at the whole cemetery all this are you a catholic herr sometimes i said when im hurrying to catch a train or trying to sober up linden used to pray to st anthony said the american i believe hes the patron saint of lost things was he trying to be cryptic i wondered never use him myself i said he followed me on to the road that led back to the chapel it was a long avenue of severely pruned trees on which the gobbets of snow sitting on the sconcelike ends of the branches resembled the stumps of melted candles from some outsized requiem pointing at one of the parked cars a mercedes he said like a lift to town ive got a car here it was true that i wasnt much of a catholic killing men even russians wasnt the kind of sin that was easy to explain to ones maker all the same i didnt have to consult st michael the patron saint of policemen to smell an mp you can drop me at the main gate if you like i heard myself reply sure hop in he paid the funeral and the mourners no more attention after all he had me a new face to interest him now perhaps i was someone who might shed some light on a dark corner of the whole affair i wondered what he would have said if he could have known that my intentions were the same as his own and that it was in the vague hope of just such an encounter that i had allowed myself to be persuaded to come to lindens funeral in the first place the american drove slowly as if he were part of the cortège no doubt hoping to spin out his chance to discover who i was and why i was there my name is shields he volunteered roy shields bernhard gunther i answered seeing no reason to tease him with it are you from vienna not originally where originally germany no i didnt think you were austrian your friend herr linden i said changing the subject did you know him well the american laughed and found some cigarettes in the top pocket of his sports jacket linden i didnt know him at all he pulled one clear with his lips and then handed me the packet he got himself murdered a few weeks back and my chief thought it would be a good idea if i were to represent our department at the funeral and what department is that i asked although i was almost certain i already knew the answer the international patrol lighting his cigarette he mimicked the style of the american radio broadcasters for your protection call a then he handed me a book of matches from somewhere called the zebra club waste of valuable time if you ask me coming all the way down here like this its not that far i told him and then perhaps your chief was hoping that the murderer would put in an appearance hell i should hope not he laughed weve got that guy in gaol no the chief captain clark is the kind of fellow who likes to observe the proper protocols shields turned the car south towards the chapel christ he muttered this place is like a goddamned gridiron you know gunther that road we just turned off is almost a kilometre as straight as an arrow i caught sight of you when you were still a couple of hundred metres short of lindens funeral and it looked to me like you were in a hurry to join us he grinned to himself it seemed am i right my father is buried only a short way from lindens grave when i got there and saw the colour party i decided to come back a little later when its quieter you walked all that way and you didnt bring a wreath did you bring one sure did cost me fifty schillings cost you or cost your department i guess we did pass a hat round at that and you need to ask me why i didnt bring a wreath come on gunther shields laughed there isnt one of you people who isnt involved in some kind of a racket youre all exchanging schillings for dollar scrip or selling cigarettes on the black market you know i sometimes think that the austrians are making more from breaking the rules than we are thats because youre a policeman we passed through the main gate on simmeringer hauptstrasse and drew up in front of the tram stop where several men were already clinging to the outside of the packed tram car like a litter of hungry piglets on a sows belly are you sure you dont want that lift into town said shields no thanks i have some business with some of the stonemasons well its your funeral he said with a grin and sped away i walked along the high wall of the cemetery where it seemed that most of viennas market gardeners and stonemasons had their premises and found a pathetic old woman standing in my way she held up a penny candle and asked me if i had a light here i said and gave her shields book of matches when she made as if to take only one i told her to keep the whole book i cant afford to pay you for it she said with real apology just as surely as you know that a man waiting for a train will look at his watch i knew that i would be seeing shields again but i wished him back right then and there so that i could have shown him one austrian who didnt have the price of a match let alone a fiftyschilling wreath herr josef pichler was a fairly typical austrian shorter and thinner than the average german with pale softlooking skin and a sparse immature sort of moustache the hangdog expression on his drawnout muzzle of a face gave him the appearance of one who had consumed too much of the absurdly young wine that austrians apparently consider drinkable i met him standing in his yard comparing the sketchplan of a stones inscription with its final execution gods greeting to you he said sullenly i replied in kind are you herr pichler the celebrated sculptor i asked traudl had advised me that the viennese have a passion for overblown titles and flattery i am he said with a slight swell of pride does the gallant gentleman wish to consider ordering a piece he spoke as if he had been the curator of an artgallery on dorotheergasse a fine headstone perhaps he indicated a large slice of polished black marble on which names and a date had been inscribed and painted in gold something marmoreal a carved figure a statue perhaps to be honest i am not entirely sure herr pichler i believe you recently created a fine piece for a friend of mine dr max abs he was so delighted with it that i wondered if i might have something similar yes i think i remember the herr doktor pichler took off his little chocolate cake of a hat and scratched the top of his grey head but the particular design escapes me for the moment do you remember what kind of piece it was he had only that he was delighted with it im afraid no matter perhaps the honourable gentleman would care to return tomorrow by which time i should have been able to find the herr doktors specifications permit me to explain he showed me the sketch in his hand one for a deceased whose inscription described him as an engineer of urban conduits and conservancy take this customer he said warming to the theme of his own business i have a design with his name and order number here when this piece is completed the drawing will be filed away according to the nature of the piece from then on i must consult my sales book to find the name of the customer but right now im in something of a hurry to complete this piece and really he patted his stomach im dead today he shrugged apologetically last night you understand im short of staff too i thanked him and left him to his engineer of urban conduits and conservancy that was presumably what you called yourself if you were one of the citys plumbers what sort of title i wondered did the private investigators give themselves balanced on the outside of the tram car back to town i kept my mind off my precarious position by constructing a number of elegant titles for my rather vulgar profession practitioner of solitary masculine lifestyle nonmetaphysical inquiry agent interrogative intermediary to the perplexed and anxious confidential solicitor for the displaced and the misplaced bespoke grailfinder seeker after truth i liked the last one best of all but at least as far as my client in the particular case before me was concerned there was nothing which seemed properly to reflect the sense of working for a lost cause that might have deterred even the most dogmatic flat earther according to all the guidebooks the viennese love dancing almost as passionately as they love music but then the books were all written before the war and i didnt think that their authors could ever have spent a whole evening at the casanova club in dorotheergasse there the band was led in a way that put you in mind of the most ignominious retreat and the shitkicking that passed for something approximately terpsichorean looked as if it might have been performed more in imitation of a polar bear kept in a very small cage for passion you had to look to the sight of the ice yielding noisily to the spirit in your glass after an hour in the casanova i was feeling as sour as a eunuch in a bathful of virgins counselling myself to be patient i leaned back into my red velvetandsatin booth and stared unhappily at the tentlike drapes on the ceiling the last thing to do unless i wanted to end up like beckers two friends whatever he said i hadnt much doubt that they were dead was to bounce around the place asking the regulars if they knew helmut könig or maybe his girlfriend lotte on its ridiculously plush surface the casanova didnt look like the kind of place which a fearful angel might have preferred to avoid there were no extralarge tuxedoes at the door nor anyone about who looked as if he could be carrying anything more lethal than a silver toothpick and the waiters were all commendably obsequious if könig no longer frequented the casanova it wasnt because he was afraid of having his pocket fingered has it started turning yet she was a tall striking girl with the sort of exaggeratedly made body that might have adorned a sixteenthcentury italian fresco all breasts belly and backside the ceiling she explained jerking her cigaretteholder vertically not yet anyway then you can buy me a drink she said and sat down beside me i was starting to worry you wouldnt show up i know im the kind of girl youve been dreaming about well here i am now i waved to the waiter and let her order herself a whisky and soda im not one for dreaming much i told her well thats a pity isnt it she shrugged what do you dream about listen she said shaking her head of long shiny brown hair this is vienna it doesnt do to describe your dreams to anyone here you never know you might just be told what they really mean and then where would you be that sounds almost as if you have something to hide i dont see you wearing sandwich boards most people have something to hide especially these days whats in their heads most of all well a name ought to be easy enough mines bernie short for bernhard like the dog that rescues mountaineers more or less whether or not i do any rescuing depends on how much brandy im carrying im not as loyal when im loaded i never met a man who was she jerked her head down at my cigarette can you spare me one of those i handed her a pack and watched as she screwed one into her holder you didnt tell me your name i said thumbnailing a match alight for her veronika veronika zartl pleased to meet you im sure i dont think ive ever seen your face in here where are you from you sound like a pifke berlin i thought so anything wrong with that not if you like pifkes most austrians dont as it happens she spoke in the slow almost yokelish drawl that seemed typical of the modern viennese but i dont mind them i get mistaken for a pifke myself sometimes thats because i wont speak like the rest of them she chuckled its so funny when you hear some lawyer or dentist speaking like he was a tramdriver or a miner just so as he doesnt get mistaken for a german mostly they only do it in shops to make sure that they get the good service that all austrians think that they are entitled to you want to try it yourself bernie and see the difference it makes to the way youre treated viennese is quite easy you know just speak like youre chewing something and add ish onto the end of everything you say cleverish eh the waiter returned with her drink which she regarded with some disapproval no ice she muttered as i tossed a banknote on to the silver tray and left the change under veronikas questioning eyebrow with a tip like that you must be planning on coming back here you dont miss much do you are you planning on coming back here i mean it could be that i am but is it always like this the trade heres about as busy as an empty fireplace just wait until it gets crowded and then youll wish it was like this again she sipped her drink and leaned back on the redvelvetandgilt chair stroking the buttonback satin upholstery that covered the wall of our booth with the palm of her outstretched hand you should be grateful for the quiet she told me it gives us a chance to get to know each other just like those two she waved her holder meaningfully at a couple of girls who were dancing with each other with their gaudy outfits tight buns and flashing paste necklaces they looked like a pair of circus horses catching veronikas eye they smiled and then whinnied a little confidence to each other at a coiffures distance i watched them turn in elegant little circles friends of yours not exactly are they together she shrugged only if you made it worth their while she laughed some smoke out of her pert little nose theyre just giving their highheels some exercise thats all whos the taller one ibolya thats hungarian for a violet and the blonde thats mitzi veronika was bristling a little as she named the other girl maybe youd prefer to talk to them she took out her powdercompact and scrutinized her lipstick in the tiny mirror im expected soon anyway my mother will be getting worried theres no need to play the little red riding hood with me i told her we both know that your mother doesnt mind if you leave the path and walk through the woods and as for those two sparklers over there a man can look in the window cant he sure but theres no need to press your nose up against it not when youre with me anyway it seems to me veronika i said that you wouldnt have to try very hard to sound like someones wife frankly its the sort of sound that drives a man to a place like this in the first place i smiled just to let her know i was still friendly and then along you come with the rollingpin in your voice well it could put a man right back to where he was when he walked through the door she smiled back at me i guess youre right at that she said you know it strikes me that youre new at this chocolady thing christ she said her smile turning bitter isnt everyone but for the fact that i was tired i might have stayed longer at the casanova might even have gone home with veronika instead i gave her a packet of cigarettes for her company and told her that i would be back the following evening on the town late at night was not the best time to compare vienna to any metropolis with the possible exception of the lost city of atlantis i had seen a motheaten umbrella stay open for longer than vienna veronika had explained over several more drinks that austrians preferred to spend their evenings at home but that when they did choose to make a night of it they traditionally made an early start as early as six or seven oclock which left me trailing back to the pension caspian along an empty street at only with just my shadow and the sound of my halfintoxicated footsteps for company after the combusted atmosphere of berlin viennas air tasted as pure as birdsong but the night was a cold one and shivering inside my overcoat i quickened my step disliking the quiet and remembering dr liebls warning about the soviet predilection for nocturnal kidnappings at the same time however crossing heldenplatz in the direction of the volksgarten and beyond the ring josefstadt and home it was easy to find ones thoughts turning to the ivans as far away from the soviet sector as i was there was still ample evidence of their omnipresence the imperial palace of the habsburgs was one of the many public buildings in the internationally run city centre that was occupied by the red army over the main door was a colossal red star in the centre of which was a picture of stalin in profile set against a significantly dimmer one of lenin it was as i passed the ruined kunsthistorische that i felt there was someone behind me someone hanging back between the shadows and the piles of rubble i stopped in my tracks looked around and saw nothing then about thirty metres away next to a statue of which only the torso remained like something i had once seen in a mortuary drawer i heard a noise and a moment later saw some small stones roll down a high bank of rubble are you feeling a bit lonely i called out having drunk just enough not to feel stupid asking such a ridiculous question my voice echoed up the side of the ruined museum if its the museum youre interested in were closed bombs you know dreadful things there was no reply and i found myself laughing if youre a spy youre in luck thats the new profession to be in especially if youre a viennese you dont have to take my word for it one of the ivans told me still laughing to myself i turned and walked away i didnt bother to see if i was followed but crossing onto mariahilferstrasse i heard footsteps again as i paused to light a cigarette as anyone who knows vienna could have told you this wasnt exactly the most direct route back to skodagasse i even told myself but there was a part of me probably the part most affected by alcohol that wanted to find out exactly who was following me and why the american sentry who stood out in front of the stiftskaserne was having a cold time of it he watched me carefully as i passed by on the other side of the empty street and i reflected that he might even recognize the man on my tail as a fellow american and member of the special investigations section of his own military police probably they were in the same baseball team or whatever game it was that american soldiers played when they werent eating or chasing women further up the slope of the wide street i glanced to my left and through a doorway saw a narrow covered passage that seemed to lead down several flights of steps to an adjoining street instinctively i ducked inside vienna might not have been blessed with a fabulous nightlife but it was perfect for anyone on foot a man who knew his way around the streets and the ruins who could remember these convenient passages would i thought provide even the most determined police cordon with a better chase than jean valjean ahead of me beyond my sight someone else was making his way down the steps and thinking that my tail might take these for my own footsteps i pressed myself against a wall and waited for him in the dark after less than a minute i heard the approaching sound of a man running lightly then the footsteps halted at the top of the passageway as he stood trying to judge whether or not it was safe to come after me hearing the other mans footsteps he started forward i stepped out of the shadows and punched him hard in the stomach so hard i thought i would have to bend down and retrieve my knuckles and while he lay gasping on the steps where he had fallen i tugged his coat off his shoulders and pulled it down to hold his arms he wasnt carrying a gun so i helped myself to the wallet in his breast pocket and picked out an id card captain john belinsky i read united states cic whats that are you one of mr shieldss friends the man sat up slowly fuck you kraut he said biliously have you orders to follow me i tossed the card on to his lap and searched the other compartments of his wallet because youd better ask for another assignment johnny youre not very good at this sort of thing ive seen less conspicuous striptease dancers than you there wasnt much of interest in his wallet some dollar scrip a few austrian schillings a ticket for the yank movie theatre some stamps a room card from sachers hotel and a photograph of a pretty girl have you finished with that he said in german i tossed him the wallet thats a nicelooking girl you have there johnny i said did you follow her as well maybe i should give you my snapshot write my address on the back make it easier for you fuck you kraut johnny i said starting back up the steps to mariahilferstrasse ill bet you say that to all the girls pichler lay under a massive piece of stone like some primitive car mechanic repairing a neolithic stoneaxle with the tools of his trade a hammer and a chisel held tight in his dusty bloodstained hands it was almost as if while carving the black rocks inscription he had paused for a moment to draw breath and decipher the words that seemed to emerge vertically from his chest but no mason ever worked in such a position at right angles to his legend and draw breath he never would again for although the human chest is sufficiently strong a cage for those soft mobile pets that are the heart and lungs it is easily crushed by something as heavy as half a tonne of polished marble it looked like an accident but there was one way to be sure leaving pichler in the yard where i had found him i went into the office i retained very little memory of the dead mans description of his businessaccounting system to me the niceties of doubleentry bookkeeping are about as useful as a pair of brogue galoshes but as someone who ran a business himself albeit a small one i had a rudimentary knowledge of the petty fastidious way in which the details of one ledger are supposed to correspond with those in another and it didnt take william randolph hearst to see that pilchers books had been altered not by any subtle accounting but by the simple expedient of tearing out a couple of pages there was only one financial analysis that was worth a spit and that was that pichlers death had been anything but accidental wondering whether his murderer had thought to steal the sketchdesign for dr max abs headstone as well as the relevant pages from the ledgers i went back into the yard to see if i might be able to find it i had a good look round and after a few minutes discovered a number of dusty artfiles propped up against a wall in the workshop at the back of the yard i untied the first file and started to sort through the draughtsmans drawings working quickly since i had no wish to be found searching the premises of a man who lay crushed to death less than ten metres away and when at last i found the drawing i was looking for i gave it no more than a cursory glance before folding it up and slipping it into my coat pocket i caught a back to town and went to the café schwarzenberg close to the tram terminus on the kärtner ring i ordered a mélange and then spread the drawing out on the table in front of me it was about the size of a doublepage spread in a newspaper with the customers name max abs clearly marked on an order copy stapled to the top righthand corner of the paper the markup for the inscription read sacred to the memory of martin albers born martyred april beloved of wife leni and sons manfred and rolf behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed i corinthians on max abs order was written his address but beyond the fact that the doctor had paid for a headstone in the name of a man who was dead a brotherinlaw perhaps and which had now occasioned the murder of the man who had carved it i could not see that i had learned very much the waiter wearing his grey frizzy hair on the back of his balding head like a halo returning with the small tin tray that carried my mélange and the glass of water customarily served with coffee in viennese cafés he glanced down at the drawing before i folded it away to make room for the tray and said with a sympathetic sort of smile blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted i thanked him for his kind thought and tipping him generously asked him first from where i might send a telegram and then where berggasse was the central telegraph office is on börseplatz he answered on the schottenring youll find berggasse just a couple of blocks north of there an hour or so later after sending my telegrams to kirsten and to neumann i walked up to berggasse which ran between the police prison where becker was locked up and the hospital where his girlfriend worked this coincidence was more remarkable than the street itself which seemed largely to be occupied by doctors and dentists nor did i think it particularly remarkable to discover from the old woman who owned the building in which abs had occupied the mezzanine floor that only a few hours earlier he had told her he was leaving vienna for good he said his job urgently required him to go to munich she explained in the kind of tone that left me feeling she was still a bit puzzled by this sudden departure or at least somewhere near munich he mentioned the name but im afraid that ive forgotten it it wasnt pullach was it she tried to look thoughtful but only succeeded in looking badtempered i dont know if it was or if it wasnt she said finally the cloud lifted from her face as she returned to her normal bovine expression anyway he said he would let me know where he was when he got himself settled did he take all his things with him there wasnt much to take she said just a couple of suitcases the apartment is furnished you see she frowned again are you a policeman or something no i was wondering about his rooms well why didnt you say come in herr its professor actually i said with what i thought sounded like a typically viennese punctiliousness professor kurtz there was also the possibility that by giving myself the academic handle i might appeal to the snob in the woman dr abs and myself are mutually acquainted with a herr könig who told me that he thought the herr doktor might be about to vacate some excellent rooms at this address i followed the old woman through the door and into the big hallway which led to a tall glass door beyond the open door lay a courtyard with a solitary plane tree growing there we turned up the wroughtiron staircase i trust you will forgive my discretion i said only i wasnt sure how much credence to place on my friends information he was most insistent that they were excellent rooms and im sure i dont have to tell you madam how difficult it can be for a gentleman to find an apartment of any quality in vienna these days perhaps you know herr könig no she said firmly i dont think i ever met any of dr abs friends he was a very quiet man but your friend is well informed you wont find a better set of rooms for schillings a month this is a very good neighbourhood at the door to the apartment she lowered her voice and entirely jewfree she produced a key from the pocket of her jacket and slipped it into the keyhole of the great mahogany door of course we had a few of them here before the anschluss even in this house but by the time the war came most of them had gone away she opened the door and showed me into the apartment here we are she said proudly there are six rooms in total its not as big as some of the apartments in the street but then not as expensive either fully furnished as i think i said lovely i said looking about me im afraid that i havent yet had time to clean the place she apologized doctor abs left a lot of rubbish to throw out not that i mind really he gave me four weeks money in lieu of notice she pointed at one door which was closed theres still quite a bit of bomb damage showing in there we had an incendiary in the courtyard when the ivans came but its due to be repaired very soon im sure its fine i said generously right then ill leave you to have a little look around on your own professor kurtz let you get a feel for the place just lock up after you and knock on my door when youve seen everything when the old woman had gone i wandered among the rooms finding only that for a single man abs seemed to have received an extraordinarily large number of care parcels those food parcels that came from the united states i counted the empty cardboard boxes that bore the distinctive initials and the broad street new york address and found that there were over fifty of them it didnt look like care so much as good business when i had finished looking around i told the old woman that i was looking for something bigger and thanked her for allowing me to see the place then i strolled back to my pension in skodagasse i wasnt back very long before there was a knock at my door herr gunther said the one wearing the sergeants stripes i nodded im afraid youll have to come with us please am i being arrested excuse me sir i repeated the question in my uncertain english the american mp shifted his chewinggum around impatiently it will be explained to you down at headquarters sir i picked up my jacket and slipped it on you will remember to bring your papers wont you sir he smiled politely save us coming back for them of course i said collecting my hat and coat have you got transport or are we walking the trucks right outside the front door the landlady caught my eye as we came through her lobby to my surprise she looked not at all perturbed maybe she was used to her guests getting pulled in by the international patrol or perhaps she just told herself that someone else was paying for my room whether i slept there or in a cell at the police prison we climbed into the truck and drove a few metres north before a short turn to the right took us south down lederergasse away from the city centre and the headquarters of the imp arent we going to kärtnerstrasse i said it isnt an international patrol matter sir the sergeant explained this is american jurisdiction were going to the stiftskaserne on mariahilferstrasse to see who shields or belinsky it will be explained when we get there right the mockbaroque entrance to the stiftskaserne the headquarters of the military police with its halfrelief doric columns griffins and greek warriors was situated somewhat incongruously between the twin entrances of tillers department store and was part of a fourstorey building that fronted onto mariahilferstrasse we passed through the massive arch of this entrance and beyond the rear of the main building and a parade ground to another building which housed a military barracks the truck drove through some gates and pulled up outside the barracks i was escorted inside and up a couple of flights of stairs to a big bright office which commanded an impressive view of the antiaircraft tower that stood on the other side of the parade ground shields stood up from behind a desk and grinned like he was trying to impress the dentist come on in and sit down he said as if we were old friends he looked at the sergeant did he come peaceably gene or did you have to beat the shit out of his ass the sergeant grinned a little and mumbled something which i didnt catch it was no wonder that one could never understand their english i thought americans were forever chewing something you better stick around a while gene shields added just in case we have to get tough with this guy he uttered a short laugh and hitching up his trousers sat squarely in front of me his heavy legs splayed apart like some samurai lord except that he was probably twice as large as any japanese first of all gunther i have to tell you that theres a lieutenant canfield a real asshole brit down at international headquarters who would love somebody to help him with a little problem hes got it seems like some stonemason in the british sector got himself killed when a rock fell on his tits mostly everyone including the lieutenants boss believes that it was probably an accident only the lieutenants the keen type hes read sherlock holmes and he wants to go to detective school when he leaves the army hes got this theory that someone tampered with the dead mans books now i dont know if thats sufficient motive to kill a man or not but i do remember seeing you go into pichlers office yesterday morning after captain lindens funeral he chuckled hell i admit it gunther i was spying on you now what do you say to that pichlers dead how about it you try it with a little more surprise dont tell me pichler is dead or my god i dont believe what you are telling me you wouldnt know what happened to him would you gunther i shrugged maybe the business was getting on top of him shields laughed at that one he laughed like he had once taken a few classes in laughing showing all his teeth which were mostly bad in a blue boxingglove of a jaw that was wider than the top of his dark and balding head he seemed loud like most americans and then some he was a big brawny man with shoulders like a rhinoceros and wore a suit of lightbrown flannel with lapels that were as broad and sharp as two swiss halberds his tie deserved to hang over a café terrace and his shoes were heavy brown oxfords americans seemed to have an attraction for stout shoes in the same way that ivans loved wristwatches the only difference was that they generally bought them in shops frankly i dont give a damn for that lieutenants problems he said its shit in the british backyard not mine so let them sweep it up no im merely explaining your need to cooperate with me you may have nothing at all to do with pichlers death but im sure that you dont want to waste a day explaining that to lieutenant canfield so you help me and ill help you ill forget i ever saw you go into pichlers shop do you understand what im saying to you theres nothing wrong with your german i said all the same it struck me with what venom he attacked the accent tackling the consonants with a theatrical degree of precision almost as if he regarded the language as one which needed to be spoken cruelly i dont suppose it would matter if i said that i know absolutely nothing about what happened to herr pichler shields shrugged apologetically as i said its a british problem not mine maybe you are innocent but like i say it sure would be a pain in the ass explaining it to those british i swear they think every one of you krauts is a goddam nazi i threw up my hands in defeat so how can i help you well naturally when i heard that before coming to captain lindens party you visited his murderer in prison my inquiring nature could not be constrained his tone grew sharper come on gunther i want to know what the hell is going on between you and becker i take it you know beckers side of the story like it was engraved on my cigarettecase well becker believes it hes paying me to investigate it and he hopes to prove it youre investigating it you say so what does that make you a private investigator a shamus well well he leaned forwards on his chair and taking hold of the edge of my jacket felt the material with his finger and thumb it was fortunate that there were no razor blades sewn on that particular number no i cant buy that youre not half greasy enough greasy or not its true i took out my wallet and showed him my id and then my old warrant disc before the war i was with the berlin criminal police im sure i dont have to tell you that becker was too thats how i know him i took out my cigarettes mind if i smoke smoke but dont let it stop your lips moving well after the war i didnt want to go back to the police the force was full of communists i was throwing him a line with that one there wasnt one american i had met who seemed to like communism so i set up in business on my own actually i had a period out of the force during the midthirties and did a bit of private work then so im not exactly new at this game with so many displaced persons since the war most people can use an honest bull believe me thanks to the ivans theyre few and far between in berlin yeah well its the same here because the soviets got here first they put all their own people in the top police jobs things are so bad that the austrian government had to look to the chief of the vienna fire service when they were trying to find a straight man to become the new vicepresident of police he shook his head youre one of beckers old colleagues how about that what kind of cop was he for christs sake the crooked kind no wonder this countrys in such a mess i suppose you were ss as well then briefly when i found out what was going on i asked for a transfer to the front people did you know not enough of them your friend didnt for one hes not exactly a friend so why did you take the case i needed the money and i needed to get away from my wife for a while do you mind telling me why i paused realizing that it was the first time i had talked about it shes been seeing someone else one of your brother officers i thought that if i wasnt around for a while she might decide what was more important her marriage or this schätzi of hers shields nodded and then made a sympatheticsounding grunt naturally all your papers are in order naturally i handed them over and watched him examine my identity card and my pink pass p just a few dishonest ones dishonest russkies what other kind is there sure i had to grease some people but the papers are genuine shields handed them back do you have your fragebogen with you i fished my denazification certificate out of my wallet and handed it over he only glanced at it having no desire to read through the questions and answers it recorded an exonerated person eh how come you werent classed as an offender all ss were automatically arrested i saw out the end of the war in the army on the russian front and like i said i got a transfer out of the ss shields grunted and handed back the fragebogen i dont like ss he growled that makes two of us shields examined the big fraternity ring which gracelessly adorned one of his welltufted fingers he said we checked beckers story you know there was nothing in it i dont agree and what makes you think that do you think hed be willing to pay me to dig around if his story were just hot air five thousand shields let out a whistle worth it if your heads in a noose sure well maybe you can prove that the guy was somewhere else when we actually caught him maybe you can find something thatll persuade the judge that his friends didnt shoot at us or that he wasnt carrying the gun that shot linden you got any bright ideas yet shamus like maybe the one that took you to see pichler it was a name that becker remembered as having been mentioned by someone at reklaue werbe zentrale by who dr max abs shields nodded recognizing the name id say it was him who killed pichler probably he went to see him not long after i did and found out that someone claiming to be a friend of his had been asking questions maybe pichler told him that hed said i should come back the following day so before i did abs killed him and took away the paperwork with his name and address on or so he thought he forgot something which led me to his address only by the time i got there hed cleared out according to his landlady hes halfway to munich by now you know shields it might not be a bad idea if you were to have someone meet him off that train shields stroked his poorlyshaven jaw it might not be at that he stood up and went behind his desk where he picked up the telephone and proceeded to make a number of calls but using a vocabulary and an accent that i was unable to comprehend when finally he replaced the receiver in its cradle he looked at his wristwatch and said the train to munich takes eleven and a half hours so theres plenty of time to make sure he gets a warm hello when he gets off the telephone rang shields answered it staring at me openmouthed and unblinking as if there wasnt much of my story he had believed but when he put down the telephone a second time he was grinning one of my calls was to the berlin documents centre he said im sure you know what that is and that linden worked there i nodded i asked them if they had anything on this max abs guy that was them calling back just now it seems that he was ss too not actually wanted for any war crimes but something of a coincidence wouldnt you say you becker abs all former pupils of himmlers little ivy league a coincidence is all it is i said wearily shields settled back in his chair you know im perfectly prepared to believe that becker was just the triggerman for linden that your organization wanted him dead because he had found out something about you oh i said without much enthusiasm for shieldss theory and which organization is that the werewolf underground i found myself laughing out loud that old nazi fifthcolumn story the staybehind fanatics who were going to continue a guerrilla war against our conquerors you have to be joking shields something wrong with that you think well theyre a bit late for a start the wars been over for nearly three years surely you americans have screwed enough of our women by now to realize that we never planned to cut your throats in bed the werewolves i shook my head pityingly i thought they were something that your own intelligence people had dreamed up but i must say i certainly never thought there was anyone who actually believed that shit look maybe linden did find out something about a couple of warcriminals and maybe they wanted him out of the way but not the werewolf underground lets try and find something a little more original can we i started another cigarette and watched shields nod and think his way through what i had said what does the berlin documents centre have to stay about lindens work i said officially he was no more than the crowcass liaison officer the central registry of war crimes and security suspects of the united states army they insist that linden was simply an administrator and not a field agent but then if he were working in intelligence those boys wouldnt tell us anyway theyve got more secrets than the surface of mars he got up from behind the desk and went to the window you know the other day i had eyes of a report that said as many as two out of every thousand austrians were spying for the soviets now there are over million people in this city gunther which means that if uncle sam has as many spies as uncle joe there are over spies right on my doorstep to say nothing of what the british and the french are doing or what the vienna state police get up to thats the commierun political police not the ordinary vienna police although theyre a bunch of communists as well of course and then only a few months ago we had a whole bunch of hungarian state police infiltrated into vienna in order to kidnap or murder a few of their own dissident nationals he turned away from the window and came back to the seat in front of me grasping the back of it as if he were planning to pick it up and crash it over my head he sighed and said what im trying to say gunther is that this is a rotten town i believe hitler called it a pearl well he must have meant one that was as yellow and worn as the last tooth in a dead dog frankly i look out of that window and i see about as much thats precious about this place as i can see blue when im pissing in the danube shields straightened up then he leaned across and took hold of my jacket lapels pulling me up to my feet vienna disappoints me gunther and that makes me feel bad dont you do the same old fellow if you turn up something i think i should know about and you dont come and tell me ill get real sore i can think of a hundred good reasons to haul your ass out of this town even when im in a good mood like i am now am i making myself clear like you were made of crystal i brushed his hands off my jacket and straightened it on my shoulders halfway to the door i stopped and said does this new cooperation with the american military police extend as far as removing the tail you put on me someones following you he was until i took a poke at him last night this is a weird city gunther maybe hes queer for you that must be why i presumed he was working for you the mans an american named john belinsky shields shook his head his eyes innocently wide i never heard of him honest to god i never ordered anyone to tail you if someones following you it has nothing to do with this office you know what you should do surprise me go home to berlin theres nothing here for you maybe i would except that im not sure that theres anything there either thats one of the reasons i came remember it was late by the time i got to the casanova club the place was full of frenchmen and they were full of whatever it is that frenchmen drink when they want to get good and stiff veronika had been right after all i did prefer the casanova when it was quiet failing to spot her in the crowd i asked the waiter i had tipped so generously the previous night if she had been in the place she was here only ten fifteen minutes ago he said i think she went to the koralle sir he lowered his voice and dipped his head towards me she doesnt much care for frenchmen and to tell the truth neither do i the british the americans even the russians one can at least respect armies that took a hand in our defeat but the french they are bastards believe me sir i know i live in the th bezirk in the french sector he straightened the tablecloth and what will the gentleman have to drink i think i might take a look at the koralle myself where is it do you know its in the th bezirk sir porzellangasse just off berggasse and close to the police prison do you know where that is i laughed im beginning to veronika is a nice girl the waiter added for a chocolady rain blew into the inner city from the east and the russian sector it turned to hail in the cold night air and stung the four faces of the international patrol as they pulled up outside the casanova nodding curtly to the doorman and without a word they passed me by and went inside to look for soldierly vice that compromising manifestation of lust exacerbated by a combination of a foreign country hungry women and a neverending supply of cigarettes and chocolate at the nowfamiliar schottenring i crossed on to währinger strasse and headed north across rooseveltplatz in the moonlit shadow of the twin towers of the votivkirche which despite its enormous skypiercing height had somehow survived all the bombs i was turning into berggasse for the second time that day when from a large ruined building on the opposite side of the road i heard a cry for help telling myself that it was none of my business i stopped for only a brief moment intending to keep to my route but then i heard it again an almost recognizably contralto voice i felt fear crawl across my skin as i walked quickly in the direction of the sound a high bank of rubble was piled against the buildings curved wall and having climbed to the top of it i stared through an empty arched window into a semicircular room that was of the proportions of a smallsized theatre there were three of them struggling in a little spot of moonlight against a straight wall that faced the windows two were russian soldiers filthy and ragged and laughing uproariously as they attempted forcibly to strip the clothes from the third figure which was a woman i knew it was veronika even before she lifted her face to the light she screamed and was slapped hard by the russian who held her arms and the two flap sides of her dress that his comrade kneeling on her toes had torn open pakazhitye dushka show me darling he guffawed wrenching veronikas underwear down over her knocking knees he sat back on his haunches to admire her nakedness pryekrasnaya beautiful he said as if he had been looking at a painting and then pushed his face into her pubic hair vkoosnaya tozhe tasty too he growled the russian looked round from between her legs as he heard my footfall on the debris that littered the floor and seeing the length of lead pipe in my hand he stood up beside his friend who now pushed veronika aside get out of here veronika i shouted needing little encouragement she grabbed her coat and ran towards one of the windows but the russian who had licked her seemed to have other ideas and snatched at her mane of hair in the same moment i swung the pipe which hit the side of his lousylooking head with an audible clang numbing my hand with the vibration from the blow the thought was just crossing my mind that i had hit him much too hard when i felt a sharp kick in the ribs and then a knee thudded into my groin the pipe fell on to the brickstrewn floor and there was a taste of blood in my mouth as i slowly followed it i drew my legs up to my chest and tensed myself as i waited for the mans great boot to smash into my body again and finish me instead i heard a short mechanical punch of a sound like the sound of a rivetgun and when the boot swung again it was well over my head with one leg still in the air the man staggered for a second like a drunken balletdancer and then fell dead beside me his forehead neatly trepanned with a wellaimed bullet i groaned and for a moment shut my eyes when i opened them again and raised myself on to my forearm there was a third man squatting in front of me and for a chilling moment he pointed the silenced barrel of his luger at the centre of my face fuck you kraut he said and then grinning broadly helped me to my feet i was going to belt you myself but it looks like those two ivans have saved me the trouble belinsky i wheezed holding my ribs what are you my guardian angel yeah its a wonderful life you all right kraut maybe my chest would feel better if i quit smoking yes im all right where the hell did you come from you didnt see me great after what you said about tailing someone i read a book about it i disguised myself as a nazi so as you wouldnt notice me i looked around did you see where veronika went you mean you know that lady he meandered over to the soldier i had felled with the pipe and who lay senseless on the floor i thought you were just the don quixote type i only met her last night before you met me i guess belinsky stared down at the soldier for a moment then levelled the luger at the back of the mans head and pulled the trigger shes outside he said with no more emotion than if he had shot at a beerbottle shit i breathed appalled at this display of callousness they could certainly have used you in an action group what i said i hope i didnt make you miss your tram last night did you have to kill him he shrugged and started to unscrew the lugers silencer two dead is better than one left alive to testify in court believe me i know what im talking about he kicked the mans head with the toe of his shoe anyway these ivans wont be missed theyre deserters how do you know belinsky pointed out two bundles of clothes and equipment that lay near the doorway and next to them the remains of a fire and a meal it looks like theyve been hiding here for a couple of days i guess they got bored and fancied some he searched for the right word in german and then shaking his head completed the sentence in english cunt he bolstered the luger and dropped the silencer into his coat pocket if theyre found before the rats eat them up the local boys will just figure that the mvd did it but my bet is on the rats viennas got the biggest rats you ever saw they come straight up out of the sewers come to think of it from the smell of these two id say theyd been down there themselves the main sewer comes out in the stadt park just by the soviet kommendatura and the russian sector he started towards the window come on kraut lets find this girl of yours veronika was standing a short way back down währinger strasse and looked ready to make a run for it if it had been the two russians who came out of the building when i saw your friend go in she explained i waited to see what would happen she had buttoned her coat to the neck and but for a slight bruise on her cheek and the tears in her eyes i wouldnt have said she looked like a girl who had narrowly missed being raped she glanced nervously back at the building with a question in her eyes its all right said belinsky they wont bother us no more when veronika had finished thanking me for saving her and belinsky for saving me he and i walked her home to the halfruin in rotenturmstrasse where she had her room there she thanked us some more and invited us both to come up an offer which we declined and only after i had promised to visit her in the morning could she be persuaded to close the door and go to bed from the look of you id say that you could use a drink belinsky said let me buy you one the renaissance bar is just around the corner its quiet there and we can talk close by st stephens cathedral which was now being restored the renaissance in singerstrasse was an imitation hungarian tavern with gypsy music the kind of place you see depicted on a jigsawpuzzle it was no doubt popular with the tourists but just a concertinasqueeze too premeditated for my simple gloomy taste there was one significant compensation as belinsky explained they served csereszne a clear hungarian spirit made from cherries and for one who had recently been subjected to a kicking it tasted even better than belinsky had promised thats a nice girl he said but she ought to be a bit more careful in vienna so should you for that matter if youre going to go around playing errolfuckingflynn you should have more than just a bit of hair under your arm i guess youre right i sipped at my second glass but it seems strange you telling me that you being a bull and all carrying a guns not strictly legal for anyone but allied personnel who said i was a bull he shook his head im cic the counterintelligence corps the mps dont know shit about what we get up to youre a spy no were more like uncle sams hotel detectives we dont run spies we catch them spies and warcriminals he poured some more of the csereszne so why are you following me its hard to say really im sure i could find you a german dictionary belinsky withdrew a readyfilled pipe from his pocket and while he explained what he meant he suckstarted the thing into yielding a steady smoke im investigating the murder of captain linden he said what a coincidence so am i we want to try and find out what it was that brought him to vienna in the first place he liked to keep things pretty close to his chest worked on his own a lot was he in the cic too yes the th stationed in germany im th were stationed in austria really he should have let us know he was coming on to our patch and he didnt send so much as a postcard eh not a word probably because there was no earthly reason why he should have come if he was working on anything that affected this country he should have told us belinsky let out a balloon of smoke and waved it away from his face he was what you might call a deskinvestigator an intellectual the sort of fellow you could let loose on a wall full of files with instructions to find himmlers optical prescription the only problem is that because he was such a bright guy he kept no case notes belinsky tapped his forehead with the stem of his pipe he kept everything up here which makes it a nuisance to find out what he was investigating that got him a lead lunch your mps think that the werewolf underground might have had something to do with it so i heard he inspected the smouldering contents of his cherrywood pipe bowl and added frankly were all scraping around in the dark a bit on this one anyway thats where you walk into my life we thought maybe youd turn up something that we couldnt manage ourselves you being a native comparatively speaking and if you did id be there for the cause of free democracy criminal investigation by proxy eh it wouldnt be the first time that its happened i hate to disappoint you only im kind of in the dark myself maybe not after all you already got the stonemason killed in my book that rates as a result it means you got someone upset kraut i smiled you can call me bernie the way i figure it becker wouldnt bring you into the game without dealing you a few cards pichlers name was probably one of them you might be right i conceded but all the same its not a hand id care to put my shirt on want to let me take a peek why should i i saved your life kraut he growled too sentimental be a little more practical all right then maybe i can help better much better what do you need pichler was more than likely murdered by a man named abs max abs according to the mps he used to be ss but smalltime anyway he boarded a train to munich this afternoon and they were going to have someone meet him i expect that theyll tell me what happens but i need to find out more about abs for instance who this fellow was i took out pichlers drawing of martin albers gravestone and spread it on the table in front of belinsky if i can find out who martin albers was and why max abs was willing to pay for his headstone i might be on my way to establishing why abs thought it necessary to kill pichler before he spoke to me who is this abs guy whats his connection he used to work for an advertising firm here in vienna the same place that könig managed königs the man that briefed becker to run files across the green frontier files that went to linden belinsky nodded all right then i said heres my next card könig had a girlfriend called lotte who hung around the casanova it could be that she sparkled there a bit nibbled a little chocolate i dont know yet some of beckers friends crashed around there and a few other places and didnt come home for tea my idea is to put the girl on to it i thought id have to get to know her a bit first of all but of course now that shes seen me on my white horse and wearing my sunday suit of armour i can hurry that along suppose veronika doesnt know this lotte what then suppose you think of a better idea belinsky shrugged on the other hand your scheme has its points heres another thing both abs and eddy holl who was beckers contact in berlin are working for a company thats based in pullach near munich the south german industries utilization company you might like to try and find out something about it not to mention why abs and holl decided to move there they wouldnt be the first two krauts to go and live in the american zone said belinsky havent you noticed relations are starting to get a shade difficult with our communist allies the news from berlin is that theyve started to tear up a lot of the roads connecting the east and west sectors of the city his face made plain his lack of enthusiasm and then added but ill see what i can turn up anything else before i left berlin i came across a couple of amateur nazihunters named drexler linden used to take them care parcels now and again i wouldnt be surprised if they were working for him everyone knows thats how the cic pays its way it would help if we knew who they had been looking for cant we ask them it wouldnt do much good theyre dead someone slipped a trayload of zyklonb pellets underneath their door give me their address anyway he took out a notepad and pencil when i had given it to him he pursed his lips and rubbed his jaw his was an impossibly broad face with thick horns of eyebrows that curved halfway round his eyesockets some small animals skull for a nose and intaglio laughlines which added to his square chin and sharply angled nostrils completed a perfectly septagonal figure the overall impression was of a rams head resting on a vshaped plinth you were right he admitted its not much of a hand is it but its still better than the one i folded on with the pipe clenched tight between his teeth he crossed his arms and stared down at his glass perhaps it was his choice of drink or perhaps it was his hair styled longer than the crewcut favoured by the majority of his countrymen but he seemed curiously unamerican where are you from i said eventually williamsburg new york belinsky i said measuring each syllable what kind of a name is that for an american the man shrugged unperturbed im firstgeneration american my dads from siberia originally his family emigrated to escape one of the tsars jewish pogroms you see the ivans have got a tradition of antisemitism thats almost as good as yours belinsky was irving berlins name before he changed it and as names for americans go i dont think a yidname like that sounds any worse than a krautname like eisenhower do you i guess not talking of names if you do speak to the mps again it might be better if you didnt mention me or the cic to them on account of the fact that they recently screwed up an operation we had going the mvd managed to steal some us military police uniforms from the battalion hq at the stiftskaserne they put them on and persuaded the mps at the th bezirk station to help them arrest one of our best informers in vienna a couple of days later another informant told us that the man was being interrogated at mvd headquarters in mozartgasse not long after that we learned he had been shot but not before he talked and gave away several other names well there was an almighty row and the american high commissioner had to kick some ass for the poor security of the th they courtmartialled a lieutenant and broke a sergeant back to the ranks as a result of which me being cic is tantamount to having leprosy in the eyes of the stiftskaserne i suppose you might find that hard to understand you being german on the contrary i said id say being treated like lepers is something we krauts understand only too well the water arriving in the tap from the styrian alps tasted cleaner than the squeak of a dentists fingers i carried a glassful of it from the bathroom to answer the telephone ringing in my sittingroom and sipped some more while i waited for frau blumweiss to switch the call through well goodmorning shields said with affected enthusiasm i hope i got you out of bed i was just cleaning my teeth and how are you today he said still refusing to come to the point a slight headache thats all i had drunk too much of belinskys favourite liquor well blame it on the föhn suggested shields referring to the unseasonably warm and dry wind that occasionally descended on vienna from the mountains everyone else in this city blames all kinds of strange behaviour on it but all i notice is that it makes the smell of horseshit even worse than usual its nice to talk to you again shields what do you want your friend abs didnt get to munich were pretty sure he got on the train only there was no sign of him at the other end maybe he got off somewhere else the only stop that train makes is in salzburg and we had that covered too perhaps someone threw him off while the train was still moving i knew only too well how that happened not in the american zone well that doesnt start until you get to linz theres over a hundred kilometres of russian lower austria between here and your zone you said yourself that youre sure he got on the train so what else does that leave then i recalled what belinsky had said about the poor security of the us military police of course its possible he simply gave your men the slip that he was too clever for them shields sighed sometime gunther when youre not too busy with your old nazi comrades ill drive you out to the dp camp at auhof and you can see all the illegal jewish emigrants who thought they were too smart for us he laughed that is if youre not scared that you might be recognized by someone from a concentration camp it might even be fun to leave you there those zionists dont have my sense of humour about the ss id certainly miss that yes there was a soft almost furtive knock at the door look ive got to go just watch your step if i so much as think that i can smell shit on your shoes ill throw you in the cage yes well if you do smell something itll probably just be the föhn shields laughed his ghosttrain laugh and then hung up i went to the door and let in a short shiftylooking type who brought to mind the print of a portrait by klimt that was hanging in the breakfastroom he wore a brown belted raincoat trousers that seemed a little short of his white socks and barely covering his head of long fair hair a small black tyrolean that was loaded with badges and feathers somewhat incongruously his hands were enclosed in a large woollen muff what are you selling swing i asked him the shifty look turned suspicious arent you gunther he drawled in an improbable voice that was as low as a stolen bassoon relax i said im gunther you must be beckers personal gunsmith sright names rudi he glanced around and grew easier you alone in this watertight like a hair on a widows tit have you brought me a present rudi nodded and with a sly grin pulled one of his hands out of the muff it held a revolver and it was pointed at my morning croissant after a short uncomfortable moment his grin widened and he released the handgrip to let the gun hang by the triggerguard on his forefinger if i stay in this city im going to have to shop for a new sense of humour i said taking the revolver from him it was a smith with a sixinch barrel and the words military and police clearly engraved in the black finish i suppose the bull who owned this let you have it for a few packets of cigarettes rudi started to answer but i got there first look i told becker a clean gun not exhibit a in a murder trial thats a new gun rudi said indignantly squeeze your eye down the barrel its still greased hasnt been fired yet i swear them at the top dont even know its missing where did you get it the arsenal warehouse honest herr gunther that guns as clean as they come these days i nodded reluctantly did you bring any ammunition theres six in it he said and taking his other hand out of the muff laid a miserly handful of cartridges on to the sideboard next to my two bottles from traudl and these what did you buy them off the ration rudi shrugged all i could get for the moment im afraid eyeing the vodka he licked his lips ive had my breakfast i told him but you help yourself just to keep the cold out eh he said and poured a nervous glassful which he quickly swallowed go ahead and have another i never stand between a man and a good thirst i lit a cigarette and went over to the window outside a pans pipes of icicles hung from the edge of the terrace roof especially on a day as chilly as this one thanks said rudi thanks a lot he smiled thinly and poured a second steadier glass which he sipped at slowly so hows it coming along the investigation i mean if youve got any ideas id love to hear them right now the fish arent exactly jumping on to the riverbank rudi flexed his shoulders well the way i see it is that this ami captain the one that took the he paused while i made the connection the number was the tram that went to the central cemetery i nodded for him to continue well he must have been involved in some kind of racket think about it he instructed warming to his subject he goes to a warehouse with some coat and the place is stacked high with nails i mean why did they go there in the first place it couldnt have been because the killer planned to shoot him there he wouldnt have done it near his stash would he they must have gone to look at the merchandise and had an argument i had to admit there was something in what he said i thought for a minute who sells cigarettes in austria rudi apart from everyone the main blacksiders excepting emil theres the ivans a mad american staff sergeant who lives in a castle near salzburg a romanian jew here in vienna and an austrian named kurtz but emil was the biggest most people have heard the name of emil becker in that particular connection do you think its possible that one of them could have framed emil to take him out of competition sure but not at the expense of losing all those nails forty cases of cigarettes herr gunther thats a big loss for someone to take when exactly was this tobacco factory on thaliastrasse robbed months ago didnt the mps have any idea who could have done it didnt they have any suspects not a chance thaliastrasse is in the th bezirk part of the french sector the french mps couldnt catch drip in this city what about the local bulls the vienna police rudi shook his head firmly too busy fighting with the state police the ministry of the interior has been trying to have the state mob absorbed into the regular force but the russians dont like it and are trying to fuck the thing up even if it means wrecking the whole force he grinned i cant say id be sorry no the locals are almost as bad as the frenchies to be honest the only bulls that are worth a damn in this city are the amis even the tommies are pretty stupid if you ask me rudi glanced at one of the several watches he had strapped to his arm look ive got to go otherwise ill miss my pitch at ressel thats where youll find me every morning if you need to herr gunther there or at the hauswirth café on favoritenstrasse during the afternoon he drained his glass thanks for the drink favoritenstrasse i repeated frowning thats in the russian sector isnt it true said rudi but it doesnt make me a communist he raised his little hat and smiled just prudent the sad aspect to her face with its downcast eyes and the tilt of her thickening jaw not to mention her cheap and secondhandlooking clothes made me think that veronika could not have made much out of being a prostitute and certainly there was nothing about the cold cavernsized room she rented in the heart of the citys redlight district that indicated anything other than an ekedout handtomouth kind of existence she thanked me again for helping her and having inquired solicitously after my bruises proceeded to make a pot of tea while she explained that one day she was planning to become an artist i looked through her drawings and watercolours without much enjoyment profoundly depressed by my gloomy surroundings i asked her how it was that she had ended up on the sledge this was foolish because it never does to challenge a whore about anything least of all her own immorality and my only excuse was that i felt genuinely sorry for her had she once had a husband who had seen her frenching an ami in a ruined building for a couple of bars of chocolate who said i was on the sledge she responded tartly i shrugged its not coffee that keeps you up half the night maybe so all the same you wont find me working in one of those places on the gürtel where the numbers just walk up the stairs and you wont find me selling it on the street outside the american information office or the atlantis hotel chocolady i may be but im no sparkler i have to like the gentleman that wont stop you getting hurt like last night for instance not to mention venereal disease listen to yourself she said with amused contempt you sound just like one of those bastards in the vice squad they pick you up have a doctor examine you for a dose and then give you a lecture on the perils of drip youre beginning to sound like a bull maybe the police are right ever think of that well they never found anything wrong with me nor will they she smiled a shrewd little smile like i said im careful i have to like the gentleman which means i wont do ivans or niggers nobody ever heard of an ami or a tommy with syphilis i suppose look you play the percentages she scowled what the hell do you know about it anyway saving my ass doesnt give you the right to read me the ten commandments bernie you dont have to be a swimmer to throw someone a lifepreserver ive met enough snappers in my time to know that most of them started out as selective as you then someone comes along and beats the shit out of them and the next time with the landlord chasing for his rent they cant afford to be quite as choosy you talk about percentages well theres not much percentage in french for ten schillings when youre forty youre a nice girl veronika if there were a priest around hed maybe think you were worth a short homily but since there isnt youll have to make do with me she smiled sadly and stroked my hair youre not so bad not that i have any idea why you think it necessary im really quite all right ive got money saved soon ill have enough to get myself into an artschool somewhere i thought it just as likely that she would win a contract to repaint the sistine chapel but i felt my mouth force its way up to a politely optimistic sort of smile sure you will i said look maybe i can help maybe we can help each other it was a hopelessly flatfooted way of manoeuvring the conversation back to the main purpose of my visit maybe she said serving the tea one more thing and then you can give me a blessing the vice squad has got files on over girls in vienna but thats not even half of it these days everyone has to do things that were once unthinkable you too probably theres not much percentage in going hungry and even less in going back to czechoslovakia youre czech she sipped some of her tea then took a cigarette from the packet i had given her the night before and collected a light according to my papers i was born in austria but the fact is that im czech a sudeten germanjew i spent most of the war hiding out in lavatories and attics then i was with the partisans for a while and after that a dp camp for six months before i escaped across the green frontier have you heard of a place called wiener neustadt no well its a town about fifty kilometres outside vienna in the russian zone with a collection centre for soviet repatriations there are of them waiting there at any one time the ivans screen them into three groups enemies of the soviet union are sent to labour camps those they cant actually prove are enemies are sent to work outside the camps so either way you end up as some kind of slave labour unless that is youre the third group and youre sick or old or very young in which case youre shot right away she swallowed hard and took a long drag of her cigarette do you want to know something i think i would sleep with the whole of the british army if it meant that the russians couldnt claim me and that includes the ones with syphilis she tried a smile but as it happens i have a medical friend who got me a few bottles of penicillin i dose myself with it now and again just to be on the safe side that sounds expensive like i said hes a friend it costs me nothing that could be spent on the reconstruction she picked up the teapot would you like some more tea i shook my head i was anxious to be out of that room lets go somewhere i suggested all right it beats staying here hows your head for heights because theres only one place to go on a sunday in vienna the amusement park of the prater with its great wheel merrygorounds and switchbackrailway was somehow incongruous in that part of vienna which as the last to fall to the red army still showed the greatest effects of the war and the clearest evidence of our being in an otherwise less amusing sector broken tanks and guns still littered the nearby meadows while on every one of the dilapidated walls of houses all along the ausstellungsstrasse was the faded chalk outline of the cyrillic word atakivat searched which really meant looted from the top of the big wheel veronika pointed out the piers of the red army bridge the star on the soviet obelisk close by it and beyond these the danube then as the cabin carrying the two of us started its slow descent to the ground she reached inside my coat and took hold of my balls but snatched her hand away again when i sighed uncomfortably it could be that you would have preferred the prater before the nazis she said peevishly when all the dollyboys came here to pick up some trade thats not it at all i laughed maybe thats what you meant when you said that i could help you no im just the nervous type try it again sometime when were not sixty metres up in the air highly strung eh i thought you said you had a head for heights i lied but youre right i do need your help if vertigos your problem then getting horizontal is the only treatment im qualified to prescribe im looking for someone veronika a girl who used to hang around the casanova club why else do men go to the casanova except to look for a girl this is one particular girl maybe you hadnt noticed none of the girls at the casanova are that particular she threw me a narroweyed look as if she suddenly distrusted me i thought you sounded like them at the top all that shit about drip and all are you working with that american no im a private investigator like the thin man she laughed when i nodded i thought that stuff was just for the films and you want me to help you with something youre investigating is that it i nodded again i never saw myself quite like myrna loy she said but ill help you if i can who is this girl youre looking for her name is lotte i dont know her last name you might have seen her with a man called könig he wears a moustache and has a small terrier veronika nodded slowly yes i remember them actually i used to know lotte reasonably well her name is lotte hartmann but she hasnt been around in a few weeks no do you know where she is not exactly they went skiing together lotte and helmut könig her schätzi somewhere in the austrian tyrol i believe when was this i dont know two three weeks ago könig seems to have plenty of money do you know when theyre coming back i have no idea i do know she said shed be away for at least a month if things worked out between them knowing lotte that means it would depend on how much of a good time he showed her are you sure shes coming back it would take an avalanche to stop her coming back here lottes viennese right up to her earlobes she doesnt know how to live anywhere else i guess you want me to keep my eye close to the keyhole for them thats about the size of it i said naturally ill pay you she shrugged theres no need she said and pressed her nose against the windowpane people who save my life get themselves all sorts of generous discounts i ought to warn you it could be dangerous you dont have to tell me she said coolly ive met könig hes all smooth and charming at the club but he doesnt fool me helmuts the kind of man who takes his brass knuckles to confession when we were on the ground again i used some of my coupons to buy us a bag of lingos a hungarian snack of fried dough sprinkled with garlic from one of the stalls near the great wheel after this modest lunch we took the lilliput railway down to the olympic stadium and walked back in the snow through the woods on hauptallee much later on when we were in her room again she said are you still feeling nervous i reached for her gourdlike breasts and found her blouse damp with perspiration she helped me to unbutton her and while i enjoyed the weight of her bosom in my hand she unfastened her skirt i stood back to give her room to step out of it and when she had laid it over the back of a chair i took her by the hand and drew her towards me for a brief moment i held her tight enjoying her short husky breath on my neck before searching down for the curve of her girdled behind her membranetight stockingtops and then the soft cool flesh between her gartered thighs and after she had engineered the subtraction of what little remained to cover her i kissed her and allowed an intrepid finger to enjoy a short exploration of her hidden places in bed she held a smile on her face as slowly i strove to fathom her catching sight of her open eyes which were no more than dreamy as if she was unable to forget my satisfaction in search of her own i found that i was too excited to care much beyond what seemed polite when at last she felt the wound i was making in her become more urgent she raised her thighs on to her chest and reaching down spread herself open with the flats of her hands as if holding taut a piece of cloth for the needle of a sewingmachine so that i might see myself periodically drawn tight into her a moment later i flexed against her as life worked its independent and juddering propulsion it snowed hard that night and then the temperature fell into the sewers freezing the whole of vienna to preserve it for a better day i dreamed not of a lasting city but of the city which was to come part two a date for herr beckers trial has now been set liebl told me which makes it absolutely imperative that we make all haste with the preparation of our defence i trust you will forgive me herr gunther if i impress upon you the urgent need for evidence to substantiate our clients account while i have faith in your ability as a detective i should very much like to know exactly what progress you have made so far in order that i may best advise herr becker how we are to conduct his case in court this conversation took place several weeks after my arrival in vienna but it was not the first time that liebl had pressed me for some indication of my progress we were sitting in the café schwarzenberg which had become the nearest thing id had to an office since before the war the viennese coffee house resembles a gentlemans club except in so far as that a days membership costs little more than the price of a cup of coffee for that you can stay for as long as you like read the papers and magazines that are provided leave messages with waiters receive mail reserve a table for appointments and generally run a business in total confidence before all the world the viennese respect privacy in the same way that americans worship antiquity and a fellow patron of the schwarzenberg would no more have stuck his nose over your shoulder than he would have stirred a cup of mocha with his forefinger on previous occasions i had told liebl that an exact idea of progress was not something that existed in the world of the private investigator that it was not the kind of business in which one might report that a specific course of action would definitely occur within a certain period thats the trouble with lawyers they expect the rest of the world to work like the code napoléon on this particular occasion however i had rather more to tell liebl königs girlfriend lotte is back in vienna i said shes returned from her skiing holiday at long last it looks like that but you havent yet found her someone i know from the casanova club has a friend who spoke to her just a couple of days ago she may even have been back for a week or so a week liebl repeated why has it taken so long to find that out these things take time i shrugged provocatively i was fed up with liebls constant quizzing and had started to take a childish delight in teasing him with these displays of apparent insouciance yes he grumbled so youve said before he did not sound convinced its not like we have addresses for these people i said and lotte hartmann hasnt been near the casanova since shes been back the girl who spoke to her said that lotte had been trying to get a small part in a film at sievering studios sievering yes thats in the th bezirk the studio is owned by a viennese called karl hartl he used to be a client of mine hartls directed all the great stars pola negri lya de putti maria corda vilma banky lilian harvey did you see the gypsy baron well that was hartl you dont suppose he could know anything about the film studio where becker found lindens body drittemann film liebl stirred his coffee absently if it were a legitimate film company hartl would know about it theres not much that happens in viennese filmproduction that hartl doesnt know about but this wasnt anything more than a name on a lease there werent actually any films made there you checked it out yourself didnt you yes i said recalling the fruitless afternoon i had spent there two weeks before it turned out that even the lease had expired and that the property had now reverted to the state youre right linden was the first and last thing to be shot there i shrugged it was just a thought so what will you do now try and trace lotte hartmann at sievering that shouldnt be too difficult you dont go after a part in a film without leaving an address where you can be contacted liebl sipped his coffee noisily and then dabbed daintily at his mouth with a spinnakersized handkerchief please waste no time in tracing this person he said im sorry to have to press you like this but until we discover herr königs whereabouts we have nothing once you find him we might at least try and oblige him to be called as a material witness i nodded meekly there was more i could have told him but his tone irritated me and any further explanation would have generated questions i was simply not equipped to answer yet i could for instance have given him an account of what i had learned from belinsky at that same table in the schwarzenberg about a week after he had saved my skin information that i was still turning over in my mind and trying to make sense of nothing was as straightforward as liebl somehow imagined first of all belinsky had explained the drexlers were what they seemed she survived matthausen concentration camp while he came out of the lodz ghetto and auschwitz they met in a red cross hospital after the war and lived in frankfurt for a while before they went to berlin apparently they worked pretty closely with the crowcass people and the public prosecutors office they maintained a large number of files on wanted nazis and pursued many cases simultaneously consequently our people in berlin werent able to determine if there had been any one investigation which related to their deaths or to captain lindens the local police are baffled as they say which is probably the way they prefer it frankly they dont give much of a damn who killed the drexlers and the american mp investigation doesnt look as if its going to get anywhere but it doesnt seem likely that the drexlers would have been very interested in martin albers he was s s and sd clandestine operations chief in budapest until when he was arrested for his part in stauffenbergs plot to kill hitler and hanged at flossenburg concentration camp in april but i dare say he had it coming to him from all accounts albers was a bit of a bastard even if he did try and get rid of the führer a lot of you guys were a hell of a long time about that you know our intelligence people even think that himmler knew about the plot all along and let it go ahead in the hope that he could take hitlers place himself anyway it turns out that this max abs guy was albers servant driver and general dogsbody so it kind of looks as if he was honouring his old boss the albers family was killed in an airraid so i guess there was no one else to erect a stone in his memory rather an expensive gesture wouldnt you say you think so well id sure hate to get killed minding your ass kraut then belinsky told me about the pullach company its an americansponsored organization run by the germans set up with the aim of rebuilding german commerce throughout bizonia the whole idea is that germany should become economically selfsupporting as quickly as possible so that uncle sam wont have to keep baling you all out the company itself is located at an american mission called camp nicholas which until a few months ago was occupied by the postal censorship authorities of the us army camp nicholas is a big compound that was originally built for rudolf hess and his family but after he went awol bormann had it for a while and then kesselring and his staff now its ours theres just enough security about the place to convince the locals that the camp is home to some kind of technical research establishment but thats no surprise given the history of the place anyway the good people of pullach give it a wide berth preferring not to know too much about whats happening there even if it is something as harmless as an economic and commercial thinktank i guess theyre good at that what with dachau just a few miles away that seemed to take care of pullach i thought but what of abs it didnt seem to be in character for a man who wished to commemorate the memory of a hero of the german resistance such as it had existed to kill an innocent man merely in order to remain anonymous and how could abs be connected with linden the nazihunter except as some kind of informer was it possible that abs had also been killed just like linden and the drexlers i finished my coffee lit a cigarette and for the present moment i was content that these and other questions could not be asked in any forum other than my own mind the number ran west along sieveringer strasse into dobling and stopped just short of the vienna woods a spur of the alps which reaches as far as the danube a film studio is not a place where you are likely to see any great evidence of industry equipment lies forever idle in the vans hired to transport it sets are never more than halfbuilt even when they are finished but mostly there are lots of people all drawing a wage who seem to do little more than stand around smoking cigarettes and nursing cups of coffee and these only stand because they are not considered important enough to be provided with a seat for anyone foolish enough to have financed such an apparently profligate undertaking film must seem like the most expensive length of material since chinese silk and would i reflected surely have driven dr liebl halfmad with impatience i inquired after the studio manager from a man with a clipboard and he directed me to a small office on the first floor there i found a tall paunchy man with dyed hair wearing a lilaccoloured cardigan and having the manner of an eccentric maiden aunt he listened to my mission with one hand clasped on top of the other as if i had been requesting the hand of his warded niece what are you some kind of policeman he said combing an unruly eyebrow with his fingernail from somewhere in the building came the sound of a very loud trumpet which caused him to wince noticeably a detective i said disingenuously well we always like to cooperate with them at the top im sure what did you say this girl was casting for i didnt im afraid i dont know but it was in the last two or three weeks he picked up the telephone and pressed a switch willy its me otto could you be a love and step into my office for a moment he replaced the receiver and checked his hair willy reichmanns a production manager here he may be able to help you thanks i said and offered him a cigarette he threaded it behind his ear how kind ill smoke it later what are you filming at the moment i inquired while we waited whoever was playing the trumpet hit a couple of high notes that didnt seem to match otto emitted a groan and stared archly at the ceiling well its called the angel with the trumpet he said with a conspicuous lack of enthusiasm its more or less finished now but this director is such a perfectionist would that be karl hartl yes do you know him only the gypsy baron oh he said sourly that there was a knock at the door and a short man with bright red hair came into the office he reminded me of a troll willy this is herr gunther hes a detective if youre willing to forgive the fact that he liked the gypsy baron you might like to give him some assistance hes looking for a girl an actress who was at a casting session here not so long ago willy smiled uncertainly revealing small uneven teeth that looked like a mouthful of rock salt nodded and said in a highpitched voice youd best come into my office herr gunther dont keep willy too long herr gunther otto instructed as i followed willys diminutive figure into the corridor he has an appointment in fifteen minutes willy turned on his heel and looked blankly at the studio manager otto sighed exasperatedly dont you ever write anything in your diary willy weve got that englishman coming from london films mr lyndonhaynes remember willy grunted something and then closed the door behind us he led the way along the corridor to another office and ushered me inside now what is this girls name he said pointing me to a chair lotte hartmann i dont suppose you know the name of the production company no but i know that she came here within the last couple of weeks he sat down and opened one of the desk drawers well there were only three films casting here this past month so it shouldnt be too difficult his short fingers picked out three files which he laid on the blotter and started to sort through their contents is she in trouble no its just that she may know someone who can help the police with an inquiry we are making this was true at least well if shes been up for a part this last month or so shell be in one of these files we may be short of attractive ruins in vienna but one thing weve got plenty of is actresses half of them are chocoladies mind you even at the best of times an actress is just a chocolady by another name he came to the end of one pile of papers and started on another i cant say i miss your lack of ruins i remarked im from berlin myself weve got ruins on an epic scale dont i know it but this englishman i have to see wants lots of ruins here in vienna just like berlin just like rosellini he sighed disconsolately i ask you what is there apart from the ring and the opera district i shook my head sympathetically what does he expect the wars been over for three years does he imagine that we delayed rebuilding just in case an english film crew turned up perhaps these things take longer in england than in austria it wouldnt surprise me considering the amount of redtape the british generate never known such a bureaucratic lot christ knows what im going to tell this fellow by the time they start filming theyll be lucky to find a broken window he skimmed a sheet of paper across the desk pinned to its top lefthand corner was a passportsized photograph lotte hartmann he announced i glanced at the name and the photograph it looks like it actually i remember her he said she wasnt quite what we were looking for on that occasion but i said i could probably find her something in this english production goodlooking ill say that much for her but to be frank with you herr gunther she isnt much of an actress a couple of walkon parts at the burgtheater during the war and thats about it still the english are making a film about the black market and so they want lots of chocoladies in view of lotte hartmanns particular experience i thought she could be one of them oh what experience is that she used to be a greeter at the casanova club and now shes a croupier at the casino oriental at least thats what she told me for all i know she could be one of the exotic dancers they have there anyway if youre looking for her thats the address she gave mind if i borrow this sheet be my guest one more thing if for any reason fräulein hartmann gets in contact with you id be grateful if you would keep this under your hat like it was a new toupee i stood up to leave thanks i said youve been very helpful oh and good luck with your ruins he grinned wryly yes well if you see any weak walls give them a shove theres a good fellow i was at the oriental that evening just in time for the first show at the girl dancing naked on the pagodalike dance floor to the accompaniment of a sixpiece orchestra had eyes that were as cold and hard as the blackest piece of pichlers porphyry contempt was written into her face as indelibly as the birds tattooed on her small girlish breasts a couple of times she had to stifle a yawn and once she grimaced at the gorilla who was detailed to watch over her in case anyone wanted to show the girl his appreciation when after fortyfive minutes she came to the end of her act her curtsy was a mockery of those of us who had watched it i waved to a waiter and transferred my attention to the club itself the wonderful egyptian night cabaret was how the oriental described itself on the book of matches i had collected from the brass ashtray and it was certainly greasy enough to have passed for something middle eastern at least in the clichéd eye of some setdesigner from sievering studios a long curving stairway led down into the moorishstyle interior with its gilt pillars cupolad ceiling and many persian tapestries on the mockmosaic walls the dank basement smell cheap turkish tobaccosmoke and number of prostitutes only added to the authentic oriental atmosphere i half expected to see the thief of baghdad sit down at the wooden marquetry table i had taken instead i got a viennese garterhandler you looking for a nice girl he asked if i were i wouldnt have come here the pimp read this the wrong way up and pointed out a big redhead who was seated at the anachronistic american bar i can get you nice and cosy with that one there no thanks i can smell her pants from here listen pifke that little chocolady is so clean you could eat your supper off her crotch im not that hungry perhaps something else then if its drip youre worried about i know where i can find some nice fresh snow with no footprints know what i mean he leaned forwards across the table a girl who hasnt even finished school yet how does a splash like that sound to you disappear swing before i shut your flap he leaned back suddenly slow your blood down pifke he sneered i was only trying to he yelped with pain as he found himself drawn to his feet by one sideburn held between belinskys forefinger and thumb you heard my friend he said with quiet menace and pushing the man away he sat down opposite me god i hate pimps he muttered shaking his head id never have guessed i said and waved again at the waiter who seeing the pimps manner of departure approached the table with more obsequiousness than an egyptian houseboy whatll you have i asked the american a beer he said two gossers i told the waiter immediately gentlemen he said and scuttled away well thats certainly made him more attentive i observed yeah well you dont come to the casino oriental for ritzy service you come to lose money on the tables or in a bed what about the floorshow you forgot the show the hell i did he laughed obscenely and proceeded to explain that he usually tried to catch the show at the oriental at least once a week when i told him about the girl with the tattoos on her breasts he shook his head with worldly indifference and for a while i was obliged to listen to him tell me about the strippers and exotic dancers hed seen in the far east where a girl with a tattoo was considered nothing to write home about this kind of conversation was of little interest to me and when after several minutes belinsky ran out of unholy anecdote i was glad to be able to change the subject i found königs girlfriend fräulein hartmann i announced yes where in the next room dealing cards the croupier the blonde piece with the tan and the icicle up her ass i nodded i tried to buy her a drink he said only i might as well have been selling brushes if youre going to ingratiate yourself with that one youve got your work cut out kraut shes so cold her perfume makes your nostrils ache perhaps if you were to kidnap her you might stand some chance i was thinking along similar lines seriously how low is your credit with the mps here in vienna belinsky shrugged its a real snakes ass but say what youve got in mind and ill tell you for sure hows this then the international patrol comes in here one night and arrests me and the girl on some pretext then they take us down to kärtnerstrasse where i start talking tough about how a mistake has been made maybe some money even changes hands to make it look really convincing after all people like to believe that all police are corrupt dont they so she and könig might appreciate that little bit of fine detail anyway when the police let us go i make out to lotte hartmann that the reason i helped her was because i find her attractive well naturally shes grateful and would like me to know it only shes got this gentleman friend maybe he can repay me somehow or other put some business my way that kind of thing i paused and lit a cigarette well what do you think in the first place belinsky said thoughtfully the ip isnt allowed in this joint theres a big sign at the front door to that effect your tenschilling entrance buys a nights membership to what is after all a private club which means the ip just cant come marching in here dirtying the carpet and scaring the flowerlady all right then i said they wait outside and work a spotcheck on people as they leave the club surely theres nothing to stop them doing that they pull lotte and me in on suspicion her of being a chocolady and me of working some racket the waiter arrived with our beers meanwhile the second show was starting belinsky swallowed a mouthful of his drink and sat back in his seat to watch i like this one he growled lighting his pipe shes got an ass like the west coast of africa just you wait until you see it puffing contentedly his pipe fixed between his grinning teeth belinsky kept his eyes on the girl peeling off her brassiere it might just work at that he said eventually only forget trying to bribe one of the americans no if its grease youre trying to simulate then it really has to be an ivan or a frenchy as it happens the cic has turned a russian captain in the ip apparently hes trying to work his passage to the united states so hes good for service manuals identitypapers tipoffs the usual kind of thing a fake arrest ought to be within his abilities and by a happy coincidence the russians are in the chair this month so it should be easy enough to arrange a night when hes on duty belinskys grin widened as the dancing girl eased her pants over her substantial backside to reveal a tiny gstring oh will you look at that he chuckled with schoolboyish glee put a nice frame around her ass and i could hang it on my wall he tossed back his beer and winked lasciviously at me ill say one thing for you krauts you build your women every bit as well as you build your automobiles my clothes actually seemed to fit me better my trousers had stopped hanging loose around my waist like a clowns pantaloons slipping into my jacket was no longer reminiscent of a schoolboy optimistically trying on his dead fathers suits and my shirtcollar was as snug about my neck as the bandage on a cowards arm there was no doubt that a couple of months in vienna had put some weight on me so that i now looked more like the man who had gone to a soviet pow camp and less like the man who had returned from one but while this pleased me i saw it as no excuse to get out of condition and i had resolved to spend less time sitting in the café schwarzenberg and to take more exercise it was the time of year when winters denuded trees were starting to bud and when the decision to wear an overcoat was no longer automatic with only a chalkmark of cloud on an otherwise uniformly blue board of sky i decided to take a walk around the ring and expose my pigments to the warm spring sunshine like a chandelier that is too big for the room in which it hangs so the official buildings on the ringstrasse built at a time of overbearing imperial optimism were somehow too grand too opulent for the geographical realities of the new austria a country of six million people austria was little more than the buttend of a very large cigar it wasnt a ring i went walking on so much as a wreath the american sentry outside the usrequisitioned bristol hotel had his pink face lifted up to catch the rays of the morning sun his russian counterpart guarding the similarly requisitioned grand hotel next door looked as if he had spent his whole life outdoors so dark were his features crossing on to the south side of the ring in order to be close to the park as i came up the schubertring i found myself near the russian kommendatura formerly the imperial hotel as a large red army staff car drew up outside the enormous red star and four caryatids that marked the entrance the car door opened and out stepped colonel poroshin he did not seem in any way surprised to see me indeed it was almost as if he had expected to find me walking there and for a moment he simply looked at me as if it had been only a few hours since i had sat in his office in the little kremlin in berlin i suppose my jaw must have dropped because after a second he smiled murmured dobraye ootra goodmorning and then carried on into the kommendatura followed closely by a couple of junior officers who stared suspiciously back at me while i stood there simply lost for words more than a little puzzled as to why poroshin should have turned up in vienna now i wandered back across the road to the café schwarzenberg narrowly escaping being hit by an old lady on a bicycle who rang her bell furiously at me i sat down at my usual table to give some thought to poroshins arrival on the scene and ordered a light snack my new fitness resolution already ruined the colonels presence in vienna seemed easier to explain with some coffee and cake inside of me there was after all no reason why he should not have come as an mvd colonel he could probably go wherever he liked that he had not said more to me or inquired as to how my efforts were going on behalf of his friend i thought was probably due to the fact that he had no wish to discuss the matter in front of the two other officers and he had only to pick up the telephone and ring the headquarters of the international patrol in order to discover if becker was still in prison or not all the same i had a feeling on the sole of my shoe that poroshins arrival from berlin was connected with my own investigation not necessarily for the better like a man who has breakfasted on prunes i told myself i was certain to notice something before very long each one of the four powers took administrative responsibility for the policing of the inner city for a month at a time in the chair was how belinsky had described it the chair in question was located in a meetingroom at the combined forces headquarters in the palais auersperg although it also affected who sat next to the driver in the international patrol vehicle but though the ip was an instrument of the four powers and subject in theory to orders from the combined forces for all practical purposes it was american operated and supplied all vehicles petrol and oil radios radio spares maintenance of the vehicles and the radios operation of the radio network system and organization of the patrols were the responsibility of the us th this meant that the american member of the patrol always drove the vehicle operated the radio and performed the firstechelon maintenance thus at least as far as the patrol itself was concerned the idea of the chair was a bit of a movable feast although the viennese referred to the four men in the jeep or sometimes the four elephants in the jeep in reality the jeep had long been abandoned as too small to accommodate a patrol of four men their shortwave transmitter not to mention any prisoners and a threequarterton command and reconnaissance vehicle was now the favoured mode of transport all this i learned from the russian corporal commanding the ip truck parked a short distance from the casino oriental on petersplatz in which i sat under arrest waiting for the kaprals colleagues to pick up lotte hartmann speaking neither french nor english and with only a smattering of german the kapral was delighted to find someone with whom he could have a conversation even if it was a russianspeaking prisoner im afraid i cant tell you very much about why youre being arrested apart from the fact that its for blackmarketeering he apologised youll find out more when we get to the kärtnerstrasse well both find out eh all i can tell you about is the procedure my captain will fill out an arrestform in duplicate everythings in duplicate and leave both copies with the austrian police theyll forward one copy to the military government publicsafety officer if youre held for trial in a military court a charge sheet will be prepared by my captain and if youre held for trial in an austrian court the local police will be instructed accordingly the kapral frowned to be honest with you we dont bother much with blackmarket offences these days or vice for that matter its smugglers were generally after or illegal emigrants those other three bastards think ive gone mad i can tell but ive got my orders i smiled sympathetically and said how i appreciated him explaining i was thinking of offering him a cigarette when the door of the truck opened and the french patrolman helped a very palelooking lotte hartmann to climb up beside me then he and the englishman came after her locking the door from the inside the smell of her fear was only marginally weaker than the cloying scent of her perfume where are they taking us she whispered to me i told her we were going to the kärtnerstrasse no talking is allowed said the english mp in appalling german prisoners will keep quiet until we reach headquarters i smiled quietly to myself the language of bureaucracy was the only second language that an englishman would ever be capable of speaking well the ip was headquartered in an old palace within a cigaretteends flick of the state opera the truck drew up outside and we were marched through huge glass doors and into a baroquestyle hall where an assortment of atlantes and caryatids showed the omnipresent hand of the viennese stonemason we went up a staircase that was as wide as a railway track past urns and busts of forgotten noblemen through a pair of doors that were longer than the legs of a circus tallman and into an arrangement of glassfronted offices the russian kapral opened the door of one of them ushered his two prisoners inside and told us to wait there what did he say fräulein hartmann asked as he closed the door behind him he said to wait i sat down lit a cigarette and looked about the room there was a desk four chairs and on the wall a large wooden noticeboard of the kind you see outside churches except that this one was in cyrillic with columns of chalked numbers and names headed wanted persons absentees stolen vehicles express messages part i orders and part ii orders in the column headed wanted persons appeared my own name and that of lotte hartmann belinskys pet russian was making things look very convincing have you any idea what this is all about she asked tremulously no i lied have you no of course not there must be some kind of mistake evidently you dont seem all that concerned or maybe you just dont understand that its the russians who ordered us to be brought here do you speak russian no of course not she said impatiently the american mp who arrested me said that this was a russian call and nothing to do with him well the ivans are in the chair this month i said reflectively what did the frenchman say nothing he just kept looking down the front of my dress he would i smiled at her its worth a look she gave me a sarcastic sort of smile yes well i dont think they brought me here just to see the wood stacked in front of the cabin do you she spoke with crisp distaste but accepted the cigarette i offered her all the same i cant think of a better reason she swore under her breath ive seen you havent i i said at the oriental what were you during the war an air spotter be nice maybe i can help you better help yourself first you can depend on that when the office door finally opened it was a tall burlylooking red army officer who came into the room he introduced himself as captain rustaveli and took a seat behind the desk look here demanded lotte hartmann would you mind telling me why ive been brought here in the middle of the night what the hell is going on all in good time fräulein he replied in flawless german please sit down she slumped on to a chair beside me and regarded him sullenly the captain looked at me herr gunther i nodded and told him in russian that the girl spoke only german shell think im a more impressive sonofabitch if you and i confine ourselves to a language she cant understand captain rustaveli stared coldly back at me and for a brief moment i wondered if something had gone wrong and belinsky had not managed to make it clear to this russian officer that our arrests were a putup job very well he said after a long moment nevertheless we shall at least have to go through the motions of an interrogation may i see your papers please herr gunther from his accent i took him for a georgian the same as comrade stalin i reached inside my jacket and handed over my identity card into which at belinskys suggestion i had inserted two bills while sitting in the truck rustaveli quickly slipped the money into his breeches pocket without blinking and out of the corner of my eye i saw lotte hartmanns jaw drop on to her lap very generous he murmured turning over my identity card in his hairy fingers then he opened a file with my name on it although quite unnecessary i can assure you theres her feelings to think of captain you wouldnt want me to disappoint her prejudice would you no indeed goodlooking wouldnt you say very a whore do you think that or something pretty close to it im only guessing of course but id say she was the type that likes to strip a man of a lot more than ten schillings and his underwear not the sort of girl to fall in love with eh it would be like putting your tail on an anvil it was warm in rustavelis office and lotte started to fan herself with her jacket allowing the russian several glimpses of her ample cleavage its rare that an interrogation is quite so amusing he said and looking down at his papers added she has nice tits thats the kind of truth i can really respect i guess its a lot easier for you russians to look at well whatever this little show has been laid on to achieve i hope you get to have her i cant think of a better reason to go to all this trouble me ive got a sexual disease my tail swells up every time i see a woman i guess that makes you a fairly typical russian rustaveli smiled wryly incidentally you speak excellent russian herr gunther for a german so do you captain for a georgian where are you from tbilisi stalins birthplace no thank god thats goris misfortune rustaveli closed my file that should be enough to impress her dont you think yes what shall i tell her you have information that shes a whore i explained so youre reluctant to let her go but you let me talk you into it well that seems to be in order herr gunther rustaveli said reverting to german again my apologies for having detained you now you may leave he handed back my identity card and i stood up and made for the door but what about me lotte moaned rustaveli shook his head im afraid you must stay fräulein the vice squad doctor will be here shortly he will question you regarding your work at the oriental but im a croupier she wailed not a chocolady that is not our information what information your name has been mentioned by several other girls what other girls prostitutes fräulein possibly you may have to submit yourself for a medical examination a medical what for for venereal disease of course venereal disease captain rustaveli i said above lottes rising cry of outrage i can vouch for this woman i wouldnt say i knew her very well but ive known her long enough to be able to state quite categorically that she is not a prostitute well he cavilled i ask you does she look like a prostitute frankly ive yet to meet an austrian girl who isnt selling it he closed his eyes for a second and then shook his head i cant go against the protocol these are serious charges many russian soldiers have been infected as i recall the oriental where fräulein hartmann was arrested is off limits to the red army i was under the impression that your men tended to go to the moulin rouge in walfischgasse rustaveli pursed his lips and shrugged that is true but nevertheless perhaps if i were to meet you again captain we might discuss the possibility of me compensating the red army for any embarrassment regarding a breach of the protocol in the meantime would you be able to accept my personal surety for the fräuleins good character rustaveli scratched his stubble thoughtfully very well he said your personal surety but remember i have your addresses you can always be rearrested he turned to lotte hartmann and told her that she was also free to leave thank god she breathed and sprang to her feet rustaveli nodded at the kapral standing guard on the other side of the grimy glass door and then ordered him to escort us out of the building then the captain clicked his heels and apologised for the mistake as much for the benefit of his kapral as for any effect it might have had on lotte hartmann she and i followed the kapral back down the big staircase our steps echoing up to the ornate cornicework on the high ceiling and through the arched glass doors into the street where he leaned over the pavement and spat copiously into the gutter a mistake eh he uttered a bitter laugh mark my words ill be the one that gets the blame for it i hope not i said but the man just shrugged adjusted his lambskin hat and trudged wearily back into his headquarters i suppose i ought to thank you lotte said tying up the collar of her jacket forget it i said and started walking towards the ring she hesitated for a moment and then tripped after me wait a minute she said i stopped and faced her again frontally her face was even more attractive than its profile as the length of her nose seemed less noticeable and she was not cold at all belinsky had been wrong about that mistaking cynicism for general indifference indeed i thought she seemed more apt to entice men although an evening of watching her in the casino had established that she was probably one of those unsatisfactory women who dangle intimacy only to withdraw it at a later stage yes what is it look youve already been very kind she said but would you mind walking me home it is very late for a decent girl to be on the streets and i doubt if ill be able to find a taxi at this time of night i shrugged and looked at my watch where do you live its not very far the rd bezirk in the british sector all right i sighed with a conspicuous lack of enthusiasm lead the way we walked eastwards along streets that were as quiet as a house of franciscan tertiaries you havent explained why you helped me she said breaking the silence after a while i wonder if thats what andromeda said when perseus had saved her from the seamonster you seem a little less obviously heroic herr gunther dont be fooled by my manners i told her ive got a whole chestful of medals down at my local pawnshop so youre not the sentimental type either no i like sentiment it looks fine on needlework and christmas cards only it doesnt make much of an engraving on the ivans or perhaps you werent looking oh i was looking all right it was very impressive the way you handled him i never knew the ivans could be greased like that you just have to know the right spot on the axle that kapral would probably have been too scared to take some drop and a major too proud not to mention the fact that id met our captain rustaveli before when he was plain lieutenant rustaveli and both he and his girlfriend had a dose of drip i got them some good penicillin for which he was very grateful you dont look like any swing heini i dont look like a swing i dont look like a hero what are you the head of casting at warner brothers i only wish i were she murmured and then anyway you started it you said to that ivan that i didnt look like a chocolady coming from you id say it almost sounded like a compliment like i said ive seen you at the oriental selling nothing worse than bad luck incidentally i hope youre a good cardplayer because im supposed to go back and give him something for your liberty assuming you actually want to stay out of the cement how much will that be a couple of hundred dollars ought to do it a couple of hundred her words echoed around schwarzenbergplatz as we came past a great fountain and crossed onto rennweg where am i going to get that kind of mouse same place you got the suntan and nice jacket i imagine failing that you could ask him to the club and deal him a few aces off the bottom of the deck i could if i were that good but im not thats too bad she was quiet for a moment as she gave the matter some thought maybe you could persuade him to take less after all you seem to speak pretty good russkie maybe i allowed i dont suppose it would do much good to go to court and protect my innocence would it with the ivans i laughed harshly you might just as well appeal to the goddess kali no i didnt think so we came up a side street or two and stopped outside an apartment building that was close by a small park would you like to come in for a drink she fumbled in her handbag for her key i know i could use one i could suck one out of the rug i said and followed her through the door upstairs and into a cosy solidly furnished apartment there was no ignoring the fact that lotte hartmann was attractive some women you look at them and calculate what modest length of time you would be willing to settle for generally the betterlooking the girl the less time with which you tell yourself you would be satisfied after all a really attractive woman might have to accommodate a lot of similar wishes lotte was the kind of girl with whom you could have been persuaded to settle for five steamy unfettered minutes just five minutes for her to let you and your imagination do what you wanted not too much to ask you would have thought the way things happened though it looked like she might actually have granted me rather longer than that perhaps even the full hour but i was dogtired and perhaps i drank a little too much of her excellent whisky to pay much attention to the way she bit her bottomlip and stared at me through those blackwidow eyelashes i was probably supposed to lie quietly on her bed with my muzzle resting on her impressively convex lap and let her fold my big floppy ears only i ended up falling asleep on the sofa when i awoke later that same morning i scribbled my address and telephone number on a piece of paper and leaving lotte asleep in bed i caught a taxi back to my pension there i washed changed my clothes and ate a large breakfast which did much to restore me i was reading the mornings wiener zeitung when the telephone rang a mans voice with only the smallest trace of a viennese accent asked me if it was speaking to herr bernhard gunther when i identified myself the voice said im a friend of fräulein hartmann she tells me that you very kindly helped her out of an awkward spot last night shes not exactly out of it yet i said quite so i was hoping that we could meet and discuss the matter fräulein hartmann mentioned the sum of for this russian captain also that you had offered to act as her intermediary did i i suppose i might have i was hoping i might give you the money to give to this wretched fellow and i should like to thank you personally i felt sure that this was könig but i stayed silent for a moment not wishing to seem too eager to meet him are you still there where do you suggest i asked reluctantly do you know the amalienbad on reumannplatz ill find it shall we say in one hour in the turkish baths all right but how will i recognize you you havent even told me your name yet no i havent he said mysteriously but ill be whistling this tune and with that he proceeded to whistle it down the line bella bella bella marie i said recognizing a melody that had been irritatingly ubiquitous some months before precisely that said the man and hung up it seemed a curiously conspiratorial mode of recognition but i told myself that if it was könig he had good reason to be cautious the amalienbad was in the th bezirk in the russian sector which meant catching a number south down favoritenstrasse the district was a workingclass quarter with lots of dirty old factories but the municipal baths on reumannplatz was a sevenstoreyed building of comparatively recent construction which without any apparent exaggeration advertised itself as the largest and most modern baths in europe i paid for a bath and a towel and after i had changed i went to find the mens steamroom this was at the far end of a swimming pool that was as big as a football field and possessed only a few viennese who wrapped in their bathsheets were trying to sweat off some of the weight that was rather easy to gain in the austrian capital through the steam at the far end of the luridlytiled room i heard someone whistling intermittently i walked towards the source of the tune and took it up as i approached i came upon the seated figure of a man with a uniformly white body and a uniformly brown face it looked almost as if he had blackedup like jolson but of course this disparity in colour was a souvenir of his recent skiing holiday i hate that tune he said but fräulein hartmann is always humming it and i couldnt think of anything else herr gunther i nodded circumspectly as if i had come there only reluctantly permit me to introduce myself my name is könig we shook hands and i sat down beside him he was a wellbuilt man with thick dark eyebrows and a large flourishing moustache it looked like some rare species of marten that had escaped on to his lip from some colder more northerly clime drooping over königs mouth this small sable completed a generally lugubrious expression which started with his melancholy brown eyes he was much as becker had described him but for the absence of the small dog i hope you like a turkish bath herr gunther yes when theyre clean then its lucky i chose this one he said instead of the dianabad of course the dianas wardamaged but the place does seem to attract rather more than its fair share of incurables and other assorted lower humans they go for the thermal pools they have there you take a dip at your peril you could go in with eczema and come out with syphilis it doesnt sound very healthy i dare say that im exaggerating a little könig smiled youre not from vienna are you no im from berlin i said i come and go from vienna how is berlin these days from what one hears the situation there is getting worse the soviet delegation walked out of the control commission did it not yes i said soon the only way in or out will be by military air transport könig made a tutting noise and rubbed his big hairy chest wearily communists he sighed thats what happens when you make deals with them it was terrible what happened at potsdam and yalta the amis just let the ivans take what they wanted a great mistake which makes another war a virtual certainty i doubt if anyones got the stomach for another one i said repeating the same line i had used on neumann in berlin this was a fairly automatic reaction with me but i genuinely believed it to be true not yet maybe but people forget and in time he shrugged who knows what may happen until then we carry on with our lives and our businesses doing the best that we can for a moment he rubbed his scalp furiously then he said what business are you in the only reason i ask is that i hoped that there might be some way in which i could repay you for helping fräulein hartmann such as putting a little business your way perhaps i shook my head its not necessary if you really want to know im in imports and exports but to be frank with you herr könig i helped her because i liked the smell of her scent he nodded appreciatively thats natural enough she is very lovely but slowly rapture gave way to perplexity strange though dont you think the way you were both picked up like that i cant answer for your friend herr könig but in my line of work there are always business rivals who would be glad to see me out of the way an occupational hazard you might say by fräulein hartmanns account its a hazard to which you seem more than equal i heard that you handled that russian captain quite expertly and she was most impressed that you could speak russian i was a plenny i said a pow in russia that would certainly explain it but tell me do you believe that this russian can be serious that there were charges made against fräulein hartmann im afraid he was very serious have you any idea where he could have got his information no more than i have about how he came to have my name perhaps the lady has someone with a tooth against her maybe you could find out who id be prepared to pay you not my line i said shaking my head the chances are that it was an anonymous tipoff probably done out of spite youd be wasting your money if youll take my advice youll just give the ivan what he wants and pay up two hundred is not a lot of coal to get a name off a file and when the ivans decide to keep a dog away from a bitch its best to settle the account without any trouble könig smiled and then nodded perhaps you are right he said but you know it has occurred to me that you and this ivan are in it together it would after all be a nice way of raising money wouldnt it the russian puts the squeeze on innocent people and you offer to act as intermediary he kept on nodding as he surveyed the subtlety of his own scheme yes it could be very profitable for someone with the right kind of background keep going i laughed maybe you can make an ox out of an egg surely you admit that its possible anything is possible in vienna but if you think im trying to give you some chocolate for a lousy two hundred thats your affair it may have escaped your attention könig but it was your ladyfriend who asked me to walk her home and you who asked me to come here frankly ive got better things to polish i stood up and made as if to leave please herr gunther he said accept my apologies perhaps i was allowing my imagination to run away with me but i must confess that this whole affair has me intrigued and even at the best of times i find myself suspicious with regard to so many things that happen today well that sounds like a recipe for a long life i said sitting down again in my own particular line of work it pays to be a little sceptical what line of work is that i used to be in advertising but that is an odious unrewarding business full of very small minds with no real vision i dissolved the company i owned and moved into business research the flow of accurate information is essential in all walks of commerce but it is something that one must treat with a degree of caution those who wish to be wellinformed must first equip themselves with doubt doubt breeds questions and questions beg answers these things are essential to the growth of any new enterprise and new enterprise is essential to the growth of a new germany you sound like a politician politics he smiled wearily as if the subject was too childish for him to contemplate a mere sideshow to the main event which is communism against the free world capitalism is our only hope of withstanding the soviet tyranny wouldnt you agree im no friend of the ivans i said but capitalism comes with its own particular faults but könig was hardly listening we fought the wrong war he said the wrong enemy we should have fought the soviets and only the soviets the amis know that now they know the mistake they made in letting russia have a free hand in eastern europe and theyre not about to let germany or austria go the same way i stretched my muscles in the heat and yawned wearily könig was beginning to bore me you know he said my company could use a man with your special talents a man with your background which part of the ss was it that you were in noting the surprise that must have appeared on my face he added the scar under your arm doubtless you too were keen to remove your ss tattoo before being captured by the russians he lifted his own arm to reveal an almost identical scar in his armpit i was with military intelligence the abwehr when the war ended i explained not the ss that was much earlier but he had been right about the scar the result of an obliterating and excrutiatingly painful burn sustained from the muzzle flash of an automatic pistol i had fired underneath my upper arm it had been that or risk discovery and death at the hands of the nkvd könig himself offered no explanation for the removal of his own tattoo instead he proceeded to expand on his offer of employment this was all much more than i had hoped for but i still had to be careful it was only a few minutes since he had all but accused me of working in consort with captain rustaveli its not that working for someone else gives me the livers or anything i said but right now ive got another bottle to finish i shrugged maybe when thats empty who knows but thanks anyway he did not seem offended that i had declined his offer and merely shrugged philosophically where can i find you if i ever change my mind fräulein hartmann at the casino oriental will know where to contact me he collected a folded newspaper from beside his thigh and handed it to me open it carefully when you get outside there are two bills to pay off the ivan and one for your trouble at that moment he groaned and took hold of his face baring incisors and canines that were as even as a row of tiny milkbottles observing my eyebrows and mistaking their inquiry for concern he explained that he was quite all right but that he had recently been fitted with two dental plates i cant seem to get used to having them in my mouth he said and briefly allowed the blind slow worm that was his tongue to squirm along the upper and lower galleries of his jaw and when i see myself in a mirror its like having some perfect stranger grinning back at me most disconcerting he sighed and shook his head sadly a pity really i always had such perfect teeth he stood up adjusting the sheet around his chest and then shook my hand it was a pleasure meeting you herr gunther he said with easy viennese charm no the pleasure was all mine i replied könig chuckled well make an austrian out of you yet my friend then he walked off into the steam whistling that same maddening tune theres nothing the viennese love more than getting cosy they look to achieve this conviviality in bars and restaurants to the accompaniment of a musical quartet comprising a bass a violin an accordion and a zither a strange instrument which resembles an empty box of chocolates with thirty or forty strings that are plucked like a guitar for me this omnipresent combination embodies everything that was phoney about vienna like the syrupy sentiment and the affected politeness it did make me feel cosy only it was the kind of cosiness you might have experienced after you had been embalmed sealed in a leadlined coffin and tidily deposited in one of those marble mausoleums up at the central cemetery i was waiting for traudl braunsteiner in the herrendorf a restaurant on herrengasse the place was her choice but she was late when at last she arrived her face was red because she had been running and also because of the cold you have a less than catholic air about you the way you sit there in the shadows she said sitting down at the dinner table i work at that i said nobody wants a detective who looks as honest as the village postmaster being dimly lit is good for business i waved to a waiter and we quickly ordered emils upset that you havent been to see him lately traudl said giving up her menu if he wants to know what ive been doing tell him ill be sending him a bill for a shoerepair ive walked all over this damned city you know he goes to trial next week dont you im not likely to be able to forget it what with liebl telephoning nearly every day emils not about to forget it either she spoke quietly obviously upset im sorry i said that was a stupid thing to say look i do have some good news ive finally spoken to könig her face lit up with excitement you have she said when where this morning i said at the amalienbad what did he say he wanted me to work for him i think it might not be a bad idea as a way of getting close enough to him to find some sort of evidence couldnt you just tell the police where he is so that they can arrest him on what charge i shrugged as far as the police are concerned theyve already got their man cold anyway even if i could persuade them to do it könig wouldnt be so easy to clip the americans cant go into the russian sector and arrest him even if they wanted to no emils best chance is that i gain königs confidence as quickly as possible and thats why i turned down his offer traudl bit her lip with exasperation but why i dont understand i have to make sure that könig believes i dont want to work for him he was slightly suspicious of the way in which i got to meet his girlfriend so heres what i want to do lottes a croupier at the oriental i want you to give me some money to lose there tomorrow night enough to make it look like ive been cleaned out which would give me a reason to reconsider königs offer this counts as legitimate expenses does it im afraid it does how much three or four thousand schillings ought to do it she thought for a minute and then the waiter arrived with a bottle of riesling when he had filled our glasses traudl sipped some of her wine and said all right then but only on one condition that im there to watch you lose it from the set of her jaw i judged her to be quite determined i dont suppose it would do much good to remind you that it could be dangerous its not as if you could accompany me i cant afford to be seen with you in case somebody recognizes you as emils girl if this werent such a quiet place i would have insisted that we met at your house dont worry about me she said firmly ill treat you like you were a sheet of glass i started to speak again but she held her hands over her small ears no im not listening to any more im coming and thats final youre a spinner if you think that im just going to hand over schillings without keeping an eye on what happens to it you have a point i stared at the limpid disc of wine in my glass for a moment and then said you love him a lot dont you traudl swallowed hard and nodded vigorously after a short pause she added im carrying his child i sighed and tried to think of something encouraging to say to her look i mumbled dont worry well get him out of this mess theres no need to be the cockroach come on come out of the dumps everything will work out for you and the baby im sure of it a pretty inadequate speech i thought and lacking any real conviction traudl shook her head and smiled im all right really i am i was just thinking how the last time i was here was with emil when i told him that i was pregnant we used to come here a lot i never meant to fall in love with him you know nobody ever means to do it i noticed that my hand was on hers it just happens that way like a car accident but looking at her elfin face i wasnt sure if i agreed with what i was saying her beauty wasnt the kind thats left smeared on your pillowcase in the morning but the kind that would make a man proud that his child should have such a mother i realized how much i envied becker this woman how much i myself would have wanted to fall in love with her if she had come my way i let go her hand and quickly lit a cigarette to hide behind some smoke the next evening found me hurrying from its sharp edge and hint of snow although the calendar suggested something less inclement and into the warm lubricious fug of the casino oriental my pockets packed tight with wads of emil beckers easy money i bought quite a lot of the highest denomination chips and then wandered over to the bar to await lottes arrival at one of the cardtables having ordered a drink all i had to do was shoo away the sparklers and the chocoladies that buzzed around intent on keeping me and my wallet company which left me with a keener appreciation of what it must be like to be a horses ass in high summer it was ten oclock before lotte showed up at one of the tables by which time the flick of my tail was becoming more apathetic i delayed another few minutes for appearances sake before carrying my drink over to lottes stretch of green baize and sitting down directly opposite her she surveyed the pile of chips that i neatly arranged in front of me and made an equally neat purse of her lips i didnt figure you for a quirk she said meaning a gambler i thought you had more sense maybe your fingers will be lucky for me i said brightly i wouldnt bet on it yes well ill certainly bear that in mind im not much of a cardplayer i couldnt even have named the game i was playing so it was with some considerable surprise that at the end of twenty minutes play i realized that i had almost doubled my original stock of chips it seemed a perverse logic that trying to lose money at cards should be every bit as difficult as trying to win it lotte dealt from the shoe and once again i won glancing up from the table i noticed traudl seated opposite me nursing a small pile of chips i hadnt seen her come into the club but by now the place was so busy that i would have missed rita hayworth i guess its my lucky night i remarked to no one in particular as lotte raked my winnings towards me traudl merely smiled politely as if i had been a stranger to her and prepared to make her next modest bet i ordered another drink and concentrating hard tried to make a go of being a real loser taking a card when i should have stayed betting when i should have folded and generally trying to sidestep luck at every available opportunity now and again i tried to play sensibly in order to make what i was doing appear less obvious but after another forty minutes i had succeeded in losing all of what i had won as well as half my original capital when traudl left the table having seen me lose enough of her boyfriends money to be satisfied that it had been used for the purpose i had stated i finished my drink and sighed exasperatedly it looks as if its not my lucky night after all i said grimly lucks got nothing to do with the way you play lotte murmured i just hope you were more skilful in dealing with that russian captain oh dont worry about him hes taken care of you wont have any more problems there im glad to hear it i gambled my last chip lost it and then stood up from the table saying that maybe i was going to be grateful for königs offer of a job after all smiling ruefully i walked back to the bar where i ordered a drink and for a while watched a topless girl dancing in a parody of a latin american step on the floor to the tinny jerking sound of the orientals jazz band i didnt see lotte leave the table to make a telephone call but after a while könig came down the stairs into the club he was accompanied by a small terrier which stayed close to his heels and a taller more distinguishedlooking man who was wearing a schiller jacket and a clubtie this second man disappeared through a bead curtain at the back of the club while könig made a pantomime of catching my eye he walked over to the bar nodding to lotte and producing a fresh cigar from the top pocket of his green tweed suit as he came herr gunther he said smiling how nice to meet you again hello könig i said how are your teeth my teeth his smile vanished as if i had asked him how his chancre was dont you remember i explained you were telling me about your plates his face relaxed so i was theyre much better thank you tipping in a smile again he added i hear youve had some bad luck at the tables not according to fräulein hartmann she told me that luck has nothing at all to do with the way i play cards könig finished lighting his fourschilling corona and chuckled then you must allow me to buy you a drink he waved the barman over ordered a scotch for himself and whatever i was drinking did you lose much more than i could afford i said unhappily about schillings i drained my glass and pushed it across the bartop for a refill stupid really i shouldnt play at all i have no real aptitude for cards so im cleaned out now i toasted könig silently and swallowed some more vodka thank god i had the good sense to pay my hotel bill well in advance apart from that theres very little to feel happy about then you must allow me to show you something he said and puffed at his cigar vigorously he blew a large smoke ring into the air above his terriers head and said time for a smoke lingo whereupon and much to its owners amusement the brute leaped up and down sniffing excitedly at the tobaccoenriched air like the most craven nicotine addict thats a neat trick i smiled oh its no trick said könig lingo loves a good cigar almost as much as i do he bent down and patted the dogs head dont you boy the dog barked by way of reply well whatever you call it its money not laughs i need right now at least until i can get back to berlin you know its fortunate you happened to come along i was sitting here wondering how i might manage to broach the subject of that job with you again my dear fellow all in good time theres someone i want you to meet first he is the baron von bolschwing and he runs a branch of the austrian league for the united nations here in vienna its a publishing house called österreichischer verlag hes an old comrade too and i know he would be interested to meet a man like yourself i knew könig was referring to the ss he wouldnt be associated with this research company of yours would he associated yes associated he allowed accurate information is essential to a man like the baron i smiled and shook my head wryly what a town this is for saying goingaway party when what you really mean is a requiem mass your research sounds rather like my imports and exports herr könig a fancy ribbon round a rather plain cake i cant believe that a man who served with the abwehr could be much of a stranger to these necessary euphemisms herr gunther however if you wish me to do so i will as the saying goes uncover my batteries for you but let us first move away from the bar he led me to a quiet table and we sat down the organization of which i am a member is fundamentally an association of german officers the primary aim and purpose of which is the collection of research excuse me intelligence as to the threat that the red army poses to a free europe although military ranks are seldom used nevertheless we exist under military discipline and we remain officers and gentlemen the fight against communism is a desperate one and there are times when we must do things we may find unpleasant but for many old comrades struggling to adjust to civilian life the satisfaction of continuing to serve in the creation of a new free germany outweighs such considerations and there are of course generous rewards it sounded as if könig had said these words or their equivalent on a number of other occasions i was beginning to think that there were more old comrades whose struggle to adjust to civilian life was remedied by the simple expedient of continuing under a form of military discipline than i could guess at he spoke a lot more most of which went in one ear and out of the other and after a while he drained the remainder of his drink and said that if i were interested in his proposition then i should meet the baron when i told him that i was very much interested he nodded satisfiedly and steered me towards the bead curtain we came along a corridor and then went up two flights of stairs these are the premises of the hat shop next door explained könig the owner is a member of our org and allows us to use them for recruiting he stopped outside a door and knocked gently hearing a shout he ushered me into a room which was lit only by a lamppost outside but it was enough to make out the face of the man seated at a desk by the window tall thin cleanshaven darkhaired and balding i judged him to be about forty sit down herr gunther he said and pointed at a chair on the other side of the desk i removed the stack of hatboxes that lay on it while könig went over to the window behind the baron and sat on the deep sill herr könig believes you might make a suitable representative for our company said the baron you mean an agent dont you i said and lit a cigarette if you like i saw him smile but before that can happen its up to me to learn something of your personality and circumstances to question you in order that we might determine how best to use you like a fragebogen yes i understand lets start with your joining the s s said the baron i told him all about my service with kripo and the rsha and how i had automatically become an officer in the ss i explained that i had gone to minsk as a member of arthur nebes action group but having no stomach for the murder of women and children i had asked for a transfer to the front and how instead i had been sent to the wehrmacht war crimes bureau the baron questioned me closely but politely and he seemed the perfect austrian gentleman except that there was also about him an air of false modesty a surreptitious aspect to his gestures and a way of speaking that seemed to indicate something of which any true gentleman might have felt less than proud tell me about your service with the war crimes bureau this was between january and february i explained i had the rank of oberleutnant conducting investigations into both russian and german atrocities and where was this exactly i was based in berlin in blumeshof across from the war ministry from time to time i was required to work in the field specifically in the crimea and the ukraine later on in august the okw moved its offices to torgau because of the bombing the baron smiled a supercilious smile and shook his head forgive me he said its just that i had no idea that such an institution had existed within the wehrmacht it was no different to what happened within the prussian army during the great war i told him there have to be some accepted humanitarian values even in wartime i suppose there do sighed the baron but he did not sound convinced of this all right then what happened with the escalation of the war it became necessary to send all the ablebodied men to the russian front i joined general schorners northern army in white russia in february promoted hauptmann i was an intelligence officer in the abwehr yes i spoke a fair bit of russian by then some polish too the work was mostly interpreting and you were finally captured where königsberg in east prussia april i was sent to the copper mines in the urals where exactly in the urals if you dont mind outside sverdlovsk thats where i perfected my russian were you questioned by the nkvd of course many times they were very interested in anyone who had been an intelligence officer and what did you tell them frankly i told them everything i knew the war was over by that stage and so it didnt seem to matter much naturally i left out my previous service with the s s and my work with the okw the ss were taken to a separate camp where they were either shot or persuaded to work for the soviets in the free germany committee that seems to be how most of the german peoples police were recruited and i dare say the staatspolizei here in vienna quite so his tone was testy do carry on herr gunther one day a group of us were told that we were to be transferred to frankfurt an der oder this would be in december they said they were sending us to a rest camp there as you can imagine we thought that was pretty funny well on the transport train i overheard a couple of the guards say that we were bound for a uranium mine in saxony i dont suppose either of them realized i could speak russian can you remember the name of this place johannesgeorgenstadt in the erzebirge on the czech border thank you the baron said crisply i know where it is i jumped the train as soon as i saw a chance not long after we crossed the germanpolish border and then i made my way back to berlin were you at one of the camps for returning pows yes staaken i wasnt there for very long thank god the nurses there didnt think much of us plennys all they were interested in was american soldiers fortunately the social welfare office of the municipal council found my wife at my old address almost immediately youve been very lucky herr gunther said the baron in several respects wouldnt you say so helmut as i told you baron herr gunther is a most resourceful man said könig stroking his dog absently indeed he is but tell me herr gunther did no one debrief you about your experiences in the soviet union like who for instance it was könig who answered members of our organization have interrogated a great many returning plennys he said our people present themselves as social workers historical researchers that kind of thing i shook my head perhaps if i had been officially released instead of escaping yes said the baron that must be the reason in which case you must count yourself as doubly fortunate herr gunther because if you had been officially released we should now almost certainly have been obliged to take the precaution of having you shot in order to protect the security of our group you see what you said about the germans who were persuaded to work for the free germany committee was absolutely right it is these traitors who were usually released first of all sent to a uranium mine in erzebirge as you were eight weeks is as long as you could have been expected to have lived being shot by the russians would have been easier so you see we can now be confident of you knowing that the russians were happy for you to die the baron stood up now the interrogation evidently over i saw that he was taller than i had supposed könig slid off his window sill and stood beside him i pushed myself off my chair and silently shook the barons outstretched hand and then königs then könig smiled and handed me one of his cigars my friend he said welcome to the org during the next couple of days könig met me at the hat shop next to the oriental on several occasions in order to school me in the many elaborate and secret working methods of the org but first i had to sign a solemn declaration agreeing on my honour as a german officer not to disclose anything of the orgs covert activities the declaration also stipulated that any breach of secrecy would be severely punished and könig said that i would be welladvised to conceal my new employment not only from any friends and relatives but even and these were his precise words even from our american colleagues this and one or two other remarks he made led me to believe that the org was in fact fully funded by american intelligence so when my training considerably shortened in view of my experience with the abwehr was complete i irately demanded of belinsky that we should talk as quickly as possible whats eating you kraut he said when we met at a table i had reserved for us in a quiet corner at the café schwarzenberg if im not in my plate its only because youve been showing me the wrong map oh and hows that he set to work with one of his clovescented toothpicks you know damned well königs part of a german intelligence organization set up by your own people belinsky i know because theyve just finished recruiting me so either you put me in the picture or i go to the stiftskaserne and explain how i now believe that linden was murdered by an americansponsored organization of german spies belinsky looked around for a moment and then leaned purposefully across the table his big arms framing it as if he was planning to pick it up and drop it on my head i dont think that would be a very good idea he said quietly no perhaps you think you can stop me like the way you stopped that russian soldier i might just mention that as well perhaps i will kill you kraut he said it shouldnt be too difficult i have a gun with a silencer i could probably shoot you in here and nobody would notice thats one of the nice things about the viennese with someones brains spattered in their coffee cups theyd still try and mind their own fucking business he chuckled at the idea and then shook his head talking over me when i tried to reply but what are we talking about he said theres no need for us to fall out no need at all youre right maybe i should have explained before now but if you have been recruited by the org then youve undoubtedly been obliged to sign a secrecy declaration am i right i nodded maybe you dont take it very seriously but at least you can understand when i tell you that my government required me to sign a similar declaration and that i take it very seriously indeed its only now that i can take you into my complete confidence which is ironic im investigating the very same organization which your membership of now enables me to treat you as someone who no longer poses a security risk hows that for a bit of cockeyed logic all right i said youve given me your excuse now how about telling me the whole story i mentioned crowcass before now right the war crimes commission yes well how shall i put it the pursuit of nazis and the employment of german intelligence personnel are not exactly separate considerations for a long time the united states has been recruiting former members of the abwehr to spy on the soviets an independent organization was set up at pullach headed by a senior german officer to gather intelligence on behalf of cic the south german industrial utilization company the same when the org was set up they had explicit instructions about exactly who they might recruit this is supposed to be a clean operation you understand but for some time now weve had the suspicion that the org is also recruiting ss sd and gestapo personnel in violation of its original mandate we wanted intelligence people for gods sake not warcriminals my job is to find out the level of penetration that these outlawed classes of personnel have achieved within the org you with me i nodded but where did captain linden fit into this as i explained before linden worked in records its possible that his position at the us documents centre enabled him to act as a consultant to members of the org with regard to recruitment checking out people to see if their stories matched what could be discovered from their service records that kind of thing i am sure i dont have to tell you that the org is keen to avoid any possible penetration by germans who may have already been recruited by the soviets in their prison camps yes i said ive already had that explained to me in no uncertain terms maybe linden even advised them on who might have been worth recruiting but thats the bit were not sure about that and what this stuff your friend becker was playing courier with maybe he lent them some files when they were interrogating potential recruits who might have been under some suspicion i suggested no that simply couldnt have happened security at the centre is tighter than a clams ass you see after the war the army was scared your people might try to take the contents of the centre back that or destroy them you just dont walk out of that place with an armful of files all documentary examinations are onsite and must be accounted for then perhaps linden altered some of the files belinsky shook his head no weve already thought of that and checked back from the original log to every single one of the files which linden had sight of theres no sign of anything having been removed or destroyed it seems our best chance of finding out what the hell he was up to depends on your membership of the org kraut not to mention your best chance of finding something that will put your friend becker in the clear im almost out of time with that he goes to trial at the beginning of next week belinsky looked thoughtful maybe i could help you to cut a few corners with your new colleagues if i were to provide you with some highgrade soviet intelligence it could put you well in with the org of course it would have to be stuff that my people had seen already but the boys in the org wouldnt know that if i dressed it up with the right kind of provenance that would make you look like a pretty good spy how does that sound good while youre in such an inspired mood you can help me out of another fix after könig had got through instructing me in the use of the deadletter box he gave me my first assignment he did good what was it they want me to kill beckers girlfriend traudl that pretty little nurse he sounded quite outraged the one at the general hospital did they say why she came into the casino oriental to oversee me losing her boyfriends money i warned her about it but she wouldnt listen i guess it must have made them nervous or something but this wasnt the reason that könig had given me a bit of wetwork is often used as an early test of loyalty belinsky explained did they say how to do it im to make it look like an accident i said so naturally ill need to get her out of vienna as quickly as possible and thats where you come in can you organize a travel warrant and a rail ticket for her sure he said but try and persuade her to leave as much behind as possible well drive her across the zone and get her on a train at salzburg that way we can make it look as if shes disappeared maybe dead which would help you right lets just make sure that she gets safely out of vienna i told him if anyone has to take risks id rather it was me than her leave it to me kraut itll take a few hours to arrange but the little lady is as good as out of here i suggest that you go back to your hotel and wait for me to bring her papers then well go and pick her up in which case perhaps it would be better if you didnt speak to her before then she might not want to leave your friend becker to face the music on his own it would be better if we could just pick her up and drive out of here that way if she decides to protest about it there wont be much that she can do after belinsky had left to make the necessary arrangements i wondered if he would have been so willing to help get traudl safely out of vienna if he had seen the photograph which könig had given to me he had told me that traudl braunsteiner was an mvd agent knowing the girl as i did it seemed utterly absurd but for anyone else most of all a member of cic looking at the photograph that had been taken in a vienna restaurant in which traudl was evidently enjoying the company of a russian colonel of mvd whose name was poroshin things might have seemed rather less than clearcut there was a letter from my wife waiting for me when i returned to the pension caspian recognizing the tight almost childlike writing on the cheap manilla envelope crushed and grimy from a couple of weeks at the mercy of a haphazard postal service i balanced it on the mantelpiece in my sittingroom and stared at it for a while recollecting the letter to her that i had positioned similarly on our own mantelpiece at home in berlin and regretting its peremptory tone since then i had sent her only two telegrams one to say that i had arrived safely in vienna and giving my address and the other telling her that the case might take a little longer than i had first anticipated i dare say a graphologist could easily have analysed kirstens hand and made a pretty good job of convincing me that it indicated the letter inside had been written by an adulterous woman who was in the frame of mind to tell her inattentive husband that despite his having left her in gold she nevertheless intended divorcing him and using the money to emigrate to the united states with her handsome american schätzi i was still looking at the unopened envelope with some trepidation when the telephone rang it was shields and how are we doing today he asked in his overprecise german i am doing very well thank you i said mocking his way of speaking but he didnt seem to notice exactly how may i be of service to you herr shields well with your friend becker about to go to trial frankly i wondered what kind of detective you were i was asking myself whether you had come up with anything pertinent to the case if your client was going to get his worth he paused waiting for me to reply and when i said nothing he continued rather more impatiently so whats the answer have you found the vital piece of evidence that will save becker from the hangmans noose or does he take the drop ive found beckers witness if thats what you mean shields only i havent got anything that connects him with linden not yet anyway well you had better work fast gunther when trials commence in this city theyre apt to be a mite quick id hate to see you get round to proving a dead man innocent that looks bad all round im sure you would agree bad for you bad for us but worst of all for the man on the rope suppose i could set this other fellow up for you to arrest him as a material witness it was an almost desperate suggestion but i thought it worth a try theres no other way hed show up in court no at least it would give becker someone to point the finger at youre asking me to make a dirty mark on a shiny floor shields sighed i hate not to give the other side a chance you know so i tell you what im going to do ill have a word with my executive officer major wimberley and see what he recommends but i cant promise anything chances are the major will tell me to go balls out and get a conviction and to hell with your mans witness theres a lot of pressure on us to get a quick result here you know the brig doesnt like it when american officers are murdered in his city thats brigadiergeneral alexander o gorder commanding the th one tough sonofabitch ill be in touch thanks shields i appreciate it dont thank me yet mister he said i replaced the receiver and picked up my letter after id fanned myself with it and used it to clean my fingernails i tore it open kirsten was never much of a letterwriter she was more one for a postcard only a postcard from berlin was no longer likely to inspire much in the way of wishful thinking a view of the ruined kaiserwilhelm church or one of the bombedout opera house the execution shed at plotzensee i thought that it would be a good long while before there were any postcards sent from berlin i unfolded the paper and started to read dear bernie i hope this letter reaches you but things are so difficult here that it may not in which case i may also try to send you a telegram if only to tell you that everything is all right sokolovsky has demanded that the soviet military police should control all traffic from berlin to the west and this may mean that the mail does not get through the real fear here is that this will all turn into a fullscale siege of the city in an effort to push the americans the british and the french out of berlin although i dont suppose anyone would mind if we saw the back of the french nobody objects to the amis and the tommies bossing us around at least they fought and beat us but franz they are such hypocrites the fiction of a victorious french army is almost too much for a german to bear people say that the amis and the tommies wont stand by and see berlin fall to the ivans im not so sure about the british theyve got their hands full in palestine right now all books on zionist nationalism have been removed from berlin bookshops and libraries which seems only too familiar but just when you think that the british have more important things to do one hears that theyve been destroying more german shipping the sea is full of fish for us to eat and theyre blowing up boats do they want to save us from the russians in order that they can starve us one still hears rumours of cannibalism theres a story going around berlin that the police were called to a house in kreuzberg where downstairs neighbours had heard the sounds of a terrible commotion and found blood seeping through their ceiling they burst in and found an old couple dining off the raw flesh of a pony that they had dragged off the street and killed with rocks it may or may not be true but i have the terrible feeling that it is what is certain is that morale has sunk to new depths the skies are full of transport planes and troops of all four powers are increasingly jumpy you remember frau fersens son karl he came back from a russian pow camp last week but in very poor health apparently the doctor says that his lungs are finished poor boy she was telling me what hed said about his time in russia it sounds awful why ever didnt you talk to me about it bernie perhaps i would have been more understanding perhaps i could have helped i am conscious that i havent been much of a wife to you since the war and now that you are no longer here this seems harder to bear so when you come back i thought that maybe we could use some of the money you left so much money did you rob a bank to go on holiday somewhere to leave berlin for a while and spend time together meanwhile i have used some of the money to repair the ceiling yes i know you had planned on doing it yourself but i know how you kept putting it off anyway its done now and it looks very nice come home and see it soon i miss you your loving wife kirsten so much for my imaginary graphologist i reflected happily and poured myself the last of traudls vodka this had the immediate effect of melting my nervousness of telephoning liebl to report on my almost imperceptible progress to hell with belinsky i said to myself and resolved to solicit liebls opinion as to whether becker would or would not be best served by trying to obtain königs immediate arrest in order that he be forced to give evidence when liebl finally came on the line he sounded like a man who had just come to the telephone after falling down a flight of stairs his normally forthright and irascible manner was cowed and his voice was balanced precariously at the very edge of breakdown herr gunther he said and swallowed his way to a more decorous silence then i heard him take a deep breath as he took control of himself again theres been the most terrible accident fräulein braunsteiner has been killed killed i repeated dumbly how she was run over by a car liebl said quietly where it happened virtually on the doorstep of the hospital where she worked apparently it was instantaneous there was nothing they could do for her when was this just a couple of hours ago when she was coming off duty unfortunately the driver did not stop that part i could have guessed for myself he was scared probably possibly he had been drinking who knows austrians are such bad drivers did anyone see the the accident the words sounded almost angry in my mouth there are no witnesses so far but someone seems to recollect having seen a black mercedes driving rather too fast much farther along alser strasse christ i said weakly thats just around the corner to think i might even have heard the squeal of those cartyres yes indeed quite so liebl murmured but there was no pain it was so quick that she could not have suffered the car struck her in the middle of her back the doctor i spoke to said that her spine was completely shattered probably she was dead before she hit the ground where is she now in the morgue at the general hospital liebl sighed i heard him light a cigarette and take a long drag of smoke herr gunther he said we shall of course have to inform herr becker since you know him so much better than i oh no i said quickly i get enough rotten jobs without contracting to do that one as well take her insurance policy and her will along if it makes it any easier for you i can assure you that im every bit as upset about this as you are herr gunther theres no need to be yes youre right im sorry look i hate to sound callous but lets see if we cant use this to get an adjournment i dont know if this quite qualifies as compassionate liebl hummed its not as if they were married or anything she was going to have his baby for christs sake there was a brief shocked silence then liebl spluttered i had no idea yes youre right of course ill see what i can do do that but however am i going to tell herr becker tell him she was murdered i said he started to say something but i was not in a mood to be contradicted it was no accident believe me tell becker it was his old comrades who did it tell him that precisely hell understand see if it doesnt jog his memory a little perhaps now hell remember something he should have told me earlier tell him that if this doesnt make him give us everything he knows then he deserves a crushed windpipe there was a knock at the door belinsky with traudls travel papers tell him that i snapped and banged the receiver back onto its cradle then i crossed the floor of the room and hauled the door open belinsky held traudls redundant travel papers in front of him and gave them a jaunty wave as he came into the room too pleased with himself to notice my mood it took a bit of doing getting a pink as quickly as this he said but old belinsky managed it just dont ask me how shes dead i said flatly and watched his big face fall shit he said thats too bad what the hell happened a hitandrun driver i lit a cigarette and slumped into the armchair killed her outright ive just had beckers lawyer on the phone telling me it happened not far from here a couple of hours ago belinsky nodded and sat down on the sofa opposite me although i avoided his eye i still felt it trying to look into my soul he shook his head for a while and then produced his pipe which he set about filling with tobacco when he had finished he started to light the thing and in between firesustaining sucks of air he said forgive me for asking but you didnt change your mind did you about what i growled belligerently he removed the pipe from his mouth and glanced into the bowl before replacing it between his big irregular teeth i mean about killing her yourself finding the answer on my rapidly colouring face he shook his head quickly no of course not what a stupid question im sorry he shrugged all the same i had to ask you must agree its a bit of a coincidence isnt it the org asks you to arrange an accident for her and then almost immediately she gets herself knocked down and killed maybe you did it i heard myself say maybe belinsky sat forward on the sofa lets see now i waste all afternoon getting this unfortunate little fräulein a pink and a ticket out of austria then i knock her down and kill her in cold blood on my way here to see you is that it what kind of car do you drive a mercedes what colour black someone saw a black mercedes speeding further up the street from the scene of the accident i dare say ive yet to see the car which drives slowly in vienna and in case you hadnt noticed just about every other nonmilitary vehicle in this city is a black mercedes all the same i persisted maybe we should take a look at the front fenders and check for dents he spread his hands innocently as if he had been about to give the sermon on the mount be my guest only youll find dents all over the car there seems to be a law against careful driving here he sucked some more of his pipe smoke look bernie if you dont mind me saying so i think were in danger of throwing the handle after the axehead here its a real shame that traudls dead but theres no sense in you and me falling out over it who knows maybe it was an accident you know its true what i said about viennese drivers theyre worse than the soviets and they take some beating jesus its like a chariotrace on these roads now i agree that its a hell of a coincidence but its not an impossible one by any stretch of the imagination you must admit that surely i nodded slowly all right i admit its not impossible on the other hand maybe the org briefed more than one agent to kill her so that if you missed somebody else was bound to get her its not unusual for assassinations to be handled that way certainly not in my own experience anyway he paused and then pointed his pipe at me you know what i think i think that the next time you see könig you should simply keep quiet about it if he mentions it then you can assume that it probably was an accident and feel confident of taking the credit for it he searched in his jacket pocket and drew out a buffcoloured envelope which he threw into my lap it makes this a little less necessary but that cant be helped whats this from an mvd station near sopron close to the hungarian border its the details of mvd personnel and methods throughout hungary and lower austria and how am i supposed to account for this little lot i rather thought that you could handle the man who gave it to us frankly its just the sort of material that theyre keen on the mans name is yuri thats all you need to know there are map references and the location of the deadletter box hes been using theres a railway bridge near a little town called mattersburg on the bridge is a footpath and about twothirds of the way along the handrail is broken the top part is hollow cast metal all you have to do is collect your information from there once a month and leave some money and instructions how do i account for my relationship with him until quite recently yuri was stationed in vienna you used to buy identity papers for him but now hes getting more ambitious and you havent the money to buy what hes got to offer so you can offer him to the org cic has already assessed his worth weve had all were going to get out of him at least in the short term theres no harm done if he gives all the same stuff to the org belinsky relit his pipe and puffed vigorously while he awaited my reaction really he said theres nothing to it an operation of this sort is hardly deserving of the word intelligence believe me very few of them are but all in all a source like this and an apparently successful bit of murder leaves you pretty well accredited old man youll forgive my lack of enthusiasm i said drily only im beginning to lose sight of what im doing here belinsky nodded vaguely i thought you wanted to clear your old pitman maybe you havent been listening becker was never my friend but i really think he is innocent of lindens murder and so did traudl so long as she was alive this case really felt as if it was worthwhile there seemed to be some point in trying to prove becker innocent now im not so sure come on gunther belinsky said beckers life without his girl is still better than no life at all do you honestly think that traudl would have wanted you to give up maybe if she knew the kind of crap he was into the kind of people he was dealing with you know thats not true becker was no altarboy thats for sure but from what youve told me about her id bet she knew that theres not much innocence left anymore not in vienna i sighed and rubbed my neck wearily maybe youre right i conceded maybe its just me im used to having things being a little more welldefined than this a client came along paid my fee and id point my suit in whatever direction seemed appropriate sometimes i even got to solve a case thats a pretty good feeling you know but right now its like there are too many people near me telling me how to work as if ive lost my independence ive stopped feeling like a private investigator belinsky rocked his head on his shoulders like a man who has sold out of something explanations probably he made a stab at one all the same come on surely you must have worked undercover before now sure i said only it was with a sharper sense of purpose at least i got to see a criminals picture i knew what was right but this isnt clearcut anymore and its beginning to peel my reed nothing stays the same kraut the war changed everything for everyone private investigators included but if you want to see criminals photographs i can show you a hundred thousands probably warcriminals all of them photographs of krauts listen belinsky youre an american and youre a jew its a lot easier for you to see the right here me im a german for one brief dirty moment i was even in the ss if i met one of your warcriminals hed probably shake me by the hand and call me an old comrade he had no answer for that i found another cigarette and smoked it in silence when it was finished i shook my head ruefully maybe its just vienna maybe its being away from home for so long my wife wrote to me we werent getting along too well when i left berlin frankly i couldnt wait to leave and so i took this case against my better judgement anyway she says that she hopes we can start again and do you know i cant wait to get back to her and give it a try maybe i shook my head maybe i need a drink belinsky grinned enthusiastically now youre talking kraut he said one thing ive learned in this job if in doubt pickle it in alcohol it was late when we drove back from the melodies bar a nightclub in the st bezirk belinsky drew up outside my pension and as i got out of the car a woman stepped quickly out of the shadow of a nearby doorway it was veronika zartl i smiled thinly at her having drunk rather too much to care for any company thank god youve come she said ive waited hours then she flinched as through the open car door we both heard belinsky utter an obscene remark whats the matter i asked her i need your help theres a man in my room so whats new said belinsky veronika bit her lip hes dead bernie youve got to help me im not sure what i can do i said uncertainly wishing that wed stayed longer in the melodies i said to myself a girl ought not to trust anyone these days to her i said you know its really a job for the police i cant tell the police she groaned impatiently that would mean the vice squad the austrian criminal police public health officials and an inquest id probably lose my room everything dont you see all right all right what happened i think he had a heart attack her head dropped im sorry to bother you only there is no one else i can turn to i cursed myself again and then stuck my head back into belinskys car the lady needs our help i grunted without much enthusiasm thats not all she needs but he started the engine and added come on hop in the pair of you he drove to rotenturmstrasse and parked outside the bombdamaged building where veronika had her room when we got out of the car i pointed across the darkened cobbles of stephansplatz to the partly restored cathedral see if you cant find a tarpaulin over on the building site i told belinsky ill go up and take a look if theres something suitable bring it up to the second floor he was too drunk to argue instead he nodded dully and walked back towards the cathedral scaffolding while i turned and followed veronika up the stairs to her room a large lobstercoloured man of about fifty lay dead in her big oak bed vomiting is quite common in cases of congestive heart failure it covered his nose and mouth like a bad facial burn i pressed my fingers against the mans clammy neck how long has he been here three or four hours its lucky you kept him covered up i told her close that window i stripped the bedclothes from the dead mans body and started to raise the upper part of his torso give me a hand here i ordered what are you doing she helped me to bend the torso over the legs as if i had been trying to shut an overstuffed suitcase im keeping this bastard in shape i said a bit of chiropractic ought to slow up the stiffening and make it easier for us to get him in and out of the car i pressed down hard on the back of his neck and then blowing hard from my exertions pushed the man back against the pukestrewn pillows uncle heres been getting extra foodstamps i breathed he must weigh more than a hundred kilos its lucky weve got belinsky along to help is belinsky a policeman she asked sort of i said but dont worry hes not the kind of bull who cares much for the crime figures belinskys got other fish to fry he hunts nazi warcriminals i started to bend the dead mans arms and legs what are you going to do with him she said nauseously drop him on the railway line with him being naked it will look like the ivans gave him a little party and then threw him off a train with any luck the express will go over him and fit him with a good disguise please dont she said weakly he was very kind to me when id finished with the body i stood up and straightened my tie this is hard work on a vodka supper now where the hell is belinsky spotting the mans clothes which were laid neatly over the back of a diningchair by the grimy net curtains i said have you been through his pockets yet no of course not you are new at this game arent you you dont understand at all he was a good friend of mine evidently belinsky said coming through the door he held up a length of white material im afraid that this was all i could find what is it an altarcloth i think i found it in a cupboard inside the cathedral it didnt look like it was being used i told veronika to help belinsky wrap her friend in the cloth while i searched his pockets hes good at that belinsky told her he went through my pockets once while i was still breathing tell me honey were you and fat boy actually doing it when he was scythed out leave her alone belinsky blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth he chuckled but me i just hope i die in a good woman i opened the mans wallet and thumbed a fold of dollar bills and schillings on to the dressingtable what are you looking for asked veronika if im going to dispose of a mans body i like to know at least a little more about him than just the colour of his underwear his name was karl heim she said quietly i found a business card dr karl heim i said a dentist eh is he the one who got you the penicillin yes a man who liked to take precautions eh belinsky murmured from the look of this room i can understand why he nodded at the money on the dressingtable you had better keep that money sweetheart get yourself a new decorator there was another business card in heims wallet belinsky i said have you ever heard of a major jesse p breen from something called the dp screening project sure i have he said coming over and taking the card out of my fingers the dpsp is a special section of the th breen is the cics local liaison officer for the org if any of the orgs men get into trouble with the us military police breen is supposed to try and help them sort it out that is unless its anything really serious like a murder and i wouldnt put it past him to fix that as well providing the victim was anyone but an american or an englishman it looks as if our fat friend might have been one of your old comrades bernie while belinsky talked i quickly searched heims trouser pockets and found a set of keys in that case it might be an idea if you and i were to take a look around the good doctors surgery i said ive got a feeling in my socks that we might just find something interesting there we dumped heims naked body on a quiet stretch of railway track near the ostbahnhof in the russian sector of the city i was keen to leave the scene as quickly as possible but belinsky insisted on sitting in the car and waiting to see the train finish the job after about fifteen minutes a goods train bound for budapest and the orient came rumbling by and heims corpse was lost under its many hundreds of pairs of wheels for all flesh is grass belinsky intoned and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth and the flower fadeth cut that out will you i said it makes me nervous but the souls of the righteous are in the hand of god and there shall no torment touch them anything you say kraut come on i said lets get away from here we drove north to wahring in the th bezirk and an elegant threestorey house on türkenschanzplatz close to a decentsized park which was bisected by a small railway line we could have dropped our passenger out here said belinsky on his own doorstep and saved ourselves a trip into the russian sector this is the american sector i reminded him the only way to get thrown off a train round here is to travel without a ticket they even wait until the train stops moving thats uncle sam for you hey no youre right bernie hes better off with the ivans it wouldnt be the first time they threw one of our people off a train but id sure hate to be one of their trackmen damned dangerous id say we left the car and walked towards the house there was no sign that anyone was at home above the broad toothy grin of a short wooden fence the darkened windows on the white stuccoed house stared back like the empty sockets in a great skull a tarnished brass plate on the gatepost which with typical viennese exaggeration bore the name of dr karl heim consultant orthodontic surgeon not to mention most of the letters of the alphabet indicated two separate entrances one to heims residence and the other to his surgery you look in the house i said opening the front door with the keys ill go round the side and check the surgery anything you say belinsky produced a flashlight from his overcoat pocket seeing my eyes fasten on the torch he added whats the matter you scared of the dark or something he laughed here you take it i can see in the dark in my line of work you have to i shrugged and relieved him of the light then he reached inside his jacket and took out his gun besides he said screwing on the silencer i like to keep one hand free for turning door handles just watch who you shoot i said and walked away round the side of the house i let myself in through the surgery door and after closing it quietly behind me again switched on the torch i kept the light on the linoleum floor and away from the windows in case a nosy neighbour happened to be keeping an eye on the place i found myself in a small reception and waiting area which was home to a number of potted plants and a tankful of terrapins it made a change from goldfish i told myself and mindful of the fact that their owner was now dead i sprinkled some of the foulsmelling food that they ate on to the surface of their water that was my second good deed of the day charity was beginning to be a bit of a habit with me behind the reception desk i opened the appointmentbook and pointed the torch beam on to its pages it didnt look like heim had much of a practice to leave to his competition always assuming he had any there wasnt a lot of spare money around for curing toothache these days and i didnt doubt that heim would have made a better living selling drugs on the black market turning back the pages i could see that he averaged no more than two or three appointments a week several months back in the book i came across two names i knew max abs and helmut könig both of them were marked down for full extractions within a few days of each other there were lots of other names listed for full extractions but none that i recognized i went over to the filing cabinets and found them mostly empty with the exception of one that contained details only of patients prior to the cabinet didnt look as if it had been opened since then which struck me as odd as dentists tend to be quite meticulous about such things and indeed the heim of pre had been conscientious with his patients records detailing residual teeth fillings and denturefitting marks for each one of them had he just got sloppy i wondered or had an inadequate volume of business ceased to make such careful records worthwhile and why so many full extractions of late it was true the war had left a great many men myself included with poor teeth in my case this was one legacy of a years starvation as a soviet prisoner but nevertheless i had still managed to keep a full set and there were plenty of others like me what need for könig then who i remembered telling me that he had had such good teeth to have had all of his teeth extracted or did he simply mean that his teeth had been good before they went bad while none of this was enough for conan doyle to have turned into a short story it certainly left me puzzled the surgery itself was much like any other i had ever been in a little dirtier perhaps but then nothing was as clean as it had been before the war beside the blackleather chair stood a large cylinder of anaesthetic gas i turned the tap at the neck of the bottle and hearing a hissing sound switched it off again everything looked like it was in proper working order beyond a locked door was a small storeroom and it was there that belinsky found me find anything he said i told him about the lack of records youre right belinsky said with what sounded like a smile that doesnt sound at all german i flashed the torch over the shelves in the storeroom hello he said what have we got here he reached out to touch a steel drum on the side of which was painted in yellow the chemical formula h so i wouldnt if i were you i said that stuffs not from a schoolboys chemistry set unless im very much mistaken its sulphuric acid i moved the torch beam up the side of the drum to where the words extreme caution were also painted enough to turn you into a couple of litres of animal fat kosher i hope belinsky said what does a dentist want with a drumload of sulphuric acid for all i know he soaks his false teeth in it overnight on a shelf beside the drum piled one on top of the other were several kidneyshaped steel trays i picked one of them up and brought it under the beam of the torch the two of us stared at what looked like a handful of oddshaped peppermints all stuck together as if they had been halfsucked and then saved by some disgusting small boy but there was also dried blood on some of them belinskys nose wrinkled with disgust what the hell are these teeth i handed him the torch and picked one of the spiky white objects out of the tray to hold it up to the light extracted teeth and several mouthfuls of them too i hate dentists belinsky hissed he fumbled in his waistcoat and found one of his picks to chew id say these normally end up in the drum of acid so but belinsky had noticed my interest what kind of dentist does nothing but full extractions i asked the appointmentbook is booked for nothing but full extractions i turned the tooth in my fingers would you say that there was much wrong with this molar it hasnt even been filled it looks like a perfectly healthy tooth agreed belinsky i stirred the sticky mass in the tray with my forefinger same as the rest of them i observed im no dentist but i dont see the point of pulling teeth that havent even been filled yet maybe heim was on some kind of piece work maybe the guy just liked to pull teeth better than he liked keeping records there are no records for any of his recent patients belinsky picked up another kidneytray and inspected its contents another full set he reported but something rolled in the next tray it looked like several tiny ball bearings well what have we here he picked one up and regarded it with fascination unless im very much mistaken i should say each one of these little confections contains a dose of potassium cyanide lethal pills thats right they were very popular with some of your old comrades kraut especially the ss and senior state and party officials who might have had the guts to prefer suicide to being captured by the ivans i believe that these were originally developed for german secret agents but arthur nebe and the ss decided that the top brass had a greater need of them a man would have his dentist make him a false tooth or use an existing cavity and then put this little baby inside nice and snug youd be surprised when he was captured he might even have a decoy cyanide brass cartridge in his pocket which meant our people wouldnt bother with a dental examination and then when the man had decided the right time had come he would work off the false tooth tongue out this capsule and chew the thing until it broke death is almost instantaneous thats how himmler killed himself goering too i heard no said belinsky he used one of the decoys an american officer smuggled it back to him while he was in gaol how about that eh one of our own people going soft on the fat bastard like that he dropped the capsule back into the tray and handed it to me i poured a few into my hand to get a closer look it seemed almost astonishing that things which were so small could also be so deadly four tiny seed pearls for the deaths of four men i did not think i could have carried one in my mouth false tooth or not and still enjoyed my dinner you know what i think kraut i think weve got ourselves a lot of toothless nazis running round vienna i followed him back into the surgery i take it that youre familiar with dental techniques for the identification of the dead as familiar as the next bull i said it was damned useful after the war he said the best way we had of establishing the identity of a corpse naturally enough there were many nazis who were keen for us to believe that they were dead and they went to a great deal of trouble to try and persuade us of it halfcharred bodies carrying false papers you know the sort of thing well of course the first thing we did was have a dentist take a look at a corpses teeth even if you dont have a mans dental records you can at least determine his age from his teeth periodontosis root resorption etc you can say for sure that a corpse isnt who it is supposed to be belinsky paused and looked about the surgery you finished looking around in here i told him i was and asked if he had found anything in the house he shook his head and said he hadnt then i said that we had better get the hell out of there he resumed his explanation as we climbed into the car take the case of heinrich müller chief of the gestapo he was last seen alive in hitlers bunker in april müller was supposed to have been killed in the battle for berlin in may but when after the war his body was exhumed a dental expert specializing in jawbone surgery at a berlin hospital in the british sector couldnt identify the teeth in the corpse as those belonging to a fortyfouryearold male he thought that the corpse was more probably that of a man of no more than twentyfive belinsky turned the ignition gunned the engine for a second or two and then slipped the car into gear crouched over the steeringwheel he drove badly for an american doubledeclutching missing his gears and generally oversteering it was clear to me that driving required all of his attention but he continued with his calm explanation even after we had almost killed a passing motorcyclist when we catch up with some of these bastards theyve got false papers new hairstyles moustaches beards glasses you name it but teeth are as good as a tattoo or sometimes a fingerprint so if any of them have had all their teeth pulled it removes yet another possible means of identification after all a man who can explode a cartridge under his arm to remove an ss number probably wouldnt baulk at wearing false teeth would he i thought of the burn scar under my own arm and reflected that he was probably right to disguise myself from the russians i would certainly have resorted to having my teeth out assuming that i would have the same opportunity for painless extraction as max abs and helmut könig no i guess not you can bet your life on it which is why i stole heims appointmentbook he patted the breast of his coat where i assumed he was now keeping it it might be interesting to find out who these men with bad teeth really are your friend könig for instance and max abs too i mean why would a little ss chauffeur feel the need to disguise what he had in his mouth unless he wasnt an ss corporal at all belinsky chuckled enthusiastically at the thought of it thats why i have to be able to see in the dark some of your old comrades really know how to mix the maps you know i wouldnt be at all surprised if were still chasing some of these nazi bastards when their kids are having to sugar their strawberries for them all the same i said the longer it is before you catch them the harder it will be to get a positive identification dont you worry he snarled vindictively there wont be a shortage of witnesses willing to come forward and testify against these shits or perhaps you think people like müller and globocnik should be allowed to get away with it whos globocnik when hes having a party odilo globocnik he headed up operation reinhard establishing most of the big death camps in poland another one who is supposed to have committed suicide in so come on what do you think theres a trial going on in nuremberg right now otto ohlendorf commander of one of those s s special action groups do you think he should hang for his war crimes war crimes i repeated wearily listen belinsky i worked in the wehrmachts war crimes bureau for three years so dont think you can lecture me about fucking war crimes im just interested to know where you stand kraut exactly what kind of war crimes did you jerries investigate anyway atrocities by both sides youve heard of katyn forest of course you investigated that i was part of the team how about that he seemed genuinely surprised most people were frankly i think that the idea of charging fighting men with war crimes is absurd the murderers of women and children should be punished yes but it wasnt just jews and poles who were killed by people like müller and globocnik they murdered germans too perhaps if youd given us half a chance we could have brought them to justice ourselves belinsky turned off wahringer strasse and drove south past the long edifice of the general hospital and on to alser strasse where encountering the same recollection as myself he slowed the car to a more respectful pace i could tell he had been about to answer my point but now he grew quiet almost as if he felt obliged to avoid giving me any cause for offence drawing up outside my pension he said did traudl have any family not that i know of theres just becker i wondered at that though the photograph of her and colonel poroshin still preyed on my mind well thats all right im not going to lose any sleep worrying about his grief hes my client in case youd forgotten in helping you im supposed to be working to prove him innocent and youre convinced of that yes i am but surely you must know hes on the crowcass list youre pretty cute i said dumbly letting me make all the running like this only to tell me that supposing that i do get lucky and win the race am i going to be allowed to collect the prize your friend is a murdering nazi bernie he commanded an execution squad in the ukraine massacring men women and children id say that he deserved to hang whether he killed linden or not youre pretty cute belinsky i repeated bitterly and started to get out of the car but as far as im concerned hes small fry im after bigger fish than emil becker you can help me you can try and repair some of the damage that your country has done a symbolic gesture if you like who knows if enough germans do the same then maybe the account could be settled what are you talking about i said from the road what account i leaned on the car door and bent forward to see belinsky take out his pipe gods account he said quietly i laughed and shook my head in disbelief whats the matter dont you believe in god i dont believe in trying to make a deal with him you speak about god as if he sells secondhand cars ive misjudged you youre much more of an american than i thought you were now thats where youre wrong god likes making deals look at that covenant he made with abraham and with noah gods a huckster bernie only a german could mistake a deal for a direct order get to the point will you there is a point isnt there his manner seemed to indicate as much im going to level with you oh i seem to remember you doing that a little earlier on everything i told you was true theres just more to come right belinsky nodded and lit his pipe i felt like smacking it out of his mouth instead i got back into the car and closed the door with your penchant for selective truth you should get a job in an advertising agency lets hear it just dont make a hot throat at me until im through right i nodded curtly all right for a start we crowcass believe becker is innocent of lindens murder you see the gun which killed him was used to kill somebody else in berlin almost three years ago the ballistics people matched that bullet with the one that killed linden and they were both fired from the same gun for the time of the first killing becker has a pretty good alibi he was a russian prisoner of war of course he could have acquired the gun since then but i havent come to the interesting part yet the part that actually makes me want becker to be innocent the gun was a standard ssissue walther p we traced the serialnumber records held at the us documents centre and discovered that this same pistol was one of a batch that was issued to senior officers within the gestapo this particular weapon was given to heinrich müller it was a long shot but we compared the bullet that killed linden with the one that killed the man we dug up who was supposed to be müller and what do you know jackpot whoever killed linden might also have been responsible for putting a false heinrich müller in the ground do you see bernie its the best clue that weve ever had that gestapo müller is still alive it means that only a few months ago he might have been right here in vienna working for the org of which you are now a member he may even still be here do you know how important that is think about it please müller was the architect of the nazi terror for ten years he controlled the most brutal secret police the world has ever known this was a man almost as powerful as himmler himself can you imagine how many people he must have tortured how many deaths he must have ordered how many jews poles even how many germans he must have killed bernie this is your opportunity to help avenge all those dead germans to see that justice is done i laughed scornfully is that what you call it when you let a man hang for something he didnt do correct me if im wrong belinsky but isnt that part of your plan to let becker take the drop naturally i hope that it doesnt come to that but if its necessary then so be it so long as the military police have becker müller wont be spooked and if that includes hanging him yes knowing what i know about emil becker i wont lose much sleep belinsky watched my face carefully for some sign of approval come on youre a cop you appreciate how these things work dont tell me youve never had to nail a man for one thing because you couldnt prove another it all evens up you know that sure ive done it but not when a mans life was involved ive never played games with a mans life provided you help us to find müller were prepared to forget about becker the pipe emitted a short smoke signal which seemed to bespeak a growing impatience on its owners part look all im suggesting is that you put müller in the dock instead of becker and if i do find müller what then hes not about to let me walk up and put the cuffs on him how am i supposed to bring him in without getting my head blown off you can leave that to me all you have to do is establish exactly where he is telephone me and my crowcass team will do the rest how will i recognize him belinsky reached behind his seat and brought back a cheap leather briefcase he unzipped it and took out an envelope from which he removed a passportsized photograph thats müller he said apparently he speaks with a very pronounced munich accent so even if he should have radically changed his appearance youll certainly have no trouble recognizing his voice he watched me turn the photograph towards the streetlight and stare at it for a while hed be fortyseven now not very tall big peasant hands he may still even be wearing his wedding ring the photograph didnt say much about the man it wasnt a very revealing face and yet it was a remarkable one müller had a squarish skull a high forehead and tense narrow lips but it was the eyes that really got to you even on that small photograph müllers eyes were like the eyes of a snowman two black frozen coals heres another one belinsky said these are the only two photographs of him known to exist the second picture was a group shot there were five men seated round an oak table as if they had been having dinner in a comfortable restaurant three of them i recognized at the head of the table was heinrich himmler playing with his pencil and smiling at arthur nebe on his right arthur nebe my old comrade as belinsky would have said on himmlers left and apparently hanging on every one of the reichsführersss words was reinhard heydrich chief of the rsha assassinated by czech terrorists in when was this picture taken i asked november belinsky leaned across and tapped one of the two other men in the picture with the stem of his pipe thats müller there he said sitting beside heydrich müllers hand had moved in the same halfsecond that the camerashutter had opened and closed it was blurred as if covering the order paper on the table but even so the wedding ring was clearly visible he was looking down almost not listening to himmler at all by comparison with heydrich müllers head was small his hair was closely cropped shaven even until it reached the very top of the cranium where it had been permitted to grow a little in a small carefully tended allotment whos the man sitting opposite müller the one taking notes thats franz josef huber he was chief of the gestapo here in vienna you can hang on to those pictures if you want theyre only prints i havent agreed to help you yet but you will you have to right now i ought to tell you to go and fuck yourself belinsky you see im like an old piano i dont much like being played but im tired and ive had a few maybe ill be able to think a little more clearly tomorrow i opened the car door and got out again belinsky was right the body work of the big black mercedes was covered in dents ill call you in the morning he said you do that i said and slammed the door shut he drove away like he was the devils own coachman i did not sleep well troubled by what belinsky had said my thoughts made my limbs restless and after only a few hours i woke before dawn in a cold sweat and did not sleep again if only he hadnt mentioned god i said to myself i was not a catholic until i became a prisoner in russia the regime in the camp was so hard that it seemed to me that there was an even chance it would kill me and wishing to make my peace with the back of my mind i had sought out the only churchman among my fellow prisoners a polish priest i had been brought up as a lutheran but religious denomination seemed like a matter of small account in that dreadful place becoming a catholic in the full expectation of death only made me more tenacious of life and after id escaped and returned to berlin i continued to attend mass and to celebrate the faith that had apparently delivered me my newfound church did not have a good record in its relation to the nazis and had now also distanced itself from any imputation of guilt it followed that if the catholic church was not guilty nor were its members there was it seemed some theological basis for a rejection of german collective guilt guilt said the priests was really something personal between a man and his god and its attribution to one nation by another was blasphemy for this could only be a matter of divine prerogative after that all that there remained to do was pray for the dead for those who had done wrong and for the whole dreadful and embarrassing epoch to be forgotten as quickly as possible there were many who remained uneasy at the way the moral dirt was swept under the carpet but it is certain that a nation cannot feel collective guilt that each man must encounter it personally only now did i realize the nature of my own guilt and perhaps it was really not much different from that of many others it was that i had not said anything that i had not lifted my hand against the nazis i also realized that i had a personal sense of grievance against heinrich müller for as chief of the gestapo he had done more than any other man to achieve the corruption of the police force of which i had once been a proud member from that had flowed wholesale terror now it seemed it was not too late to do something after all it was just possible that by seeking out müller the symbol not just of my own corruption but beckers too and bringing him to justice i might help to clear my own guilt for what had happened belinsky rang early almost as if he had already guessed my decision and i told him that i would help him to find gestapo müller not for crowcass nor for the united states army but for germany but mostly i told him i would help him to get müller for myself first thing that morning after telephoning könig and arranging a meeting to hand over belinskys ostensibly secret material i went to liebls office in judengasse in order that he might arrange for me to see becker at the police prison i want to show him a photograph i explained a photograph liebl sounded hopeful is this a photograph that might become an item of evidence i shrugged that depends on becker liebl made a couple of swift telephone calls trading on the death of beckers fiancée the possibility of new evidence and the proximity of the trial which gained us almost immediate access to the prison it was a fine day and we made our way there by foot with liebl walking his umbrella like a colour sergeant in an imperial regiment of guards did you tell him about traudl i asked last night how did he take it the grey brow on the old lawyers head shifted uncertainly surprisingly well herr gunther like you i had supposed our client would be devastated by the news the brow shifted again more in consternation this time but he was not no it was his own unfortunate situation that seemed to preoccupy him as well as your progress or lack of it herr becker does seem to have an extraordinary amount of faith in your powers of detection powers for which if i may be frank with you sir i have seen little or no evidence youre entitled to your opinion dr liebl i guess youre like most lawyers ive met if your own sister sent you an invitation to her wedding youd be happy only if it was signed under seal and in the presence of two witnesses perhaps if our client had been a little more forthcoming you suspect hes been holding something back yes i remember you said as much on the telephone yesterday without knowing quite what you were talking about i did not feel able to take advantage of herr beckers he hesitated for a second while he debated whether or not he could reasonably use the word and then decided that he could grief to make such an allegation very sensitive of you im sure but perhaps this photograph will jog his memory i do hope so and perhaps his bereavement will have sunk in and he will make a better show of his grief it seemed like a very viennese sort of sentiment but when we saw becker he appeared hardly affected after a packet of cigarettes had persuaded the guard to leave the three of us alone in the interview room i tried to find out why im sorry about traudl i said she was a really lovely girl he nodded expressionlessly as if he had been listening to some boring point of legal procedure as explained by liebl i must say you dont seem very upset by it i remarked im dealing with it in the best way i know how he said quietly theres not a lot i can do here chances are they wont even let me attend the funeral how do you think i feel i turned to liebl and asked him if he wouldnt mind leaving the room for a minute theres something i wish to say to herr becker in private liebl glanced at becker who nodded curtly back at him neither of us spoke until the heavy door had closed behind the lawyer spit it out bernie becker said halfyawning at the same time whats on your mind it was your friends in the org who killed your girl i said watching his long thin face closely for some sign of emotion i wasnt sure if this was true or not but i was keen to see what it might make him reveal but there was nothing they actually asked me to kill her so he said with his eyes narrowing youre in the org his tone was cautious when did this happen your friend könig recruited me his face seemed to relax a little well i guessed it was only a matter of time to be honest i wasnt at all sure whether or not you were in the org when you first came to vienna with your background youre the kind of man theyre quick to recruit if youre in now you have been busy im impressed did könig say why he wanted you to kill traudl he told me she was an mvd spy he showed me a photograph of her talking to colonel poroshin becker smiled sadly she was no spy he said shaking his head and she was not my girlfriend she was poroshins girl originally she posed as my fiancée so that i could stay in contact with poroshin while i was in prison liebl knew nothing about it poroshin said that you hadnt been all that keen to come to vienna said you didnt seem to have a very good opinion of me he wondered if you would stay very long when you did come so he thought it would be a good idea if traudl worked on you a little and persuaded you that there was someone who loved me on the outside someone who needed me hes a shrewd judge of character bernie go on admit it shes half the reason why youve stuck to my case because you thought that mother and baby deserved the benefit of the doubt even if i didnt it was becker who was watching me now looking for some reaction oddly enough i found i wasnt angry at all i was used to discovering that at any one time i only ever had half the truth so i dont suppose she was a nurse at all oh she was a nurse all right she used to steal penicillin for me to sell on the black market it was me who introduced her to poroshin he shrugged i didnt know about the two of them for a while but i wasnt surprised traudl liked a good time like most of the women in this city she and i were even lovers for a brief while but nothing like that lasts for very long in vienna your wife said that you got poroshin some penicillin for a dose of drip was that true i got him some penicillin sure but it wasnt for him it was for his son he had cerebrospinal fever theres quite an epidemic of it i believe and a shortage of antibiotics especially in russia theres a shortage of everything but manpower in the soviet union after that poroshin did me one or two favours fixed papers gave me a cigarette concession that sort of thing we became quite friendly and when the orgs people got round to recruiting me i told him all about it why not i thought könig and his friends were a bunch of spinners but i was happy to make money from them and frankly i wasnt much involved with the org beyond that odd bit of courierwork to berlin poroshin was keen that i get closer to them however and when he offered me a lot of money i agreed to try but theyre absurdly suspicious bernie and when i expressed some interest in doing more work for them they insisted that i subject myself to an interrogation about my service with the ss and my imprisonment in a soviet pow camp it bothered them a lot that i was released they didnt say anything about it at the time but in view of what has happened since i guess they must have decided that they couldnt trust me and put me out of the way becker lit one of his cigarettes and leaned back on the hard chair why didnt you tell this to the police he laughed you think i didnt when i told them about the org those stupid bastards thought i was telling them about the werewolf underground you know that shit about a nazi terrorist group so thats where shields got the idea shields becker snorted hes a fucking idiot all right why didnt you tell me about the org like i said bernie i wasnt sure if they hadnt already recruited you in berlin exkripo exabwehr youd have been exactly what they were looking for but if you hadnt been in the org and id told you you might well have gone round vienna asking questions about it in which case you would have ended up dead like my two business partners and if you were in the org i thought that maybe that would just be in berlin here in vienna youd be just another detective albeit one i knew and trusted do you see i grunted an affirmative and found my own cigarettes you still should have told me perhaps he drew fiercely on his cigarette listen bernie my original offer still stands thirty thousand dollars if you can dig me out of this hole so if youve got anything up your sleeve theres this i said cutting across him i produced müllers photograph the one that was passportsized do you recognize him i dont think so but ive seen this picture before bernie at least i think i have traudl showed it to me before you came to vienna oh did she say how she came by it poroshin i guess he studied the picture more carefully oakleaf collar patches silver braid on the shoulders an ssbrigadeführer by the look of him who is it anyway heinrich müller gestapo müller officially hes dead so id like you to keep quiet about all this for the moment ive teamed up with this american agent from the war crimes commission who is interested in the linden case he worked for the same department apparently the gun that was used to kill linden belonged to müller and was used to kill the man who was supposed to be müller which might leave müller still alive naturally the war crimes people are anxious to get hold of müller at any price which leaves you firmly on the spot im afraid at least for the moment i wouldnt mind if it was firmly but the particular spot they have in mind has hinges on it do you mind explaining what this means exactly it means theyre not prepared to do anything that might scare müller out of vienna assuming hes here thats right because this is an intelligence operation theyre not prepared to let the military police in on it if the charges against you were to be dropped now it might persuade the org that the case was about to be reopened so where does that leave me for christs sake this american agent im working with has promised to let you go if we can put müller in your place were going to try and draw him out into the open until then theyre just going to let the trial go ahead maybe even the sentence too thats about the size of it and youre asking me to keep my mouth shut in the meantime what can you say that linden was possibly murdered by a man whos been dead for three years its just so becker flung his cigarette into the corner of the room so damned callous do you want to take that biretta off your head look they know about what you did in minsk playing a game with your life isnt something they feel squeamish about to be honest they dont much care whether you swing or not this is your only chance and you know it becker nodded sullenly all right he said i stood up to leave but a sudden thought stopped me from walking to the door as a matter of interest i said why did they release you from the soviet pow camp you were a prisoner you know what it was like always scared they were going to find out you were in the ss thats why im asking he hesitated for a moment then he said there was a man who was due to be released he was very sick and would have died soon enough what was the point in repatriating him he shrugged and looked me square in the eye so i strangled him ate some camphor to make myself sick damn near killed myself and took his place he stared me out i was desperate bernie you remember what it was like yes i remember i tried to conceal my distaste and failed all the same if youd told me that before today id have let them hang you i reached for the door handle theres still time why dont you if id told him the truth becker wouldnt have understood what i was talking about he probably thought that metaphysics was something you used to manufacture cheap penicillin for the black market so instead i shook my head and said lets just say that i made a deal with someone i met könig at the café sperl in gumpendorfer strasse which was in the french sector but close to the ring it was a big gloomy place which the many artnouveaustyle mirrors on the walls did nothing to brighten and was home to several halfsize billiard tables each one of these was illuminated by a light which was fixed to the yellowing ceiling above with a brass fitting that looked like something out of an old uboat königs terrier sat a short way off from its master like the dog on the record label watching him play a solitary but thoughtful game i ordered a coffee and approached the table he judged his shot at a careful cues length and then applied a screw of chalk to the tip silently acknowledging my presence with a short nod of his head our own mozart was particularly fond of this game he said lowering his eyes to the felt doubtless he found it a very congenial facsimile of the very precise dynamism of his intellect he fixed his eye on the cueball like a sniper taking aim and after a long painstaking moment rifled the white on to one red and then the other this second red coasted down the length of the table teetered on the lip of the pocket and enticing a small murmur of satisfaction from its translator for there exists no more graceful manifestation of the laws of gravity and motion slipped noiselessly out of sight i on the other hand enjoy the game for rather more sensuous reasons i love the sound of the balls hitting each other and the way they run so smoothly he retrieved the red from the pocket and replaced it to his own satisfaction but most of all i love the colour green did you know that among celtic peoples the colour green is considered unlucky no they believe green is followed by black probably because the english used to hang irishmen for wearing green or was it the scots for a moment könig stared almost insanely at the surface of the billiard table as if he could have licked it with his tongue just look at it he breathed green is the colour of ambition and of youth its the colour of life and of eternal rest requiem aeternam dona eis reluctantly he laid his cue down on the cloth and conjuring a large cigar from one of his pockets turned away from the table the terrier stood up expectantly you said on the telephone that you had something for me something important i handed him belinskys envelope sorry its not in green ink i said watching him take out the papers do you read cyrillic könig shook his head im afraid it might as well be in gaelic but he went ahead and spread the papers out on the billiard table and then lit his cigar when the dog barked he ordered it to be quiet perhaps you would be good enough to explain exactly what i am looking at these are details of mvd dispositions and methods in hungary and lower austria i smiled coolly and sat down at an adjacent table where the waiter had just laid my coffee könig nodded slowly stared uncomprehendingly at the papers for another few seconds then scooped them up replaced them in their envelope and slipped the papers inside his jacket pocket very interesting he said sitting down at my table assuming for a moment that theyre genuine oh theyre genuine all right i said quickly he smiled patiently as if i could have had no idea of the lengthy process whereby such information was properly verified assuming theyre genuine he repeated firmly how exactly did you come by them a couple of men came over to the billiard table and started a game könig drew his chair away and jerked his head at me to follow him its all right said one of the players theres plenty of room to get by but we moved our chairs anyway and when we were at a more discreet distance from the table i started to give him the story i had rehearsed with belinsky only now könig shook his head firmly and picked up his dog which licked his ear playfully this isnt the right time or place he said but im impressed at how busy you have been he raised his eyebrows and watched the two men at the billiard table with an air of distraction i learned this morning that you had been successful in procuring some petrol coupons for that medical friend of mine the one at the general hospital i realized that he was talking about traudls murder and so soon after we had discussed the matter too it really was most efficient of you im sure he puffed smoke at the dog on his lap which sniffed and then sneezed its so difficult to obtain reliable supplies of anything in vienna these days i shrugged you just have to know the right people thats all as you clearly do my friend he patted the breast pocket of his green tweed suit where he had put belinskys documents in these special circumstances i feel i ought to introduce you to someone in the company who will be better able than i to judge the quality of your source someone who as it happens is keen to meet you and decide how best a man of your skills and resourcefulness may be used we had thought to wait a few weeks before making the introduction but this new information changes everything however first i must make a telephone call i shall be a few minutes he looked down the café and pointed to one of the other free billiard tables why dont you try a few shots while im away ive not much use for games of skill i said i distrust a game that relies on anything but luck that way i neednt blame myself if i lose i have a tremendous capacity for selfrecrimination a twinkle came into königs eye my dear fellow he said standing up from the table that seems hardly german i watched him as he walked into the back of the café to use the phone the terrier trotting faithfully after him i wondered who it was that he was calling the one who was better able to judge the quality of my source might even be müller it seemed too much to hope for so soon when könig returned a few minutes later he seemed excited as i thought he said nodding enthusiastically there is someone who is keen to have immediate sight of this material and to meet you i have a car outside shall we go königs car was a black mercedes like belinskys and like belinsky he drove too fast for safety on a road that had seen a heavy morning rain i said that it would be better to arrive late than not to arrive at all but he paid no attention my feeling of discomfort was made worse by königs dog which sat on his masters lap and barked excitedly at the road ahead for the whole of the journey as if the brute had been giving directions on where we were going i recognized the road as the one which led to sievering studios but at that same moment the road forked and we turned north again on to grinzinger allee do you know grinzing könig shouted over the dogs incessant barking i said that i did not then you really dont know the viennese he opined grinzing is famous for its wine production in the summer everyone comes up here in the evening to go to one of the taverns selling the new vintage they drink too much listen to a schrammel quartet and sing old songs it sounds very cosy i said without much enthusiasm yes it is i own a couple of vineyards up here myself just two small fields you understand but its a start a man must have some land dont you think well come back here in the summer and then you can taste the new wine yourself the lifeblood of vienna grinzing seemed hardly a suburb of vienna at all more a charming little village but because of its proximity to the capital its cosy country charm somehow appeared as false as one of the film sets they built over at sievering we drove up a hill on a narrow winding lane which led between old heurige inns and cottage gardens with könig declaring how pretty he thought it all was now that spring was here but the sight of so much storybook provinciality merely served to stimulate my citybred parts to contempt and i restricted myself to a sullen grunt and a muttered sentence about tourists to one more used to the perennial sight of rubble grinzing with its many trees and vineyards looked very green however i made no mention of this impression for fear that it might set könig off on one of his queer little monologues about that sickly colour he stopped the car in front of a high yellowbrick wall which enclosed a large yellowpainted house and a garden that looked as if it had spent all day in the beauty parlour the house itself was a tall threestorey building with a highdormered roof apart from its bright colour there was a certain austerity of detail about the facade which lent the house an institutional appearance it looked like a rather opulent son of town hall i followed könig through the gates and up an immaculately bordered path to a heavy studded oak door of the kind that expected you to be holding a battleaxe when you knocked we walked straight into the house and on to a creaking wooden floor that would have given a librarian a heart attack könig led me into a small sittingroom told me to wait there and then left closing the door behind him i took a good look round but there wasnt much to see beyond the fact of the owners bucolic taste in furniture a roughhewn table blocked the french window and a couple of cartwheel farmhouse chairs were ranged in front of an empty fireplace that was as big as a mineshaft i sat down on a slightly more comfortablelooking ottoman and retied my shoelaces then i polished my toes with the edge of the threadbare rug i must have waited there for an indifferent halfhour before könig came back to fetch me he led me through a maze of rooms and corridors and up a flight of stairs to the back of the house with the manner of a man whose jacket is lined with oak panelling hardly caring if i insulted him or not now that i was about to meet someone more important i said if you changed that suit youd make someone a wonderful butler könig did not turn around but i heard him bare his dentures and utter a short dry laugh im glad you think so you know although i like a sense of humour i would not advise you to exercise it with the general frankly his character is most severe he opened a door and we came into a bright airy room with a fire in the grate and hectares of empty bookshelves against the broad window behind a long library table stood a greysuited figure with a closelycropped head i half recognized the man turned and smiled his hooked nose unmistakably belonging to a face from my past hello gunther said the man könig looked quizzically at me as i blinked speechlessly at the grinning figure do you believe in ghosts herr könig i said no do you i do now if im not mistaken the gentleman by the window was hanged in for his part in the plot to kill the führer you can leave us helmut said the man at the window könig nodded curtly turned on his heel and left arthur nebe pointed at a chair in front of the table on which belinskys documents lay spread out beside a pair of spectacles and a fountain pen sit down he said drink he laughed you look as though you need one its not every day i get to see a man raised from the dead i said quietly better make it a large one nebe opened a large carvedwood drinks cabinet revealing a marble interior filled with several bottles he took out a bottle of vodka and two small glasses which he filled to the top to old comrades he said raising his glass i smiled uncertainly drink up it wont make me disappear again i tossed the vodka back and breathed deeply as it hit my stomach death agrees with you arthur you look well thanks ive never felt better i lit a cigarette and left it on my lip for a while minsk wasnt it he said in the last time we saw each other thats right you got me transferred to the war crimes bureau i ought to have had you put on a charge for what you asked even had you shot from what i hear you were keen on shooting that summer nebe let that one pass so why didnt you you were a damned good policeman thats why so were you i sucked hard at my cigarette at least you were before the war what made you change arthur nebe savoured his drink for a moment and then finished it with one swallow this is good vodka he remarked quietly almost to himself bernie dont expect me to give you an explanation i had my orders to carry out and so it was them or me kill or be killed thats how it always was with the ss ten twenty thirty thousand after youve calculated that to save your own life you must kill others then the number makes little or no difference that was my final solution bernie the final solution to the pressing problem of my own continued survival you were fortunate that you were never required to make that same calculation thanks to you nebe shrugged modestly before pointing at the papers spread before him im rather glad that i didnt have you shot now that ive seen this lot naturally this material will have to be assessed by an expert but on the face of it you appear to have won the lottery all the same id like to hear more about your source i repeated my story after which nebe said can he be trusted do you think your russian he never let me down before i said of course he was just fixing papers for me then nebe refilled our glasses and frowned is there a problem i asked its just that in the ten years ive known you bernie i cant find anything that can persuade me that youre now a common blackmarketeer that shouldnt be any more difficult than the problem i have persuading myself that youre a warcriminal arthur or for that matter accepting that youre not dead nebe smiled you have a point but with so many opportunities presented by the vast number of displaced persons im surprised you didnt return to your old trade and become a private investigator again private investigation and the black market are not mutually exclusive i said good information is just like penicillin or cigarettes it has its price and the better the more illicit the information the higher that price its always been like that incidentally my russian will want to be paid they always do sometimes i think that the ivans have more confidence in the dollar than the americans themselves nebe clasped his hands and laid both forefingers along the length of his shrewdlooking nose then he pointed them at me as if he had been holding a pistol youve done very well bernie very well indeed but i must confess i am still puzzled about me as a black peter i can accept the idea of that rather more easily than i can accept the idea of you killing traudl braunsteiner murder was never in your line i didnt kill her i said könig told me to do it and i thought i could because she was a communist i learned to hate them while i was in a soviet prisoncamp even enough to kill one but when i thought about it i realized i couldnt do it not in cold blood maybe i could have done it if it had been a man but not a girl i was going to tell him that this morning but when he congratulated me on having done it i decided to keep my mouth shut and take the credit i figured there might be some money in it so somebody else killed her how very intriguing youve no idea who i suppose i shook my head a mystery then just like your resurrection arthur how exactly did you manage it im afraid that i cant take any of the credit he said it was something the intelligence people dreamed up in the last few months of the war they simply doctored the service records of senior ss and party personnel to the effect that we were dead most of us were executed for our part in count stauffenbergs plot to kill the führer well what were another hundred or so executions on a list that was already thousands of names long and then some of us were listed as killed in a bombing raid or in the battle for berlin then all that remained was to make sure that these records fell into the hands of the americans so the ss transported the records to a paper mill near munich and the owner a good nazi was briefed to wait until the amis were on his doorstep before he started to destroy anythingnebe laughed i remember reading in the newspaper how pleased with themselves the amis were what a coup they thought they had scored of course most of what they captured was genuine enough but for those of us who were most at risk from their ridiculous warcrimes investigations it provided a real breathing space and enough time to establish a new identity theres nothing quite like being dead for giving one a little room he laughed again anyway that us documents centre of theirs in berlin is still working for us how do you mean i asked wondering if i was about to learn something that would throw light on why linden had been killed or perhaps he had simply found out that the records had been doctored before they fell into allied hands wouldnt that have been enough to justify killing him no ive said enough for the moment nebe drank some more vodka and licked his lips appreciatively these are interesting times we live in bernie a man can be whoever he wants to be take me my new name is nolde arthur nolde and i make wine on this estate resurrected you said well youre not so very far away from it there only our nazi dead are raised incorruptible were changed my friend its the russians who are wearing the black hats and trying to take over the town now that were working for the americans were the good boys dr schneider hes the man who set the org up with the help of their cic he has regular meetings with them at our headquarters in pullach hes even been to the united states to meet their secretary of state can you imagine it a senior german officer working with the presidents number two you dont get more incorruptible than that not these days if you dont mind i said i find it hard to think of the amis as saints when i got back from russia my wife was getting an extra ration from an american captain sometimes i think theyre no better than the ivans nebe shrugged youre not the only one in the org who thinks that he said but for my part i never heard of the ivans asking a ladys permission or giving her a few bars of chocolate first theyre animals he smiled as a thought came into his head all the same i will admit that some of those women ought to be grateful to the russians but for them they might never have known what it was like it was a poor joke and in bad taste but i laughed along with him anyway i was still sufficiently nervous of nebe to want to be good company for him so what did you do about your wife and this american captain he asked when his laughter has subsided something made me check myself before i replied arthur nebe was a clever man before the war as chief of the criminal police he had been germanys most outstanding policeman it would have been too risky to give an answer which suggested that i had wanted to kill an american army captain nebe saw common factors worthy of investigation where other men only saw the hand of a capricious god i knew him too well to believe that he would have forgotten how once he had assigned becker to a murder inquiry i was leading any hint of an association no matter how accidental between the death of one american officer affecting becker and the death of another affecting me and i didnt doubt that nebe would have given orders to have had me killed one american officer was bad enough two would have been too much of a coincidence so i shrugged lit a cigarette and said what can you do but make sure its her and not him who gets the slap in the mouth american officers dont take kindly to being socked least of all by krauts its one of the small privileges of conquest that you dont have to take any shit from your defeated enemy i cant imagine youve forgotten that herr gruppenführer you of all people i watched his grin with an extra curiosity it was a cunning smile in an old foxs face but his teeth looked real enough that was very wise of you he said it doesnt do to go around killing americans confirming my nervousness of him he added after a long pause do you remember emil becker it would have been stupid to have tried to affect a show of protracted remembering he knew me better than that of course i said it was his girlfriend that könig told you to kill one of his girlfriends anyway but könig said she was mvd i frowned and so she was so was becker he killed an american officer but not before hed tried to infiltrate the org i shook my head slowly a crook maybe i said but i cant see becker as one of ivans spies nebe nodded insistently here in vienna he nodded again did he know about you being alive of course not we used him to do a little courier work now and again it was a mistake becker was a blackmarketeer like you bernie rather a successful one as it happens but he had delusions regarding his own worth to us he thought he was at the centre of a very big pond but he was nowhere near it quite frankly if a meteorite had landed in the middle of it becker wouldnt even have noticed the fucking ripple how did you find out about him his wife told us nebe said when he came back from a soviet pow camp our people in berlin sent someone round to his house to see if we could recruit him to the org well they missed him and by the time they got to speak to beckers wife he had left home and was living here in vienna the wife told them about beckers association with a russian colonel of mvd but for one reason and another actually it was sheer bloody inefficiency it was quite a while before that information reached us here in vienna section and by that time he had been recruited by one of our collectors so where is he now here in vienna in gaol the americans are putting him on trial for murder and he will most certainly hang that must be rather convenient for you i said sticking my neck out a little way rather too convenient if you ask me professional instinct bernie better just call it a hunch that way if im wrong it wont make me look like an amateur still trusting your guts eh most of all now that ive got something inside them again arthur viennas a fat city after berlin so you think we killed the american that would depend on who he was and if you had a good reason then all you would have to do is make sure they got someones coat for it someone you might want out of the way that way you could get to hit two flies with one swat am i right nebe inclined his head to one side a little perhaps but dont ever try to remind me of just how good a detective you were by doing something as stupid as proving it its still a very sore point with some people in this section so it might be best if you were to nail your beak about it altogether you know if you really felt like playing detective you might like to give us the benefit of your advice as to how we should go about finding one of our own missing persons his name is dr karl heim and hes a dentist a couple of our people were supposed to take him to pullach early this morning but when they went to his house there was no sign of him of course he may just have gone on the local cure nebe meant a tour of the bars but in this city there is always the possibility that the ivans have snatched him there are a couple of freelance gangs that the russians have working here in return they get concessions to sell blackmarket cigarettes as far as weve been able to find out both these gangs report to beckers russian colonel thats probably how he got most of his supplies in the first place sure i said unnerved by this latest revelation of beckers involvement with colonel poroshin what do you want me to do speak to könig nebe instructed give him some advice on how he might try and find heim if you get time you could even give him some help thats simple enough i said anything else yes id like you to come back here tomorrow morning theres one of our people who has specialized in all matters relating to the mvd i have a feeling that he will be especially keen to talk to you about this source of yours shall we say ten oclock ten oclock i repeated nebe stood up and came round the table to shake my hand its good to see an old face bernie even if it does look like my conscience i smiled weakly and clasped his hand whats past is past i said exactly so he said dropping a hand on to my shoulder until tomorrow then könig will drive you back to town nebe opened the door and led the way down the stairs back to the front of the house im sorry to hear about that problem with your wife i could arrange to have her sent some px if you wanted dont bother i said quickly the last thing i wanted was anyone from the org turning up at my apartment in berlin and asking kirsten awkward questions she wouldnt know how to answer she works in an american café and gets all the px she needs in the hallway we found könig playing with his dog women nebe laughed it was a woman who bought könig his dog isnt that so helmut yes herr general nebe bent down to tickle the dogs stomach it rolled over and presented itself submissively to nebes fingers and do you know why she bought him a dog i caught königs embarrassed little crease of a smile and i sensed that nebe was about to crack a joke to teach the man obedience i laughed right along with the two of them but after only a few days closer acquaintance with könig i thought that lotte hartmann would as soon have taught her boyfriend to recite the torah the sky was grey by the time i got back to my rooms i heard a handful of rain against the french windows and seconds later there was a short flash and a huge clap of thunder that sent the pigeons on my terrace flying for cover i stood and watched the storm as it rocked the trees and flooded the drains discharging the atmosphere of all its surplus electrical energy until the air was clear and comfortable again ten minutes later the birds were singing in the trees as if in celebration of the purgative squall there seemed much to envy them in this swift climatic cure and i wished the pressure i felt on my own nerves could have been as easily resolved trying to keep one step ahead of all the lies my own included i was rapidly coming to the end of my own ingenuity and i was in danger of losing the tempo of the whole affair not to mention my life it was about eight oclock when i called belinsky at sachers a hotel on philharmonikerstrasse requisitioned by the military i thought it might be too late to catch him but he was there he sounded relaxed like hed known all along that the org would take his bait i said id call i reminded him its a bit late but ive been busy no problem did they buy it the information damn near took my hand off könig drove me to a house in grinzing possibly its their headquarters here in vienna im not sure its certainly grand enough good did you see anything of müller no but i saw someone else oh and who was that belinskys voice got cool arthur nebe nebe are you sure of that he was excited now of course im sure i knew nebe before the war i thought he was dead but this afternoon we spoke for almost an hour he wants me to help könig find our dentist friend and to go back to grinzing for a meeting tomorrow morning to discuss your russians love letters ive a hunch that müllers going to be there how do you make that out nebe said that there would be someone there who specialized in all matters relating to the mvd yes coming from arthur nebe that description might well fit müller what time is this meeting ten oclock that only gives me tonight to get things organized let me think for a minute he was silent for so long that i wondered if he was still on the line but then i heard him take a deep breath how far is the house from the road twenty or thirty metres at the front and the north side behind the house to the south is a vineyard i couldnt tell you how far the road is on that side theres a row of trees between the house and the vineyard some outbuildings as well i gave him directions to the house as best i remembered them all right he said briskly heres what well do after ten ill start to have my men surround the place at a discreet distance if müller is there you signal to us and well close in and pick him up thats going to be the difficult part because theyll be watching you closely while you were there did you happen to use the lavatory no but i walked past one on the first floor if the meeting is in the library where i met nebe as i imagine it will be that will be the one in use it faces north towards josefstadt and the road and theres a window with a beige roller blind perhaps i could use the blind to signal there was another short silence then he said twenty minutes past the hour or as near as you can manage you go to the musicroom when youre in there you pull the blind down and count for five seconds and then push it up for five seconds do it three times ill be watching the place through binoculars and when i see your signal ill sound the car horn three times that will be the signal for my men to move in then you rejoin the meeting sit tight and wait for the cavalry it sounds simple enough a bit too simple really look kraut i would suggest that you hang your ass out of the window and whistle dixie but that might attract attention he gave an irritated sort of sigh a swoop like this needs a lot of paperwork gunther i have to work out code names and get all kinds of special authorizations for a major field operation and then theres an investigation if the whole thing turns out to be a false alarm i hope youre right about müller you know im going to be up all night arranging this little party that really knocks over the heap i said im the one on the beach and youre bitching about some sand in the oil well im really blue about your damned paperwork belinsky laughed come on kraut dont get a hot throat about it i just meant that it would be nice if we could be sure that müller will be there be reasonable we still dont know for sure that hes part of the orgs setup in vienna sure we do i lied this morning i went to the police prison and showed emil becker one of müllers snapshots he identified him immediately as the man who was with könig when he asked becker to try and find captain linden unless müller is just sweet on könig that means he must be part of the orgs vienna section shit said belinsky why didnt i think of doing that its so simple hes certain it was müller no doubt whatsoever i strung him along like that for a while until i was sure of him all right slow your blood down as a matter of fact becker didnt identify him at all but he had seen the photograph before traudl braunsteiner showed it to him i just wanted to make sure it wasnt you who gave it to her you still dont trust me yet do you kraut if im going to walk into the lions den for you im entitled to give you an eyetest beforehand yes well that still leaves us with the problem of where traudl braunsteiner got hold of a picture of gestapo müller from a colonel poroshin of mvd i expect he gave becker a cigarette concession here in vienna in return for information and the occasional bit of kidnapping when becker was approached by the org he told poroshin all about it and agreed to try and find out everything he could after becker was arrested traudl was their gobetween she just posed as his girlfriend you know what this means kraut it means the ivans are after müller as well right but have you thought what would happen if they got him frankly theres not much chance of him going on trial in the soviet union like i said before müllers made a special study of soviet police methods no the russians want müller because he can be very useful to them he could for instance tell them who all the gestapos agents in the nkvd were men who are probably still in place in the mvd lets hope hes there tomorrow then youd better tell me how to find this place i gave him clear directions and told him not to be late these bastards scare me i explained hey you want to know something all you krauts scare me but not as much as the russians he chuckled in a way that i had almost started to like goodbye kraut he said and good luck then he hung up leaving me staring at the purring receiver with the curious sensation that the disembodied voice to which i had been speaking belonged nowhere outside my own imagination smoke drifted up to the vaulted ceiling of the nightclub like the thickest underworld fog it wreathed the solitary figure of belinsky like bela lugosi emerged from a churchyard as he strode up to the table where i sat the band i had been listening to could hold a beat about as well as a onelegged tapdancer but somehow he managed to walk to the rhythm it was generating i knew he was still angry with me for doubting him and that he was well aware of how even now i was trying to fathom why it was that he hadnt thought to show müllers photograph to becker so i wasnt very surprised when he took hold of my hair and banged my head twice on the table telling me that i was just a suspicious kraut i got up and staggered away from him towards the door but found my exit blocked by arthur nebe his presence there was so unexpected that i was momentarily unable to resist nebe grasping me by both ears and banging my skull once against the door and then once again for good luck saying that if i hadnt killed traudl braunsteiner then perhaps i ought to find out who had i twisted my head free of his hands and said that i might as soon have guessed that rumpelstiltskins name was rumpelstiltskin i shook my head again unwillingly and blinked hard at the dark there was another knock at the door and i heard a halfwhispered voice who is it i said reaching for the bedside light and then my watch the name made no impression on me as i swung my legs out of bed and went into the sittingroom i was still swearing as i opened the door a little wider than was safe lotte hartmann stood in the corridor in the glistening black evening dress and astrakhan jacket i remembered her wearing from our last evening together she had a questioning impertinent sort of look in her eye yes i said what is it what do you want she sniffed with cool contempt and pushed the door lightly with her gloved hand so i stepped back into the room she came in closed the door behind her and leaning on it looked around while my nostrils got a little exercise thanks to the smell of smoke alcohol and perfume she carried on her venal body im sorry if i woke you up she said she didnt look at me so much as the room no youre not i said now she took a little trip around the floor peering into the bedroom and then the bathroom she moved with an easy grace and as confidently as any woman who is used to the constant sensation of having a mans eyes fixed on her behind youre right she grinned im not sorry at all you know this place isnt as bad as i thought it would be do you know what time it is very late she giggled your landlady wasnt impressed with me at all so i had to tell her i was your sister and that i had come all the way from berlin to give you some bad news she giggled again and youre it she pouted for a moment but it was just an act she was still too amused with herself to take much umbrage when she asked me if i had any luggage i said that the russians had stolen it on the train she was extremely sympathetic and really rather sweet i hope youre not going to be different oh i thought thats why you were here or are the vice squad giving you problems again she ignored the insult always supposing she had even bothered to notice it well i was just on my way home from the flottenbar thats on mariahilferstrasse do you know it i didnt say anything i lit a cigarette and fixed it in a corner of my mouth to stop me snarling something at her anyway its not far from here and i thought that id just drop by you know her tone grew softer and more seductive i havent had a chance to thank you properly she let that one hang in the air for a second and i suddenly wished that i was wearing a dressinggown for getting me out of that little spot of bother with the ivans she untied the ribbon of her jacket and let it slip to the floor arent you even going to offer me a drink id say youve had enough but i went ahead and found a couple of glasses anyway dont you think youd like to find that out for yourself she laughed easily and sat down without any hint of unsteadiness she looked like the type who could take the stuff through the vein and still walk a chalk line without so much as a hiccup do you want anything in it i held a glass of vodka up as i asked the question perhaps she said ruminatively after ive had my drink i handed her the drink and put one quickly down into the pit of my stomach to hold the fort i took another drag on my cigarette and hoped that it might fill me up enough to kick her out whats the matter she said almost triumphantly do i make you nervous or something i guessed it was probably the something not me i said just my pyjamas theyre not used to mixed company from the look of them id say they were more used to mixing concrete she helped herself to one of my cigarettes and blew a cord of smoke straight at my groin i could get rid of them if they bothered you i said stupidly my lips were dry when they sucked at my cigarette again did i want her to leave or not i wasnt making a very good job of throwing her out on her perfect little ear lets talk a little first why dont you sit down i sat down relieved that i could still fold in the middle all right i said how about you tell me where your boyfriend is tonight she grimaced not a good subject perseus pick another you two have a rattle she groaned do we have to i shrugged it doesnt make me itch a lot the mans a bastard she said but i still dont want to talk about it especially today whats so special about today i got a part in a movie congratulations whats the role its an english film not a very big part you understand but there are going to be some big stars in it i play the role of a girl at a nightclub well that sounds simple enough isnt it exciting she squealed me acting with orson welles the war of the worlds fellow she shrugged blankly i never saw that film forget it of course theyre not actually sure about welles but they think theres a good chance they can persuade him to come to vienna that all sounds very familiar to me whats that i didnt even know you were an actress you mean i didnt tell you listen that job at the oriental is just temporary you seem pretty good at it oh ive always been good with numbers and money i used to work in the local tax department she leaned forward and her expression became just a little too quizzical as if she meant to question me about my yearend business expenses ive been meaning to ask you she said that night when you dropped all that mouse what were you trying to prove prove im not sure i follow you no she turned her smile up a couple of stops to shoot me a knowing conspiratorial sort of look i see a lot of quirks mister i get to recognize the types one day im even going to write a book about it like franz josef gall ever hear of him i cant say that i have he was an austrian doctor who founded the science of phrenology now youve heard of that havent you sure i said and what can you tell from the bumps im wearing on my head i can tell youre not the kind to drop that sort of money without a good reason she stretched an eyebrow of draughtsmans quality up her smooth forehead ive got an idea about that too lets hear it i urged and poured myself another drink maybe youll make a better go of reading my mind than you did of reading my cranium dont act so hard to get she told me we both know youre the kind of man that likes to make an impression and did i make an impression im here arent i what do you want tristan and isolde so that was it she thought that i had lost the money for her benefit to look like a bigshot she drained her glass stood up and handed it back to me pour me some more of that love potion of yours while i powder my nose while she was in the bathroom i refilled the glasses with hands that were none too steady i didnt particularly like the woman but i had nothing against her body it was just fine i had an idea that my head was going to object to this little skylark when my libido had released the controls but at that particular moment i could do nothing more than sit back and enjoy the flight even so i was unprepared for what happened next i heard her open the bathroom door and say something ordinary about the perfume she was wearing but when i turned round with the drinks i saw that the perfume was all that she was wearing actually she had kept her shoes on but it took my eyes a little while to work their way down past her breasts and her pubic equilateral except for those highheels lotte hartmann was as naked as an assassins blade and probably just as treacherous she stood in the doorway of my bedroom her hands hanging by her bare thighs glowing with delight as my tongue licked my lips rather too obviously for me to have contemplated using it on anything but her maybe i could have given her a pompous little lecture at that id seen enough naked women in my time some of them in fair shape too i ought to have tossed her back like a fish but the sweat starting out on my palms the flare of my nostrils the lump in my throat and the dull insistent ache in my groin told me that the machina had other ideas as to the next course of action than the deus which called it home delighted with the effect she was having on me lotte smiled happily and took the glass from my hand i hope you dont mind me undressing she said only the gown is an expensive one and i had the strangest feeling that you were about to tear it off my back why should i mind its not as if i havent finished reading the evening paper anyway i like having a naked woman about the place i watched the slight wobble of her behind as she walked lazily to the other side of the sittingroom where she swallowed her drink and dropped the empty glass on to the sofa suddenly i wanted to see her bottom shaking like a jelly against the rut of my abdomen she seemed to sense this and bending forwards took hold of the radiator like a wrestler pulling against the ring ropes in his corner then she stood with her feet a short way apart and stood quietly with her backside towards me as if waiting for a thoroughly unnecessary bodysearch she glanced back over her shoulder flexed her buttocks and then faced the wall again id had more eloquent invitations but with the blood buzzing in my ears and battering those few brain cells not yet affected by alcohol or adrenalin i really couldnt remember when probably i didnt even care i tore off my pyjamas and stalked after her im no longer young enough nor quite thin enough to share a single bed with anything other than a hangover or a cigarette so it was perhaps a sense of surprise that woke me from an unexpectedly comfortable sleep at around six oclock lotte who might otherwise have caused me a restless night was no longer lying in the crook of my arm and for a brief happy moment i supposed that she must have gone home it was then that i heard a small stifled sob coming from the sittingroom reluctantly i slipped out from under the covers and into my overcoat and went to see what was wrong still naked lotte had made a little ball of herself on the floor by the radiator where it was warm i squatted down beside her and asked why she was crying a fat tear rolled down a stained cheek and hung on her top lip like a translucent wart she licked it away and sniffed as i handed her my handkerchief what do you care she said bitterly now that youve had your fun she had a point but i went ahead and protested enough to be polite lotte heard me out and when her vanity was satisfied she tried a crippled sort of smile that reminded me of the way an unhappy child will cheer up when you hand over pfennigs or a pennychew youre very sweet she allowed finally and wiped her red eyes ill be all right now thank you do you want to tell me about it lotte glanced at me out of the corner of one eye in this town better tell me your rates first doctor she blew her nose and then uttered a short hollow laugh you might make a good screw doctor you seem quite sane to me i said helping her to an armchair i wouldnt bet on it is that your professional advice i lit a couple of cigarettes and handed her one she smoked it desperately and without much apparent pleasure thats my advice as a woman whos mad enough to have been having an affair with a man who just slapped her round like a circus clown könig i never saw him as the violent type if he seems urbane thats only the morphine he uses hes an addict i dont know if hes an addict exactly but whatever it was he did while he was in the ss he needed morphine to get through the war so why did he paste you she bit her lip fiercely well it wasnt because he thought i could use a little colour i laughed i had to hand it to her she was a tough one i said not with that tan anyway i picked up the astrakhan jacket from the floor where she had dropped it and draped it around her shoulders lotte drew it close to her throat and smiled bitterly nobody puts his hand on my jaw she said not if he ever wants to put his hand any place else tonight was the first and last time that hell give me a pair of slaps so help me she blew smoke from her nostrils as fiercely as a dragon thats what you get when you try to help someone i guess help who könig came into the oriental at around ten last night she explained he was in a foul mood and when i asked him why he wanted to know if i remembered a dentist who used to come into the club and gamble a bit she shrugged well i did remember him a bad player but certainly not half as bad as you like to pretend you are her eyes flicked at me uncertainly i nodded urgently go on helmut wanted to know if dr heim the dentist had been in the place during the last couple of days i told him i didnt think he had then he wanted me to ask some of the girls if they remembered him being there well there was one particular girl i said he should be sure to speak to a bit of a hardluck case but pretty with it the doctors always went for her i guess it was because she always looked that little bit more vulnerable and there are some men who quite like that sort of thing it so happened she was sitting at the bar so i pointed her out to him i felt my stomach turning to quicksand what was this girls name i asked veronika something she said and noticing my concern added why do you know her a little i said what happened then helmut and one of his friends took veronika next door to the hat shop yes her voice was soft now and just a little ashamed helmuts temper she flinched at the memory of it i was worried veronikas a nice girl a doofy but nice you know shes had a bit of a hard life but shes got plenty of guts perhaps too many for her own good i thought with helmut the way he was the mood he was in it would be better for her to tell him if she knew anything or not and to tell him quickly hes not a very patient man just in case he turned nasty she grimaced not much of a corner to turn when you know helmut so i went after them veronika was crying when i found them theyd already slapped her around quite hard shed had enough and i told them to stop it that was when he slapped me twice she held her cheeks as if the pain lingered with the memory then he shoved me out into the corridor and told me to mind my own business and stay out of his what happened after that i went to the ladies a couple of bars and came here in that order did you see what happened to veronika they left with her helmut and the other man you mean they took her away somewhere lotte shrugged glumly i guess so where would they have taken her i stood up and walked into the bedroom i dont know try and think youre going after her like you said shes been through a lot already i started to dress and whats more i got her into this you how come while i finished dressing i described how coming back from grinzing with könig i had explained how i would have gone about trying to find a missing person in this case dr heim i told him how we could check heims usual haunts if he could tell me where they were i told her but i left out how i had thought it would never have got that far how i assumed that with müller possibly nebe and könig too arrested by belinsky and the people from crowcass the need actually to look for heim would never have arisen how i thought that i had stalled könig into waiting until the meeting at grinzing was over before we started to look for his dead dentist why should they have thought that you could find her before the war i was a detective with the berlin police i should have known she snorted not really i said straightening my tie and jabbing a cigarette into my sourtasting mouth but i should certainly have known that your boyfriend was arrogant enough to go and look for heim on his own it was stupid of me to think that he would wait i climbed back into my overcoat and picked up my hat do you think they would have taken her to grinzing i asked her now i come to think of it i had the idea they were going to veronikas room wherever that is but if shes not there grinzing would be as good a place to look as any well lets hope shes home but even as i said it i knew in my guts that this was unlikely lotte stood up the jacket covered her chest and her upper torso but left bare the burning bush which earlier had spoken so persuasively and left me feeling as sore as a skinned rabbit what about me she said quietly what shall i do you i nodded down at her nakedness put the magic away and go home the morning was bright clear and chilly crossing the park in front of the new town hall on my way to the inner city a couple of squirrels bounded up to say hello and check me out for breakfast but before they got close they caught the cloud on my face and the smell of fear on my socks probably they even made a mental note of the heavy shape in my coat pocket and thought better of it smart little creatures after all it wasnt so very long since small mammals were being shot and eaten in vienna so they hurried on their way like living scribbles of fur at the dump where veronika lived they were used to people mostly men coming and going at all hours of the day and night and even if the landlady had been the most misanthropic of lesbians i doubt she would have paid me much attention if she had met me on the stairs but as it happened there was nobody about and i made my way up to veronikas room unchallenged i didnt need to break the door in it was wide open just like all the drawers and cupboards i wondered why they had bothered when all the evidence they needed was still hanging on the back of the chair where doctor heim had left it the stupid bitch i muttered angrily whats the point of getting rid of a mans body if you leave his suit in your room i slammed a drawer shut the force dislodged one of veronikas pathetic sketches from off the chest of drawers and it floated to the floor like a huge dead leaf könig had probably turned the place over out of pure spite and then taken her to grinzing with an important meeting there that morning i couldnt see that they would have gone anywhere else assuming that they didnt kill her outright on the other hand if veronika told them the truth about what had happened that a couple of friends had helped her to dispose of heims body after his suffering a heart attack then if she had omitted mentioning belinskys name and my own perhaps they would let her go but there was a real possibility that they might still kick her around to make sure she had told them everything she knew that by the time i arrived to try and help her i would already be exposed as the man who had dumped heims body i remembered how veronika had told me about her life as a sudeten jew during wartime how she had hid in lavatories dirty basements cupboards and attics and then a dp camp for six months a bit of hard life was how lotte hartmann had described it the more i thought about it the more it seemed to me that shed had very little of what could properly be called life at all i glanced at my wristwatch and saw that it was seven oclock there were still three hours to go before the meeting started longer before belinsky could be expected with the cavalry as he put it and because the men who had taken veronika were who they were i began to think that there was a real possibility that she wouldnt live that long it looked as if i had no choice but to go and get her myself i took out my revolver thumbed open the sixshot cylinder and checked that it was fully loaded before heading back downstairs outside i hailed a taxi at the rank on kartnerstrasse and told the driver to go to grinzing whereabouts in grinzing he asked accelerating away from the kerb ill tell you when we get there youre the boss he said speeding on to the ring only reason i asked was that everything there will be shut at this time of the morning and you dont look like youre going hillwalking not in that coat the car shuddered as we hit a couple of enormous potholes and youre no austrian i can tell that from your accent you sound like a pifke sir am i right skip the universityoflife class will you im not in the mood thats all right sir only reason i asked was in case you were looking for a little bit of fun you see sir only a few minutes further on from grinzing on the road to cobenzl theres this hotel the schlosshotel cobenzl he wrestled with the wheel as the car hit another pothole right now its being used as a dp camp theres girls there you can have for just a few cigarettes even at this hour of the morning if you fancy it a man wearing a good coat like yours could have two or three together maybe get them to put a nice show on for you between themselves if you know what i mean he laughed coarsely some of these girls sir theyve grown up in dp camps got the morals of rabbits so they have theyll do anything believe me sir i know what im talking about i keep rabbits myself he chuckled warmly at the thought of it all i could arrange something for you sir in the back of the car for a small commission of course i leaned forwards on the seat i dont know why i bothered with him maybe i just dont like garterhandlers maybe i just didnt much care for his trotskylookalike face that would be just great i said very tough if it werent for a russian tabletrap i found in the ukraine partisans put a tensionrelease grenade behind a drawer that they left halfopen with a bottle of vodka in there just to get your attention i came along pulled the drawer the pressure was released and the grenade detonated it took the meat and two vegetables clean off at my belly i nearly died of shock then i nearly died from loss of blood and when finally i came out of the coma i nearly died of grief i tell you if i so much as see a bit of plum im liable to go mad with the frustration of it id probably kill the nearest man to me out of plain envy the driver glanced back over his shoulder sorry he said nervously i didnt mean to forget it i said almost smiling now when we came past the yellow house i told the driver to keep going to the top of the hill i had decided to approach nebes house from the back through the vineyards because the meters on viennas taxis were old and out of date it was customary to multiply the tariff shown by five to give the total sum payable there were six schillings on the clock when i told him to stop and this was all the driver asked me for his hand trembling as he took the money the car was already roaring away by the time i realized he had forgotten his arithmetic i stood there on a muddy track by the side of the road wondering why i hadnt kept my mouth shut having intended to tell the man to wait a while now if i did find veronika i would have the problem of how to get away me and my smart mouth i thought the poor bastard was only offering a service i told myself but he was wrong about one thing there was something open a café further up cobenzlgasse the rudelshof i decided that if i was going to get shot id prefer to collect it with something in my stomach the café was a cosy little place if you didnt mind taxidermy i sat down under the beady eye of an anthraxiclooking weasel and waited for the badly stuffed proprietor to shamble up to my table gods greeting to you sir he said its a lovely morning i reeled away from his distilled breath i can tell youre already enjoying it i said using my smart mouth yet again he shrugged uncomprehending and took my order the fiveschilling viennese breakfast i gobbled tasted like the taxidermist had cooked it during his time off between jobs the coffee had grounds in it the roll was about as fresh as a piece of scrimshaw and the egg was so hard it might have come from a quarry but i ate it i had so much on my mind id probably have eaten the weasel if only theyd sat it on a slice of toast outside the café i walked down the road awhile and then climbed over a wall into what i thought must be arthur nebes vineyard there wasnt much to see the vines themselves planted in neat rows were still only young shoots hardly higher than my knee here and there on high trolleys were what looked like abandoned jet engines but were in fact the rapid burners they used at night to heat the atmosphere around the shoots and protect them from late frost they were still warm to the touch the field itself was perhaps a hundred metres square and offered little in the way of cover i wondered exactly how belinsky would manage to deploy his men apart from crawling the length of the field on your belly you could only stay close to the wall while you worked your way down to the trees immediately behind the yellow house and its outbuildings when i got as far as the trees i looked for some sign of life and seeing none i edged my way forwards until i heard voices next to the largest of the outbuildings a long halftimbered affair that resembled a barn two men neither of whom i recognized were standing talking each man wore a metal drum on his back and this was connected by a rubber hose to a long thin tube of metal he held in his hand which i presumed to be some kind of cropspraying contraption at last they finished their conversation and walked towards the opposite side of the vineyard as if to start their attack on the bacteria fungi and insects which plagued their lives i waited until they were well across the field before leaving the cover of the trees and entering the building a musty fruit smell hit my nostrils large oak vats and storage tanks were ranged under the open rafters of the ceiling like enormous cheeses i walked the length of the stone floor and emerged at the other end of this first building to be faced with the door to another built at right angles to the house this second outhouse contained hundreds of oak barrels which lay on their sides as if awaiting the giant st bernard dogs to come and collect them stairs led down into the darkness it seemed like a good place to imprison someone so i switched on the light and went downstairs to take a look but there were only thousands of bottles of wine each rack marked by a small blackboard on which were chalked a few numbers that must have meant something to somebody i came back upstairs switched off the light and stood by the barrelroom window it was beginning to look as if veronika might be in the house after all from where i was standing i had a clear view across a short cobbled yard to the west side of the house in front of an open door a big black cat sat staring at me beside the door was the window of what looked like the kitchen there was a large shiny shape on the kitchen ledge which i thought was probably a pot or a kettle after a while the cat walked slowly up to the outbuilding where i was hiding and mewed loudly at something beside the window where i was standing for a second or two it fixed me with its green eyes and then for no apparent reason ran off i looked back towards the house and continued to watch the kitchen door and window after a few more minutes i judged it safe to leave the barrel room and started across the yard i had not gone three paces when i heard the ratchet sound of an automaticslide and almost simultaneously felt the cold steel of a gun muzzle pressed hard against my neck clasp your hands behind your head said a voice none too distinctly i did as i was told the gun pressed under my ear felt heavy enough to be a enough to dispose of a large part of my skull i winced as he screwed the gun between my jaw and my jugular vein twitch and youre tomorrow mornings pig swill he said smacking my pockets and relieving me of my revolver youll find that herr nebe is expecting me i said dont know a herr nebe he said thickly almost as if his mouth didnt work properly naturally i was reluctant to turn round and take a good look to make sure yes thats right he changed his name didnt he i tried hard to remember nebes new surname meanwhile i heard the man behind me step back a couple of steps now walk to your right he told me towards the trees and dont trip on your shoelaces or anything he sounded big and not too bright and it was a strangely accented german he spoke like prussian but different more like the old prussian i had heard my grandfather speak almost like the german i had heard spoken in poland look youre making a mistake i said why dont you check with your boss my name is bernhard gunther theres a meeting at ten oclock this morning im supposed to be at it its not even eight yet grunted my captor if youre here for a meeting how come youre so early and how come you dont come to the front door like normal visitors how come you walk across the fields how come you snoop around in the outhouses im early because i own a couple of wineshops in berlin i said i thought it might be nice to take a look around the estate you were taking a look all right youre a snooper he chuckled cretinously i got orders to shoot snoopers now wait a minute i turned into a clubbing blow from his gun and as i fell i caught a glimpse of a big man with a shaven head and a lopsided sort of jaw he grabbed me by the scruff of my neck and hauled me back on to my feet and i wondered why i had never thought to sew a razor blade under that part of my coat collar he pushed me through the line of trees and down a slope to a small clearing where several large dustbins were standing a trail of smoke and a sweet sickly smell arose through the roof of a small brick hut it was where they incinerated the rubbish next to several bags of what looked like cement a sheet of rusting corrugated iron lay on some bricks the man ordered me to draw it aside now i had it he was a latvian a big stupid latvian and i decided that if he was working for arthur nebe he was probably from a latvian ss division that had served in one of the polish death camps they had used a lot of latvians at places like auschwitz latvians were enthusiastic antisemites when moses mendelssohn was one of germanys favourite sons i hauled the iron sheet away from what was revealed as some kind of old drain or cesspit certainly it smelt every bit as bad it was then that i saw the cat again it emerged from between two paper sacks labelled calcium oxide close by the pit it mewed contemptuously as if to say i warned you there was someone standing in that yard but you wouldnt listen to me an acrid chalky smell came up from the pit and made my skin crawl youre right mewed the cat like something from edgar allan poe calcium oxide is a cheap alkali for treating acid soil just the sort of thing you would expect to see in a vineyard but its also called quicklime and thats an extremely efficient compound for speeding human decomposition with horror i realized that the latvian really did mean to kill me and there i was trying to place his accent like some sort of philologist and to recall the chemical formulas i had learned at school then i got my first good look at him he was big and as burly as a circus horse but you hardly noticed that for looking at his face its whole right side was crooked like he had a big chew of tobacco in his cheek his right eye stared wide as if it had been made of glass he could probably have kissed his own ear lobe starved of affection as any man with such a face would have been he probably had to kneel down by the side of the pit he snarled sounding like a neanderthal short of a couple of vital chromosomes youre not going to kill an old comrade are you i said desperately trying to remember nebes new name or even one of the latvian regiments i considered shouting for help except that i knew he would have shot me without hesitation youre an old comrade he sneered without much apparent difficulty obersturmführer with the first latvian i said with a poor show of nonchalance the latvian spat into the bushes and regarded me blankly with his pop eye the gun a big blue steel colt automatic remained pointed squarely at my chest first latvian eh you dont sound like a lat im prussian i said our family lived in riga my father was a shipworker from danzig he married a russian i offered a few words of russian by way of confirmation although i could not remember if riga was predominantly russian or germanspeaking his eyes narrowed one rather more than the other so what year was the first latvian founded i swallowed hard and racked my memory the cat mewed encouragingly reasoning that the raising of a latvian ss regiment would have to have followed operation barbarossa in i said he grinned horribly and shook his head with slow sadism he said advancing a couple of paces it was now get down on your knees or ill give it to you in the guts slowly i sank down on my knees on the edge of the pit feeling the ground wet through the material of my trousers i had seen more than enough of ss murder to know what he intended a shot in the back of the neck my body collapsing neatly into a readymade grave and a few spadefuls of quicklime on top he came around behind me in a wide circle the cat settled down to watch its tail wrapping neatly around its behind as it sat i closed my eyes and waited rainis said a voice and several seconds passed i hardly dared to look around and see if i had been saved its all right bernie you can get up now my breath came out in one huge burp of fright weakly my knees knocking i picked myself up from the edge of the pit and turned to see arthur nebe standing a few metres behind the latvian ugly to my annoyance he was grinning im glad you find it so amusing dr frankenstein i said your fucking monster nearly killed me what on earth were you thinking of bernie nebe said you should know better rainis here was only doing his job the latvian nodded sullenly and bolstered his colt he was snooping he said dully i caught him i shrugged its a nice morning i thought id take a look at grinzing i was just admiring your estate when lon chancy here stuck a gun in my ear the latvian took my revolver out of his jacket pocket and handed it to nebe he was carrying a lighter herr nolde planning to shoot small game is that it bernie you cant be too careful these days im glad you think so said nebe it saves me the trouble of apologizing he weighed my gun in his hand and then pocketed it all the same ill hang on to this for now if you dont mind guns make some of our friends nervous remind me to return it to you before you leave he turned to the latvian all right rainis thats all you were only doing your job i suggest that you go and get yourself some breakfast the monster nodded and walked back towards the house with the cat following him ill bet he can eat his weight in peanuts nebe smiled thinly some people keep savage dogs to protect them i have rainis yes well i hope hes housetrained i took off my hat and wiped my brow with my handkerchief me i wouldnt let him past the front door id keep him on a chain in the yard where does he think he is treblinka the bastard couldnt wait to shoot me arthur oh i dont doubt it he enjoys killing people nebe shook his head to my offer of a cigarette but he had to help me light mine as my hand was shaking like it was talking to a deaf apache hes a latvian nebe explained he was a corporal at the riga concentration camp when the russians captured him they stamped on his head and broke his jaw with their boots believe me i know how they must have felt they paralysed half his face and left him slightly soft in the head he was always a brutal killer but now hes more like an animal and just as loyal as any dog well naturally i was thinking hed have his good points too riga eh i jerked my head at the open pit and the incinerator i bet that little wastedisposal setup makes him feel quite at home i sucked gratefully at my cigarette and added if it comes to that i bet it makes you both feel at home nebe frowned i think you need a drink he said quietly i wouldnt be at all surprised just make sure it doesnt have any lime in it i think i lost my taste for lime for ever i followed nebe into the house and up to the library where we had talked the day before he fetched me a brandy from the drinkscabinet and set it down on the table in front of me forgive me for not joining you he said watching me down it quickly normally i quite enjoy a cognac with my breakfast but this morning i must keep a clear head he smiled indulgently as i replaced the empty glass on the table better now i nodded tell me have you found your missing dentist yet dr heim now that i no longer had to worry about my own immediate prospects for survival veronika was once again at the front of my mind hes dead im afraid thats bad enough but its not half as bad as not knowing what had happened to him was at least we now know that the russians havent got him what did happen to him he had a heart attack nebe uttered the familiar dry little laugh i remembered from my days at the alex the headquarters of berlins criminal police it seems that he was with a girl at the time a chocolady you mean it was while they were i mean precisely that still i can think of worse ways to go cant you after what ive just been through thats not particularly difficult for me arthur quite he smiled almost sheepishly i spent a moment searching for a frame of words that might enable me to innocently inquire as to veronikas fate so what did she do the chocolady i mean phone the police i frowned no i expect not why do you say that i shrugged at the apparent simplicity of my explanation i cant imagine shed have risked a runin with the vice squad no ill bet she tried to have him dumped somewhere got her garterhandler to do it i raised my eyebrows questioningly well am i right yes youre right he sounded almost as if he admired my thinking as usual then he uttered a wistful sort of sigh what a pity that were no longer with kripo i cant tell you how much i miss it all me too but you you could rejoin surely youre not wanted for anything bernie and work for the communists no thanks i pursed my lips and tried to look rueful anyway id rather stay out of berlin for a while a russian soldier tried to rob me on a train it was selfdefence but im afraid i killed him i was seen leaving the scene of the crime covered in blood the scene of the crime quoted nebe rolling the phrase round his mouth like a fine wine its good to talk to a detective again just to satisfy my professional curiosity arthur how did you find the chocolady oh it wasnt me it was könig he tells me that it was you who told him how best to go about looking for doctor heim it was just routine stuff arthur you could have told him maybe so anyway it seems that königs girlfriend recognized heim from a photograph apparently he used to frequent the nightclub where she works she remembered that heim used to be especially keen on one of the snappers who worked there all helmut had to do was persuade her to come clean about it it was as simple as that getting information out of a snapper is never as simple as that i said it can be like getting a curse out of a nun money is the only way to get a partygirl to talk that doesnt leave a bruise i waited for nebe to contradict me but he said nothing of course a bruise is cheaper and leaves no margin for error i grinned at him as if to say that i had no particular scruples when it came to slapping a chocolady in the interests of efficient investigation id say könig wasnt the type to waste money am i right to my disappointment nebe merely shrugged and then glanced at his watch youd better ask him yourself when you see him is he coming to this meeting too hell be here nebe consulted his watch again im afraid i have to leave you now ive still one or two things to do before ten perhaps it would be better if you stayed in here security is tight today and we wouldnt want another incident would we ill have someone bring you some coffee build a fire if you like its rather cold in here i tapped my glass i cant say that im noticing it much now nebe regarded me patiently yes well do help yourself to some more brandy if you think you need it thanks i said reaching for the decanter i dont mind if i do but stay sharp youll be asked a lot of questions about your russian friend i wouldnt like your opinion of his worth to be doubted merely because you had too much to drink he walked across the creaking floor to the door dont worry about me i said surveying the empty shelves ill read a book nebes considerable nose wrinkled with disapproval yes its such a pity that the library is gone apparently the previous owners left a superb collection but when the russians came they used them all as fuel for the boiler he shook his head sadly what can you do with subhumans like that when nebe had left the library i did as he had suggested and built a fire in the grate it helped me to focus my mind on my next course of action as the flames took hold of the small edifice of logs and sticks i had constructed i reflected that nebes apparent amusement at the circumstances of heims death seemed to indicate that the org was satisfied veronika had told the truth it was true i was no wiser as to where she might be but i had gained the impression that könig was not yet at grinzing and without my gun i did not see that i could now leave and look for her elsewhere with only two hours to go before the orgs meeting it appeared that my best course of action was to wait for könig to arrive and hope that he could put my mind at rest and if he had killed or injured veronika i would settle his account personally when belinsky arrived with his men i collected the poker off the hearth and stoked the fire negligently nebes man arrived with the coffee but i paid him no attention and after he had gone again i stretched out on the sofa and closed my eyes the fire stirred clapped its hands a couple of times and warmed my side behind my closed lids bright red turned to deep purple and then something more restful herr gunther i jerked my head up from the sofa sleeping in an awkward position even for only a few minutes had made my neck as stiff as new leather but when i looked at my watch i saw that i had been sleeping for more than an hour i flexed my neck sitting beside the sofa was a man wearing a grey flannel suit he leaned forward and held out his hand for me to shake it was a broad strong hand and surprisingly firm for such a short man gradually i recognized his face although i had never met him before i am dr moltke he said ive heard a great deal about you herr gunther you could have blown froth from the top of his accent it was so bavarian i nodded uncertainly there was something about his gaze i found deeply disconcerting his were the eyes of a musichall hypnotist im pleased to meet you herr doktor here was another one who had changed his name another one who was supposed to be dead like arthur nebe and yet this was no ordinary nazi fugitive from justice if indeed justice existed anywhere in europe during it gave me a strange feeling to consider that i had just shaken hands with a man who but for the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death might well have been the worlds most wanted man this was gestapo heinrich müller in person arthur nebe has been telling me about you he said you know you and i are quite alike it seems i was a police detective like yourself i began on the beat and i learnt my profession in the hard school of ordinary police work like you i also specialized while you worked for the murder commission i was led to the surveillance of communist party functionaries i even made a special study of soviet russian police methods i found much there to admire as a policeman yourself you would surely appreciate their professionalism the mvd which used to be the nkvd is probably the finest secret police force anywhere in the world better even than the gestapo for the simple reason i think that national socialism was never able to offer a faith capable of commanding such a consistent attitude towards life and do you know why i shook my head his broad bavarian speech seemed to suggest a natural geniality which i knew the man himself could not possibly have possessed because herr gunther unlike communism we never really appealed to the intellectuals as well as to the working classes you know i myself did not join the party until stalin does these things better today i see him in quite a different light than i did of old i frowned wondering whether this was müllers idea of a test or a joke but he seemed to be perfectly serious pompously so you admire stalin i asked almost incredulously he stands head and shoulders above any of our western leaders even hitler was a small man by comparison just think what stalin and his party have stood up to you were in one of their camps you know what theyre like why you even speak russian you always know where you are with the ivans they put you up against a wall and shoot you or they give you the order of lenin not like the americans or the british müllers face suddenly took on an expression of intense dislike they talk about morality and justice and yet they allow germany to starve they write about ethics and yet they hang old comrades one day and recruit them for their own security services the next you cant trust people like that herr gunther forgive me herr doktor but i was under the impression that we were working for the americans that is wrong we work with the americans but in the end we are working for germany for a new fatherland looking more thoughtful now he got up and went over to the window his manner of expressing deliberation was a silent rhapsody more characteristic of a peasant priest wrestling with his conscience he folded his thick hands thoughtfully unclasped them again and finally pressed his temples between both fists there is nothing to admire in america not like russia but the amis do have power and what gives them this power is the dollar that is the only reason why we must oppose russia we need the american dollars all that the soviet union can give us is an example an example of just what loyalty and dedication can achieve even without money so then think what germans might do with similar devotion and american cash i tried and failed to stifle a yawn why are you telling me this herr herr doktor for one ghastly second i had almost called him herr müller did anyone but arthur nebe and perhaps von bolschwing who had interrogated me know who moltke really was we are working for a new tomorrow herr gunther germany may be divided between them now but there will come a time when we are a great power again a great economic power so long as our organization works alongside the amis to oppose communism they will be persuaded to allow germany to rebuild herself and with our industry and our technology we shall achieve what hitler could never have achieved and what stalin yes even stalin with his massive fiveyear plans what he can still only dream of the german may never rule militarily but he can do it economically it is the mark not the swastika that will conquer europe you doubt what i say if i looked surprised it was only because the idea of german industry being on top of anything but a scrapheap seemed perfectly ludicrous its just that i wonder if everyone in the org thinks the same way as you he shrugged not precisely no there are a variety of opinions as to the worth of our allies and the evil of our enemies but all are agreed on one thing and that is the new germany whether it takes five years or fiftyfive years absently müller started to pick his nose it occupied him for several seconds after which he inspected his thumb and forefinger and then wiped them on nebes curtains it was i considered a poor indicator of the new germany he had been speaking of anyway i just wanted this opportunity to thank you personally for your initiative ive had a good look at the documents that your friend has provided and theres no doubt in my mind its firstclass material the americans will be beside themselves with excitement when they see it im pleased to hear it müller strolled back to his chair by my sofa and sat down again how confident are you that he can carry on providing this sort of highgrade material very confident herr doktor excellent you know this couldnt have come along at a better time the south german industries utilization company is applying to the american state department for increased funding your mans information will be an important part of that case at this mornings meeting i shall be recommending that the exploitation of this new source be given top priority here in vienna he collected the poker off the hearth and jabbed violently at the glowing embers of the fire it wasnt too difficult to imagine him doing the same to some human subject staring into the flames he added with a matter of such personal interest to me i have a favour to ask herr gunther im listening herr doktor i must confess i had hoped to persuade you to let me run this informer myself i thought for a minute naturally i should have to ask his opinion he trusts me it might take a little time of course and as i told nebe hell want money lots of it you can tell him ill organize everything a swiss bank account whatever he wants right now what he wants most is a swiss watch i said improvising a doxas no problem müller grinned you see what i mean about the russian he knows exactly what he wants a nice watch well leave that to me müller replaced the poker on its stand and sat back contentedly then i can assume you have no objections to my proposal naturally you will be wellrewarded for bringing us such an important informer since you mention it i do have a figure in mind i said müller raised his hands and beckoned me to name it you may or may not know that i suffered a heavy loss at cards quite recently i lost most of my money about schillings i thought that you might like to make that up to he pursed his lips and started nodding slowly that sounds not unreasonable in the circumstances i smiled it amused me that müller was so concerned to protect his area of expertise within the org that he was willing to buy me out of my involvement with belinskys russian it was easy to see that in this way the reputation of gestapo müller as the authority on all matters relating to the mvd would be ensured he slapped both his knees decisively good im glad thats settled ive enjoyed our little chat well talk again after this mornings meeting we certainly will i said to myself only it would probably be at the stiftskaserne or wherever the crowcass people were likely to interrogate müller of course well have to discuss the procedure for contacting your source arthur tells me you already have a deadletter arrangement its all written down i said to him im sure youll find everything is in order i glanced at my watch and saw that it was already past ten oclock i got up and straightened my tie oh dont worry müller said clapping me on the shoulder he seemed almost jovial now that he had got what he wanted they will wait for us i can assure you but almost at the same moment the library door opened and the slightly irritated face of the baron von bolschwing peered into the room he raised his wristwatch significantly and said herr doktor we really must get on now its all right müller boomed weve finished you can tell everyone to come in now thank you very much but the barons voice was peevish meetings sneered müller one after another in this organization theres no end to the pain of it like wiping your arse with a car tyre its as if himmler were still alive i smiled that reminds me i have to hit the spot its just along the corridor he said i went to the door excusing myself first to the baron and then to arthur nebe as i shouldered past the men coming into the library these were old comrades all right men with hard eyes flabby smiles wellfed stomachs and a certain arrogance as if none of them had ever lost a war or done anything for which they ought to have been in any way ashamed this was the collective face of the new germany that müller had droned on about but of könig there was still no sign in the soursmelling toilet i bolted the door carefully checked my watch and stood at the window trying to see the road beyond the trees at the side of the house with the wind stirring the leaves it was difficult to distinguish anything very clearly but in the distance i thought that i could just about make out the fender of a big black car i reached for the cord of the blind and hoping that the thing was attached to the wall rather more firmly than the blind in my own bathroom back in berlin i pulled it gently down for five seconds then let it roll up again for another five seconds when i had done this three times as arranged i waited for belinskys signal and felt very relieved when i heard three blasts of a car horn from far away then i flushed the toilet and opened the door halfway back along the corridor leading back to the library i saw königs dog he stood in the middle of the corridor sniffing the air and regarding me with something like recognition then he turned away and trotted downstairs i didnt think there was a quicker way of finding könig than by letting his crapper do it for me so i followed at a door on the ground floor the dog stopped and whined a little bark as soon as i opened it he was off again scampering along another corridor towards the back of the house he stopped once more and made a show of trying to burrow under another door to what looked like the cellar for several seconds i hesitated to open it but when the dog barked i decided that it was wiser to let him through rather than risk that the noise would summon könig i turned the handle pushed and when the door didnt budge pulled it came towards me with only a gentle creak largely concealed by what sounded at first like a cat mewing somewhere down in the cellar cool air and the horrible realization that this was no cat touched my face and i felt myself shiver involuntarily then the dog twisted round the edge of the door and disappeared down the bare wooden stairs even before i had tiptoed to the bottom of the flight where a large rack of wine concealed me from immediate discovery i had recognized the painful voice as belonging to veronika the scene required very little analysis she was sitting in a chair stripped to the waist her face deathly pale a man sat immediately in front of her his sleeves were rolled up and he was torturing her knee with some bloodstained metal object könig stood behind her steadying the chair and periodically stifling her screams with a length of rag there was no time to worry about my lack of a gun and it was fortunate that könig was momentarily distracted by the arrival of his dog lingo he said looking down at the brute how did you get down here i thought i locked you out he bent down to pick the dog up and in the same moment i stepped smartly round the wine rack and ran forwards the man in the chair was still in his seat as i clapped both his ears with my cupped hands as hard as i could he screamed and fell on to the floor clutching both sides of his head and writhing desperately as he tried to contain the pain of what were almost certainly burst eardrums it was then that i saw what he had been doing to veronika slicking out of her knee joint at a right angle was a corkscrew königs gun was even now halfway out of his shoulderholster i leaped at him punched hard at his exposed armpit and then chopped him across the upper lip with the edge of my hand the two blows together were enough to disable him he staggered back from veronikas chair blood pouring from his nose i neednt have hit him again but now that his hand no longer covered her mouth her loud cries of excruciating pain persuaded me to deliver a third more vicious blow with my forearm aimed at the centre of his sternum he was unconscious before he hit the ground immediately the dog stopped its furious barking and set about trying to revive him with its tongue i picked königs gun off the floor slipped it into my trouser pocket and quickly started untying veronika its all right i said were getting out of here belinsky will be here any minute with the police i tried not to look at the mess they had made of her knee she moaned pitiably as i pulled the last of the cords away from her bloodstained legs her skin was cold and she was shaking all over clearly going into shock but when i took off my jacket and put it about her shoulders she held my hand firmly and said through gritted teeth get it out for gods sake get it out of my knee with one eye on the cellar stairs in case one of nebes men should come looking for me now that my presence upstairs was overdue i knelt down in front of her and surveyed the wound and the instrument that had caused it it was an ordinarylooking corkscrew with a wooden handle now sticky with blood the sharp business end had been screwed into the side of her kneejoint to a depth of several millimetres and there seemed no way of removing it without causing her almost as much pain as had been caused by screwing it in the slightest touch of the handle made her cry out please take it out she urged sensing my indecision all right i said but hold on to the seat of your chair this is going to hurt i drew the other chair close enough to prevent her kicking me in the groin and sat down ready she closed her eyes and nodded the first anticlockwise twist turned her face a bright shade of scarlet then she screamed with every particle of air in her lungs but with the second twist mercifully she passed out i surveyed the thing in my hand for a brief second and then hurled it at the man whose ears i had boxed lying in a corner breathing stertorously between groans veronikas torturer looked to be in a bad way the blow had been a cruel one and although i had never used it before i knew from my army training that sometimes it even caused a fatal brain haemorrhage veronikas knee was bleedily heavily i searched around for something with which to bandage her wound and decided to make do with the shirt of the man i had deafened i went over to him and tore it off his back having folded the body of the shirt i pressed it hard against the knee and then used the sleeves to tie it tightly when the dressing was finished it was a good looking piece of firstaid work but her breathing had turned shallow now and i didnt doubt that she would need a stretcher out of there by this time almost fifteen minutes had elapsed since my signal to belinsky and yet there was no sound that anything had yet happened how long could it take his men to move in i hadnt heard so much as a shout to indicate that they might have encountered some resistance with people like the latvian around it seemed too much to expect that müller and nebe could have been arrested without a fight könig moaned and moved his leg feebly like a swatted insect i kicked the dog aside and bent down to take a look at him the skin underneath his moustache had turned a dark livid colour and from the amount of blood that had rolled down his cheeks i judged that i had probably separated his nose cartilage from the upper section of his jaw i guess itll be a while before you enjoy another cigar i said grimly i took königs mauser out of my pocket and checked the breech through the inspection hole i saw the familiar glint of a centrefire cartridge one in the chamber i hauled out the magazine and saw another six neatly ranged like so many cigarettes i slammed the magazine back up the handle with the heel of my hand and thumbed back the hammer it was time to find out what had happened to belinsky i went back up the cellar stairs waited behind the door for a moment and listened briefly i thought i heard breathing and then realized that it was my own i brought the gun up beside my head slipped the safety off with my thumbnail and came through the door for a split second i saw the latvians black cat and then felt what seemed like the whole ceiling collapsing on top of me i heard a small popping noise like a champagne cork and almost laughed as i realized that it was all the sound of the gun firing involuntarily in my hand that my concussed brain was able to decode stunned like a landed salmon i lay on the floor my body hummed like a telephone cable too late i remembered that for a big man the latvian was remarkably light on his feet he knelt down beside me grinned into my face before wielding the cosh again then the darkness came there was a message waiting for me it was written in capital letters as if to emphasize its importance i struggled to make my eyes focus only the message kept moving blearily i picked out the individual letters it was laborious but i had no choice finally i pieced the letters together the message read care usa it seemed important somehow although i failed to understand why but then i saw that this was only one part of the message and the second half at that i swallowed nauseously and struggled through the first part of the message which was coded grwt lbs cuft what could it all mean i was still trying to understand the code when i heard footsteps and then the sound of a key turning in the lock my head cleared agonizingly as i was hauled up by two pairs of strong hands one of the men kicked the empty cardboard care package out of the way as they frogmarched me through the doorway my neck and shoulder were hurting so bad that my skin turned to gooseflesh the second they held me under my arms which i now realized were handcuffed in front of me i retched desperately and tried to get back on to the floor where i had felt comparatively comfortable but i remained supported and struggling merely made the pain more intense and so i allowed myself to be dragged along a short damp passageway past a couple of broken barrels and up some steps to a big oak vat the two men sat me roughly in a chair a voice müllers voice told them to give me some wine i want him to be fully conscious when we question him someone put a glass to my lips and tilted my head painfully i drank when the glass was empty i could taste blood in my mouth i spat in front of me i didnt care where cheap stuff i heard myself croak cooking wine müller laughed and i turned my head towards the sound the bare lightbulbs burned only dimly but even so they managed to hurt my eyes i squeezed the lids hard shut and then opened them again good said müller youve still got something left in you youll need it to answer all my questions herr gunther i can assure you müller was sitting on a chair with his legs crossed and his arms folded he looked like a man who was about to watch an audition seated beside him and looking rather less relaxed than the former gestapo chief was nebe next to him sat könig wearing a clean shirt and holding his nose and mouth with a handkerchief as if he had a bad attack of hayfever on the stone floor at their feet lay veronika she was unconscious and but for the bandage round her knee quite naked like me she was also handcuffed although her pallor indicated that this was an entirely redundant precaution i turned my head to the right a few metres away stood the latvian and another thug whom i hadnt seen before the latvian was grinning excitedly no doubt in anticipation of my further humiliation we were in the largest of the outhouses beyond the windows the night looked in on the proceedings with dark indifference somewhere i could hear the low throb of a generator it hurt to move my head or my neck and it was actually more comfortable to look back at müller ask anything you like i said youll get nothing out of me but even as i spoke i knew that in müllers expert hands there was no more chance of my not telling him everything than there was of me naming the next pope he found my bravado sufficiently absurd as to laugh and shake his head its quite a few years since i conducted an interrogation he said with what sounded like nostalgia however i think youll find that i havent lost my touch müller looked to nebe and könig as if seeking their approbation and each man nodded grimly i bet you won prizes for it you halfsized bastard at this utterance the latvian was prompted to strike me hard across the cheek the sudden jerk of my head sent an agonizing pain down to my toenails and made me cry out no no rainis müller said like a father to a child we must allow herr gunther to talk he may insult us now but eventually he will tell us what we want to hear please dont hit him again unless i order you to do it nebe spoke its no use bernie fräulein zartl has now told us all about how you and this american fellow disposed of poor heims body i wondered why you were so inquisitive about her now we know in fact we now know a great deal said müller while you have been having a nap arthur here posed as a policeman in order to gain access to your rooms he smiled smugly it wasnt too difficult for him austrians are such docile lawabiding people arthur tell herr gunther what you discovered your photographs heinrich i imagine that the american must have given them to him what do you say bernie go to hell nebe continued unperturbed there was also a drawing of martin albers headstone you remember that unfortunate business herr doktor yes said müller that was very careless of max i dare say you must have guessed that max abs and martin albers were one and the same person bernie he was an oldfashioned rather sentimental kind of man he just couldnt pretend to be dead like the rest of us no he had to have a stone to commemorate his passing to make it look respectable really a typical viennese wouldnt you say i should think you were probably the person who tipped off the mps in munich that max was due to arrive there of course you werent to know that max was carrying several sets of papers and travel warrants you see documents were maxs speciality he was a master forger as the former head of sd clandestine operations section in budapest he was one of the very best in his field i suppose he was another bogus conspirator against hitler i said another fake entry on the list of all those who were executed just like you arthur i have to hand it to you youve been very clever that was maxs idea said nebe ingenious yes but with königs help not very difficult to organize you see könig commanded the execution squad at plotzensee and hanged conspirators by the hundreds he supplied all the details as well as the butchers hooks and piano wire no doubt herr gunther said könig indistinctly through the handkerchief he kept pressed to his nose i hope to be able to do the same for you müller frowned were wasting time he said briskly nebe told your landlady that the austrian police thought you had been kidnapped by the russians after that she was most helpful apparently your rooms are being paid for by dr ernst liebl this man is now known to us as emil beckers advocate at law nebe is of the opinion that you were retained by him to come to vienna and attempt to clear him of the murder of captain linden i myself am of this opinion everything fits so to speak müller nodded at one of the uglies who stepped forward and collected up veronika in his pylonsized arms she made no movement and but for her breathing which became louder and more difficult as her head lolled back on her neck one might have thought that she was dead she looked as if they had drugged her why dont you leave her out of this müller i said ill tell you whatever it is you want to know müller pretended to look puzzled that surely is what remains to be seen he stood up as did nebe and könig bring herr gunther along rainis the latvian hauled me to my feet just the effort of being made to stand made me feel suddenly faint he dragged me a few metres to the side of a sunken circular oak vat which was of the dimensions of a goodsized fishpond the vat itself was joined to a rectangular steel plate which had two wooden semicircular wings like the leaves of a large dining table by a thick steel column which went up to the ceiling the thug carrying veronika stepped down in the vat and laid her on the bottom then he got out and drew down the two oak leaves of the plate to form a perfect deadly circle this is a wine press müller said matteroffactly i struggled weakly in the latvians big arms but there was nothing i could do it felt like my shoulder or collarbone was broken i called them several filthy words and müller nodded approvingly your concern for this young woman is encouraging he said it was her you were looking for this morning said nebe when you walked into rainis wasnt it yes all right it was now let her go for gods sake i give you my word arthur she knows absolutely nothing yes thats true müller admitted or at least not much so könig tells me anyway and he is a most persuasive person but youll be flattered to learn that she still managed to conceal the part which you played in heims disappearance for quite a while isnt that so helmut yes general but in the end she told us everything müller continued even before your impossibly heroic arrival on the scene she told us that you and she had enjoyed a sexual relationship and that you had been kind to her which was why she had asked you for help when it came to getting rid of heims body which was why you came looking for her when könig took her away incidentally i must compliment you you killed one of nebes men quite expertly its a great pity that a man of your formidable skills will never work for our organization after all but a number of things remain a puzzle and i expect you herr gunther to enlighten us he glanced around and saw that the man who had laid veronika into the vat was now standing by a small panel of electric switches on the wall do you know anything about making wine he asked walking round the vat the crushing as the word suggests is the process whereby the grape is squeezed bursting its skin and releasing the juice as you will no doubt be aware it was once done by treading the grapes in huge casks but most modern presses are pneumatic or electrically operated machines the crushing is repeated several times and thus is an indication of the quality of the wine with the first press being the best of all once every bit of juice has been squeezed out the residue i believe nebe calls it the cake is supplied to a distillery or as is the case on this small estate it is turned into fertilizer müller looked across at arthur nebe there arthur did i get that right nebe smiled indulgently perfectly right herr general i hate to mislead anyone müller said with good humour even a man who is going to die he paused and looked down into the vat of course at this precise moment it is not your life which is the most pressing issue if i may be permitted that one tasteless little joke the big latvian guffawed in my ear and my head was suddenly enveloped with the stink of his garlicky breath so i advise you to make your answers quickly and accurately herr gunther fräulein zartls life depends on it he nodded at the man by the control panel who pressed a button which initiated a mechanical noise gradually increasing in pitch dont think too harshly of us said müller these are hard times there are shortages of everything if we had any sodium pentathol we should give it to you we should even look to buy it on the black market but i think youll agree that this method is every bit as effective as any truth drug ask your damned questions ah youre in a hurry to answer thats good tell me then who is this american policeman the one who helped you dispose of heims body his name is john belinsky he works for crowcass how did you meet him he knew that i was working to prove beckers innocence he approached me with an offer to work in tandem initially he said that he wanted to find out why captain linden had been murdered but then after a while he told me that he really wanted to find out about you if you had anything to do with lindens death so the americans arent happy that they have the right man no yes the military police are but the crowcass people arent the gun used to kill linden was one which they traced back to a killing in berlin a corpse which was supposed to be you müller and the gun checked back to ss records at the berlin documents centre crowcass didnt inform the military police for fear that they might spook you out of vienna and you were encouraged to infiltrate the org on their behalf yes are they so certain that im here yes but until this morning you had never seen me before explain how they know please the information that i supplied on the mvd was designed to draw you out they know you like to consider yourself an expert in these matters the thinking was that with information of such quality you yourself would take charge of the debrief if i saw you at this mornings meeting i was to signal to belinsky from the toilet window i had to pull down the blind three times he would be watching the window through binoculars and then what he was supposed to have brought agents to surround the house he was meant to have arrested you the deal was that if they were successful in arresting you then they would let becker go free nebe glanced over at one of his men and jerked his head at the door get some men to check the grounds just in case müller shrugged so youre saying that the only reason they know im here in vienna is because you made some signal to them from a lavatory window is that it i nodded but then why didnt this belinsky have his men move in and arrest me as you had planned believe me ive been asking myself the same question come now herr gunther this is inconsistent is it not i ask you to be fair how am i supposed to believe this would i have gone looking for the girl if i didnt think there were going to be agents arriving what time were you supposed to make your signal asked nebe twenty minutes into the meeting i was supposed to excuse myself at then but you were looking for fräulein zartl before seven oclock this morning i decided that she might not be able to wait until the americans showed up youre asking us to believe that you would have risked a whole operation for one müllers nose wrinkled with disgust for one little chocolady he shook his head i find that very hard to believe he nodded at the man controlling the wine press this man pushed a second button and the machines hydraulics cranked into gear come now herr gunther if what you say is true why didnt the americans come when you signalled to them i dont know i shouted then speculate said nebe they never meant to arrest you i said putting into words my own suspicions all they wanted to know was that you were alive and working for the org they used me and after they found out what they wanted they dumped me i tried to wrestle free of the latvian as the press began its slow descent veronika lay unconscious her chest swelling gently as she continued breathing oblivious to the descending plate i shook my head look i honestly dont know why they didnt turn up so said müller lets get this clear the only evidence that they have of my continued existence apart from this rather tenuous piece of ballistic evidence you mentioned is your own signal yes i suppose so one more question do you do the amis know why captain linden was killed no i said and then reasoning that negative answers were not what was wanted added we figured that he was being supplied with information about warcriminals in the org that he came to vienna to investigate you at first we thought that könig was supplying him with the information i shook my head trying to recall some of the theories i had come up with to explain lindens death then we thought that he might somehow have been supplying the org with information in order to help you to recruit new members switch that machine off for gods sake veronika disappeared from sight as the press closed over the edge of the vat there were only two or three metres of life left to her we didnt know why damn you müllers voice was slow and calm like a surgeons we must be sure herr gunther let me repeat the question i dont know why was it necessary for us to kill linden i shook my head desperately just tell me the truth what do you know youre not being fair to this young woman tell us what you found out the shrill whine of the machine grew louder it reminded me of the sound of the elevator in my old offices in berlin where i should have stayed herr gunther müllers voice contained a gramme of urgency for the sake of this poor girl i beg you for gods sake he glanced over at the thug by the control panel and shook his squarelycropped head i cant tell you anything i shouted the press shuddered as it encountered its living obstacle the mechanical whine briefly rose a couple of octaves as the resistance to the hydraulic force was dealt with and then returned to its old pitch before finally the press came to the end of its cruel journey the noise died away at another nod from mxiller cant or wont herr gunther you bastard i said suddenly weak with disgust you vicious cruel bastard i dont think shell have felt much he said with studied indifference she was drugged which is more than you will be when we repeat this little exercise in say he glanced at his wristwatch twelve hours you have until then to think it over he looked over the edge of the vat i cant promise to kill you outright of course not like this girl i might want to squeeze you two or three times before we spread you on the fields just like the grapes on the other hand if you tell me what i wish to know i can promise you a rather less painful death a pill would be so much less distressing for you dont you think i felt my lip curl müller winced fastidiously as i started to swear and then shook his head rainis he said you may hit herr gunther just once before returning him to his quarters back in my cell i massaged the floating rib above my liver which nebes latvian had selected for one stunningly painful punch at the same time i tried to douse the lights on the memory of what had just happened to veronika but without success i had met men who had been tortured by the russians during the war i remembered them describing how the most awful part of it was the uncertainty whether you would die whether you could withstand the pain that part was certainly true one of them had described a way of reducing the pain breathing deeply and gulping could induce a lightheadedness that was partly anaesthetic the only trouble was that it had also left my friend prone to bouts of chronic hyperventilation which eventually caused him to suffer a fatal heartattack i cursed myself for my selfishness an innocent girl already a victim of the nazis had been killed because of her association with me somewhere inside of me a voice replied that it was she who had asked for my help and that they might well have tortured and killed her irrespective of my own involvement but i was in no mood to go easy on myself wasnt there anything else i could have told müller about lindens death that might have satisfied him and what would i tell him when it came to my own turn selfish again but there was no avoiding my egotisms snakes eyes i didnt want to die more importantly i didnt want to die on my knees begging for mercy like an italian warhero they say impending pain offers the mind the purest aid to concentration doubtless müller would have known that thinking about the lethal pill he had promised me if i told him whatever it was he wanted to hear helped me to remember something vital twisting round my handcuffs i reached down into my trouser pocket and tugged out the lining with my little finger allowing the two pills i had taken from heims surgery to roll into my palm i wasnt even sure why i had taken them at all curiosity perhaps or maybe it was some subconscious prompt which had told me i might have need of a painless exit myself for a long time i just stared at the tiny cyanide capsules with a mixture of relief and horrific fascination after a while i hid one pill in my trouserturnup which left the one i had decided i would keep in my mouth the one that would in all probability kill me with an appreciation of irony that was much exaggerated by my situation i reflected that i had arthur nebe to thank for diverting these lethal pills from the secret agents for whom they had been created to the top brass in the ss and from them to me perhaps the pill in my hand had been nebes own it is of such speculations however improbable that a mans philosophy consists during his last remaining hours i slipped the pill into my mouth and held it gingerly between my back molars when the time came would i even have the guts to chew the thing my tongue pushed the pill over the edge of my tooth and into the corner of my cheek i rubbed my fingers over my face and could feel it through the flesh would anyone see it the only light in the cell came from a bare bulb fixed to one of the wooden rafters seemingly with nothing but cobwebs all the same i couldnt help thinking that the outline of the pill in my mouth was very much visible when a key scraped in the mortice i realized that i would soon find out the latvian came through the door holding his big colt in one hand and a small tray in the other get away from the door he said thickly whats this i said sliding backwards on my backside a meal perhaps you could tell the management that what id like most is a cigarette lucky to get anything at all he growled carefully he squatted down and laid the tray on the dusty floor there was a jug of coffee and a large slice of strudel the coffees fresh the strudel is homemade for a brief stupid second i considered rushing him before reminding myself that a man in my weakened condition could rush about as quickly as a frozen waterfall and i would have had no more chance of overpowering the huge latvian than i had of engaging him in socratic dialogue he seemed to sense some flicker of hope on my face however even though the pill resting on my gum remained undetected go ahead he said try something i wish you would id like to blow your kneecap off laughing like a retarded grizzly bear he backed out of my cell and closed the door with a loud bang from the size of him i judged rainis to be the kind who enjoyed his food when he wasnt killing or hurting people it was probably his only real pleasure perhaps he was even something of a glutton it occurred to me that if i were to leave the strudel untouched rainis might be unable to resist eating it himself that if i were to put one of my cyanide capsules inside the filling then later on perhaps long after i myself was dead the dumb latvian would eat my cake and die it might i reflected be a comforting thought as i left the world that he would be swiftly following me i decided to drink the coffee while i thought about it was a lethal pill hotwatersoluble i didnt know so i popped the capsule out of my mouth and thinking that it might as well be that pill which i used to put my pathetic plan into action i pushed it into the fruit filling with my forefinger i could happily have eaten it myself pill and all i was so hungry my watch told me that over fifteen hours had passed since my viennese breakfast and the coffee tasted good i decided that it could only have been arthur nebe who had instructed the latvian to bring me supper another hour passed there were eight to go before they would come to take me back upstairs i would wait until there was no hope no possibility of reprieve before i took my own life i tried to sleep but without much success i was beginning to understand what becker must have felt like facing the gallows at least i was better off than he was i still had my lethal pill it was almost midnight when i heard the key in the lock again quickly i transferred my second pill from my trouserturnup to my cheek in case they decided to search my clothes but it was not rainis who came to fetch my tray but arthur nebe he held an automatic in his hand dont force me to use this bernie he said you know i wont hesitate to shoot you if i have to youd best get back against that far wall whats this a social call i dragged myself back from the door he tossed a packet of cigarettes and some matches after me you might say that i hope youre not here to talk about old times arthur im not feeling very sentimental right now i looked at the cigarettes winston does müller know youre smoking american nails arthur be careful you might get into trouble hes got some strange ideas about the amis i lit one and inhaled with slow satisfaction still bless you for this nebe drew a chair round the door and sat down mviller has his own ideas of where the org is going he said but theres no doubting his patriotism or his determination hes quite ruthless i cant say id noticed he has an unfortunate tendency to judge other people by his own insensitive standards however which means that he really does believe you are capable of keeping your mouth shut and allowing that girl to die he smiled i of course know you rather better than that gunther is a sentimental sort of man i told him even a little bit of a fool it would be just like him to risk his neck for someone he hardly knew even a chocolady it was the same in minsk i said he was perfectly prepared to go to the front line rather than kill innocent people people to whom he owed nothing that doesnt make me a hero arthur just a human being it makes you someone müller is used to dealing with a man with a principle müller knows what men will take and still stay silent hes seen lots of people sacrifice their friends and then themselves in order to keep silent hes a fanatic fanaticism is the only thing he understands and as a result he thinks youre a fanatic hes convinced theres a possibility that you might be holding out on him as i said i know you rather better than that if you had known why linden was killed i think you would have said so well its nice to know somebody believes me itll make being turned into this years vintage all the more bearable look arthur why are you telling me this so i can tell you that youre a better judge of character than müller i was thinking if you were to tell müller exactly what he wants to hear then it might save you a lot of pain id hate to see an old friend suffer and believe me hell make you suffer i dont doubt it its not this coffee thats helped to keep me awake i can tell you come on what is this the old friend and foe routine like i said i dont know why linden was canned no but i could tell you i winced as the cigarette smoke stung my eyes let me get this straight i said uncertainly youre going to tell me what happened to linden in order that i can spill it to müller and thereby save myself from a fate worse than death right thats about the size of it i shrugged painfully i dont see that ive got anything to lose i grinned of course you could just let me escape arthur for old times sake we werent going to talk about old times you said so yourself anyway you know too much youve seen müller youve seen me im dead remember nothing personal arthur but i wish you were i took another cigarette and lit myself with the butt of the first all right unpack it why was linden killed linden had a germanamerican background he even read german at cornell university during the war he had some minor intelligence role and afterwards worked as a denazification officer he was a clever man and soon had a nice racket going for himself selling persil certificates clearances for old comrades you know the sort of thing then he joined the cic as a deskinvestigator and crowcass liaison officer at the berlin documents centre naturally he kept up his old blackmarket contacts and by this time he had become known to us in the org as someone sympathetic to our cause we contacted him in berlin and offered him a sum of money to perform a small service on an occasional basis you remember i told you about how a number of us faked our deaths gave ourselves new identities well that was albers the max abs you were interested in his idea but of course the fundamental weakness of any new identity especially when it has to be done so quickly is that one lacks a past think of it bernie world war every ablebodied german between the ages of twelve and sixtyfive under arms and no service record for me alfred nolde where was i what was i doing we thought we were very clever in killing off our real identities letting the records fall into the hands of the amis but instead it merely created new questions we had no idea that the documents centre would prove to be quite so comprehensive its effect has been to make it possible to check every answer on a mans denazification questionnaire many of us were working for the americans by this stage naturally it suits them now to turn a blind eye to the pasts of our org members but what about tomorrow politicians have a habit of changing policy right now were friends in the fight against communism but will the same hold true in five or ten years time so albers came up with a new scheme he created old documentation for our more senior personnel in their new identities himself included we were all of us given smaller less culpable roles in the ss and abwehr than were possessed by our real selves as alfred nolde i was a sergeant in the ss personnel section my file contains all my personal details even dental records i led a quiet fairly blameless kind of war its true i was a nazi but never a warcriminal that was somebody else the fact that i happen to resemble someone called arthur nebe is neither here nor there security at the centre is tight however its impossible to take files out but it is comparatively easy to take files in nobody is searched when they go into the centre only when they leave this was lindens job once a month becker would deliver new files forged by albers to berlin and linden would file them in the archive naturally this was before we found out about beckers russian friends why were the forgeries done here and not in berlin i asked that way you could have cut out the need for a courier because albers refused to go anywhere near berlin he liked it here in vienna not least because austria is the first step on the ratline its easy to get across the border into italy and then the middle east south america there were lots of us who came south like birds in winter eh so what went wrong linden got greedy thats what went wrong he knew the material he was getting was forged but he couldnt understand what it amounted to at first i think it was mere curiosity he started photographing the stuff we were giving him and then he enlisted the help of a couple of jewish lawyers nazihunters to try and establish the nature of the new files who these men were the drexlers they were working with the joint army group on war crimes probably the drexlers had no idea that lindens motives for seeking their help were purely personal and for profit and why should they have done his credentials were unquestionable anyway i think they noted something about all these new ss personnel and party records that we kept the same initials as our old identities its an old trick with building a new legend makes you feel more comfortable with your new name something as instinctive as initialling a contract becomes safe i think drexler must have compared these new names with the names of comrades who were missing or presumed dead and suggested that linden might like to compare the details of a file held on alfred nolde with the file on arthur nebe heinrich müller with heinrich moltke max abs with martin albers etc so thats why you had the drexlers killed exactly that was after linden turned up here in vienna looking for more money money to keep his mouth shut it was müller who met him and who killed him we knew that linden had already made contact with becker for the very simple reason that linden told us so we decided to kill two flies with one swat first we left several cases of cigarettes around the warehouse where linden was killed in order to incriminate becker then könig went to see becker and told him that linden was missing the idea was that becker would start going round asking questions about linden looking for him at his hotel and generally getting himself noticed at the same time könig switched müllers gun for beckers then we informed the police that becker had shot and killed linden it was an unlookedfor bonus that becker already knew where lindens body was and that he should return to the scene of the crime with the aim of taking away the cigarettes of course the amis were waiting for him and caught him redhanded the case was watertight all the same if the amis had been even half efficient they would have discovered the link between becker and linden in berlin but i dont think they even bothered to take the investigation outside of vienna theyre happy with what theyve got or at least we thought they were until now with what linden knew why didnt he take the precaution of leaving a letter with someone informing the police of what had happened in the event of his death oh but he did said nebe only the particular lawyer he chose in berlin was also a member of the org on lindens death he read the letter and passed it across to the head of the berlin section nebe stared levelly at me and nodded seriously thats it bernie thats what müller wants to find out if you know or not well now that you do know you can tell him and save yourself from being tortured naturally i would prefer it if this conversation remained a secret as long as i live arthur you can depend on it and thanks i felt my voice crack a little i appreciate it nebe nodded in acknowledgement and stared around him uncomfortably then his gaze fell upon the uneaten slice of strudel you werent hungry ive not got much of an appetite i said one or two things on my mind i guess give it to rainis i lit a third cigarette was i wrong or had he really licked his lips that would have been too much to hope for but it was surely worth a try or help yourself if youre feeling hungry nebe really did lick his lips now may i he asked politely i nodded negligently well if youre sure he said picking the plate up off the tray on the floor my housekeeper made it she used to work for demel the best strudel you ever tasted in your life it would be a pity to waste it eh he took a big bite i never had much of a sweet tooth myself i lied thats nothing short of tragic in vienna bernie you are in the greatest city in the world for cake you should have come here before the war gerstners lehmanns heiners aida haag slukas bredendicks pastrycooks like you never tasted before he took another large mouthful to come to vienna without a sweet tooth why thats like a blind man taking a trip on the big wheel in the prater you dont know what youre missing why dont you try a little i shook my head firmly my heart was beating so quickly that i thought he must hear it suppose he didnt finish it i really couldnt eat anything nebe shook his head pityingly and bit once more the teeth could not be real i thought surveying their white evenness nebes own teeth had been much more stained anyway i said nonchalantly im supposed to be watching my weight ive put on several kilos since coming to vienna me too he said you know you should really he never finished the sentence he coughed and choked all in one jerk of his head stiffening suddenly he made a dreadful blowing noise through his lips as if he had been trying to play a tuba and fragments of halfchewed cake rolled out of his mouth the plate of strudel clattered on to the floor followed by nebe himself scrabbling on top of him i tried to wrestle the automatic from his grasp before he could fire it and bring müller and his thugs down on my head to my horror i saw that the gun was cocked and in the same half second nebes dying finger pulled the trigger but the hammer clicked harmlessly the safety was still on nebes legs jerked feebly one eyelid flickered shut while the other stayed perversely open his last breath was a long mucoid gurgle smelling strongly of almonds finally he lay still his face already turning a blueish colour disgusted i spat the lethal pill out of my own mouth i had little sympathy for him in a few hours he might have watched the same thing happening to me i prised the gun free from nebes dead hand which was now greyskinned with cyanosis and having unsuccessfully searched his pockets for the key to my handcuffs i stood up my head shoulder rib even my penis it seemed were hurting terribly but i felt a lot better for the grip of the walther p in my hand the kind of gun that had killed linden i thumbcocked the hammer for semiautomatic operation as nebe himself had done before coming into my cell slipped off the safety as he had forgotten to do and stepped carefully out of the cell i walked to the end of the damp passageway and climbed the stairs to the pressing and fermentation room where veronika had died there was only one light near the front door and i went towards it hardly daring to glance at the wine press if i had seen him i would have ordered müller into the machine and squeezed him out of his bavarian skin in another body i might have risked the guards and gone up to the house where possibly i could have tried to arrest him probably i would just have shot him it had been that kind of day now it would be as much as i could do to escape with my life switching out the light i opened the front door without a jacket i shivered the night was a cold one i crept along to the line of trees where the latvian had tried to execute me and hid in some bushes the vineyard was bright with the lights of the rapid burners several men were busy pushing the tall trolleys which carried the burners up and down the furrows to positions which they apparently judged important from where i sat their long flames looked like giant fireflies moving slowly through the air it seemed as if i would have to choose another route to escape from nebes estate i returned to the house and moved stealthily along the wall past the kitchen towards the front garden none of the groundfloor lights were on but one at an upperfloor window lay reflected on the lawn like a big square swimmingpool i halted by the corner and sniffed the air someone was standing in the porch smoking a cigarette after what seemed like forever i heard the mans footsteps on the gravel and glancing quickly round the corner i saw the unmistakable figure of rainis lumbering down the path towards the open gates where a large grey bmw was parked facing the road i walked on to the front lawn staying out of the light from the house and followed him until he got to the car he opened the car boot and started to rummage around as if looking for something by the time he closed it again i had put less than five metres between us he turned and froze as he saw the walther levelled at his misshapen head put those car keys in the ignition i said softly the latvians face turned even uglier at the prospect of my escaping how did you get out he sneered there was a key hidden in the strudel i said and jerked the gun at the car keys in his hand the car keys i repeated do it slowly he stepped back and opened the drivers door then he bent inside and i heard the rattle of keys as he slipped them into the ignition straightening again he rested his foot almost carelessly on the runningboard and leaning on the roof of the car smiled a grin that was the shape and colour of a rusting tap want me to wash it before you go not this time frankenstein what i would like you to do is give me the keys for these i showed him my stillmanacled wrists keys for what keys for handcuffs he shrugged and kept on grinning i got no keys for no handcuffs dont believe me you search me you find out hearing him speak i almost winced latvian and soft in the head he may have been but rainis had no idea of german grammar he probably thought a conjunction was a gypsy dealing three cards on a streetcorner sure youve got keys rainis it was you who cuffed me remember i saw you put them in your vest pocket he stayed silent i was beginning to want to kill him badly look you stupid latvian asshole if i say jump again youd better not look down for a skippingrope this is a gun not a fucking hairbrush i stepped forward a pace and snarled through clenched teeth now find them or ill fit your ugly face with the kind of hole that doesnt need a key rainis made a little show of patting his pockets and then produced a small silver key from his waistcoat he held it up like a minnow drop it on the drivers seat and step away from the car now that he was closer to me rainis could see by the expression on my face that i had a lot of hate in my mind this time he didnt hesitate to obey and tossed the little key on to the seat but if i had thought him stupid or suddenly obedient i made a mistake it was fatigue probably he nodded down at one of the wheels youd better let me fix that slack tyre he said i glanced downwards and then quickly up again as the latvian sprintstarted towards me his big hands reaching for my neck like a savage tiger a half second later i pulled the trigger the walther fed and cycled another round into the firing chamber in less time than it took for me to blink i fired again the shots echoed across the garden and up the sky as if the twin sounds had been bearing the latvians soul to final judgement i didnt doubt that it would be heading earthwards and below ground fairly quickly again his big body crashed face first on to the gravel and lay still i ran to the car and jumped into the seat ignoring the handcuff key underneath my backside there was no time to do anything but start the car i turned the key in the ignition and the big car new by the smell of it roared into life behind me i heard shouts collecting the gun off my lap i leaned out and fired a couple of rounds back at the house then i threw it on the passenger seat beside me rammed the gear stick forward hauled the door shut and stamped on the accelerator the rear tyres gouged at the driveway as the bmw skidded forward for the moment it didnt matter that my hands were still manacled the road ahead lay straight and down a hill but the car veered dangerously from side to side as i released the steering for a brief second and wrestled the gear into second my hands back on the wheel i swerved to avoid a parked car and almost put the bmw into the side of a fence if i could only get to stifstkaserne and roy shields i would tell him all about veronikas murder if the amis were quick they could at least get them for that explanations about müller and the org could come later when the mps had müller in the cage there would be no limit to the embarrassment i was going to cause belinsky crowcass cic the whole rotten bunch of them i looked in the wing mirror and saw the headlights of a car i wasnt sure if it was chasing me or not but i pushed the already screaming engine even further and almost immediately braked pushing the wheel up hard to the right the car hit the kerb and bounced back on to the road my foot touched the floor again the engine complaining loudly against the lower gear but i couldnt risk changing into third now that there were more bends in the road to negotiate at the junction of billrothstrasse and the gürtel i almost had to lean over in order to steer the car sharp right past a van hosing down the street i didnt see the roadblock until it was too late and but for the truck parked behind the makeshift barrier that had been erected i dont suppose i would have bothered to try and swerve or stop as it was i turned hard left and lost the back wheels on the water on the road for a moment i had a camera obscuras eye view as the bmw spun out of control the barrier the us military policemen waving their arms or chasing after me the road i had just driven down the car that had been following me a row of shops a plate glass window the car danced sideways on two wheels like a mechanical charlie chaplin and then there was a cataract of glass as i crashed into one of the shops i rolled helplessly across the passenger seat and hit the door as something solid came through the other side i felt something sharp underneath my elbow then my head hit the frame and i must have blacked out it could only have been for a few seconds one moment there was noise movement pain and chaos and the next there was just quiet with only the sound of a wheel spinning slowly to tell me that i was still alive mercifully the car had stalled so my first worry which was of the car catching fire was allayed hearing footsteps on shards of glass and american voices announcing that they were coming to get me i shouted my encouragement but to my surprise it came out as little more than a whisper and when i tried to raise my arm to reach for the door handle i lost consciousness again well how are we feeling today roy shields leaned forward on the chair beside my bed and tapped the plaster cast on my arm a wire and pulley kept it high in the air that must be pretty handy he said a permanent nazi salute shit you germans can even make a broken arm look patriotic i took a short look around it appeared to be a fairly normal hospital ward but for the bars on the windows and the tattoos on the nurses forearms what kind of hospital is this youre in the military hospital at the stiftskaserne he said for your protection how long have i been here almost three weeks you had quite a bump on your square head fractured your skull busted collarbone broken arm broken ribs youve been delirious since you came in yes well blame it on the föhn i guess shields chuckled and then his face grew more sombre better hold on to that sense of humour he said ive got some bad news for you i riffled through the card index inside my head most of the cards had been thrown on the floor but the ones i picked up first seemed somehow especially relevant something i had been working on a name emil becker i said recalling a manic face he was hanged the day before yesterday shields shrugged apologetically im sorry really i am well you certainly didnt waste any time i remarked is that good old american efficiency or has one of your people cornered the market in rope i wouldnt lose any sleep about it gunther whether he murdered linden or not becker earned that collar that doesnt sound like a very good advert for american justice come on you know it was an austrian court that dropped his cueball you handed them the stick and the chalk didnt you shields looked away for a moment and then rubbed his face with irritation aw what the hell youre a cop you know how it is these things happen with any system just because your shoes pick up a bit of shit doesnt mean you have to buy a new pair sure but you learn to stay on the path instead of taking shortcuts across the field wise guy i dont even know why were having this conversation youve still not given me a shred of evidence why i should accept that becker didnt kill linden so you can order a retrial a file is never quite complete he said with a shrug a case is never really closed even when all the participants are dead i still have one or two loose ends im all cut up about your loose ends shields perhaps you should be herr gunther his tone was stiffer now perhaps i ought to remind you that this is a military hospital and under american jurisdiction and if you remember i once had occasion to warn you about meddling in this case now that youve done exactly that id say youve still got some explaining to do possession of a firearm by a german or austrian national well thats contrary to the austrian military governments public safety manual for a start you could get five years for that alone then theres the car you were driving quite apart from the fact that you were wearing handcuffs and that you dont appear to be in possession of a valid driving licence theres the small matter of driving through a military checkpoint he paused and lit a cigarette so whats it to be information or incarceration neatly put im a neat kind of fellow all policemen are come on lets have it i sank back on my pillow resignedly im warning you shields youre likely to have as many loose ends as you started with i doubt if i could prove half of what i could tell you the american folded his brawny arms and leaned back on his chair proof is for the courtroom my friend im a detective remember this is for my own private casebook i told him nearly everything when i had finished his face adopted a lugubrious expression and he nodded sagely well i can certainly suck a bit of that thats good i sighed but my tits are getting a little sore right now babe if youve got questions how about you save them till next time id like to take a little nap shields stood up ill be back tomorrow but just one question for now this guy from crowcass belinsky belinsky yeah how come that he quit the game before the period was up your guess is as good as mine better maybe he shrugged ill ask around our relations with the intelligence boys have improved since this berlin thing the american military governor has told them and us that we need to present a united front in case the soviets try the same thing here what berlin thing i said in case they try what here shields frowned you dont know about that no of course you wouldnt would you look my wife is in berlin hadnt you better tell me whats happened he sat down again only on the edge of the chair which added to his obvious discomfort the soviets have imposed a complete military blockade on berlin he said theyre not letting anything in or out of the zone so were supplying the city by plane happened the day your friend got his own personal airlift june he smiled thinly its kind of tense up there from what i hear lots of folk think that theres going to be one almighty great showdown between us and the russkies me i wouldnt be at all surprised we should have kicked their asses a long time ago but were not about to abandon berlin you can depend on it provided everybody keeps their heads we should get through it all right shields lit a cigarette and put it between my lips im sorry about your wife he said you been married long seven years i said what about you are you married he shook his head i guess i never met the right girl do you mind me asking has it worked out all right for you both you being a detective and all i thought for a minute yes i said its worked out just fine mine was the only occupied bed in the hospital that night a barge slipping down the canal woke me with its bovinesounding horn and then abandoned me to stare sleeplessly at the dark as the echo of it fled into eternity like the bray of the last trump staring into the void of the pitchblack darkness my whispered breathing serving only to remind me of my own mortality it seemed that seeing nothing i could see beyond to what was most tangible death itself a lean motheaten figure shrouded in heavy black velvet ever ready to press the silent chloroformed pad over the victims nose and mouth and to carry him to a waiting black sedan to some dreadful zone and dp camp where darkness never ends and whence no one ever escapes as light returned to press against the window bars so too did courage although i knew that deaths ivans held no high regard for those who met them without fear whether a man is ready to die or not his requiem always sounds the same it was several days before shields returned to the hospital this time he was accompanied by two other men who from their haircuts and wellfed faces i took to be americans like shields they wore loudly cut suits but their faces were older and wiser bing crosby types with briefcases pipes and emotions restricted to their supercilious eyebrows lawyers or investigators or corps shields handled the introductions this is major breen he said indicating the older of the two men and this is major medlinskas investigators then but for which organization what are you i said the medical students shields grinned uncertainly theyd like to ask you a few questions ill help with the translating tell them im feeling a lot better and thank them for the grapes and perhaps one of them could fetch me the pot shields ignored me they drew up three chairs and sat down like a team of judges at a dog show with shields nearest to me briefcases were opened and notepads produced maybe i should have my twister here is that really necessary said shields you tell me only i look at these two and i dont think theyre a couple of american tourists who want to know the best places in vienna to nudge a pretty girl shields translated my concern to the other two the older of whom grunted and said something about criminals the major says that this is not a criminal matter reported shields but if you want a lawyer one will be fetched if this is not a criminal matter then how come im in a military hospital you were wearing handcuffs when they picked you out of that car sighed shields there was a pistol on the floor and a machinegun in the trunk they werent about to take you to the maternity hospital all the same i dont like it dont think that this bandage on my head gives you the right to treat me like an idiot who are these people anyway they look like spies to me i can recognize the type i can smell the invisible ink on their fingers tell them that tell them that people from cic and crowcass give me an acid stomach on account of the fact that i trusted one of their people before and got my fingers clipped tell them that i wouldnt be lying here now if it wasnt for an american agent called belinsky thats what they want to talk to you about yeah well maybe if they were to put away those notebooks id feel a little easier they seemed to understand this they shrugged simultaneously and returned the notebooks to the briefcases one more thing i said im an experienced interrogator myself remember that if i start to get the impression that im being rinsed and stacked for criminal charges then the interview will be over the older man breen shifted in his chair and clasped his hands across his knee it didnt make him look any cuter when he spoke his german wasnt as bad as i had imagined it would be i dont see any objections to that he said quietly and then it began the major asked most of the questions while the younger man nodded and occasionally interrupted in his bad german to ask me to clarify a remark for the best part of two hours i answered or parried their questions only refusing to reply directly on a couple of occasions when it seemed to me that they had stepped across the line of our agreement gradually however i perceived that most of their interest in me lay in the fact that neither the th cic in germany nor the th cic in austria knew anything about a john belinsky nor indeed was there a john belinsky attached however tenuously to the central registry of war crimes and security suspects of the united states army the military police had no one by that name nor the army there was however a john belinsky in the air force but he was nearly fifty and the navy had three john belinskys all of whom were at sea which was just how i felt along the way the two americans sermonized about the importance of keeping my mouth shut with regard to what i had learned about the org and its relation to the cic nothing could have suited me more and i counted this as a strong hint that as soon as i was well again i would be permitted to leave but my relief was tempered by a great deal of curiosity as to who john belinsky had really been and what he had hoped to achieve neither of my interrogators gave me the benefit of their opinions but naturally i had my own ideas several times in the following weeks shields and the two americans came to the hospital to continue with their inquiry they were always scrupulously polite almost comically so and the questions were always about belinsky what had he looked like which part of new york had he said that he came from could i remember the number of his car i told them everything i could remember about him they checked his room at sachers and found nothing he had cleared out on the very day that he was supposed to have come to grinzing with the cavalry they staked out a couple of the bars he had said he favoured i think they even asked the russians about him when they tried to speak to the georgian officer in the ip captain rustaveli who had arrested lotte hartmann and me on belinskys instructions it transpired that he had been suddenly recalled to moscow of course it was all too late the cat had already fallen into the stream and what was now clear was that belinsky had been working for the russians all along no wonder he had played up the rivalry between the cic and the military police i said to my new american friends of truth i thought myself a very clever sort of coat to have spotted that as early on as i had by now he had presumably told his mvd boss all about americas recruitment of heinrich müller and arthur nebe but there were several subjects about which i remained silent colonel poroshin was one i didnt like to think what might have happened had they discovered that a senior officer in the mvd had arranged my coming to vienna their curiosity about my travel documents and cigarette permit was quite uncomfortable enough i told them that i had had to pay a great deal of money to bribe a russian officer and they seemed satisfied with that explanation privately i wondered if my meeting with belinsky had always been part of poroshins plan and the circumstances of our deciding to work together was it possible that belinsky had shot those two russian deserters as a demonstration for my benefit as a way of impressing upon me his ruthless dislike for all things soviet there was another thing about which i kept resolutely silent and that was arthur nebes explanation of how the org had sabotaged the us documents centre in berlin with the help of captain linden that i decided was their problem i did not think i cared to help a government that was prepared to hang nazis on mondays tuesdays and wednesdays and to recruit them for its own security services on thursdays fridays and saturdays heinrich müller had at least got that part right as for müller himself major breen and captain medlinskas were adamant that i must have been mistaken about him the former gestapo chief was long dead they assured me belinsky they insisted for reasons best known to himself had almost certainly shown me someone elses picture the military police had made a very careful search of nebes wine estate in grinzing and discovered only that the owner one alfred nolde was abroad on business no bodies were found nor any evidence that anyone had been killed and while it was true that there existed an organization of former german servicemen which was working alongside the united states to prevent the further spread of international communism it was they insisted quite inconceivable that this organization could have included fugitive nazi warcriminals i listened impassively to all this nonsense too exhausted by the whole business to care much what they believed or for that matter what they wanted me to believe suppressing my first reaction in the face of their indifference to the truth which was to tell them to go to hell i merely nodded politely my manners verging on the truly viennese agreeing with them seemed to be the best possible way of expediting my freedom shields was less complaisant however his help with translation grew more surly and uncooperative as the days went by and it became obvious that he was unhappy with the way in which the two officers appeared to be more concerned to conceal rather than to reveal the implications of what i had first told him and certainly he had believed much to shieldss annoyance breen pronounced himself content that the case of captain linden had been brought to a satisfactory conclusion shieldss only satisfaction might have come from the knowledge that the th military police still smarting as a result of the scandal involving russians posing as american mps now had something to throw back at the th cic a russian spy posing as a member of the cic with the proper identity card staying at a hotel requisitioned by the military driving a vehicle registered to an american officer and generally coming and going as he pleased through areas restricted to american personnel i knew that this would only have been a small consolation for a man like roy shields a policeman with a common enough fetish for neatness it was easy for me to sympathize id often encountered that same feeling myself for the last two interrogations shields was replaced by another man an austrian and i never saw him again neither breen nor medlinskas told me when at last they had concluded their inquiry nor did they give me any indication that they were satisfied with my answers they just left the matter hanging but such are the ways of people in the security services over the next two or three weeks i made a full recovery from my injuries i was both amused and shocked to learn from the prison doctor however that on my first being admitted to the hospital after my accident i had been suffering from gonorrhoea in the first place youre damned lucky that they brought you here he said where we have penicillin if theyd taken you anywhere but an american military hospital theyd have used salvarsan and that stuff burns like lucifers spitball and in the second youre lucky it was just drip and not russian syphilis these local whores are full of it havent any of you jerries ever heard of french letters you mean parisians sure we have but we dont wear them we give them to the nazi fifth column who prick holes in them and sell them to gis to make them sick when they screw our women the doctor laughed but i could tell that in a remote part of his soul he believed me this was just one of many similar incidents i encountered during my recovery as my english slowly improved enabling me to talk with the two americans who were the prison hospitals nurses for as we laughed and joked it always seemed to me that there was something strange in their eyes but which i was never able to identify and then a few days before i was discharged it came to me in a sickening realization because i was a german these americans were actually chilled by me it was as if when they looked at me they ran newsreel film of belsen and buchenwald inside their heads and what was in their eyes was a question how could you have allowed it to happen how could you have let that sort of thing go on perhaps for several generations at least when other nations look us in the eye it will always be with this same unspoken question in their hearts it was a pleasant september morning when wearing an illfitting suit lent to me by the nurses at the military hospital i returned to my pension in skodagasse the owner frau blumweiss greeted me warmly informed me that my luggage was stored safely in her basement handed me a note which had arrived not half an hour before and asked me if i would care to have some breakfast i told her i would and having thanked her for looking after my belongings inquired if i owed any money dr liebl settled everything herr gunther she said but if you would like to take your old rooms again that will be all right they are vacant since i had no idea when i might be able to return to berlin i said i would did dr liebl leave me any message i asked already knowing the answer he had made no attempt to contact me during my stay in the military hospital no she said no message then she showed me back to my old rooms and had her son bring my luggage up to me i thanked her again and said that i would breakfast just as soon as i had changed into my own clothes everythings there she said as her son heaved my bags on to the luggage stand i had a receipt for the few things that the police took away papers that kind of thing then she smiled sweetly wished me another pleasant stay and closed the door behind her typically viennese she showed no desire to know what had befallen me since last i had stayed in her house as soon as she had left the room i opened my bags and found almost to my astonishment and much to my relief that i was still in possession of my in cash and my several cartons of cigarettes i lay on the bed and smoked a memphis with something approaching delight i opened the note while i ate my breakfast there was only one short sentence and that was written in cyrillic meet me at the kaisergruft at eleven oclock this morning the note was unsigned but then it hardly needed to be when frau blumweiss returned to my table to clear away the breakfast things i asked her who had delivered it it was just a schoolboy herr gunther she said collecting the crockery on a tray an ordinary schoolboy i have to meet someone i explained at the kaisergruft where is that the imperial crypt she wiped a hand on a wellstarched pinafore as if she had been about to meet the kaiser himself and then crossed herself mention of royalty always seemed to make the viennese doubly respectful why its at the church of the capuchins on the west side of neuer markt but go early herr gunther its only open in the morning from ten to twelve im sure youll find it very interesting i smiled and nodded gratefully there was no doubting that i was likely to find it very interesting indeed neuer markt hardly looked like a market square at all a number of tables had been laid out like a café terrace there were customers who werent drinking coffee waiters who did not seem inclined to serve them and little sign of any café from where coffee might have been obtained it seemed quite makeshift even by the easy standards of a reconstructed vienna there were also a few people just watching almost as if a crime had occurred and everyone was waiting for the police but i paid it little regard and hearing the eleven oclock chimes of the nearby clock tower hurried on to the church it was as well for whichever zoologist who had named the famous monkey that the capuchin monks style of habit was rather more remarkable than their plainish church in vienna compared with most other places of worship in that city the kapuzinerkirche looked as if they must have been flirting with calvinism at the time that it was built either that or the orders treasurer had run off with the money for the stonemasons there wasnt one carving on it the church was sufficiently ordinary for me to walk past the place without even recognizing it i might have done so again but for a group of american soldiers who were hanging around in a doorway and from whom i overheard a reference to the stiffs my new acquaintance with english as it was spoken by the nurses at the military hospital told me that this group was intent on visiting the same place as i was i paid a schilling entrance to a grumpy old monk and entered a long airy corridor that i took to be a part of the monastery a narrow stairwell led down into the vault it was in fact not one vault but eight interconnecting vaults and much less gloomy than i had expected the interior was simple being in plain white with the walls faced partly in marble and contrasted strongly with the opulence of its contents here were the remains of over a hundred habsburgs and their famous jaws although the guidebook which i had thought to bring with me said that their hearts were pickled in urns located underneath st stephens cathedral it was as much evidence for royal mortality as you could have found anywhere north of cairo nobody it seemed was missing except the archduke ferdinand who was buried at graz no doubt piqued at the rest of them for having insisted that he visit sarajevo the cheaper end of the family from tuscany were stacked in simple lead coffins one on top of the other like bottles in a winerack at the far end of the longest vault i half expected to see an old man prising a couple of them open to try out a new mallet and set of stakes naturally enough the habsburgs with the biggest egos rated the grandest sarcophagi these huge morbidly ornamented copper caskets seemed to lack nothing but caterpillar tracks and gun turrets for them to have captured stalingrad only the emperor joseph ii had shown anything like restraint in his choice of box and only a viennese guidebook could have described the copper casket as excessively simple i found colonel poroshin in the franz joseph vault he smiled warmly when he saw me and clapped me on the shoulder you see i was right you can read cyrillic after all maybe you can read my mind as well for sure he said you are wondering what we could possibly have to say to each other given all that has happened least of all in this place you are thinking that in a different place you might try to kill me you should be on the stage palkovnik you could be another professor schaffer you are mistaken i think professor schaffer is a hypnotist not a mindreader he slapped his gloves on his open palm with the air of one who had scored a point i am not a hypnotist herr gunther dont underestimate yourself you managed to make me believe that i was a private investigator and that i should come here to vienna to try and clear emil becker of murder a hypnotic fantasy if ever i heard one a powerful suggestion perhaps said poroshin but you were acting under your own free will he sighed a pity about poor emil youre wrong if you think that i didnt hope you could prove him innocent but to borrow a chess term it was my vienna gambit it has a peaceable first appearance but the sequel is full of subtleties and aggressive possibilities all that one requires is a strong and valiant knight that was me i suppose tochno exactly and now the game is won do you mind explaining how poroshin pointed to the casket on the right of the more elevated one containing the emperor franz joseph the crown prince rudolf he said he committed suicide in the famous hunting lodge at mayerling the general story is wellknown but the details and the motives remain unclear just about the only thing we can be certain of is that he lies in this very tomb for me to know this for sure is enough but not everyone whom we believe to have committed suicide is really quite as dead as poor rudolf take heinrich müller to prove him still alive now that was something worthwhile the game was won when we knew that for sure but i lied about that i said insouciantly i never saw müller the only reason i signalled to belinsky was because i wanted him and his men to come and help me save veronika zartl the chocolady from the oriental yes i admit that belinskys arrangements with you were less than perfect in their concept but as it happens i know that you are lying now you see belinsky really was at grinzing with a team of agents they were not of course americans but my own men every vehicle leaving the yellow house in grinzing was followed including i may say your own when müller and his friends discovered your escape they were so panicstricken that they fled almost immediately we simply tailed them at a discreet distance until they thought that they were safe again since then we have been able to positively identify herr müller for ourselves so you see you did not lie but why didnt you just arrest him what good is he to you if hes left at liberty poroshin made his face look shrewd in my business it is not necessarily politic always to arrest a man who is my enemy sometimes he can be many times more valuable if he is allowed to remain at large from as early as the beginning of the war müller was a double agent towards the end of he was naturally anxious to disappear from berlin altogether and come to moscow well can you imagine it herr gunther the head of the fascist gestapo living and working in the capital of democratic socialism if the british or american intelligence agencies were to have discovered such a thing they would undoubtedly have leaked this information to the worlds press at some politically opportune moment then they would have sat back and watched us squirm with embarrassment so it was decided that müller could not come the only problem was that he knew so much about us not to mention the whereabouts of dozens of gestapo and abwehr spies throughout the soviet union and eastern europe he had first to be neutralized before we could turn him away from our door so we tricked him into giving us the names of all these agents and at the same time started to feed him with new information which while of no help to the german wareffort might prove of considerable interest to the americans it goes without saying that this information was also false anyway all this time we continued to put off müllers defection telling him to wait just a little longer and that he had nothing to worry about but when we were ready we allowed him to discover that for various political reasons his defection could not be sanctioned we hoped that this would now persuade him to offer his services to the americans as others had done general gehlen for example baron von bolschwing even himmler although he was simply too well known for the british to accept his offer and too crazy yes perhaps we miscalculated perhaps müller left it too late and was unable to escape the eye of martin bormann and the ss who guarded the führerbunker who knows anyway müller apparently committed suicide this he faked but it was quite a while before we could prove this to our own satisfaction müller is a very clever man when we learned about the org we thought that it wouldnt be long before müller turned up again but he stayed persistently in the shadows there was the occasional unconfirmed sighting but nothing for certain and then when captain linden was shot we noticed from the reports that the serial number of the murder weapon was one which had been originally issued to müller but this part you already know i think i nodded belinsky told me a most resourceful man the family is siberian you know they returned to russia after the revolution when belinsky was still a boy but by then he was allamerican as they say the whole family were soon working for nkvd it was belinskys idea to pose as a crowcass agent not only do crowcass and cic often work at cross purposes but crowcass is often staffed with cic personnel and it is quite common for the american military police to be left in ignorance of cic crowcass operations the americans are even more byzantine in their organizational structures than we are ourselves belinsky was plausible to you but he was also plausible as an idea to müller enough to scare him out into the open when you told him that a crowcass agent was on his trail but not enough to scare him as far as south america where he could be of no use to us after all there are others in cic less fastidious about employing warcriminals than the people in crowcass whose protection müller could seek out and so it has proved even as we speak müller is exactly where we want him with his american friends in pullach being useful to them giving them the benefit of his massive knowledge of soviet intelligence structures and secret police methods boasting about the network of loyal agents he still believes are in place this was the first stage of our plan to disinform the americans very clever i said with genuine admiration and the second poroshins face adopted a more philosophical expression when the time is right it is we who shall leak some information to the worlds press that gestapo müller is a tool of american intelligence it is we who will sit back and watch them squirm with embarrassment it may be in ten years time or even twenty but provided müller stays alive it will happen suppose the worlds press dont believe you the proof will not be so hard to obtain the americans are great ones for keeping files and records look at that documents centre of theirs and we have other agents provided that they know where and what to look for it will not be too difficult to find the evidence you seem to have thought of everything more than you will ever know and now that i have answered your question i have one for you herr gunther will you answer it please i cant imagine what i can tell you palkovnik youre the player not me im just a knight in your vienna gambit remember nevertheless there is something i shrugged fire away yes he said to return to the chess board for a moment one expects to make sacrifices becker for example and you of course but sometimes one encounters the unexpected loss of material your queen he frowned for a moment if you like belinsky told me that it was you who killed traudl braunsteiner but he was a very determined man in this whole affair the fact that i had a personal interest in traudl was of no special account to him i know this to be true he would have killed her without a second thought but you i had one of my people in berlin check you out at the us documents centre you told the truth you were never a party member and the rest of it is there too how you asked for a transfer out of the ss that could have got you shot so a sentimental fool maybe but a killer i will tell you straight herr gunther my intellect says that you did not kill her but i must know it here too he slapped his stomach perhaps here most of all he fixed me with his pale blue eyes but i did not flinch or look away did you kill her no did you run her down belinsky had a car not me say that you had no part in her murder i was going to warn her poroshin nodded da he said dagavareelees thats agreed you are speaking the truth slava bogu thank god you are right to thank him he slapped his stomach once again if i had not felt it i would have had to kill you as well as well i frowned who else was dead belinsky yes most unfortunate it was smoking that infernal pipe of his such a dangerous habit smoking you should give it up how its an old cheka way a small quantity of tetryl in the mouthpiece attached to a fuse which leads to a point below the bowl when the pipe is lit so is the fuse quite simple but also quite deadly it blew his head off poroshins tone was almost indifferent you see my mind told me that it was not you who killed her i merely wanted to be sure that i would not have to kill you as well and now you are sure for sure he said not only will you walk out of here alive you would have killed me down here it is a suitable enough place dont you think oh yes very poetic what were you going to do bite my neck or had you wired one of the caskets there are many poisons herr gunther he held out a small flickknife in his palm tetrodotoxin on the blade even the smallest scratch and byebye he pocketed the knife in his tunic and gave a sheepish little shrug i was about to say that not only may you now walk out of here alive but that if you go to the café mozart now you will find someone waiting there for you my look of puzzlement seemed to amuse him can you not guess he said delightedly my wife you got her out of berlin kanyeshnct of course i dont know how else she would have got out berlin is surrounded by our tanks kirsten is waiting at the mozart café now he looked at his watch and nodded for fifteen minutes already he said youd best not keep her waiting much longer an attractive woman like that on her own in a city like vienna one must be so careful nowadays these are difficult times youre full of surprises colonel i told him five minutes ago you were ready to kill me on nothing more tangible than your indigestion and now youre telling me that youve brought my wife from berlin why are you helping me like this ya nye paneemayoo i dont understand let us just say that it was part of the whole futile romance of communism vot i vsyo thats all he clicked his heels like a good prussian goodbye herr gunther who knows after this berlin thing we may meet again i hope not that is too bad a man of your talents then he turned and strode off i left the imperial crypt with as much spring in my step as lazarus outside on neuer markt there were still more people watching the strange little caféterrace that had no café then i saw the camera and the lights and at the same time i spotted willy reichmann the little redhaired production manager from sievering film studios he was speaking english to another man who was holding a megaphone this was surely the english film that willy had told me about the one for which viennas increasingly rare ruins had been a prerequisite the film in which lotte hartmann the girl who had given me a welldeserved dose of drip had been given a part i stopped to watch for a few moments wondering if i might catch sight of königs girlfriend but there was no sign of her i thought it unlikely that she would have left vienna with him and passed up her first screen role one of the onlookers around me said what on earth are they doing and another answered saying its supposed to be a café the mozart café laughter rippled through the crowd what here said another voice apparently they like the view better here replied a fourth its what they call poetic licence the man with the megaphone asked for quiet ordered the cameras to roll and then called for action two men one of them carrying a book as if it was some kind of religious icon shook hands and sat down at one of the tables leaving the crowd to watch what happened next i walked quickly south towards the real mozart café and the wife who was waiting there for me authors note in ian sayer and douglas hotting who were compiling a history of the american counterintelligence corps entitled americas secret army the untold story of the counterintelligence corps were asked by a us government investigative agency to verify a file consisting of documents signed by cic agents in berlin towards the end of in connection with the employment of heinrich müller as a cic advisor the file indicated that soviet agents had concluded that müller had not been killed in and that he was possibly being used by western intelligence agencies sayer and botting rejected the material as a forgery counterfeited by a skilful but rather confused person this view was corroborated by colonel e browning who was cic operations chief in frankfurt at the time the documents were supposed to have been produced browning indicated that the whole idea of something as sensitive as the employment of müller as a cic advisor was ludicrous regretfully wrote the two authors we have to conclude that the fate of the chief of the gestapo in the third reich remains shrouded in mystery and speculation as it has always been and probably always will be attempts by a leading british newspaper and an american news magazine to investigate the story in detail have so far come to nothing
