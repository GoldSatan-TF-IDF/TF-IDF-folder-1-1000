marion lennox a royal marriage of convenience a book in the by royal appointment series chapter one roseanitra we have a surprise for you rose sighed in her experience surprises from her inlaws were like surprises in a fairground ghosttrain surprise followed by green slimeor worse rose had spent the evening on a windswept scree delivering a calf which had taken one look at the outside world and elected to stay put it had taken her hours to persuade it to change its mind shed been up before dawn and she hadnt stopped since more than anything else in the whole world she wanted to go to bed there was also the issue of the letter the stiff formal communication had arrived registered mail in the midst of a bunch of condolence cards shed read it briefly then had stuffed it in her overall pocket to try and make sense of later shed like to think about it now but rose knew better than to try and deflect her inlaws so she perched on the edge of an overstuffed chair in their overheated sitting room she clasped her hands obediently and she braced herself its a wonderful surprise gladys said but for once she sounded a bit nervous youll be really pleased bob said and rose cast him an uncertain glance ever since her husband max had died two years ago rose suspected bob empathised with her a little but only a little not so much that hed stand up to his wife you know its the anniversary of maxs death today gladys said casting a quelling glance at her husband of course how could rose have forgotten yes she still grieved for the man shed loved but maybe it was a little over the top that her veterinary clinic had been filled with as many flowers today as it had been two years ago max had been a loved son of the village his memory would be kept alive for ever we waited until now to tell you gladys said because max asked us to wait he said we were to let you get the worst of your grieving over for you couldnt have coped with a child until now iwhat are you saying roses fingers clenched involuntarily into her palms of course she couldnt have coped with a child not when shed been fighting to earn her way though vet school not when she and max had been battling his illness and not now when she was struggling to earn enough for this tiny vet clinic to support them all but now its time gladys said and she smiled time rose managed for what its his sperm bob said and the elderly mans voice was eager its maxs sperm rose when he first got sick years and years ago he was naught but a lad but they told us that the treatment might make him infertile even then we thought whod inherit this life whod take this place forward who indeed but rose wasnt asking the question she was staring at them in dawning horror so we had it frozen gladys said and we wanted it to be a surprise its his twoyear anniversary present from max to you now you can have his babies five hundred miles away in london in the illustrious international law firm goodman stern and haddock another surprise was being played out nikolai de montez barristeratlaw was staring at the elderly man across his desk in stunned silence hed walked in five minutes before the scheduled appointment hed made a week earlier neatly dressed stooped with age and with hands that trembled the card hed handed over had said simply erhard fritz assistant to the crown my question is simple really erhard said without preamble if it meant you were to inherit a throne would you be prepared to marry as partner in this internationally renowned law firm nick was accustomed to listening to all sorts of outrageous proposals but this was one to take the breath away would i be prepared to marry he said now really carefully as if his words alone could make the situation explode may i askmarry who a woman called rose mccray you might know her as roseanitra de montez shes a veterinarian in yorkshire but it seems that she might also be first in line to the throne of alp de montez how could she walk away she couldnt but for the last two days rose had felt like she was walking in a nightmarethe nightmare that was the remains of her husbands life everywhere she went she was surrounded by memories she woke and max looked down on her from the framed photograph beside their wedding bed gladys had collapsed in hysterics when rose had wanted to give away his clothes so maxs shirts and trousers still hung in the closet maxs coats still hung in the entrance hall his boots still stood on the back porch ill not be forgetting our max she said fiercely when anyone challenged her roses grief over the death of her husband had been as deep as it had been sincere but now it was starting to overwhelm her she felt like she was living in a perpetual shrine to maxand now they wanted her to have maxs child the request had been playing over and over in her head for the last two daysalong with the contents of the letter she was so weary she was about to fall over but one truth was starting to emerge this couldnt go on max had been dead these two years if thered been the money she would have moved out to a place of her own but her income paid the upkeep on this place she couldnt leave unlessunless the proposal outlined in the letter was crazy but so was this situation the proposal was almost like a siren song alp de monteza country she loved she lifted the photograph that had come with the letter a picture of one nikolai de montez he was long lean and darkly handsome his mediterranean good looks were stunning he was about as different from max as it was possible to get she thought reading the letter for the tenth time and then putting it firmly away no it was stupid the letter was a lunacy a crazy escapeclause with no guarantees that she wouldnt be worse off this was maxs community she had to give it one last try no matter how trapped she was feeling if only theyd back off about the baby she walked into the sitting room determined to say what had to be said they were waiting for her bob was pouring her a sherry weve been thinking gladys said before she could say a word were so excited about the baby but you need to hurry theres enough sperm for you to have more than one and youre almost thirty if you dont have a boy first then we she caught herself youll want another rose weve made an appointment for you with the specialist in newcastle tomorrow and bobs arranged for a locum so you can go thats good rose said faintly but she didnt take the sherry gladys smiled her approval good girl i told bob no alcohol not if youre pregnant im not pregnant yet but you will be no rose said faintly and then more forcibly no if youll excuse me she took a deep breath its good that youve organised a locum i need to go to london for a couple of days ive received a letter a letter it came registered post to the surgery she said knowing full well that any post out of the ordinary that came via the private letterbox was likely to be steamed open you remember my family has royal connections yes gladys said stiffening in disapproval it seems someone came here to see me a week ago she said someone from alp de montez you told him i was away i gladys looked at bob and then she looked at the carpet he said he had a proposal for you she muttered defensive what would you be wanting with a proposal rose nodded two proposals in two weeks the one facing her here made the other one seem mild in comparison but what gladys had just said firmed things for her if she agreed to have a child a daughter would never be enough if she finally had maxs son then the child would be a living memorial to max what crazy reason was that to bring a child into the world it seems im needed she said thinking it through as she spoke i meanneeded by someone other than you by someone other than my dead husbands family and his community when i first read the letter i thought it was crazy but it seems as if its not crazy after all or no more crazy than this either way im going to find out im going to london to see if ive inherited a crown chapter two the restaurant nick had organised as a rendezvous was a good one it was oldfashioned full of oak wainscotting linen tablecloths and individual booths where people could talk without struggling to hear or worrying about being heard he walked in and walter the head waiter met him with the familiarity of an old acquaintance good evening mr de montez he looked at nicks casual chinos and cord jacket and he smiled well well holiday mode tonight then sir holiday yeah maybe this was his holiday nick hardly did holidays at all so he might as well term this one oh every now and then hed fly back to australia to see his foster mother ruby with whom he kept in touch and phoned every sunday without fail he skied now and then with a few important clients but mostly nick lived to work he was on holiday tonight because hed donned casual clothes thatd do him for while he was led over to the booth he generally used erhard was there already and nick appraised him more thoroughly as he rose to greet him the old man looked thin wiry and frail with a shock of white hair and white bushy eyebrows he was dressed in a deeply formal black suit im sorry i wasnt here when you arrived nick said and he looked ruefully down at his clothes regretting he hadnt opted for formal and im sorry for these you think roseanitra might be uncomfortable with formality erhard asked smiling i did he confessed some time in the last few days as erhard had talked him through the situation hed handed over a photograph of rose taken a month ago by a private investigator rose had been workingthe shot had her leaning against a battered fourwheeldrive vehicle talking to someone out of frame she was wearing dirty brown dungarees wellingtons and a liberal spray of mud she was pale faced with the odd freckle or six and the only colour about her was the deep glossy auburn of the braid hanging down her back she was a goodlooking woman in a country hick sort of way nick had conceded the women in his world were usually sophisticated chic there was no way this woman could be described in those terms but shed looked sort ofcute so when dressing tonight hed decided formal gear might make her uneasy you may be underestimating her erhard said shes a country vet yes a trained veterinarian still the hint of reproof my sources say shes a woman of considerable intelligence and then he paused for walter was escorting someone to their table roseanitra the woman in the dungarees nick could see the similarities but only just she was wearing a crimson halternecked dress buttoned at the front from the belowknee hemline to a lowcut cleavage the dress was cinched at the waist in a classic marilyn monroe style showing her hourglass figure to perfection her hair was twisted into a casual knot caught up with soft white ribands and tiny tendrils were escaping every which way she was wearing not much makeupjust enough to dust the freckles her lips were a soft rose which should have clashed with her dress but didnt she was wearing stilettos gorgeous red stilettos that made her legs look as if they went on for ever i believe i had it right erhard said softly to him and chuckled and moved forward to greet their guest mrs mccray rose she said and smiled and her smile lit up the room her pert nose wrinkled a little i think i remember you monsieur fritzyou were assistant to my uncle i was erhard said pleased please call me erhard thank you she said gravely its been almost fifteen years but i do remember she turned to nick and you must be nikolai monsieur de montez nick i dont think ive met you no walter was holding out her seat and rose was sitting which hid her legs which was almost a national tragedy nick decided what was she about disguising those legs in dungarees he surveyed her with unabashed pleasure as walter fussed about them taking orders offering champagne yes please rose said and beamed when the champagne arrived she put her nose right into the bubbles and closed her eyes as if it was her first drink for a very long time you like champagne then nick said fascinated and she sighed a blissful smile you have no idea and its not even sherry she had a couple more sips then laid her glass back on the table with obvious reluctance were very pleased you were able to come erhard said gently and looked at nick arent we nick yes said nick feeling winded im sorry it took a while to contact me rose told them glancing round the restaurant with real appreciation my family has an odd notion that i need protection you dont nick asked no she said and took another almost defiant sip of champagne absolutely not this is lovely it was nick thought she was maybe itd be best if i outline the situation erhard said smiling faintly at nick as if guessing his degree of confoundment rose im not sure how much you know not much at all she admitted only what you told me in the letter the whole village seems to have been playing keepings off from telling you i was away when you called to refusing to pass on phone messages if ben at the post office hadnt been a man of integrity i might never have heard from you at all why would they be worried about erhard nick asked puzzled my inlaws know im the daughter of minor royalty she said my husband used to delight in it but since hes died anything that might take me away from the village has been regarded with suspicion i gather erhard came looked dignified and spoke with an accent thatd be enough to make them worry my inlaws have a lot of influence and they dont like strangers im sorry its not your fault erhard said gently he hesitated at least youre here now which means that you may be prepared to listen it might sound preposterous you dont know what preposterous is she said enigmatically try me erhard nodded it seemed he was prepared to do the talking which left nick free to well just look im not sure how much you know already erhard said ive talked the situation through with nick this week and i did outline this in the letter but maybe i need to start at the beginning go ahead rose said sipping some more champagne and smiling it was an amazing smile stunning nick was stunned erhard cast him an amused glance he was an astute man was erhard the more nick knew him the more he respected him maybe he should look away from rose maybe what he was thinking was showing in his face what the heck not to look would be criminal im not sure if you know the history of alp de montez erhard was saying smiling between the pair of them let me give you a thumb sketch back in the sixteenth century a king had five sons the boys grew up warring and the old king thought hed preempt trouble he carved four countries from his border and told his younger sons that the cost of their own principality was lifelong allegiance to their oldest brother but granting whole countries to warlike men is hardly a guarantee of wise rule the princes and their descendants brought four wonderful countries to the brink of ruin but two are recovering nick said and erhard nodded yes two are moving towards democracy albeit with their sovereigns still in place of the remaining two alp de montez seems the worst off the old princeyour mutual grandfatherleft control more and more in the hands of the tiny council running the place the chief of council is jacques st ives and hes had almost complete control for years but the situation is dire taxes are through the roof the countrys on the brink of bankruptcy and people are leaving in the thousands where do you come into this nick asked curiously he knew much of this and not all of it was second hand several years ago curious about the country where his mother had been raised hed spent a week touring the place what hed seen had horrified him ive been an aide to the old prince for many years erhard said sadly as he lost his health i watched the power shift to jacques and then there were the deaths deaths rose asked there have been many erhard told her the old crown prince died last year he had four sons and then a daughter youd think with five children thered be someone to inherit but in order of succession gilen died young in a skiing accident leaving no children gottfried died of a drug overdose when he was nineteen keifer drank himself to death and keifers only son konrad died in a car crash two weeks ago rose your father eric died four years back and nick your mother zia the youngest of the five children is also dead which leaves three grandchildren erics daughtersyou rose and your sister juliannaare now first and second in line for the throne you nikolai are third did you know all this nick asked rose and she shook her head i knew my father was dead but i didnt know any of the ascendancy stuff until i had erhards letter my mother and i left alp de montez when i was fifteen have you ever been there i skied there once nick admitted does that mean you can inherit the throne she asked smiling because you skied there it almost comes down to that erhard said and nick had to stop smiling at rose for a minute and look serious which was really hard he was starting to feel like a moonstruck teenager and hed only had half a beer maybe hed better switch to mineral water like erhard but regardless of what he was feeling erhard was moving on we need a sovereign he said the constitution of the alp countries means no change can take place without the overarching approval of the crown id love to see the place as a democracy but thats only going to happen with royal approval which would be where we come in i guess rose said your letter said you needed me yes but im not a real royal eric really wasnt my father she touched her flamecoloured hair and winced in rueful remembrance surely you remember the fuss erhard eric called my mother a whore and kicked her out of the country not until you were fifteen and you went with her erhard said softly there wasnt a lot of choice she shrugged my sistermy halfsisterwanted to stay in the palace but my mother was being cut off with nothing there wasnt a lot of love lost between me and julianna even then my sister was jealous of me and my father hated my hair no thats putting it too nicely my father hated me i had no place there he acknowledged you as his daughter until you were fifteen erhard said yes there was general consensus that you werent his but the people felt sorry for your mother and they loved you and my grandfather wanted my mother in the castle rose said bluntly my grandfather didnt care about the scandal which had produced me he knew his son was a womaniser and he knew my mothers affair happened through loneliness my mother was kind in a family where kind was hard to get it was only after grandfather became so ill and he wasnt noticing that my father was able to send her away to nothing erhard said bleakly to no support we didnt care rose said sounding defiant at leastit would have been nice at the end but we got by so you left the throne for julianna i didnt rose said sounding annoyed my mother and i assumed keifer and then konrad would inherit we werent to know theyd die young so youve never officially removed yourself from the succession i didnt think i had to if im not real royalty you are real royalty erhard said emphatic you were born within a royal marriage i have red hair no one in my extended family has red hair and my mother admitted your mother admitted nothing on paper but dna if dna testing were done half the royal families of europe would crumble erhard told her your mother married young into a loveless marriage but such things arent unusual your parents are dead theres no proof of anything julianna looks royal you think erhard asked with a wry smile theres no proof of that either and no one dare suggest dna so we turn to the lawyers theres an international jurisdictionlegal experts chosen for impartialityset up by the four alp principalities for just this eventuality they decide who has best right to the crown rose i told you in the letter julianna has married jacques st ives and theyre making a solid play for the crown their justification is that julianna is the only one of the three of you who lives in the country and moreover shes married to a citizen who cares about the place you rose walked away almost fifteen years ago regardless of your birth your absence by choice sits as an implacable obstacle the panel will decide in juliannas favour unless theyre given an alternative he hesitated he looked as if he didnt want to continuebut it had to be said and they all knew it rose if there are questions about your parentage there are also questions about juliannas he said softly regardless of dna testing the panel acknowledge that your parents marriage was hardly happy you remain the oldest and behind you both theres nikolai whose mother was definitely royal ive thought and thought of this the only way forward is for the two of you to present as one together you must outweigh juliannas claim a married couplethe questioned first and the definite third in linetaking on the throne together whatever erhard had said in his letter rose must have been forewarned nick thought as she was showing no shock the idea had stunned him but she was reacting as if it was almost reasonable she sat and stared at the bubbles in her glass for a while letting things settle she wasnt a woman who needed to talk he thought the silence was almost comfortable a marriage of convenience she said at last as if the thing was worthy of consideration yes thats what i thought you meant after i read the letter i guess its why i came it seemed that this way i might be able to help but she smiled up at walter as he delivered their meals and she nodded absolute affirmation when he offered her wine are you sure julianna and jacques wont make good rulers im sure they wont erhard said dont you know your sister nick asked curious we were friends when we were little she said sounding suddenly forlorn julianna was pretty and blonde and cute and i was carrotheaded and pudgy but despite that the old prince liked me he indulged me hed call me his little princess and julianna hated it so did my father it got so that i hated it too and when it all blew up i was glad to go i got to stay with my mother my greataunt and six crazy cats in london while julianna got to be a princess she gave a rueful smile so she got what she wanted but she never answered my letters or returned my calls it was like she and my father just wiped us you say shes married yes erhard said to jacques who wants control of the throne i see she gave herself an irritated shake i guess i expected no less but how can i believe what you say of her intentions i can verify them nick told her feeling it was time he helped out erhard was looking so strained he looked like he might collapse ive spent the last week researching the place alp de montez is in serious trouble and it will take a sovereign to help theres never been the slightest interest in ruling the country properly from either jacques the presiding council or from julianna herself corruption is everywhere oh rose said in a small voice she swallowed and then suddenly seemed to make a conscious effort to shake off dreariness this food is wonderful it was wonderful nick had chosen steak and somewhat to his surprise rose had too he was accustomed to women ordering something like grilled fish with a salador just a saladand then not eating most of it but there was none of the dainty eater about rose she tucked into her steak with enjoyment there was a bowl of roast potatoes to share fragrant with rosemary and she reached for the last one before he did ladies first she said and she smiled at him again and the odd warmth he was feeling intensified erhard who had been the one to settle on grilled fish chuckled quietly at the pair of them this could be some match he said hey hold on nick jerked back to the issue at hand he needed to put his hormones to one side and concentrate were far from deciding here he retorted the thing seems a fairy tale none of us believe its impossible or we wouldnt be sitting here erhard said smoothly rose thinks so too rose isnt committing herself rose retorted i only said id meet him and you have met him and he makes you smile just because i beat him to the last potato thats hardly a basis for a marriage shared intelligence is a basis of a marriage erhard said calmly and shared compassion now ive met you both i believe the thing might be possible is there really no other way nick said cautiously but he wasnt feeling cautious ever since erhard had walked into his office a bubble of excitement had been growing inside him that refused to be suppressed at first it had been the idea of having some say in turning around the fate of a nation but now hed never thought of marriage why should it be suddenly immensely appealing lets get this straight he said why not just rose erhard nodded hed obviously prepared his responses very carefully on the upside shes first in line and once upon a time the people loved her he said the downside is that as soon as the old prince was unable to react eric shouted from the rooftops that rose wasnt his rose and her mother left the country fifteen years ago and never looked back why not just julianna then on the upside julianna lives in the country and the people know her but they dont like her or they dont like her husband and julianna does what her husband says the inference that rose isnt royal must also taint juliannas claim theres no proof and rose is older why not just nick then rose demanded hes an unknown erhard said flatly i didnt know him myself until a week ago hes been to the country as a tourist but nothing else the people will never accept him maybe i could support roses claim without marriage nick heard himself say albeit reluctantly there was a crazy voice in the back of his head saying take her and run he suppressed it with an effort he had to be sensible as someone in line myself even if further away and the child of a royal daughter and not a son i can surely add weight to roses position so can the president of our council erhard said bluntly he supports julianna julianna is a citizen of alp de montez and shes married to another citizen rose was a peoples favourite in the past the press loved her portraying her as a natural friendly kid who always had a stray animal attached but that knowledge of rose has faded and her fathers vitriolic denunciation of her stands in her way it will take a huge factor to swing the thing in roses favour the only thing that will do it is your marriage and you nick said turning to rose puzzled there was so much about this woman he didnt understand youd seriously consider marriage to gain a throne she froze at that shed been smiling but now her face stilled whoa she said lets not paint me a golddigger i never said yes you did she said bluntly so lets get things clear erhards letter made me think im not the least bit interested in playing the crown princessthat was always juliannas preferred optionbut theres not so many times in your life that youre presented with an option that just might be for the greater good then she smiled up at walter who was clearing the plates from the main course do your puddings match your mains they certainly do miss walter said and he beamed id like something rich and sticky i believe we can accommodate that miss walter was smiling down at her like an avuncular genie it was as if she had him mesmerised well why not nick thought he was feeling pretty mesmerised himself pudding for you too walter said beaming still and nick nodded before thinking about it what was he doing he seldom had pudding he had to get his mind back into gear now i dont know the first thing about you he said weakly to rose as walter headed off to fetch puddings for all how can we think about marriage are you worried she asked im not an axe murderer nor a husband beater are you he ignored the question erhard says youre widowed yes she said in a voice that suddenly said dont go there theres no impediment to marriage erhard said stepping into the breach except that i dont much want to be married he said or he didnt think he did he hadnt thought he did there seemed to be two strands of thought here the strand that hed had before meeting rose and the postrose strand actually the postrose was a really convoluted knot neither do i said rose isnt that lucky we wouldnt need to stay married would we erhard of course not erhard said this isnt a happyeverafter scenario im demanding of you the idea is that you marry almost immediately ill put the necessary paperwork in train and then we present you to alp de montez as the jacquesjulianna alternative ive had private words with the committee nick you stay in alp de montez for a few weeks until things seem settled maybe a month then you use the excuse that you dont want to give up your profession and return to london rose then stays in alp de montez until we can get things in train to get a decent government sorted when affairs are under control you can quietly divorce youd depend on rose to get the affairs under control youre the international lawyer erhard said shrewdly im willing to wager you know exactly what can be done he did hed been thinking about it all week the chance to make a difference hed never belonged his mother zia had left alp de montez as a troubled teenager shed ended up in australia addicted to drugs pregnant with him his childhood until he was eight had been a struggle to survive lurching from fleeting intervals living with his increasingly erratic mother to extended periods in a long string of foster homes then ruby had found him shed plucked him off the streets of sydney and from then on his base had been with ruby and her tribe of foster sons ruby had given him security but still he felt rootless at some really basic level erhards proposition left him breathless what had rose said an option for the greater good it just might be the chance to make a difference he thought back to the frightened girl whod been his mother shed want this he knew she would shed been desperately homesick for alp de montez but there was no way her increasingly disgusted family would have funded her to go home he could go home on her behalf now with this woman by his side marriage it wasnt such a frightening thought if it was done for the right reasons but were roses reasons right how could a woman like this want to marry a complete stranger she was his cousin no she wasnt even that he thought she was the product of his auntbymarriages affair with someone they knew nothing of it didnt matter she was gorgeous what about julianna he asked looking for catches you cant convince her to do the right thing julianna wont speak to me erhard said but you he asked rose youre her sister she doesnt speak to me either rose said sadly i know its dumb but there it is so this really is a serious proposition it seems like it she smiled ruefully into her empty wineglass you know i swore id never marry again thatd be a waste says you whos never married at all she retorted suddenly sounding angry im sorry but his thoughts were elsewhere i wouldnt need to stay in alp de montez he said slowly you would for a few weeks erhard said could you use a holiday a holiday strange concept with rose she really was the most extraordinary woman stunning maybe i could he said and you he queried rose how long would you have to be away from your vet practice a year erhard said answering for her at least maybe longer im sorry rose but itd be more your commitment than nicks youd rule jointly but its you whos first in line unless anything happened to julianna which isnt going to happen rose said and shivered and then braced herself no matter id have to close my doors anyway and there arereasons why thats not such a terrible idea i guess the idea of playing princess for a year would be fun nick ventured and she frowned now youre being insulting she retorted and he paused maybe he was theres not so many times in your life that youre presented with an option that just might be for the greater good she met his look with calm indifference almost scorn his gaze fell to her hands here was another differencea huge differencefrom the women he dated this womans hands wouldnt have looked out of place on a woman twenty years older workworn hands not something he saw a lot of but she was looking down at his hands and he suddenly realised she knew exactly what he was thinking his hands were those of an international lawyer there was not a lot of work wear there if she was to have fun for a year maybe there were reasons she deserved it he thought shed lost a husband on the far side of the restaurant a band struck up it was a simple quartet playing softly enough to not disturb the diners on this side of the restaurant there was a small dancefloor and a couple of diners rose and started dancing to nicks surprise erhard rose but not to dance no he said as nick rose as well im sorry he sighed im notcompletely well if youll excuse me for a momenthe looked across at the dance floor almost wistfully maybe you could dance while im away i dont nick started but erhard shook his head you do my informants say you do and so does rose he gave an uncertain smile at them both but there was discomfort behind his eyes excuse me you go on and he pressed his napkin to his lips and headed towards the rear of the restaurant rose watched him go in concern he seems a nice man she said hes ill i wonder what hes probably doing this to manipulate us nick retorted and she smiled but absently still looking concerned i dont think so even if he is hes doing it for the right reasons and there is something wrong i think the silence stretched on behind them the band launched into a lively latinswing number nick was already standing he went to sit down again but then thought it seemed surly the woman before him was beautiful you dont look like a country vet he said and he must have sounded accusing because she smiled again im not manipulating she said gently i promise but any woman who looked like she did tonight was making a statement he thought whether it was manipulative or not and maybe his thoughts were transparent because her smile gave way to a flash of anger stop looking like that i have the right to wear what i like of course you do my husband bought this for me on our honeymoon she said still angry and he stilled so it is a sort of statement i guess it is a statement that youre available the flash of anger stilled and her eyes were suddenly ice i dont think i want to be married to you she snapped of all the boorish commentsif you wear a nice suit is that an advertisement of availability as well no he said horrified he was suddenly way out of his depth how could he have asked her such a question as well as being insulting hed also hurt her he could see it in the way shed withdrawn rose im sorry he said i have no idea why i said that but it was way out of line hell marriage or not we seem to have crossed some sort of barrier thats launched me somewhere where im not sure of the rules any more i know thats no excuse but pleaseim sorry her face softenedjust a little it does seem crazy she admitted she glanced down at her dress ruefully but maybe this is some sort of a statement maybe thats why youve made me angry you know this dress has sat in a camphor chest in my parentsinlaws house for the last five years its been likewell i was locked up with it tonight i did wear it as a kind of declarationnot that im available but that im free if that makes sense she shook her head no it barely makes sense to me but the last thing i want is more attachments ive done family for life i am free diving into the royal goldfish bowl of alp de montez is scarcely freeing yourself he said cautiously it all depends on what your prison has been she said are you going to ask me to dance i what the hell yes excellent she said and she smiled rose and took his arm altogether proprietary it seemed as if he was forgiven if im going to get the camphor smell out of this dress then i need to swirl it round a bit she didnt smell of camphor rose was an intuitive dancer light and lovely on her feet nick had been taught the rudiments of dance by his determined little foster mother and hed always enjoyed it with great music and a good partner one could almost lose oneself in dance but not tonight he didnt want to lose himself when he was dancing with rose the latin music gave way to a gentle waltz erhard had still not returned to their table so suddenly nick was holding her close steering her around the dance floor feeling her body mould to his in perfect time with his steps in perfect time with him and she didnt smell of camphor she smelled of rose what was she doing shed brought this dress with her on a whim walking out of the house feeling as if shed betrayed everyone she hadnt been worried about what she was wearing but as her motherinlaws weeping had increased as her fatherinlaw had wrung his hands and said rose you cant leave we love you youre our daughter what would max think shed abandoned her distress as too hard and shed let anger hold sway shed lifted the lid of her camphor chest and had retrieved the dress and shoes that had lain there for what seemed almost a lifetime and then before shed closed the chest again shed taken maxs photograph from her bedside table and put it where her dress had been and had closed the lid then shed walked out of the house free no not free still guiltridden seemingly obligated in some weird way to a country shed left with the royal familys scorn following her but she wasnt going back to yorkshire except to finalise things no family no ties nicks question as to her availability couldnt have been more wrong if ever anyone else told her they loved her then shed run a mile but she was in this mans arms yes and that was great she told herself as she let him swirl her round the dance floor with an expertise that made her feel wonderful erhards long letter had filled her in on who nick was a loner whod pulled himself up the hard way a man whose intelligence was extraordinary a man with an aussie accent overlaying his smooth frenchitalian native tongue and a laidback charm that could knock a girl sideways nick was a sophisticated international lawyer whod come from a background even more dysfunctional than her own he was a man who knew where his boundaries were so it was fine yes she could marry him to keep alp de montez safe and she could keep her independence it would finally make her free please five minutes later erhard returned to the table the musicians took a break there was no reason to stay on the dance floor but as nick led her back to the table he was aware of a sharp stab of regret only because he loved dancing he thought only that erhard was smiling watching them weave their way through the tables to join him the strain had eased from his face a little two wonderful dancers he said softly as they sat down again you see this thing becomes possible he settled back into his chair and took a long sip of water well nick looked at rose and found she was watching him intently it seemed a decision needed to be made now did that mean rose had already decided you need to trust me erhard told him softly this is a big ask we need to trust each other its fine rose said suddenly sounding impatient to move on sounding as if she was annoyed im willing to take a chance so its up to you nick if you dont choose to take part then say so now let erhard go into damage control and see if theres another solution theres no other solution erhard said flatly and they both went back to watching him shed flung her hat in the ring just like that shed agreed to marry him after knowing him only a matter of hours his foundations were shaken he thought and it wasnt just this crazy proposition that was shaking them it was the way hed felt dancing with rose the way shed felt he needed a cold shower and then some good legal advice youre holding a gun to my head he snapped and the old man shook his head thats what were hoping to avoid guns youre serious im serious erhard whispered and the grey look flooded back how ill was he so tell us rose said to nick directly with a sideways glance of concern towards erhard are you in or are you out i need to do a little more research fine she said research away i spent a week on the internet myself but if you come up with the conclusion i came up withas you willare you ready to have a go at fixing things youre seriously asking me to marry you i thought you were asking me to marry you i guess its mutual only ive said yes and you havent she said go on it might even be fun i dont do fun neither do i she snapped not for years so were perfectly compatible im willing to take a risk on the rest what about you yes or no and there it was not a gun pointing at his head but just possibly a chance to make a difference rose was waiting for him to come to a decision her grey eyes calmly watchful erhard was waiting too two people he instinctively trusted who were trying to do good so what was a man to say yes he said and there was a moments stunned silence and then they both beamed there it is then rose said proposal accepted congratulations to us all and here comes pudding do you think i might have some more champagne chapter three rose finished an excellent pudding but it signalled that the night for rose at least was over she excused herself without waiting for coffee i was up before dawn and i need to walk a bit before bed after all that champagne she told them no i dont want company i need headspace to plan the next few weeks theres so much i need to do finding someone to take care of a thousand squaremiles of farm animals is the least of it if there are no hitches then you can marry in four weeks erhard said marrying in alp de montez is the wisest course can you be ready then ill do my best rose said she hesitated and then she stooped and kissed the old man gently on the forehead you take care of yourself please for me and she left without another word nick watched as she wove through the tables smiling as a waiter paused to let her pass smiling at the doorman as he opened the door for her smiling as she went out into the night shes some lady erhard said gently and nick came back to earth with a jolt sorry i was just thinking shes worth thinking about i dont no you dont do you erhard said ive had you thoroughly checked the longest youve ever dated one woman is nine weeks that took him aback you know that the investigative agency i hired is very thorough so you know all about me it wouldnt have been worth my while to approach you if id found you were another jacques but the reputation you have in legal circles is for integrity you try to select cases where theres moral imperative as well as financial also the woman who fostered you since you were smallrubysays that youre honest kind and trustworthy as a reference i thought that was the best how the hell did you get ruby to talk about me he demanded and erhard gave a small smile the investigative agency has an operative who enjoys macramé he confessed she infiltrated your foster mothers macramé group his smile broadened at nicks astonishment desperate times call for desperate measures ruby seemed to be the best person to give a character reference but shed never have answered an official request with such honesty as it was she told our operative that you went through eight foster homes as your mother agonised whether she could keep you that you grieved for your mother even though she wasimpossible that once you joined ruby and her family of foster sons you were fiercely loyal to every one of the family members that you learned early to be a loner but you were generous to a fault theres an australian childrens homecastle at dolphin baythat you contribute to in any way you can that if any of your foster brothers are in trouble youre there before they ask his smile deepened i read the report and i thought yes youll do rubys macramé group he was still feeling winded rose was out the door now and the room was dreary for her going well then erhard and his operatives had to be good for something rose he queried what did you find out about rose ive told you most of it tell me again he growled he hadnt listened properly the first time he hadnt been as interested as he was now shes had it hard too erhard said gently with only a faint smile to tell hed guessed at nicks reactions maybe almost as hard as you her mother had rheumatoid arthritis and couldnt work and after she left the palace eric simply ignored both of them rose worked her way through vet school she met and married a fellow studentmax mccray max was an older studenthed missed schooling because of time spent recovering from cancer max was the only son of a veterinarian in the yorkshire dales rose was embraced into maxs family and when rose and max graduated they took over the family veterinary practice then the disease recurred rose cared for max devotedlyas well as running the vet practiceuntil maxs death two years ago shes running it still but shes agreed to leave you know i suspect theres almost an element of relief erhard said honestly the village shes been living in is tiny and shes very much maxs widow everywhere we asked we were told how wonderful rose is and how noble it is of her to carry on her husbands work theres a large veterinary conglomerate based in a nearby town that would buy them out in a flash but her parentsinlaw wont hear of it so shes stuck dealing with lots of farm workhorses and cattlewhich her fatherinlaw and husband loved but its hard physical work for one so slight theres also been a huge money problem maxs illness put her in debt and shed borrowed to put herself through vet school max had no family money you know he hesitated this isnt a standard privateinvestigative report but the firm i use is goodvery good their brief is to compile character assessments of people in line for top jobs so they give more than facts our investigator talked to one of the nurses who cared for roses husband the nurses assessment is that rose is stuck in her husbands life but she is leaving weve given her a huge moral imperative to leave erhard said a whole country depending on her instead of just a village she can walk away without maxs ghost dragging her back so youre expecting me to walk away from my profession like youre expecting rose to no ones expecting anything of you erhard said patiently apart from a few weeks of your time and a name on a marriage document theres no need for you to stay in alp de montez theres no need for your life to change very much at all simply take a few weeks off work marry rose wait until the fuss about the succession has died down and then take over your life again yes youll be part of the royal couple but apart from the coronation itselfand the weddingyour attendance is optional your interest is optional and when roses position is established you can divorce rose seems willing to put in the hard yards you said shes working too hard as it is nick said frowning ill take care of her erhard said she wont be delivering calves in icy paddocks at midnight thats what shes doing now thats what shes doing living with her parentsinlaw stuck in the grief of her husbands loss there were so many facets of the woman he thought a cheeky imp a beautiful sophisticated woman a magical dancer a workhorse i guess i can he said and erhard smiled there are worse women to marry than rose he said it seemed the thing was decided by the time he turned up at work the next morning erhard had already initiated the first steps towards the royal wedding nick took a deep breath and quietly talked to the firms senior partners to his relief the partners saw nothing but benefit even blake nicks foster brother who also worked for the firm was enthusiastic when nick told him blake stared at his foster brother in amazement and then quietly gone away and done the same research nick had even to blake the plan looked solid its your birthright after all and youd be crazy not to blake told him theres enough stability in the country for your marriage to be received with relief you get in there and support roseanitra for all youre worth but marriage he said to blake and blake grinned yeah well maybe this is the only sort of marriage that can work for the likes of us hed said its not like you want a real marriage why not in name only why not because it wasnt quite true marriage for nick had always seemed something others did from the time he first remembered it had been as if he was on the outside looking in happy families how did you go about achieving that he had six foster brothers and theyd all come from disasterspartnerships that had imploded even ruby his beloved foster mother had suffered tragedy hed dated many womenof course he hadbut the step toward commitment had always seemed insurmountable but this youre only committing for a month right blake asked the general idea is that we stay married for as long as we need to minimum a month once rose is firmly entrenched theres no need for me to stay but the thought of helping get the country on its feet again turns you on it does yeah he admitted and the thought of being married to rose he grinned and didnt answer but the bubble of excitement was becoming a tidal wave this was a challenge it was potentially beneficial for a whole country and hed be marrying rose if it worked out see there was the scary bit for some dumb reason that was the thing that gave him pause the way he felt about her she was gorgeous her smile made him gasp she felt she didnt feel anything what had she said the last thing i want is more attachments ive done family for life i am free that should make him feel better about the whole deal instead it only made him feel more uncertain the thought of taking on a countrys direction didnt worry him the thought of marrying rose did or it didnt worry him as much as unsettle him it made him feel like he was teetering on the edge of something he didnt understand but blake didnt see that no one did he himself decided it was dumb and as a week passed without seeing rose he thought okay he was being a romantic fool this was hardly a romantic wedding it seemed more like a military operation and he had to treat it as such erhard was on the phone constantly organising every tiny detailwhen theyd arrive when the wedding would take place accommodation transport meetings with the council to take place as soon as the wedding was over the ascendancy claim the legal documents erhard faxed for signature made even nicks eyes water what was rose thinking but he couldnt know i have a mountain of organisation to get through before i leave shed told him in their one brief phonecall im dealing with mass hysteria here you sort the legal stuff i know its dumb but ill sign whatever needs to be signed i have to trust you on this nick you and erhard a later phone call elicited a bit more background instead of rose his call was answered by her motherinlaw you have no right to do this the woman hissed down the phone the whole town depends on her shes saying the district will have to join the vet cooperative in the next town she says with the money they pay well be well off but we dont want money my poor son would turn in his grave how dare that man tell her she has no choice how dare she became almost venomous and in the end nick had put down the phone and thought he could understand another of roses conditions she didnt want any press release until she was out of the country erhard agreed with that reluctantly but nick thought that was fine the juggernaut that was royal ascension rolled on then in the last few days before he and rose were due to fly out nicks contact with erhard had faltered there was one stilted phonecall nikolai things are in place for you to take over i need to fade into the background good luck to you and to rose he didnt explain but by the sound of his voice nick thought that his health was probably a factor erhard had launched them and was depending on them to take it from here good luck to you and to rose that caused another of those moments when panic seemed to overwhelm him but there was no reason for panic no logical reason a royal marriage of convenience why not so he went on planning for this strange wedding and the world didnt crash on his head but on that last day when he walked out of his office before taking a month off and he found the whole of the office decorated with bridal nonsense he was forced to see this for the reality it was it was saturday the office should have been deserted but people had obviously come in especially obviously blake and the partners had decided that today theyd break their silence champagne was flowing the girls from the typing pool were handing round weddingcake blake had found a picture of rose in a local newspapers weddings column detailing roses wedding to max years ago someone had blown her image up to banner size posters of a grainy bridal rose were plastered from one end of the office to another shes gorgeous everyone agreed and even rose laughing down from every wall seemed to concur roses image unsettled him as nothing else could this was a rose without the care lines around her eyes rose beforelife it felt weird that he could think of marrying this woman he decided trying to smile as he accepted congratulations it even seemed dangerous but hed gone too far to back out now and finally he escaped under a shower of confetti and goodnatured banter there goes the groom to collect his bride or the prince to collect his princess they called after him and he had to smile and concur youll be the second of rubys foster sons to get legshackled blake said as he walked with his foster brother to the firms carpark he and blake had gone through a lot together theyd come from similar dysfunctional backgrounds ending up under rubys care theyd both been ambitious and theyd made it through law school together nick had started work with this firm first and blake had followed the year after they were about as close as brothers could be which gave blake the right to say what he liked which he intended to do right now youre not looking happy he said thoughtfully bridal jitters getting to you you know this isnt a real wedding nick growled unnerved but blake smiled and shrugged you make the vows its all the wedding the likes of us can do what have you told ruby that ive agreed to be married for a month in order for rose to ascend the throne that its business only that she neednt worry about anything and ill come over and pay her a visit when its all over and she said blake said cautiously sheumsounded a little irate i thought she might have phoned you when did you tell her this morning you have to be kidding he and blake were pushing their way through a crowd of photographers on the pavement the press had arrived seemingly out of nowhere someone must have told them what was happening and they were now documenting every step shell probably have tried to phone me twenty times already just assure her its business nick said she shouldnt worry about it its nothing nothing blake stopped dead his face a picture of incredulity you want me to explain to ruby youre marrying a princess but its nothing id be lucky to get off with burst eardrums then dont rubys agreed to do some babysitting for pierce and his brood for a couple of weeks so she wont have time to think about it they do have news services in dolphin bay blake said with asperity australias not so far away as youd think when it comes to royal weddings i seem to remember they even have newspapers youre inviting guests to this wedding only dignitaries you can tell ruby that he gave a rueful grin i tried but she wouldnt stop yelling youre seriously getting married without involving family i dont do family you know that yeah but does ruby shell be over here like a flash taking rose into the bosom of our peculiar family finding out her sweater size making a macramé spread for the marital bed maybe even starting on a few booties see thats what we dont want nick said bluntly if i let ruby near rose rose would run like a scalded cat this is business a marriage made in heaven blake said wryly its the only sort rose will consider nick told him and didnt notice when blake gave him an odd look theyd reached his car now the photographers were still at it somehow they had to be ignored problems needed to be ignored meanwhile he gripped his brothers hand in a gesture of farewell thanks mate he told him keep my place here warm for me you might not still want it blake said still looking at him strangely of course i will this marriage is for a matter of weeks thats all its for ill be back yeah blake said and shook his hand back right just you be careful boyo of marital threads as well as political ones so what was the problem why did blake sound dubious and where had those photographers come from surely they wouldnt spread this news as far as ruby in dolphin bay maybe he should have given ruby a few more details maybe even invited her to the wedding but ruby at his wedding shed sob he thought shed hug them both shed make it incredibly intensely personal which would scare rose and him in the comparative privacy of his bmw heading for his kensington apartment to collect his baggage nick had time to think and the more he thought the more he felt like he was heading into trouble to hurt ruby by not inviting her he couldnt invite her and hed specified it was just business but it had his foot easing from the accelerator thinking maybe even now it wasnt too late to draw back his mobile phone rang it answered automatically on the handsfree base if it hadnt maybe he wouldnt have answered his need for solitude to get his head right was starting to be overwhelming but the voice came on the other end of the line before he could prevent the connection nick rose she sounded as spooked as he was its good to hear from you he managed there are photographers here she said everywhere they arrived an hour ago and theres more arriving by the minute my motherinlaws weeping so hard shes making herself ill the phones ringing off the hook i thinkis this a disaster so he wasnt alone in feeling overwhelmed i guess its what we had to expect he said cautiously insensibly reassured that she was feeling the same as he was i hadnt thought neither had i its not too late to back out she whispered do you want to back out i dont know she said it seemed so easy when it was just fantasy but now what would you do if you backed out he asked there was a long silence stay here i guess she said sounding unsure you dont want to stay there no that was unequivocal at any rate then we did decide to do this for the right reasons didnt we nick he had to be honest here yes it will make life better for the people of alp de montez i think so he said reluctantly my law firm is heavily geared to international disputes we have people on the ground all over the world the consensus is that we really can make a difference we dont have a choice then she said heavily there is a choice rose he said hed pulled up at traffic lights theyd turned green but he wasnt shifting there were horns blaring behind him but he thought no he had to concentrate you can walk away i cant walk away she said unless i have an alternative you can stay where you are thats what i meant she whispered alp de montez is my alternative he didnt understand look we can call the whole thing off do you want to hold on a minute he told her and moved forward before the motorists banked up behind him got out of their cars and thumped him he steered into a bus stop and stopped rose this is up to you he said gently youre the one first in line im the supporting role here i guess she took a ragged breath but you will support me five minutes ago hed been thinking he couldnt but nowit was only for a month or so and it would make a difference rose was taking this on for much much longer if she was prepared to do it how could he say no of course ill support you he said gently were in this together for a month and then ill be on the end of the phone i wont leave you isolated well set up supports but youll stay involved he took a deep breath yes where had that come from the nikolai de montez mantra was never get involved but this was different this was for a country this was for rose yes he said again ill stay as involved as you want then i guess i can cope with the press she said still sounding shaky the planes due to pick me up in newcastle at two you swear youll be on it what was a man to say to that despite misgivings despite ruby yes he said and he was committed chapter four the plane was fitted out like something out of a james bond movie nikolai was accustomed to firstclass international travel but this was mind boggling he couldnt cut and run now leaving rose to face the consequences but he felt like it he buckled his seat belt with grim resolution lets get this over with for the first part of the flight he was alone apart from a darksuited elderly attendant who spoke in monosyllables somewhere up front thered be a flight crew but he never saw them erhard had made the arrangements he just had to trust erhard only why hadnt erhard answered his calls for the last few days how sick was he what was nick walking into rose was due to catch the flight in newcastle hed committed to marriage yes to marriage and it seemed weird he sank into the luxurious upholstery and let his thoughts go where they willed they asked questions he couldnt answer things like would rose get cold feet what if erhards illness wasnt the reason for his withdrawal how alone would they be it wasnt an uncivilised country they were going to he told himself his unease deepening with every mile they drew further from london the worst that could happen was that he and rose were asked to leave or refused permission to land the plane was in the air his escape was cut off next step rose would you like refreshments a beer an expressionless fight attendantgriswold according to his name badgeasked him and nick shook his head no thank you he didnt need a beer he needed to keep every faculty crystalclear the attendant a sobersuited man in his sixties gave him a searching look nick smiled the man seemed anxious and the last thing nick wanted to do was make the locals nervous but griswold simply bowed briefly and left him alone and then they were landing at newcastle griswold appeared again and told him there was no need for him to stir the princess roseanitra is in the terminal he told him its raining outside id advise you to stay put the princess roseanitra the name took him aback the princess roseanitra boarding the official plane of the royal family of alp de montez to join her future husband the fantasy had begun and here came the bride rightnot this wasnt your normal vision of a royal bride rose was running across the rainsoaked tarmac an airport official was holding an umbrella over her head trying to keep up with her she was dressed in jeans and an ancient duffel coat she was carrying a shabby holdall she was also carrying a dog some sort of terrier his feeling of unreality took a step back rose grounded this thing in practicality he thought and the craziness seemed possible again as he watched her run seemingly ignoring the rain she smiled at griswold at the foot of the stairs and nick found himself smiling back this wasnt fantasy rose was a country veterinarian with a scruffy looking dog and clothes past their useby date she just looked likerose she stepped into the cabin laughing at something griswold said behind her speaking in a language nick recognised she saw him and she stopped short her smile faded and she looked suddenly uncertain maybe even a little scared umhi she said hi as a response to the occasion it lacked a certain sophistication but for the life of him he couldnt think of a more intelligent response you dont mind sharing a cabin with hoppy she asked hoppy because of the leg she said kindly as if he was a bit thick she smiled down at the little dog in her arms and then checked out the plane she seemed almost overwhelmed by its opulence swallowing a couple of times like she was trying to dredge up courage but somehow she made her voice light and smiley wow she whispered ive hardly ever flown before surely they cant all be like this no nick said they certainly werent the two double settees that were the airlines only passenger seats were more luxurious than any seat hed ever been in they were fitted with seat belts but that was their only concession to airline strictures there was white shagpile carpet there were tiny sidetables with indents to hold wine glassesall carved from the one magnificent piece of mahogany a partition at the rear led to a bedroomhe could see a magnificent bed set up ready for use the entire interior was painted white with muted pinks with soft hangings disguising the harsh outer casing of the airlines metal cabin this was definitely not cattle class but rose had moved on shrugging off her discomfort with her coat she placed the little dog on the seat beside him griswoldwhod spoken hardly at all since nick had come aboardtook her coat and smiled down at hoppy le chien a faim peutêtre il voudrait un petit morceau de biftek hoppy would very much like a biftek rose said and beamed at the man moi aussi oui merci beaucoup et pour la madame du champagne ooh yes oui merci merci merci she lifted her dog back into her arms sank down into the seat beside nick and giggled isnt this fabulous the dog only had three legs hoppy yep he had it he was right on the ball today if only she didnt smile so much do you suppose thered be caviar if i asked for it she said and he decided to stop the fatuousness and try and be serious i thought the plan was to stop extravagant spending by the royal family oh she said and her face fell does that have to start today i thought maybe we could have a little bit of fun first her laughter disappeared as if hed reprimanded her she sank back into the sumptuous upholstery clipped her seat belt and hugged her dog he felt bad he hadnt meant to stop her smiling she stayed looking defensive he went on feeling bad and more more yes more because suddenly he was hit with this really dumb urge to kiss her better or just to kiss her which was really dumb he told himself startled by the intensity of his urge as well as the unexpectedness of it that would be really stupid as was her reaction he thought struggling for an even keel she was acting like hed slapped her he was starting to feel like he was always apologising to this woman she made him feel he was permanently on the back foot but if he was going to apologise he might as well get it over with maybe i was out of order he conceded im sorry theres a concession she said but of course youre right this is a serious business a marriage of convenience theres not a lot to smile about in that they didnt speak again as the plane took off the two setteescumairlineseats were forward facing set in a v so up to four occupants could talk together there was a silkhung divider in front which hid the service compartment and the entrance to the cockpit but they were essentially alone they were sitting side by side and he feltweird she was very close but not for long the plane rose smoothly and the seatbelt sign clicked off the moment it did rose gathered hoppy unclipped her seat belt and moved herself sharply across the aisle to the other double seat to the furthest side of the far seat it was like shed slapped him even hoppy was looking balefully across at him like hed offended the dog too i have offended you he said frowning and she shook her head no i just decided youre right its formal the stuff well be doing so i may as well start being formal now you could have caviar if you want if its aboard i dont really want it but you asked i just thought maybe itd be fun to play the princess a little she said and then looked ruefully down at her faded jeans and her threelegged dog but im not princess material i never have been cinderella before the godmother yeah well the godmothers the money thing she said bane of my life griswold came through bearing a tray carrying one crystal flute the champagne bubbling deliciously she looked at the champagne with regret do you think i should ask for it to be put back in the bottle i dont think it can be he said weakly hell how to make a man feel bad you mean i just have to drink it she cheered up to save its life hooray griswold smiled as she buried her nose in bubbles are you having one ill have a glass of wine with my meal she raised her eyebrows and more than one never touches your lips i believe itd be good if at least one of us kept our wits about us um he hadnt meant to say that it was just that she made him feel old no defensive he decided but he didnt know why and she seemed to agree with him of course she said and raised her glass in his direction how very wise you stay on watch you keep all your wits while i stick my nose into champagne why had he said that he sounded about a hundred talk about a killjoy he thought of what erhard had told him about this woman shed had it tough for the past few years no wonder shed been talked into accepting her heritage no wonder she wanted to escape to a little fantasy he glanced across to the other seat in between sipping champagne she was hugging her little dog to her like a shield she looked about ten years old im really sorry i was mean he said and she flashed him a suspicious look lawyers dont apologise if you acknowledge fault then i get to sue so maybe she wasnt ten years old tell me about your dog hes hoppy weve done that i was hoping for a little more information she looked at him suspiciously over the rim of her champagne glass hoppys two years old she said at last he got squashed by a tractor when he was five weeks old i was helping deliver a foal and the farmer was driving his tractor through the yard mud everywhere this little one darted out to meet me and went straight under the tractor wheel when the tractor moved on we couldnt see a sign of him then thirty seconds later i found him buried completely in mud one leg was broken so badly it had to come off but otherwise he was perfect he even wiggled his tail when i patted him smashed leg and all so you bought him i was given him the farmers reaction to the accident was that it was a shame he hadnt been killed outright hoppys so small hes useless for ratting thats why hed been bred so i have my semiuseless nonratting hoppy and i love him to bits and you can take him into alp de montez sure i can she said defensively im a princess hoppys out for adventure and so am i he stared at her for a moment while she finished the last of the champagne and then stared regretfully into the empty glass in a flash griswold was out from behind his screen with a refill the elderly man was now smiling nick saw he hadnt smiled at him i shouldnt rose was saying ill be the witkeeper he told her relax im not too sure i can trust you arent we almost cousins cousins if my mother hadnt played fast and loose but even if we were family doesnt necessarily mean trust look at me and my sister yeah i dont understand that were you close when you were small when we were very young yes but my father thought julianna was great and he used to take her with him when he travelled he travelled a lot and i think it used to amuse him to have such a gorgeous little girl calling him papa my mother and i stayed behind then we were booted out i didnt mind she said diffidently much then she shook herself no that sounds iffy my mother and i had some really good times after we got out of the royal bit we stayed with my aunty cath in london the three of us always dreamed of going adventuring together but mum had rheumatoid arthritis and aunty cath owned six cats thats a bit of a restriction where adventurings concerned when did your mother die when i was twenty two years after aunty cath a year after the last cat and then you met max so i did she said diffidently and he was great but an invalid not when i first knew him we had almost a year when he was in remissionwe thought he was cured did you marry him because you loved him nick asked before he could help himself or because you felt sorry for him somewhat to his surprise she answered seriously you know it was a whole lot of things she said max was twentysix and seemed older because hed been ill he was so pleased to be well again it was just lovelyhe wanted to try everything do everything and his familywed hardly even been a family and after mama and aunty cath there was no one we went up to yorkshire the first christmas after wed met and it was such a welcome the whole town one big family it was like coming home again it was only afterwards that i felt felt what look if max had lived it would have been fine she said sounding defensive again but max was larger than life he had to be he had too much living to do the village had pooled together to get him the best medical treatment money could buy as a community it was a huge commitment and they loved him when he died well there was only me and they sort of transferred their loving to me and youre tired of loving a little bit she admitted and sipped her champagne and smiled ruefully i wouldnt mind a bit of adventuring me and hoppy he smiled back her smile was infectious even when it was rueful and you she said curiously what about your childhood erhard told me youre devoted to your foster mother rubys great but his words were curt he didnt like people enquiring into his background the knowledge that rubys macramé class had been infiltrated gave him an odd feeling like he was exposed hey if were going to be married i need to know stuff about you she said and you asked first so what do you need to know how i like my toast buttered in the morning butter your own toast big boy she said but she chuckled no but you know the sort of thing id hate to find out that you have a fiancée and twelve kids no fiancée no kids he said a bit too hastily im sure erhard would have told you if i had but what about you did you and max want kids her face closed just like that no im sorry i didnt mean to pry thats three sorries in as many minutes from a lawyer she said awed and he thought she was changing the subject he went along with it though i guess three sorries mean im at your mercy you know im very sure youre not she smiled but absently and went back to hugging hoppy and looking out the window conversation over he left her to it if reluctantly retiring into a pile of documents he needed to study even though he was taking a month off there were things he couldnt delegate and time on planes was work time so he studied or he tried to study roses nose stayed against the window it was a very cute nose what are you looking at he asked at last but she didnt look around mountains surely youve seen mountains before i used to see these peaks from the distance when i was a child you never went there mama was an invalid and my father she shrugged he took julianna but youve travelled he said startled and she shook her head only when we came to london my mother was english you see so when my father sent her away she went to aunty cath then we were a bit stuck but then when i was twenty aunty cath had a lifeinsurance policynot very much but enough shed stipulated i use it to travel mum seemed well and the cats were all dead then she grinned hey dont look sympathetic yetwe had some truly weird cats and their collective age when they died was about a thousand anyway mum only had herself to look after and she was enthusiastic that i go i had ten weeks university holiday every holiday since i was fifteen id worked trying to help but this time it all seemed to fit so i took a deep breath and flew to australia intending to backpack along the east coast but the airline contacted me before i even reached sydney my mother had had a heart attack apparently shed been having chest pain and hadnt told me shed seen specialists and still hadnt told me she was dead before i got home i used the last of aunty caths nest egg to bury her and went back to university he felt his own chest tighten didnt your father help youre kidding she said harshly of course not he and julianna stayed far away anyway she took a deep breath and moved on how about you how did you get to be an international lawyer hard work if there was no money you must have wanted it a lot i did why im not sure he said hesitating she had him off balance hed not been questioned in such a personal way sincewell since ruby had sat him down after his secondary school results had come in looked him straight in the eye and said tell me you dont want to be a lawyer because of the money was rose asking the same question maybe she was i dont really know he said with the same reluctance hed shown when ruby had asked but hed been seventeen then now he was thirty six and hed had time to think his response through i suspect it was a lot to do with my childhood i felt helpless thenbeing taken from foster home to foster home so i wanted security yes i wanted a job where i could be in control but there was also the issue of who my mother was i knew about her royal background it fascinated me the only thing i had was a knowledge that the royal family of alp de montez was somehow my family international lawwell my jobs helped to answer questions and make me feel as if the world is a smaller place good answer she said and she smiled and vet science i always wanted a dog she said and i was really fond of aunty caths cats even though they were collectively insane maybe thats a dumb reason for choosing a career but there it is i didnt have any wish to link internationallyeven with alp de montez youve kept the language up i practiced with italian and french language tapes while i was at universityjust for fun because it seemed a shame to lose it how about you my mother must have spoken the language when i was tiny i hardly know how i got it but its there i learned french and italian at university as well i gather the language of the alp countries is a mishmash of both so it seems weve both kept a little of our backgrounds yeah were both royal she said absently um theres snow on these mountains and dots lots of colourful dots ski slopes these are the best skislopes in the world do you ski yes on these mountains sometimes yes international skifields were a good base for meeting the people he needed to know goodness she said faintly lots of people ski he said knowing he sounded defensive but not being able to stop himself not in my world they dont they trudge round digging out livestock and swearing at the snow in general youve never skied i suspect theres a whole lot of stuff ive never done she turned to face him including marrying someone who skies in places like these she shook her head and hugged her dog again its a whole new world do you know what youre letting yourself in for no she said honestly i know the people i know there was lots that i loved but i dont know the political setup do you ive researched this well yes its more than i have she conceded you just jumped thats right ran more like it does sound appealing he said playing princess i dont expect i shall play princess she said absently as you said its dumb to eat caviar i guess if i have authority then ill start by doing things like selling this ostentatious aeroplane but it seemed shed said the wrong thing the screen in front of them was put aside with a decisive click the man whod been serving them griswold was staring at them in consternation you must not he said in his own language and he sounded desperate rose frowned confused by his sudden interjection slipping effortlessly into the language that matched his we mustnt sell this aeroplane no inot yet i guess its your job she said confused its not my job the elderly man told her or not very often im sorry this is none of my business i shouldnt have said your dinner is almost ready so tell us why we shouldnt sell the plane nick asked moving easily into the language as well we need you to be the royal couple griswold said simply nothing else will save the country and he flicked back the screen and went back to work no more was said until the meal was servedmagnificent beef steak which spoke heaps of griswolds skill in cooking in confined spaces no prepacked airline food this there was chocolate mousse to follow and espresso coffee finally as he cleared the coffee cups away griswolds severe face relaxed a little but as he reached for roses cup she took his wrist and held tell me what you mean about wanting us to be a royal couple she said madame i cant you cant do what i he shook his head theres orders from who from monsieur jacques the husband of your sister orders to do what to tell you nothing he said miserably to let you do this mockmarriage thing its not a mock marriage rose said frowning more its a real one its not griswold said simply ive been overhearing what julianna and jacques have been telling the people is right that this is a marriage of convenience its still a marriage yes but theres more he said unhappily reports are that this marriage is a sham and so is any goodwill you might have towards our people youre outsiders youll sign the right papers and then disappear again no wrongs will be righted taxes will continue to be bled from the people and sent overseas our country will be worse off thats not why were here nick said frowning as much as rose was erhard fritz erhard fritz is being discredited by the governmentcontrolled press griswold said theres been a smear campaign the press is portraying you both as upstart outsiders you monsieur with vaguely sinister intentions and you madame as a greedy widow why are you telling us this rose said slowly her eyes not leaving griswolds face maybebecause of the dog he said unhappily i know that sounds nonsense but my daughter has a dog such as this one i listened to you telling monsieur how you took in the dog and i thought this cant be a woman such as the press describes i remembered the stories of you as a child the press was fairer then not controlled by the council you were always described as a tomboy more interested in animals than in learning society manners then the way you both gave thanks little things buti heard you talking about a marriage of convenience and i thought it doesnt fit its a way of repairing the damage nick said we can set in place reforms not if the people rise up against you griswold said which they will if they think youre here for your own gain if you sell this plane straight away theyll think its a first act to siphon money things have been said dreadful things ive heard nothing of this nick snapped jacques and his friends are too clever to use the main newsprints to spread the worst of the rumours the man said unhappily but rumours have been sweeping the country nevertheless and people like erhard people of sense have been effectively silenced theres not a lot we can do about it rose said doubtfully we were told it would be simple you need to get the people on side griswold said people like me working people all of us i do have some english all the time ive been cooking ive been listening to you you both can speak our language thats wonderful madame the people were fond of you once as a child theyll remember that you have the little dog as you walk out of this plane you need to look happy to be in the country happy to be home you need to speak to as many people as possible ordinary people you need to see and be seen and you need to hold hands all the time speak to each other as a married couple dont appear to have heard a single thing that ive just told you and and and let the people know that you mean well and that youre not trying to deceive them let them know that youre about to enter into a marriage chapter five they landed soon after questions unresolved i think that my wifes cousin will be driving the royal car griswold told them as the plane came to a standstill he will wish you well as i do but his contact with them was over he stayed aboard unhappily disappearing into the background as they emerged onto alp de montez soil they werent sure what to expect when they arrived after erhards silence nick had been contacted by someone calling himself the palace chief of staff telling them he was taking care of the arrangements for their arrival therell be some form of official reception hed told them and when they stepped off the jet that was exactly what happened there were a couple of dozen military officers standing to stiff attention and a middleaged man in hugely decorated dressregalia stepped forward to greet them good afternoon the man said in stiff english welcome to alp de montez your royal highnesses do you wish to inspect the guard now no nick said before rose could open her mouth then he looked at rose we dont want to inspect the guard do we sweetheart sweetheart rose blinked and then she got the message what griswold had said on the plane was that these people were expecting a marriage of convenience a marriage designed to fleece the country somehow they had to change that image she swallowed then grabbed nicks hand and held tightly we might she said then i cant tell you how pleased we are to be here she said in a voice that carried across the tarmac to the assembled troops speaking in the italianfrench mix that was the countrys own dialect i loved this country as a child she said i needed to leave with my mother when i was fifteenyou know my parents were separatedand nick was orphaned early thats left us ignorant of what we should know of our heritage so youll need to excuse us as we find our feet youll have to teach us but were here to learn then she smiled sweetly at the greeting official who was looking stunned and just a little bit horrified thank you so much for meeting us she said and before he knew what she was about shed handed hoppy over to him then kissed the astounded man on both cheeks i was sure wed be welcome she said youre truly kind then before the official could say a word while nick stood on the tarmac with the warm evening breeze adding to his sense of unrealityeven though it was late spring it had been freezing back at heathrowrose grabbed his hand and towed him over to the assembled troops she smiled at the first soldier and asked his name before nick knew it they were working their way down the line greeting every soldier individually taking their hands and shaking them forcing them to lower their guns as they did and rose was giving each of them her very nicest smile by the time theyd finished nick was feeling gobsmacked maybe they all were the line didnt look nearly as formal and the stiff unsmiling faces were well trying not to smile but smiling for all that so who do we meet next she asked still beaming returning to the official and hoppy she took hoppy back from the stunned officer thanking him with a smile your limousines waiting to take you to the palace the man said stiffly i dont know your name rose said im chief of staff the man said but a name rose said gently smiling some more and the man stared at her like she was speaking gobbledegook im rose she said giving him an easy example this is nick sir madam yes but we have names too she said fixing him with a smile that took nick aback even further this wasnt some wilting violet this was a woman determined to make her point a woman starting her adventuring jean dupeaux the man muttered and she smiled some more its lovely to meet you jean if youre our chief of staff then i guess well see lots of you this is my dog hoppy are you coming with us in the limousine ino thats a shame she said brightly i guess well see you at the palace then does the driver know where to go of course he seemed offended im so sorry of course he does youll have to forgive us a lot as we learn our way round she told him i have so much to remember but dont worry were here for the long haul and well get it right in the end they didnt speak for the first couple of minutes in the limousine it was as if both needed to catch their breath certainly nick did what had just happened seemed extraordinary a salute of arms to start with and then roses performance griswold was right she said at last staring out the window at the passing scenery they were less than a mile from the airport travelling towards the nearby city but the towering snowcapped mountains were breathtaking in the fields beside the road the farmers were gathering in the hay forming bales in the way farmers had done for a thousand years it seems weve been made enemies before we even arrived she said slowly how did that happen maybe we should have expected it he said what else should they have expected the looks theyd been given by the troops before roses impromptu greeting session had been aloof and disdainful this was a tiny segment of the army and the army must be powerful where did the army come into this rose was looking as thoughtful as he was and there was a trace of fear behind her eyes hoppy was on her knee he wriggled off crossed the gap in the seat between them and put a paw tentatively on nicks knee he thinks you need a hug rose said i dont need a hug he said stunned i might she said diffidently im not sure thats wise right she said and lifted hoppy back into her arms and hugged him sorry why couldnt he have hugged her why did she have him so offbalance they were in trouble together it made sense to be able to give each other comfort but if he hugged her now dont go there we need to do some fast footwork he said trying desperately to move forward past the emotional rose we know nothing where the hell is erhard i was sure hed meet us she said his legal mind was trying to sort things things other than how close rose was sitting to him important stuff only he was having a huge amount of trouble persuading his mind to think past her she was messing with his equilibrium in a way he didnt understand think think back in london this succession had seemed reasonableeven sensible now it seemed fraught two people in a strange land threatening those in power maybe we need to bail out for a bit and rethink he said dubiously damn i didnt foresee this i had my people my people my colleagues im not an international lawyer for nothing they checked this place theres never been armed insurrection in any of the alp countries there didnt seem a threat but now im not going home rose said we might have to im not going home she said again and hugged hoppy tighter hoppy gave a doleful canine sighhe was obviously accustomed to being an emotional squeezebag i might be persuaded to treat hawaiian animals or something similar but no more in yorkshire whats wrong with yorkshire too much family she muttered alright if you want a career as a battery hen and by the way that includes you she said glaring as he gazed at her in astonishment i dont think i said but you try and protect me and i refuse to be responsible for my actions no matter that were getting marriedname only no family no ties and i want to get this place sorted right whats next and she looked so fierce that he held up his hands in mock surrender what a statement his desire to hug her should have stopped right there only for some dumb reason it intensified he had to fight to make himself agree sure he managed thats how i feel too or was it just so you know she said still glowering but even if i didnt feel like that i still wouldnt run yes i got concerned when i didnt hear from erhard this week and i was spooked when the press arrived but ive cut my ties now and im over it so move on well get some plans in place and do what erhard wanted now she looked so fierce that he smiled but he was thinking hard what lay ahead seemed much more of a challenge than it had seemed back home but maybe he like rose was glad to move on for different reasons she was leaving family he was leaving a vacuum no just boredom he wanted a challenge and it didnt hurt that hed face this challenge with rose beside him he just had to resist the desire tohug no what he really wanted to do was kiss her until her toes curled or his toes curled what he really needed on the other hand was a cold shower if he did anything so dumb shed slug him into the middle of next week we need to get meetings in place straight away he said slowly managing to think a bit further well get the armedforces chiefs to the palace let them know what we intend figure out where they stand we need to speak to each individual councillor so you will stay she said and he glanced at her in surprise for as long as it takes rose yes i promised and ill keep my word its onlyim aware that its me whos supposed to be sovereign she muttered but i dont have the skills i suspect neither of us have the skills but no one else does either so its fight through it or run youve said you wont run and neither will i thank you he smiled you know from all accounts prince consorts never had such a bad time of it in the past he said all that wheeling and dealing behind closed doors ill be the one wholl tell you whose head to chop off you do the dirty work and then you get the flack and not me oh great im truly noble he said and he managed to grin she tried not to smile she failed she looked enchanting he thought the more he looked at her the more enchanted he became she was still huddled in her oversized duffel coatnot because she needed its warmth he suspected but because she found the familiar smell of it comforting hoppy certainly did the little dog was huddling against her under her coat only his nose exposed in quivering anxiety me and my dog against the world i dont think thisll work if youre prince consort she said softly he thought about it for a moment thats what the whole idea is no its not i dont think we should be crown and deputy im sorry but hey you know im really not royal she said interrupting him my mother was married and then left to fend for herself my father married her on a whim tired of her within a year and then as far as i can tell never touched her again he went from scandal to scandal while my mother stayed in the castle and cared for the old prince there were visitors and i was born with red hair and ill not be judging her for it she must have been unbearably lonely she touched her flaming head and grinned so there you are i was born royal but im not really royal whereas youyour mother really was a princess yes but he was getting distracted by her hair but what its the way it has to work he said with difficulty its you whos in line for the throne but you want it she said thoughtfully youre aching to get in there and do stuff you cant do that if youre not a full partner i dont think you can devolve authority until you have it he said striving to keep it light i guess not she whispered and then her voice firmed a little i guess i have to take it on i can cope i have before he watched her face became more resolute david aiming his slingshot they were reaching the outskirts of the city now it was saturday at twilight the light just starting to fade where does everyone here go on a saturday night she asked suddenly and then as nick looked blank she reached forward and slid back the glass partitioning them from the driver if you and your family were wanting a fun night out tonight she said to the driver where would you go madame the driver said confused and she repeated her question whats a good local drinking place in the heart of the city she said maybe with a band playing is there somewhere like that the army officers use maison detre no not the army she said while nick stayed as confused as the driver you or the farmers we just saw where do most people go i live just two miles from here the man said dubiously its saturday night its harvest time and the weathers good the timehonoured local tradition at this time of year is to gather down at the river bank not far from here or at other picnic spots round the country he hesitated theres not the money for families to go to pubs any more taxes are terrible the army and the politicians use the restaurants and pubs but most of them well theyve closed for lack of patronage and down at the river thats where we go he said simply each district has its own meeting place we go there or we stay home but the young ones they go to the pictures and things if youre in a wellpaid job but there are few wellpaid jobs so if we wanted to meet the people maybe you could go on the television he said doubtfully we dont want to do that rose said not yet she visibly swallowed a gulp i dont think id be very good at television so what are you thinking nick said uneasily watching the set of her face this was a woman who having decided to do something went for it even facing television im not going back to yorkshire she said not for a lack of gumption on my part no ones making you yes but the main reason i can come here is that i have an imperative she said i have an imperative here but i also have an imperative back in yorkshire i havent told you what that imperative is but believe me facing a firing squad at dawn looks pretty good in comparison no we get proactive did you have to wear a suit did you have to wear a duffel coat a duffel coats more appropriate than what youre wearing she retorted lose the tie do you have a jacket in your baggage im not sure where our baggage is its being brought separately the driver said bemused watching them through the rearview mirror if we wanted to go to your picnic rose said slowly looking ahead and behind at their convoy there were twelve uniformed armyofficers in front of them on motor bikes there were twelve behind do you suppose theyd arrest us if we stopped down at the river madame we cant stop yes we can she said my orders are to take you straight to the palace and whose orders are those she asked and all of a sudden she was haughty the driver stared at her in astonishmentand so did nick then the eyes of the two men met a small moment of male empathy two male shrugs and the driver gave a small smile you want to go to our picnic we need to meet the people she said this is the fastest way to do that right i guess then our escort can come too but we dont have food for a picnic i wont be a freeloader the people will share im not going to my first picnic in alp de montez as a freeloader rose said my fiancé agrees with me do i said nick of course you dodarling she said now what can we do if i might make a suggestion the limousine driver was looking at her as if she had two heads so was nick suggest away she said if you were to produce say a keg or two of beerbeers expensive and rationed beers rationed she said incredulously do you have maybe a diners card i bet my fiancé does do you sir eh nick said getting more startled by the minute this was a seriously startling woman she grinned my fiancé will pay you she said erhard told me youre seriously rich im not but im working on it soon ill be a princess but im waiting on my first wages i need a loan of a keg until payday it was too much they were sitting in the back of a royal limousine escorted by armed troops heading to a palace with who knew what reception and she was calmly negotiating a loan of a keg or two of beer he chuckled the driver chuckled nick delved obediently into his wallet and produced his diners card so how will this help rose asked the driver the husband of my wifes cousin works as a delivery driver to one of the army hotels the driver said moving into the spirit of the thing with enthusiasm if i radio your card details he can organise a keg to be here within the hour two kegs nick said deciding he could be expansive too and lemonade for the kids a keg of lemonade i dont have a clue how it comes nick admitted well leave that to your wifes cousins husband tell him to bring what he thinks a gathering will need i guess you know the numbers though how we know we can trust you there are very few people in the higher echelons you can trust the driver said flatly then he smiled again but were not accustomed to seeing our royalty in overcoats that smell a little like the farmyard and while you were inspecting the troops griswold told me we might hope things are desperate here were willing to take a chance on you you wont get sacked if you deviate rose asked by the time our escort has time to respond well be there ill be following your direct orders maybe you organised this with erhard long since no not with me not with you rose said firmly the driver looked at her again for a long minute in the rearview mirror and then he gave a decisive nod he picked up his radio and spoke fast quoting nicks diners club card number ordering his supplies then he handed back nicks card thank you both he smiled at nick via the rearview mirror theres a jacket under the front seat you can borrow he told him its not as disreputable as your fiancées but it will have to do hold on please with a squeal of brakes the car turned at ninety degrees and proceeded calmly down to the river bank with nick wondering what hed got himself into and it wasnt just the situation that was startling him it was this woman beside him and how he was starting to react to her rose potential princess potential wife up until now hed hardly thought about the wife bit it hadnt seemed relevant now though when he should be thinking a thousand other things that was the word that was drifting around his head like a chink of light through clouds a tiny glimmer of possibility wife chapter six there had to be argument from their minders of course there did there was a moments peace before their escort of motor bikes reassembled veered off the highway and roared after them then the head of the squadjean dupeauxcame alongside their limousine and gestured angrily for the driver to pull over nicks errant thoughts were dragged back to the here and now with a vicious jolt as the bike nosed sharply in front of the car causing their driver to brake and veer onto the verge but not stop the driver was starting to look as determined as well as determined as rose the bike jerked back so it was driving alongside rose let down her window put out her head and yelled our drivers following our instructions monsieur dupeaux we just want to see the river you must pull over dupeaux shouted and rose smiled happily waved and closed the window what was the chief of staff doing riding motor bikes nick thought and then more nervously what is going on here dupeaux veered in front of the car again the driver skilfully pulled out and overtook him what the outcome would have been if theyd had to go further nick couldnt tell but they were already turning to where the cliffs along the riverbank formed what seemed almost a natural amphitheatre willows hung over the slow moving river there were ruins of some ancient castle high on the cliffs a few cars were parked under the trees but mostly there were horses and carts and people there was real poverty in this country nick thought horses and carts might look picturesque but these werent men and women using their horses and carts for pleasure these horses were workhorses and every single man and womanand even the adolescentslooked as if theyd spent a long hard day in the fields no luxury of going home to a long hot bath and a change of clothes but still theyd assembled to enjoy the evening the people turned as one at the arrival of the limousine with its trailing queue of motor bikes their jaws dropped in astonishment and then displeasure nick saw the moment their surprise turned to resentment as they recognised the coat of arms on the limousine as they realised what the outriders represented they shouldnt be here he thought his astute mind working things through fast if there was antagonism to royalty how would they react to the surprise visit of two rank outsiders but before he could stop her rose was out of the car he climbed out afterwards but was called back sir the driver sounded insistent he was handing him a shabby leatherjacket ill get it back from you some time he said diffidently just dont lose it and then he smiled by the way the lady said lose the tie lose the tie right he hauled his tie off undid a couple of buttons shrugged on the jacket and rounded the car to join rose hi she was saying as the people stared at her the uniformed motorbike riders were coming in now gathering in a cluster around the car but they didnt kill their engines the noise was overpowering and there were horses nick saw the danger kill the engines now he ordered but the damage had been done one of the horsesthe one nearest the bikeswas shifting sideways in its traces clearly panicked it reared once and then grounded backing its eyes were rolling nostrils flaring there was a child in the cart behind it no but rose had seen closer than nick she could get there faster she dumped hoppy unceremoniously on the ground and strode swiftly forward to grab the horses bridle she steadied it then tugged it sideways hauling its head around so it was forced to yield the force in its hindquarters even nick who scarcely knew one end of a horse from another could see this was an expert in one swift movement shed defused a potentially deadly situation hush she told the horse into the sudden stillness speaking in the local dialect quiet now hush then as the horse settled she spoke to the people around them im sorry i should have known thered be horses here i forgot the bikes would follow as the childs mother darted forward to retrieve her daughter from the cart rose took her time soothing the big horse scratching behind his ears whispering reassurance waiting until the flare of panic faded from his eyes nick could only watch entranced every moment he spent with this woman meant he saw another facet of her she was amazing she took all the time she needed to settle the big animal then handed the bridle over to his owner hoppy pawed at her leg in some indignation she picked him up and stroked him behind his ears as well she had the absolute attention of every person there im so sorry she told the people around them nick and i have just come from the airport im not sure if you know but im roseanitra i left here when i was fifteen but i was never able to leave the palace grounds very much before then so i dont know you this is my fiancé nikolai de montez son of the old princes daughter zia weve been told that we stand to inherit the throne were here to talk it through and we want to meet some of the locals dont we nick she turned and smiled at him and he walked forward until he was by her side it was what she seemed to want which suited him this was a woman to be proud of a wife to be proud of equal partners the thought was suddenly seductive for all sorts of reasons im a veterinary surgeon she told the assemblage tucking her hand confidingly in nicksa gesture of intimacy which jolted him still further so we should know better than to scare your animals this was just a whim to stop here you have no business being here dupeaux shouted these people dont want you that might have been a foolish thing to say nick decided watching the faces of the crowd around them rose looked a chit of a thing in her toobig jacket and holding her lame dog shed just quieted a massive horse she had the advantage of looking a bit of a stray herself dupeaux was big and uniformed and brusque authority personified get back in the car woman he snapped and there was a visible ripple of dissent leave these people be they dont want you here with one harsh order this man had made rose an underdog and from all hed seen so far rose wasnt anyones underdog erhard fritz told us that we were wanted here rose said gently but firmly stating something that was out of her control erhard said this country needed us we dont need royalty someone shouted from the back of the crowd and rose faltered time to lend a hand nick thought he couldnt stay being a complete wimp rose and i never thought there was any need for us to be in this country nick said loudly urgently speaking as rose had spoken in the native tongue you know we never thought wed inherit the throne we dont understand what your problems are but erhard came to find us hes shown us whats being done in your neighbouring countriesalp dazur and alp destella he says a sympathetic royalty could make that happen here we could organise things so the country could selfrule as a democracy erhards convinced us to try of course if were wrong if were truly not wanted then well go silence not a man woman or child moved behind them the troops shifted uneasily these riders were the same men whod greeted them at the airport rose had charmed them here shed done it again maybe roses grip on his fingers tightened it felt good he thought it feltright whats your dogs name a little boy called out from the front of the crowd and rose smiled hes hoppy because of his leg he can hop better than any dog i know he doesnt look like a royal dog i tried to get him to wear a tiara rose said and grinned but hoppy thought he looked like a sissy amazingly there was a ripple of laughter can he play with my dog the little boy asked he motioned to a halfgrown collie thin and straggly but wagging its disreputable tail with the air of a dog expecting a good time of course rose said and put hoppy down the two dogs eyed each other warily and then proceeded to sniff the most important part of their anatomy the shock and sullen resentment of the crowd was turning to smiles are you really a prince and princess someone called were the son and daughter of the old princes children nick replied we havent been in direct line to the throne so until we come into succession weve no title roseanitra is first in line to the throne before her sister julianna and i come after her if our claim to the throne succeeds then rose would be crown princess and id behe hesitated you know im not sure what id be mr crown prince someone called and there was more laughter crown consort someone else called youd be crown consort and earl de montez as well i think you already are theres no one else to inherit the title what about juliannas husband someone else called hes not royal someone else snapped no matter what airs he might give himself will you get back in the car dupeaux snapped and he sounded furious he took a step towards rose which might or might not have been menacing but suddenly nick was standing in front of rose he wasnt alone with his protective instincts in a flash there were half a dozen burly men between nick and the officer its you and your bullies who arent wanted here dupeaux someone called to the officer in charge and the mans face darkened in fury look this is a private party nick said speaking quickly knowing he had to deflect confrontation rose and i dont have a right to be here unasked weve ordered a couple of kegs of beer and a few other things to make the evening a bit more fun for you theyll be here any minute whether or not we stay no matter we just wanted to say hello now maybe we should leave but wed like you to stay and you can share our picnic someone called and ours and mine these men are our escort rose said taking courage again holding nicks hand tighter and smiling towards the men on bikes can they stay too no dupeaux snapped theyre on duty then isnt it lucky were not rose said and tugged nick forward to where an elderly lady had unpacked her basket on a rug on the grass are they chocolate éclairs my favourite she turned back to the officer and smiled her sweetest smile if you leave us the limousine well make our own way home thank you for escorting us so far dupeaux had no choice there were a couple of hundred people gathered here and more arriving every minute to use force would escalate the situation in a way he might not be able to control so he and his men disappeared in a roar of diesel engine that had the horses rearing again almost as soon as theyd gone a battered truck turned into the clearing two kegs of beer crates of lemonade and wine for the ladies the man driving the truck said pierre said you were ordering for a party so i took the liberty brilliant rose said beaming only the way she was still holding tight to nicks hand let nick know that underneath this outward show of bravado she was more nervous than he was but she wasnt letting on we have a party and a party they had it would have been a good party anyway nick thought as the evening wore on anyone who could play any sort of instrument had been dragged into the toetappingly good band the food seemed generous and plentifulgreat homecooking the beer and lemonade and wine flowed plentifully and rose worked the crowd actually they both did nick had been in enough international situations to know how to make smalltalk to ask the right questions to keep things flowing smoothly without treading on sensitivities hed been trained to do it rose did it naturally it almost felt as if he was back at work nick thought as he moved among the crowd but there was a huge difference here for whoever he spoke to in this gathering was trying desperately to find out about him to gauge his interest as being genuine or not and to discover whether rose felt the same he and rose had spent so little time together that he could only hope they were now presenting a united front they were forced apartthere were too many people wanting to talk to them to allow them to stay as a couplebut he was aware that people were talking easily to her laughing with her enjoying her presence as he was she had style he thought the sort of style that couldnt be taught theyd had people come into the firm whod lacked people skills and no amount of training had given it to them it required genuine interest in the person they were talking to it could never be feigned shes a lovely young woman an elderly man said to him and he realised that hed turned to glance at rose and maybe watched for longer than hed intended well why not the farmer was watching her too and his face showed he was as appreciative as nick was shes a damned sight more attractive than her sister the old man said and that brought nick up with a start there were factors here that he hadnt yet metthreats their escort had disappeared the powers that be would be uncomfortable with what was happening right now he thought what would they do please it was a young man just arrived on a shabby motorscooter he had a camera slung around his neck beside him was an intenselooking young woman with pad and pencil we had a call the young man said to say you were here lew and his friends run a newspaper the old man said its supposed to be illegal someone else said only the government cant shut it down because they dont charge it comes out as two or four pages every month with things the government dont want us to know someone else added so he and rose were interviewed a professional insightful interview that nick realised was sympathetic to the peoples cause the journalist wasnt interested so much in nick and rose as what they intended to do she was interested in them as a means to lessen the plight of the men and women around them as was everyone else as the interview progressed the crowd around them fell silent someone signalled the musicians to put aside their instruments every ear was tuned to what they were saying as nick outlined the changes in alp dazur and alp destellatheir neighbouring principalitiesand their hopes that the same changes could be made here there was a ripple of approval through the crowd finally the reporter tucked her notebook in her jacket smiling her approval interview over now for the photographs dance someone called thatll make a great photograph the musicians obediently struck up again but not in the lively folk music theyd been playing they played a slow waltz so the photographer would have time to focus once more rose was in his arms were doing okay he murmured into her hair as he led her round the grassy makeshift dancefloor no one else was dancingall eyes were on them i know she said but she sounded uncomfortable so whats the problem im thinkingit feels weird the whole situation dancing with you he paused lost his timing made a recovery the youth with the camera was moving around them taking shots from all angles it feels okay to me he said cautiously youre not a bad dancer thank you she said but she didnt smile so whats weird nothing you just said i know what i said she snapped and concentrated on the dance for a little but she didnt need to concentrate umrose yes she sounded seriously annoyed im not sure what ive done wrong here you havent done anything she said crossly thats the trouble right it doesnt make any sense to me either no there was a moments silence another circuit of the dance ground youre very good she said at last stiffly and he thought about that for a bit aware that it behoved him to tread cautiously at dancing he asked at last at this she said at the political bit i was thinking the same thing about you no but youre smooth she said you do it like a professional i dont know how much it means i dont understand its occurred to me that im not really sure who you are she said youre like a piece of veneered furniture polished on the outside but whats underneath wormwood he said promptly and felt her smile i dont think so but youre sosmooth and that worries you you see i find you incredibly attractive she said as dance conversation that was a real showstopper his feet faltered do mind your steps she said kindly the photographers documenting your every move ive never been told before that youre incredibly attractive i find that hard to believe he was back in step now and found himself smiling responding to her laughter its a guys line a pickup line she agreed thats why i thought i ought to say it youre trying to pick me up the opposite they turned right by the youth with the camera and she beamed into the lens it just occurred to me then watching you watching me dance no watching you talk to everyone watching you make people smile watching you make people believe that youre sincere and that you have their best interests at heart thats a problem he said cautiously and she nodded yes you want to tell me why because im starting to believe you and it doesnt help that you dance so well you want me to dance badly i dont know what i want all i know is that were being forced to spend time together as a couple and its starting to scare me and because youll be used to dating and im not im losing the thread here he said and she looked exasperated how they could be holding a personal conversation in the midst of such an audience was beyond him but rose was speaking to him as if they were completely alone as if whatever she was talking about had to be said urgently it had to be said now i met max in second year of vet school i was just turned twenty and my mother had just died max was my secondever boyfriend my first was a guy called robert who i fell for because he had a really cool sportscar but thats it my dating history so brief you could write it on a postage stamp im still not following he said cautiously you dont have to follow she said and sighed thats it i just want to make it clear that im not the least bit interested in a relationship so even if i do laugh at anything you say and even if i do find you attractive then its up to you to call a halt use a bucket of cold water if necessary but please lets not let this relationship go any further than it already has no he said blankly right yeah and i can tell you think im forward she said or scatty which is just as bad but i do need to say that im not the least bit interested in a relationship im not saying neverthatd be extreme and i might want to stick my toe in the water in later life but not for at least five years i want freedom absolute freedom just so i know he said yes for my information yes so no hitting on anyone then you can hit on anyone you like just not me but we are getting married right yes but thats got nothing to do with the rest of it im sorry she said suddenly contrite im sure you dont have the slightest intention of showing interest in me so i sound really dumb and really gauche and totally out of order so ill shut up umright so what was that all aboutthe chemistry between them the way she felt in his arms was she feeling this tooalmost overwhelmed maybe it was a good thing to bring it out in the open he thought cautiously he didnt want relationships either did he they danced on but they were now no longer alone the cameraman had finished and the makeshift dancefloor was filling as other couples joined them the last of the light had faded but lamps had been hung in the trees making the setting incredibly beautifulthe warmth of the latespring night the rippling of the river the moon rising over the cliffs incredibly romantic he should dance with someone else he thought as they danced on it was a bad thing only to dance with rose it went against everything shed just warned him about but she felt so so indescribable it was okay to dance with her he told himself almost fiercely she hadnt suggested changing partners she wasnt wanting a relationship so he could relax he could marry her with no fear that shed cling and he could hold her right now just as he was doing without her fearing that he was making a move he could savour the soft yielding curves of her body he could smell the citrusy fragrance of her hair he couldlose himself but he didnt of course he didnt this was a weird interlude before reality raised its ugly head againand here it was reality in the form of sirens many sirens the gentle lamplight overpowered by a scoremaybe a hundredvehicle lights motorbikes and cars a convoy armed men the music and the dancing stopped the men went swiftly to their horses and the women ushered their children behind them back to their individual modes of transport moving into protection mode a chauffeur climbed out of the leading cara magnificent rolls royceand ushered out its occupants a man in a severe armyuniform and a woman julianna there was enough about her to tell him this was roses sister but where rose looked what she wasa country vetjulianna was a blonde beauty a city sophisticate rose was still held loosely in his arms they were standing in the midst of the abandoned dance area he felt her stiffen as julianna appeared its julianna she confirmed for his benefit only id guess this must be jacques the big guns the opposition lets do this optimistically he murmured into her hair this is your sister go and tell her how exciting all this is dont preempt trouble by expecting it but trouble was already with them julianna rose said smiling taking his advice and moving forward with her hands outstretched in greeting she was forcing a warmth nick knew she was far from feeling julianna didnt smile the woman was magnificently groomed in cream linentrousers a cream silkblouse mostly hidden by a luxurious fur jacket and with magnificently groomed blonde hair caught into an elegant chignon as rose approached her julianna held out exquisitely manicured handsnot in welcome but as if to ward her off youre not welcome she said flatly and nick thought she sounded worried frightened even i dont want you here erhard said were very welcome rose said forcing her voice to stay light he said this country is in trouble and nick and i can help this is none of your business julianna snapped our father didnt want you here and neither do i jacques says youve entered the country illegally we entered this country on the royal jet which was appropriated by unprivileged persons julianna snapped jacques says you need to go back where you came from and me nick asked and stepped forward to hold rose gently by the arm in a gesture that was as protective as it was proprietary jacques moved then holding his wifes arm in a similar gesture to nicks but where nicks hold was gentle there was a hint of underlying violence in jacques grip he was a big man who looked accustomed to getting his own way both within his own household and without enough jacques said roughly the succession is already decided and any attempt by you to come here is seen as an attempt to undermine the throne we tried to stop the flight but erhardhe shrugged no matter his authority is at an end my people will hold you in protective custody until we can arrange for your deportation there was a shocked hush the crowd drew a little bit closer as if to better see what was happening two couples facing offa big man in a uniform designed to intimidate and his beautifully manicured wife and nick without a tie in the drivers borrowed jacket flushed from dancing rose in her faded jeans and a soft cotton shirt that was threadbare from too many washes her hair escaping from her braid a princess deportation you have no right to hold us in protective custody nick said lightly but with a hint of underlying strength my papers are in order as are those of rose theres no reason to hold us hey maybe its just my sisters way of being polite rose said standing so close to him she seemed to be using his body as support julianna she said forcing her voice to stay light its great to see you juliannas my sister she told the assemblage as if she was proud of the fact does protective custody mean youre promising to look after us julianna i julianna looked astounded you youre taking us to the palace rose asked would protective custody mean a palace nick asked it might rose said protection doesnt mean dungeons theres dungeons in the palace someone called your sister surely wouldnt put us in a dungeon nick said forcing his words to sound lightly amused thats hardly a family thing were not a very close family rose said sounding dubious look failing to send christmas cards hardly deserves dungeons nick said does it julianna im the princess julianna julianna said but she sounded worried and im going to be your brotherinlaw nick said sounding astonished surely we dont have to be formal in the family you dont want to call your sister princess roseanitra do you which youd have to if we wanted to be formal as shes just as much a princess as you are maybe even more as shes the crown princess whatever julianna and jacques had expected it wasnt this the conversation included the crowd there were cameras and the journalist was taking furious notes the journalist was backing into the crowd as she wrote and the crowd was closing in around her cutting her off from sight the photographer was still shooting and there were a few other cameras in view as well this was being documented whether jacques willed it or not and jacques didnt like it one bit this is a fiasco he yelled staring round him in impotent fury no its a picnic rose said clinging to nicks hand proprietorially these people have been really welcoming but if you have other plans for us take them jacques growled and the uniformed men moved in surrounding them as if ready to seize themor stop them escaping hey were coming julianna rose said still sounding amused theres no need for your men to make an effort on our behalf coming nick i think were expected to go in that car and before anyone could stop her shed tugged nick forward and slid into the rolls royce nick slid in beside her he was bemused but his mind worked fast and he was totally appreciative of what shed done with one swift movement shed given jacques and julianna an invidious choice they could haul rose and nick bodily from their car and toss them into one of the black cars that had been followingwhere theyd been clearly intended to go they could join them in the rolls intensifying the impression of family or they could use one of the black cars themselves nick sank into the soft leather of the rolls looked out and saw indecision on jacques face and fury this was no game they were playing for huge stakes here did rose have any idea what shed just done the stakes were upped about a millionfold jacques was being forced to state his case right now should he treat them as undignified prisoners when rose had just reminded the crowd that julianna was her sister should he treat them as equals by climbing into the car with them or should he follow calmly behind jacques looked apoplectic come julianna said uncertainly and tugged her husband forward towards the rolls no jacques said and sneered slapping his wifes hand away let them go take them straight to the palace as they said let them have their delusions of grandeur before they leave this place for ever and he slammed the rolls door after nick hoppy rose said urgently realising too late that her dog was still outside the car pleasehoppy she yelled take them away jacques growled and then as hoppy dived forward from where hed been snoozing after a surfeit of sausages jacques drew back his booted leg and kicked him hard drive he yelled and the car moved forward you realise were in trouble nick said theyd driven in silence for three minutes and it seemed he was the first to have found his voice again hoppys in trouble rose whispered sounding close to tears he kicked him yes but hes okay hed twisted and seen as theyd left the clearing the little boy with the collie pup was picking him up he was alright yes he said although he couldnt be sure he hates us rose said in a small voice and all the bravado had gone all of a sudden she looked small and vulnerable andafraid no not afraid just sad they both do juliannas my sister and they both do im not sure that julianna does jacques yes for what you represent which is a threat to his future you think we should go home now he smiled but it was a tiny smile what had they got themselves into there was no friendly driver here their driver was in the same uniform as jacques albeit with less bars on his sleeve he looked grim and businesslike and there was no way they could talk to him through the sealed glasspartition the car was speeding northward into the city nick glanced behind them to see a stream of official cars black ones there were outriders on motorcycles yorkshires looking good he confessed but at that rose firmed and looked behind them and out at the outriders and she set her face no no it doesnt hell how bad was it you ever delivered a calf in a sleet storm in yorkshire in february umno dungeons are okay she said she took a deep breath theyre a sight better than being a breeding mare a breeding mare never mind she said flatly that which doesnt kill us makes us stronger my foster mother used to say that about toothache he muttered and im dead scared that whats in front of us isnt toothache hey youre not supposed to scare me she said still subdued but trying to sound indignant youre the diplomat talk your way out of this im not exactly sure thats possible he said i cant talk us out of this rolls lets see where they put us next before we test my talking powers she subsided back against the leather cushions her behavior back at the river had been brilliant he thought yes he was supposed to be the diplomat but her diplomacyand sheer effrontery in staring her sister and brotherinlaw downhad been amazing but she was paying for it now reaction was starting to set in her face had paled and when he glanced at her hands he saw she was clenching them together to stop them shaking he swore and moved across and tugged her against him she froze wewere not playacting now she muttered you mean i dont have to act like your husband no he said grimly but i do have to act like were two people in trouble and i should have known something like this would happen how should you have known im a big boy i just gave erhard the benefit of the doubthe said there wouldnt be major problems and i of course there would be major problems she said astounded were trying to wrest the throne then she paused but you arent thinking major problems in the way im thinking major problems are you major problems to me are being escorted to the airport and told to leave i guess there are more major problems than that like imprisonment yes she didnt relax but he felt her body edge closer to his gaining comfort in the nearness of him as indeed he was gaining comfort from her you think someone will look after hoppy she whispered in a small voice of course they will not jacques men no but there were people sympathetic to our cause im sure theyll take care of him but hes been kicked hell be okay he muttered and found his fingers had clenched into fists to kick this womans dog and his reaction was for hoppy too he thought with a start how had that happened early in life nick had learned to be independent his foster brothers were like himtaught early to be loners ruby their foster mother had done everything in her power to teach them to love and maybe they did love her but to extend that loving nick had never really thought of it until hed met rose and here he was realising that after only hours acquaintance hed go to quite some trouble to make sure hoppy was safe for hoppys sake just for the way the dumb dog had wriggled his tail in ecstasy when dinner had arrived on the plane then as hed realised the two plates were meant for rose and nick hed transformed crouching low on his haunches covering his nose with his front paws and then looking mournfully overa lost orphan dog who no one had fed for the last month but far too polite to askuntil griswold had brought him his own steak youre smiling rose said staring at him and he brought himself back to the present with a start they were being hauled off to goodness knew where and he was thinking about a dog i was thinking that if anyone can survive hoppy will yeah she agreed and managed a rueful smile in return i guess im sure of it you think maybe we should worry about us first maybe itd be sensible she was huddled against him and he welcomed her warmth he wanted to hug her closer hold her tight but he wasnt sure how shed take it he thought back to the words shed spoken while theyd been dancing no more relationships like him so they were fine so youre thinking maybe firing squad at dawn she asked in a tone that said she suspected the direction his thoughts were taking and it was time he got back to matters of import like firing squads right but at least he could reassure her there rose they cant he said quelling the sudden urge to kiss her lightlyjust as a reassurance but she was withdrawing moving slightly away from him as she regained control and so must he these people arent criminals he told her the people in charge here are out for their own gain but to bankrupt the country and leave themselves nowhere to run would defeat their purpose every member of the council has homes in places like the south of france or capri or well places where they can enjoy swanning round with their wealth if we were to disappear without trace theyd be international criminals she thought that through you checked i checked he said and i do work for a huge international lawfirm im not too keen on the assassination bit but opinion was unanimous that wed be safe so lets not worry and see where they take us to the palace she said trying to sound hopeful fivestar luxury coming up he said and grinned lets count on it chapter seven they were indeed going to the palace the car pulled up in the forecourt of a building that brought roses memories flooding back the grand palace of the royal family of alp de montez id forgotten it was so grand rose whispered staring up at gleaming white turrets battlements fountains in the forecourt two stories high marble steps leading to an entrance that took up an area the size of a tennis court my mother was never given an independent allowance so here we stayed i was tutored here and we hardly left the place but id forgotten it looked like something out of a fairy tale could she really be a princess and then the car door was hauled open by men in uniform and the fairy tale evaporated like the bursting of a bubble out someone snapped and a hand grabbed her arm and tugged so hard she fell out onto the gravel but she had a protector in seconds nick was on her side of the car lifting her to her feet pushing the uniformed thugs aside as if it was he who was in charge and not these people he set rose firmly before him and placed a hand strongly on each shoulder he smiled at her a were in this together smile and then he faced jacques the black car that had drawn up right behind them had disgorged jacques and his lady julianna if you lay a finger on the princess rose youll be facing enquiries from the international community nick said in a carrying commanding voice he must have perfected in years of work as a lawyer now he deepened his voice making it louder as if wanting to carry his words as far as possible princess roseanitra and inikolai de montezhave been escorted to the imperial castle of alp de montez against our will he said strongly loudly to the world at large the date isthe time iswere being held in custody by jacques and julianna de montez jacques and julianna are here right now in my sight with direct authority over the people holding us what was he doing at any moment my mobile phone will be taken from me he continued i will then stop transmitting but this message is recorded blake you know what to do there was a moments taut stillnessand then a roar of fury from jacques as he realised what nick had just done the man whod done the talking back at the river and at the airportdupeauxsnapped a curt order nick was summarily searched and a mobile phone tugged from his shirt pocket its still transmitting nick said blandly as dupeaux handed it to jacques again he raised his voice the phones been forcibly removed from me jacques threw the phone on the ground and ground it with his heel id guess its stopped transmitting now nick said and smiled tugging rose tight against him but its been transmitting to my foster brother blake partner in the international lawfirm goodman stern and haddock i commenced recording back at the river and what i just said has been transmitted as well if blakeand my friends at almost every international embassy in londondont hear from us soon theyll know where to look wouldnt you say he smiled again but jacques wasnt smiling take them away he snapped staring down at the ruined phone as if it was a live scorpion butjulianna julianna rose asked turning to her sister julianna seemed almost stunned with what was happening surely the transmission thing hadnt been necessary surely in this day and age youre threatening us julianna whispered and her face was white with shock youre threatening this country rose said were not jacques isnt ask the hard questions julia rose told her but she had to yell her last two words over her shoulder they were being hustled away toa dungeon not quite they passed through three thick doors hustled so fast they hardly had time to be aware of their surroundings then they were unceremoniously shoved through a final door and the clang of metal against stone echoed solidly as they were left alone breathless with shock rose stared around her in dismay by this time shed almost been expecting to see a torture chamber shed never seen such a thing when she was a child but circumstances now made her fear the worst it wasnt a dungeon not even close it was an austere room whitewashed with a concrete floor and she recognised it as one of a number of windowless storerooms under the castle two single beds were simply made with white coverlets a small wool mat lay between each bed a solitary concession to comfort through a door on the other side of the room she could see simple bathroom facilities austere but not scary so much for me wanting to be a princess with tiaras and everything she whispered and she couldnt keep her voice steady rose its alright its still better than yorkshire nick was right this was her choice she told herself thered had to be some imperative to give her the moral strength to walk away from maxs life well this was surely a moral imperative and a physical imperative she couldnt return if she tried she touched the door tentatively putting pressure on the handle its locked nick said unnecessarily i guessed hell rose its okay she whispered would you mind very much if i hugged you nick asked i you see i dont much like enclosed places he confessed i think im claustrophobic you think i need a hug he said and he turned and took her into his arms he was claustrophobic she didnt believe it for a minute he was just saying it because he thought she needed a hug herself he was absolutely right this was deeply deeply scary and where where was hoppy she let herself be drawn against him again she was getting almost accustomed to it she thought as she let him tug her into his arms and then she forgot to think he needed a hug to drive away fear well maybe he was right at that for a hug from this man did drive away fear it drove away everything the strength of him the sheer arrant maleness of himthis man had a reputation as a womaniser and she was starting to see why what woman wouldnt react to nikolai de montez exactly as she was reacting now he was gorgeous and she was afraid for all her bravado for all his assurances of her longterm safety shed seen the look on jacques face and it had been hatred she was being held a prisoner shed lost hoppy the last was the worst she shuddered and he tugged her closer his fingers raking her hair with gentle reassurance hey its okay its okay rose this is just a hiccup well get out of here youll see its you whos supposed to be afraid she retorted but she didnt pull away not when he was raking her hair just as it should be raked someone will take care of hoppy he said and she froze against him im a vet she whispered into the muffling anonymity of his shoulder hoppys had a couple of his lives already i shouldnt care so much if you didnt care so much you wouldnt be you he told her did you have to stay with your inlaws for so long she frowned but she was frowning against the warmth and strength of his shoulder she had no intention of pulling away just yet whats that got to do with the price of fish she managed and she felt rather than saw him smile nothing but were in prison we might as well fill the time socially by cuddling and talking he said gravely saving me from claustrophobia youre not really claustrophobic let go of me and ill start climbing walls and hollering you want to see a grown man turn into a caged animal she smiled but she did manage to pull away just a little a lock of his hair had fallen over his eyes he did look anxious but there was a hint of laughter behind his dark eyes that belied the anxiety he was expressing this man was dangerous she told herself this whole situation was dangerous but the most dangerous thing of all was that she was locked in a single cell with nick youre on your own she said broke away and went to sit on the far bunk she sat with the expectation that thered be a bit of spring in the bed there wasnt her backside hit with a solid thud ouch nick said seeing the way her body reacted hard as nails then as he made to sit beside her she slid along further so the area hed attempted to sit on was blocked bounce on your own bed what fun is that there isnt any fun in whats happening lets assume there is he said he sat down on the other bed seemingly obedient and smiled at her with a smile that wasnt the least bit obedient just to stop me being claustrophobic cut it out with the claustrophobia she told him telling someone to cut it out isnt exactly a tried and true therapeutic approach to the problem whereas my ideadistractionis much more likely to work so how long do you think theyll keep us here she demanded and he shrugged this is unknown territory rose his voice was suddenly serious but weve done all we can weve presented our case to as many people as we could as long as that message isnt able to be suppressed then things will happen erhard said this country has been suppressed for so long that its a powder keg waiting to blow with us in the middle no because were an alternative to blowing he said still serious the people here dont want anarchyyou just have to look at how long theyve put up with dreadful rulers to see that so with us they dont have to change the status quo all they have to do is insist on the application of the law so how are they going to do thatask julianna and jacques politely to let us take over i have no idea youve gone into this as blindly as i have maybe not quite he admitted i did have the reassurance of almost everyone else on the staff and my brother your brother she said thinking things through and not able to work it out i have six fosterbrothers he told her one of whom is blake whos in the same law firm as i am he was on the other end of the telephone if in doubt ring and ill recordthats what he told me as we left i did so everything weve said since we landed has been recorded so blake will come with a battalion of armed sas agents it wont come to that are you sure no he admitted and blake doesnt have an army does he um no and my dogs wandering the country friendless he wont be i think im going to bed she said giving her hard bed another tentative poke my conversation with you is getting me nowhere youll sleep its almost midnight she said so maybe i will you dont think if we asked nicely they might give us our luggage um you dont know that either she said and sighed and then brightened hey but im set youre set she tugged off her duffel coat and foraged in an inner pocket then triumphantly produced a batteredlooking toothbrush and a halfempty tube of toothpaste she held it up like it was the crown jewels bet highflying lawyers dont carry toothpaste on their persons she said smugly umno can i ask why i keep getting stuck she told him ill go to a calving and itll be four in the morning and as i finish the farmer will say can i hang around until his pig farrows or his neighbours cow calves its too far to go home so i kip on the couch and keep going hence the toothpaste she smiled ill lend you toothpaste but youll have to use your finger cos im not sharing toothbrushes even if we are going to be married which im starting to seriously doubt and she smiled took herself to the bathroom and closed the door behind her she slept he was quite frankly astonished to have the ability to close her eyes and sleepit was a gift he wished he had it even as a kid hed never been able to sleep bad things happened when you slept where had that come from the weird background of his past where his mother was a shadowy figure moving in and out as lifes events lurched around her she was a frightened kid ruby had told him when he was old enough to respond to his foster mothers deep concerns about his nightmareswhere people had come and gone in the dark and sometimes his mother had wept sometimes shed disappeared with the shadows and when hed woken she wasnt there your mother had nightmares of her own ruby had told him they didnt let her grow up properly the trick isthe thing we have to dois to take charge of your nightmares and see if we can find you a way to live through them she was a wise woman ruby his one true thing he and his six fosterbrothers had been blessed by her taking charge of their shattered lives ruby had been sensible enough to know he could never escape completely from the nightmares just learn to live around them so dredging up a ruby lesson from the past he didnt try to sleep now he lay and watched the ceiling as hed lain and watched the ceiling countless nights in his past not trying to sleep just letting his thoughts go where they would but the ceiling wasnt interesting there was a light on through the other side of their prisons thick doors and he could see faintly by the chink of light it permitted in he could watch rose brave he thought brave and lonely but so practical so accustomed to moving through grief shed lost her dog this day he knew already how much hoppy meant to her but had she wept or made a fuss there was nothing she could do about it hed been watching her eyes as shed spoken of hoppy and he knew how much it had hurt how much shed wanted to be out looking but there was nothing to be done so a fuss hadnt been made there was nothing to do so shed settled for sleep she was some woman a woman in a million like ruby ruby would love her he thought and then thought maybe just maybe he should have told ruby more of what was happening hed described this marriage to his foster mother as a political move nothing more shed been horrified for she wanted so much more for her beloved sons maybe ruby was wiser than he was he thought ruefully for there was nothing political about how he was thinking of rose he watched on an hour two this place was cold theyd been given one blanket each he was still wearing all his clothes bar his shoes the room was chill and getting colder im cold rose said into the silence and he jumped about a foot i thought you were asleep i was she said but i just woke up one blanket isnt going to cut it youve got your duffel coat i have she agreed equably so my top half is cosy my bottom half is jealous do you only have one blanket iyes could i trust you if i said you were welcome to share my bed that took his breath away youre proposing we sleep together he asked cautiously not in the metaphoric sense she said lightly in the literal sense you mean sleep as in sleep take it or leave it she said its a onceinalifetime offer never knock a lady back he said and two seconds later he was spreading his blanket over her and then diving under the covers as well i have another suggestion she said before he could attempt to settle which is my feet are freezing she said weve both got jackets on if i spread my nice woolly duffel over our feet you could put our limousine drivers jacket over our tops note that this is a major concession on my part she said before he could move because my duffel is very very warm and your leather jacket wont be nearly as warm not to mention that its really been lent to both of us so i could be within my rights to keep my duffel just for me but insist that your leather jacket goes over our feet but im magnanimous she said in a truly magnanimous voice he chuckled they spent a convivial couple of minutes arranging their bed two blankets the duffel spreadeagled over the bottom half the leather jacket over the top then they were both under she was in her jeans and a cotton shirt he was in his trousers and linen shirt his tie was still in his pocket sleeping in her jeans would be uncomfortable they now had sufficient coverings that taking off their outer clothes would be sensible but he wasnt about to suggest it the bed was too narrow for them to lie apart their bodies touched side by side he lay rigid this was impossible they were two mature people and this is crazy she said were never going to sleep like this so what do you suppose we do about it relax she said if i lie on my side and you lie on the same side youll curve round me and keep me warm im a widow i know ii guess he said doubtfully trying to figure how this could stay a nice platonic sharing of bedsand she was so close and youre not a widower but im betting you know as well that people can sleep together without wanting sex she said so stop lying there like youre standing at attention only lying down relax yes maam thats better she said and he felt rather than saw her smile as she turned on her side waited patiently for him to do the same and then wriggled until her spine was curved against his chest unbidden his arms came round to hold her she stiffenedjust for a momentand then she relaxed again see its not just me coming up with the ideas she said excellent now relax and go to sleep unless youre worried about being taken out at dawn and shot but we have blake to stop that happening right um right then what else is there to worry about she said apart from hoppy and theres nothing i can do about him until they let us out of here so we might as well sleep sleep yes maam and he did he closed his eyes and when he opened them again to his unutterable astonishment hed slept for hours rose was still deeply asleep curled against his breast as if she belonged there he was still holding her his left arm underneath her tugging her tight against him even in sleep his right arm was resting lightly on her shoulder he had to move slightly to see his watch but she didnt stir she must have been exhausted he thought damn he should have researched her background further he wanted to know he did know hed never lain with a woman like this never she felt different amazing excitingwarm andas if she belonged she did belong he thought with a sure knowledge starting deep within it had started that first night hed met her and it had grown deeper last night as hed watched her work the crowd with an intuitive empathy hed never seen in his years of working in the international legal community then last night tossed into prison with a man she hardly knew losing a dog she obviously loved deeply thrown into an uncertain future shed been brave beyond belief shed been upbeat and courageous laughing whenever she could refusing to be intimidated treating the situation as something to be faced with optimism she stirred a fraction in his arms and his hold on her tightened this woman was affianced to be his wife he thought with something approaching incredulity his wife in name only but now things had changed what was inside him had changed had he fallen in love the thought was so startling that he must have moved or gaspedor maybe she could feel the sheer force of what he was thinking she lay motionless in his arms but he could feel that she was awake he didnt speak letting her make the first move if she wanted to wake up slowly well shed earned the right shed earned the right to do whatever she wanted he thought rose whats the time she whispered and he knew she didnt want this time to stop seven do you think theyll feed us as if on cue the door swung open a tray was put on the floor and shoved forward and the door was slammed shut before they could see who their jailer was i guess the answer to that is yes he said and as she stirred he reluctantly released her and sat up it was unbelievable what he was feeling about her right now his world had changed dont look like that she said suddenly getting businesslike sliding to the end of the bed so she could get out without pushing past him like what i dont know i dont know what youre thinking and i dont intend to ask she said briskly i bags the bathroom first and dont you dare eat all the toast there wasnt toast there was cereal and longlife milk tepid water and instant coffee not what i had in mind when i decided to be a princess again rose muttered is this a good time to tell you im addicted to good coffee and if im deprived im scary me too nick said so what do we do now rose asked finishing her coffee resolutely even though wrinkling her nose in distaste i guess we wait how long do you reckon twenty years theyll have to give us a pack of cards then rose said seemingly unperturbed otherwise ill write a letter to the united nations he smiled things firmed even further they sat down to wait if anyone had told rose that shed tell her complete life story to a man shed met once almost a month ago she would have said they were crazy nuts she wasnt an extrovert shed married max but even max had needed time to coax her out of her shell finally shed learned to trust him but that trust had landed her into a mess over her head her privacy had become the shared concern of maxs family everything she told him his family had known too as well as the whole village so shed learned once more to shut up yet here she was handing out private information like it was free why maybe it was because nick didnt really want it she told herself he was asking because he was bored and there was nothing else to do when this whole fiasco was over no matter how it ended hed head back to his city lawfirm and shed be isolated just as she desperately wanted so he was asking questions and there was no pack of cards and she didnt want to spend time thinking about all the various fates in store for someone who tried to take the crownso what was a girl to do but answer his questions honestly and ask questions herself and pretend to be interested in the answers actually she was interested and that was the problem it was a little like a game of snap she thought theyd both had bleak childhoodstheir legacy from their connection to this illfated royal family theyd learned to be independent which was only a tiny factor in their shared passions do you play tennis no but i love hockey i was hopeless as i didnt play until i got to england but i love it now i still play or until last week i played youre kidding i played hockey for my university forward centreforward mostly you mostly right fullforward she said i hit harder to the left if we had a couple of sticks now we could have a battle if were stuck in this place much longer we could pull the bed apart and use the planks she said so lets delay the hockey match till tomorrow meanwhile what about ice cream whats your favourite flavour im a chocolate man with choc chips ugh no i like my chocolate melted in triple or quadruplestrength chocolate and no crunchy bits to deflect the taste yum she said feeling suddenly hungry when do you reckon lunch will arrive i think our chances of ice cream for lunch are minimal what about swimming five strokes and then i go under she said this place never ran to a swimming pool maybe it has one now heres hoping what about you my foster mothers cottage just outside sydney had a dam in the back paddock we all had to learn to swim across it before we were allowed out of rubys sight so ruby taught you ruby taught me everything lucky you she said for having a foster mother ii guess sorry dumb comment no its okay but youwhen we get to live in this luxurious palace with an olympicsized swimming pool then we buy me some floaties and dont let photographers near nick what do you think is happening outside i dont know theyd been aware of the noise since just after breakfast at first it had sounded like a faint faroff rumble as if maybe they were not too far away from a sports pavilion it wasnt so much individual soundmore a steady murmur slowly building but it was building in the last few minutes it had become so close they could hear individual voices its well over time for lunch she said nervously maybe we should complain lets not nick said i have a feeling whoevers on lunch duty might be distracted they listened for a while longer the shouts became louder whoever it was they werent going away how are you at singing nick asked and rose thought about singing and then thought no this sound was getting too loud to permit distraction it was definitely loud it was definitely close you know if this is a revolution the ageold way to depose monarchy is to do a bit of head chopping she whispered the russians were the last he said obviously distracted too but royaltys been ousted efficiently since with nary a bruised neck to show for it look at the womens magazines there are prince and princesses all over the place minus thrones but necks nicely intact nick i know he said hed crossed to the door trying hard to hear individual noises from the background din but thered been need in her voice shed heard it but there wasnt anything she could do about it this was supposed to be an adventure how could it suddenly have got so serious and where was julianna her sister and hoppy nick she said again not even trying to disguise her need this time and he reacted in three long strides hed crossed the room and hugged her close were in this together he whispered and his lips brushed the top of her hair that should make her feel safer it didsort of it made her feel as if she could face anything with his arms around her for support but that was scary all by itself the feeling that she was starting to depend on him this man was an international businessmana jetsetter whod agreed to a marriage of convenience what had she done a normal woman would have listened to erhards proposition and treated him like a very polite madman to leave her home and come halfway across europe to claim a throneto threaten her sister to involve herself in a power struggle where she had no idea who the players were much less how to deal with themit was like shed stepped into a james bond movie but it was real shed guessed thered be risks at some subliminal level shed figured that this couldnt be as easy as erhard had suggestedarrive here say move over to julianna and become a princess yet things had been closing in on her so tightly at home that shed come regardless and the really frightening thing now was that although she should be terrified of outside factorslike a crowd of what sounded like thousands gathering in the castle surroundsshe hugged tight to this man and she still thought that it was okay better to go down fighting with this man by her side than to stay for ever in yorkshire and keep calmly on living maxs life were in this together he whispered into her hair and that was terrifying as well shed have to do something about it he was holding her as if he loved her as if he loved her she hadnt slashed one set of silver chains to be caught by another she told herself fiercely no more emotional baggage ever except right now she couldnt pull away from nicks arms right now she lacked the strength to be independent so she held on while the noise from outside grew to an earshattering roar there was a sudden burst of gunfire and that made her cling tighter and it made nick hold her closer what was happeninga revolution outside their prison door what what the gunfire stopped as abruptly as it had started there was a sudden lull and then a vast roaring cheer of approval it went on and on but finally it grew muted the roar subsided and sounds of confusion took its place people yelling individual voices growing closer was this what war was like rose had stopped thinking about how close she was holding nick if he tried to pull away now shed fight him and by the feel of his arms he was feeling exactly the same as she was the shouts grew louder people yelling to each other jubilant yells but why jubilant they stared at the locked door as if it was a time bomb the minutes ticked by and then a shout of approval from just through the door mens voices shouting demanding the sound of a key in the lock the door swung inward and a crowd of people stood in the doorway facing them was the earnest young reporter whod interviewed them the night before behind her was the cameraman his camera raised over his head flash flaring and pushing through was a childthe boy with the scraggy collie from the night before there was a man holding the child by the shoulders trying to make him stay back a little but he was still pushing through let him through the man said earnestly as the door swung wider still and people started surging in the boy has the ladys dog he pushed hard the reporter gave way and the child burst into the room he was holding out hoppy rose gasped and then she smiled hoppy she said and knelt and held out her arms oh hoppy i might have known id be rescued by a dog chapter eight her wedding day dawned as the day most brides dream of it was a perfect spring day when the maid pushed back the drapes she turned to rose and she beamed her approval happy is the bride who the sun shines on yeah rose groaned and thrust back her covers revealing hoppy this was a huge and scary palace and hoppy had decided his mistress needed round the clock protection there really was no need of it the murmurings of dissent had grown to a fullthroated roar the night of their arrival the population had arrived at the castle to voice their dissent hundreds had turned to thousands thered been one burst of gunfire over the head of the crowd to try and stem the rush but theyd still kept coming jacques and julianna had disappeared their heavies with them only agreeing because they were forced to that the succession be decided by the international panel the panel had yet to meet but there seemed little chance that erhard would be proved wrong as long as this marriage took place the throne would go to rose was it too good to be true maybe rose was still uneasy as was nick but there was nothing that could be done but continue what theyd planned a wedding today prince nikolai breakfasted before you maam the maid said beaming romantically for a groom to see the bride before the ceremony is bad luck well we wouldnt want that rose thought not now for this was going exactly as planned nick would marry her today the succession would be organized nick would be free to leave her and return to his career so why wasnt she happy it was justwell living happily ever after as reigning sovereign was starting to feel a bit empty what would she do the hairdresser will be here in an hour the maid told her and your dress will be ready at twelve photographers at two see that was the problem she hadnt factored in the princess stuff nothing to do but reign without nick her mother had been a royal bride and shed been isolated for ever was that what she was condemning herself to yeah butyeah but i wanted to be by myself she told hoppy as the maid left but hoppy gave her a quizzical look leaped off the bed and trotted to the bedroom door theyd been here only a week but already hoppy knew and approved of her routine breakfast with nick a couple of hours in the office working through the reams of paperwork trying to get her head around stuff that nick understood better than she did but he wouldnt be here for ever to help her then maybe a long hike in the woods with nick a swim with nickyes as the old prince had lost authority his son had installed a pool a magnificent pool nick was teaching her and already she could dogpaddle then maybe a picnic then dinner and conversation long into the night and then bed alone he is going to be your husband a little voice had been saying that over and over to her in the past week it wouldnt hurt to but it would hurt im getting the happyeverafter without the prince rose told her dog firmly stifling the doubts and the last step i have to take before i can start my happyeverafter is to marry so get on with it he stood alone at the end of the aisle of the palace chapel this chapel was no grand architectural statement unlike the rest of the palace it had been built with lovemaking it a place where humans could seek sanctuary from troubles surrounding them it seemed almost intimate apart from the crowd of dignitaries filling the chapel to almost bursting and the television camera broadcasting their union to the world rose entered the churchand she paused up until now it had seemed a dream an escape shed been running from a situation that had threatened to overwhelm her from the time shed walked in to the restaurant five weeks ago things had moved in fast motion a blur of things that had had to be done organisation the chaos of arriving here the fuss associated with this royal wedding this dress alone the royal dressmakers had spent hour upon hour with the heirloom wedding gown altering the fragile lace fitting it so that it seemed like a second skin the people wanted a fuss the people were desperate for a royal bride thats what shed been told over and over since she and nick had been let out of their underground prison the news that you are here has inspired the country as nothing else could a clean sweep without bloodshedoh my dear how wonderful and you and prince nikolaiyoure such a romantic couple there wont be a dry eye in the country shed blocked that comment expressed by the chief dressmaker but seemingly echoing the sentiments of the populace but now as the organ was swelling into the first chords of the bridal march she paused and took a breath what was she doing the last time shed heard this music shed been in a tiny church in yorkshire and max had been waiting for her now nick was waiting for her the whole sweet trap and it rose up to catch her she caught her breath in panic her feet refused to move nick was at the end of the aisle but he was a blur seen through misting eyes too far away to see her panic too far away to help an elderly man rose from the pew beside the door he placed a hand on her arm and she turned in shock erhard she hadnt seen him for five weeks shed been told he was convalescing from illness hed made a couple of organisational phone calls but hed stayed away she and nick had both worried but hed refused to let them see him for him to be here now seemed almost magic hed shrunk a little but in other ways hed expanded he was wearing full military uniform tassels and braid everywhere a dress sword and he was smiling nikolai isnt the same as max he said softly and his grip on her arm was surprisingly strong you know that she looked into his face for a minute and he met her look unflinching how had he known hes waiting for you he said she turned to look towards nick panic cleared nick was concerned she could see that even from here he was watching waiting but there was a slight furrow in his brow that said he knew she was troubled how did he know that how could he tell that from here and how could she know that he knew he looked fabulous he was wearing the same uniform as erhard rich deep deep blue with red and gold braid tassels a golden sash slashing across his chest and a dress sword hung by his side nikolai de montez a prince coming home he looked the part he should be sovereign and not me she thought starting to feel hysterical he looked fabulous he looked royal he looked so far apart from her world that she felt giddy the whole chapel was waiting for her to start walking to go to her bridegroom but erhards pressure on her arm wasnt insistenthe was waiting for her to decide letting her take her time nikolai was waiting and then nick smiled he stooped and lifted something from the floor hoppy shed left hoppy in the care of one of the palace gardeners the little dog had made friends of everyone here so much so that nick had suggested the reason for the countrys insurrection was that jacques had kicked the dog it was a tiny thing in the scheme of things but it had been caught on camera and jacques had not been seen in public since hoppy however had been in demand for every photo call there had been the request and the little dog rose had thought he had no place here today in this most formal of ceremonies but nick obviously had had other ideas the furrow of worry had disappeared from nicks brow he was smiling hoppy was tucked under his arm and then maybe lest she thought it was some sort of enticement for her to come to him nick set the little dog on his three feet hed been washed and brushed until he shone he looked almost regal there was a gold and blue riband stretched around his chest matching nicks to perfection he waved his tail like a flag seemingly aware that the eyes of the world were upon him lapping up the attention go to rose nick said the bridal march was still playing hoppy looked up at nick enquiringly then gazed around the church while all the dignitaries officials and palace staff held their collective breath hoppy had watched her dress he knew that this confection of whiteandcream lace and ribbon was his mistress his disreputable tail gave another happy wag and he set off down the aisle at full tilt hopalong hoppy rose giggled and bent down to greet him hoppy reached her and bounded up into her arms wriggling all over she gathered him to her then straightened and looked ahead at nick he was still smiling and suddenly this was as far as it was possible to be from that longago wedding to max she remembered itthe tiny church in yorkshire max waiting looking thin and gaunt and anxious and his parents sitting by him fretting that everything was as it should be the brides guests sat on the left the grooms on the right that was the way it should be and maxs mother had strictly enforced it are you maxs friend shed directed the ushers to ask and if the friend said yes regardless of the fact that she and max shared many friends then theyd been directed to the right as well so shed walked into the church and thered been three lone stragglers friends whod defied her motherinlaws rules and sat on her side regardless it had been maxs wedding it had been nothing to do with her it had been maxs life but here both sides of the church were crowded even if it was with strangers erhard was beside her calmly smiling giving her all the time in the world hoppy was trying to lick her face nick was smiling this was her life that flash of certainty shed had when erhard had first put this proposition to her when shed sat across the dinner table from nick and looked at the way hed talked to erhard courteous kind sensitive there were no strings here this was no golden net waiting to catch her hold her as it had held her mother nick was doing this to free this country sure hed kissed and held her and hed been her rock during the past few days but there were no conditions she could marry him and hed walk away and leave her to it he was watching her hopeful but uncertain the whole church was watching her uncertainly what was she doing having second thoughts in front of the worlds press giving erhard and nick heart attacks if julianna and jacques were watching her now theyd beam with delight or say really loudly to the nation see shes vacillating it was only the thought of marriage that had her vacillating are you right to go erhard whispered and she managed a smile i like to make my bridegrooms sweat she said and his old face wrinkled into a smile of delight he looked along the aisle to nick and she intercepted that look again womenwe dont understand them but we love them anyway its not a real marriage rose whispered tucking her hand securely into erhards this is nick love em and leave em nick i can do this lets get this ceremony on the road it wasnt a real marriage the problem was though that it was starting to feel like one they were standing in church and nick was making vows that feltright do you take this woman rose was beautiful not just now he thought though beautiful would certainly describe her almost ethereal appearance as she made her vows beside him the first night in the restaurant shed taken his breath away he knew now what lay behind the façade and it was with almost stunned disbelief that he heard her responses i roseanitra take you nikolai it was mockery make believe til death do us part no only until divorce but it surely didnt feel like that and for once he let himself go forget the control forget the isolation bit he took roses hands in his and he held them erhard looked on from the sidelines hoppy looked on from underneath and he spoke the words i nikolai take thee roseanitraforsaking all others keeping myself only unto you as long as we both shall live it didnt matter nick thought almost triumphantly as he kissed her tenderly on the lips in front of the whole congregation it didnt matter what had been said before or what had been planned for the future no matter things had changed he nikolai de montez was a married man the formalities of the wedding were tedious signing signing and more signing made longer because nick decreed there wasnt one document to be signed without checking the wording then photography and more photography and then fun a great dance out on the front lawns of the formal palace at erhards suggestion made by telephone from his convalescence bed their guest list for the party comprised representatives from every walk of life from every corner of the country as many people as were safe to fit squeezed into the grounds and the festivities were beamed out over the country to where similar celebrations were taking place over and over the locals looked at their television sets toasted the bride and groom and allowed themselves to hope nick and rose were dancing their hearts out in each others arms this seemed a turning point for this desperately poor principalityit was a new beginning for them and a new beginning for all the country then as the late hours turned to the small hours as rose sagged in exhaustion until all that was holding her up was her husbands arms the bride and groom were escorted back into the castle and cheered every step as they made their way up the vast marble staircase to the bedchambers beyond nick and rose alone even hoppy had retired long since sneaking off to find a warm kennel with the kitchen dogs tomorrow hed have rose to himself and a dog had to have some beauty sleep so for now nick had rose all to himself as they reached the first landing she tripped slightly on her train and before she knew what he was about hed swept her up into his arms and carried her the rest of the way she squeaked in protest but there was a roar of approval from the crowd below say goodnight to our friends nick ordered smiling wickedly down at her and swinging her round so they could both look over the balustrade to the people below wave she was too dazed to do anything else she waved nick grinned swung his bride around and pushed open the first bedroom door his the door swung closed behind him with a resounding slam another cheer from below which was just as well as it disguised the squeak of indignation and the imperious put me down now he put her down it behoved a man to tread warily when he thought he was married but he wasnt sure where the woman was in the equation the earth hadnt moved for her then i thought separate bedrooms might be frowned on tonight he said by who by everyone downstairs you know both our doors are visible from the entrance hall then well wait until everyone goes away and go to our own rooms right he said still cautious you know you look beautiful you look pretty gorgeous yourself she retorted gold tassels and a dress sword wow i did scrub up well he admitted and thought fleetingly that if his foster brothers had been here they would have looked at the dress sword and given him a very hard time but blake and his brothers had been told not to comenot to a mock wedding that would have been crazy but thinking of his foster family was for later for now he had to placate his bridewho showed every sign of retreating to her own bedroom i need to go she said even if people see me its not a good lookbride bolting for her own room she glowered it was a very nice wedding he said striving to keep his voice normal it was you dont have to look at me like that he complained im not about to jump you youd better not why would you think id want to he asked and that obviously set her back the suspicion on her face gave way to confusion you dont want to not if you dont i dont not even a little bit he asked and she gasped no i i just thought he said seemingly innocent i mean youve been a widow for a long time and there are some thingswell you might be missing sex thats none of your business no but i really enjoy sex he said softly wickedly thinking well why not she was gorgeous and she was his wife id hate to think of my wife as being deprived she gasped again and took two steps backwards dont you dare you really dont want this marriage is a marriage of convenience so it is but i think youre beautiful and you think im gorgeous just your tassels she said breathlessly you want to see me without my tassels he asked and started unbuttoning his dress coat she yelped his hand stilled you dont want me to undress no no so this marriage stays unconsummated yes she said but suddenly her voice was a little unsure she was looking at his throat why she wasnt looking at his face roseanitra yes have i ever told you thats a beautiful name rose but youre not english he said youre a princess of alp de montez youre my wife you dont have any rights she said i know i dont he said gently i would never want you to do anything you didnt wish but if you wished i dont wish no he nodded this room was massive it was a suite really a vast sitting room with an opulent bedchamber attached hed been bemused when hed seen it the master of the castle always uses these rooms hed been told and he thought hed better go along with it but it really was over the top there was a vast fourposter bed draped with crimson velvet edged with gold gold tassels a hundred times as large as the ones on his uniform gilt furniture overstuffed a couple of gilt lions on either side of the blazing fireplace i guess your patients back in yorkshire wouldnt recognise you now he said gently and she did look at him then and managed a smile no your parentsinlaw didnt come to the wedding what do you think she said bitterly i asked them but no ive betrayed them how did you betray them i abandoned max max died he said frowning two years ago i didnt have his baby i see he said cautiously but of course he didnt and the reason you dont want to sleep with me im not in love with you no but if you were he said probing something he suddenly sensed was important she was so lovely his bride roses dress was a family heirloom the palace housekeeper had produced it the same day that the country had installed them in this castle we hid it shed said as shed presented it to rose we hid it from your sister because shes not the right one the dress was maybe a hundred years old exquisite a clinging bodice and flowing skirt white silk with gold embroidery a soft gold underskirt there was enough color for everyone to decide it was suitable for a widows remarriage i cant be in love with you she said still breathless not and be free id never tie you to me her brow creased into a furrow that sounds almost like a proposal no but i was just thinking he said wondering as he said it what was he thinking he wasnt sure it was justshe was so lovely and she was right here before him her brow creased with just that little furrow and hed made those vows and suddenly they seemed not so stupid after all not so scary but she was frightened she took a step back nick were taking this no further no id get pregnant she said yeah that could happen he said cautiously but i read something at the back of a very dark bookstore somewhere in my deep and murky past that suggested it might just be possible to prevent it the only sure contraception is a twofootthick brick wall have you been talking to my foster mother he demanded but she wasnt smiling i could never have a child he frowned up until now hed felt that this situation right now was light fun even no she didnt want to go to bed with him and hed never force her but a bit of lighthearted dalliance after the romance of the day had seemed okay and if it had led further he wouldnt have objected at all the more he saw of rose the more desirable she became today had been fantastical theyd been transported into a fairy tale a makebelieve that was for now only but why not let it run its course what harm would it have done but suddenly the mood had changed there was bleak heaviness in her voice i could never have a child is there something wrong he asked aware that he was intruding but there was such bleakness in her eyes that he felt compelled to theres nothing wrong she said but you cant have children ino you and max tried no oh he said then you know this is one thing we havent thought of what the succession why would we worry about the succession if you died then julianna would inherit erhard said we can put changes in place permanent changes this country will never be so dependent on its sovereign again no he said doubtful dont you dare tell me its my duty to have a baby she spat and her voice was suddenly so laced with fury that he stared hey he said and held his hands up in mock surrender i didnt you inferred it i just said it might be fun to learn about how not to have babies he was trying to make her smile again but she wouldnt be persuaded nick leave it ill certainly leave babies he said still rattled i certainly dont want them myself and if you cant have them then then the discussions ended right he said and drew his sword what are you doing with that she sounded nervous hey rose im not about to ravish you at swords point i thought i might hang it on the hook behind the door he said it occurred to me that if im promising not to ravish my bride id better put down my weapons all your weapons she said theres only my sword stop smiling too she said and he paused carefully he hung his sword and turned back to her does my smile do to you what your smile does to me iwhat you see theres the problem he said theres the crux of the whole mess because youre standing there looking absolutely fabulous and you look amused and then you look angry and then you look frightened and you know what every single expression you use makes me want to kiss you senseless whichwhich would be a mistake she stammered and her voice wobbled i can see that but im damned if i know what to do about it im sure i can go to my room now listen he told her from below came the sound of laughter many voices settling in for the long haul did we have to invite so many people theyll go home soon i could sneak oh sure open the door really really silently checking every inch of the way that theres no one in the hall crouch on all fours so youre below the level of the balustrade crawl slowly along hoping no one looks up oh and may i remind you that we have guests staying on this floor foreign dignitaries from all over any one of them could chance along and meet the royal bride crawling bedroomwards wouldnt look good no she agreed and she smiled resigned damn it there was that smile again so what do we do read he said i have a legal brief or six somewhere sleeps probably a better idea she said im exhausted me too he said and looked hopefully through the door at the fourposter bed you go to bed she told him ill use the settee the settee was huge it looked very very comfortable nick looked at it sighed and knew what his duty was im an honourable man he said so so you use the bed and ill use the settee but dont say it he said and held up his hands in mock surrender i know hero is my middle name just toss me out four of those feather pillows and two of those duvets and ill suffer in silence right here while you wallow in my rightful princely bed she giggled he smiled hed made her giggle there was so much about her that he didnt understand he wanted desperately more and more to kiss her to get closer to her to see if just if this relationship might go a little further hed always been wary of marriageattachmentsbut slowly rose was creeping under his skin in a way he hadnt felt possible hed suggested seduction this night and shed refused but instead of feeling wounded he wanted to know why not for him but for her and he liked that hed made her giggle there was something in the baby thing he thought hed get to the bottom of it eventually but for now hed brought the laughter back into her eyes and he was quitting while he was ahead goodnight my bride he said and he took her hands and tugged her forwards and kissed her lightly on the tip of her nose god only knew how hard it was to leave it at that but he did sleep well he told her sleep in your royal bed while your knight errant guards your sleep my knight errant i have no idea what that means he confessed but it sounds great its me it means i get to go to sleep with my sword when id far rather be sleeping with my lady he added under his breath he wanted the laughter to stay he wanted this lady to smile chapter nine she lay in his toobig bed dressed in the soft chemise that had been her underskirt during the day the silk was soft against her body the feather duvet was so luxuriousso far away from the heavy blankets shed been used to in yorkshirethat she felt she was floating she was married remarried she reminded herself shed been married once before and now shed made those marriage vows again only she had not shed lied she lay there in nicks big bed and felt small and lost and lonely hoppy was down in the kitchens she should get up and go find him rightthe royal bride padding down through the ancient corridors calling hoppy hoppy hoppy itd probably make headline news see that was what she hadnt counted on this interest the realisation that this marriage wasnt just between the two of themit was a marriage for the country shed wanted freedom but what dumb reasoning had had her thinking she could have freedom as a royal bride and if she succumbed to nicks sexiness the blaze of desire she saw in his eyes every time he looked at herwhere would her freedom be then and a childa baby it was closing in on her nick was too close just through the door in the shadows sleeping she hoped he was sleeping the thought that he was awakeas she waswas almost unbearable nick she wanted to call but she didnt think of something else think of the good things she could do here erhard had been with them tonight pleased but frail im proud of you hed said and that had been something to hold onto for some strange reason he almost felt like family erhard had known her mother and hed known her as a child she remembered him as a solicitous attendant to a sick old man he was a link to the past julianna hadnt been here today that worried her rose should have been accustomed to the loss of her sister by now but she probably never would be and the whole setup worried herthat julianna thought of her as the enemy she hadnt thought it through enough there were repercussions she hadnt thought of and she lay there and tried to think of them now but couldnt and she felt like like padding out and saying to nick move over i want to share your settee she didnt how could she but sex is fun what sort of irresponsible thought was that it wasnt a bad thought she conceded and she found herself smiling wistfully into the night she was married yes sex with nick could be more than fun but the only true contraceptive was a brick wall or a bed and a settee in different rooms she sighed again rolled over and buried her head in her pillows a royal bride on her wedding night without even her dog to keep her company nick stayed awake for longer than she did he wasnt a good sleeperfour or five hours usually did him and tonight even this eluded him so he was awake when the door opened he was drifting letting his thoughts go where they willed which was right through the door to rose so at first he thought he dreamed it the settee was on the far side of the sitting room facing the fireplace the fire had burned down so there was only a soft glow of embers nick sensed rather than heard the door open the soft creak of moving hinges was barely audible rose must be up and moving about but why had she passed him was she leaving the suite to fetch her dog or returning to her bedroom but then the door closed again and whoever it was hadnt left he or she was still in the room footsteps went slowly past him so muted that if he wasnt straining he would never have heard them not rose he knew that with a certainty that had nothing to do with logic but everything to do with selfpreservation if it had been rose going to get her dog he would have heard her go out and thered have been no need for her to creep back through the room with stealth she knew him well enough to accept he wouldnt jump her surely but if it wasnt rose then who the settee he was on was ancient downfilled a great squishy luxurious pile of feathers no modern springs here to squeak as he moved so he did move inch by cautious inch away from the end of the settee closest to the fire so as he edged around he wasnt in line of sight one of nicks foster brothers sam was in the sas from the time sam had come into rubys care as a battered nineyearold hed been intent on joining the armed services sam had lived and breathed action comics james bond movies superheroes and by the time he had been in his midteens he was reading howto manuals that were deadly serious thered never been any money living with ruby the boys had been expected to entertain themselves but theyd never had to think how when sam had been around hed had them organised into boys own adventures every minute he could persuade them to leave off cricket or football and sams semiserious instructions came back now never put your body between an opponent and the light never move until youre sure of what youre doing theyd played tag in the back yard creeping up on each other touching and winning by stealth alone boys fantasies all of a sudden serious all of a sudden imperative to remember for whoever it was meant no good whoever it was he or she had almost reached the bedroom door nick was used to the dim light and he could see the shadow now one man he thought one man with his back to him one man slowly lifting the latch to the bedroom beyond the bedroom door opened slowly slowly hell he needed a weapon the fireiron he slid forward and the cold steel of the massive poker slid soundlessly into his grasp he moved back still crouched behind the settee waiting his heart felt as if it had stopped beating sam where the hell are you whoever it was had opened the door fully now there was an almostfull moon the curtains in the sitting room were drawn but rose must have opened hers letting the moonlight flood her as she slept as the bedroom door opened wide nick had a clear full view of the mans silhouette long and lean and all in black one hand on the door handle the otherthe other holding a gun how he moved he didnt remember afterwards the mans arm was raising he was moving inside the bedroom intent concentrating fiercely on his target his hand came up further and nicks poker smashed down with all the force he could muster he must have made a sound slight but a sound for all that for the man jerked to one side so that the poker didnt smash down on his head but hit him hard sickeningly where neck met shoulder then slid down still with force smashing into his gunarm causing the gun to drop and skid and spin across the room and nick had him hauling him round bringing his knee up fighting foul as hed learned to fight with six brothers ruby had hated their fighting but theyd all been brought up tough and they knew the ways of the world theyd practised constantly every single one of rubys boys had learned the hard way that you could never depend on others to defend you but the man whirled and smashed back nick was too close to raise the poker again he punched with all the power he had rose nick roared as the man staggered against the wall and he powered in again get the gun wha wakened from deep sleep it took rose all of two seconds to snap to wakefulness the gun she said blankly under the bed your side nick yelled and hit the guy again if this guy knew any martial arts nick was in big trouble nick was a lawyer yeah hed learned to fight but he hadnt fought for years but he wasnt giving the guy room to do anything punching him against the wall hitting him hitting him until the guy lashed out again move one muscle and ill shoot roses voice rang out clearly over the moonlit room the nightlight snapped on she must have been brought up in the same school as him nick thought approvingly for shed flicked the bedlamp on and moved away up to the back of the bed so she could see but was in the shadows all the same he could see enough to know she had the gun he moved back which was a mistake the guy lurched forward and his hand suddenly glinted in the light a knife the gun fired a heavy dull pop into the stillness and everyone froze for a moment the black figure cursed grabbed his shoulder and lurched backwards the knife a wickedlooking stiletto clattered onto the bedroom floor and slid harmlessly away ill shoot again rose said in a voice devoid of all inflection id advise you to keep very still indeed the guy did so did nick this seemed dreamlike like a game with his brothers but it was no dream he was wide awake now and he felt sick hell shed shot the man back against the wall rose said still in that cold dead tone and she jumped lightly from the bed and flicked the overhead light on nick grabbed the huge gold tassel of the bellpull and pulled for all he was worth the bell pealed out so loudly that you could have heard it in the middle of next week not a nice discreet hear it only in the butlers pantry bell if the old prince had wanted something hed wanted the whole castle to know about it the man made an involuntary lurch towards the door still she snapped i will shoot rose get right away from him rose said he couldnt believe it she was standing in her chemise barefoot her hair tousled from sleep her face deathly pale she was holding the gun in both hands and she was aiming it straight at the intruder the intruder had frozen and why wouldnt he the man was young thickset dressed all in black with a balaclava covering his face he was holding his arm and blood was dripping slowly onto the polished floor and then there were people in the doorway an elderly liveried manservant a couple of dignitaries who were staying in the castle in their nightwear and behind them blessedly one of the castle securityguards the man edged through the crowded doorway and stopped dead in astonishment he came to kill us nick said rose hadnt moved she was still pointing the gun directly at the man before her can i put it down she whispered lets get backup first nick said and looked expectantly at the security guard and the guard took a shocked look at rose and moved into action he spoke urgently into his radio and suddenly things were out of their hands the next hour passed in a blur the security guards took their intruder down to one of the main sittingrooms where those who had no direct cause to be present could be closed out nick called erhard the old man was a guest this night in the castle nick didnt want to disturb him but faced with what might have happened faced with the evil hed seen tonight he needed to be sure who he could trust erhard arrived in bathrobe and carpet slippers looking pale old and shaken to the core but still retaining the aura of dignity that hed carried from the first im so sorry he told rose his voice trembling i would never have asked you if its alright rose said but she wasnt moving from where she was which was tight against nick from the moment nick had lifted the pistol out of her hands shed started trembling and the trembling hadnt stopped nick had wanted her to be put to bed for the doctors here to give her something to help her sleep but shed reacted with anger and momentarily the trembling had stopped someone tried to shoot me so im supposed to take a sleeping tablet and go calmly to sleep without getting it sorted you must be out of your collective minds then as nick had held her shed subsided against him and let him do the supporting i have a husband she said with dignity when he goes to bed i go to bed and not before shed held to that line as more onlookers had spilled from the surrounding bedrooms as every member of the castle staff had seemed to find some excuse to see for themselves what was happening little was happening the security guards had held their prisoner until erhard had arrived these men can be trusted erhard told nick nodding to each of the four securityguards i know each of them but i dont understand how there was a disturbance on the far side of the castle grounds one of the guards told erhard sounding appalled and apologetic at the same time the fence was slashed and a group of youths tried to break in they were young and drunk and foolish but we all attended he hesitated theres only been the old prince here for so long he said theres been no interest in the castle my officers have been lax theres been little need for security in the past erhard said gravely but there is now what chance these youths were paid to make a distraction ill find out the senior guard said grimly he looked at the man they were holding roses bullet had clipped his skin a surface wound one of the guards had roughly bandaged it to stop it bleeding the man stood now between two guards grimfaced silent as well find out who this is and whos paying him erhard said heavily can you triple your numbers here tonight using trusted people only i want people outside and in the corridors then he turned to rose im so sorry he said again we werent prepared youll be safe now i had nick she said yes the old mans eyes met nicks without you it was rose who did the shooting thank you both he said grimly my twohe hesitated and appeared to think better of what hed been about to say well keep you safe he said roughly and turned and walked away signalling the guards and their prisoner to follow they were left alone i think we should go fetch hoppy nick said and as they walked out of the sittingroom door they had to walk past two burly security guards two more appeared from nowhere and escorted them to the kitchens they retrieved hoppy their guards followed at a respectable distance as they made their way upstairs again not your room rose said urgently hugging hoppy close and nick nodded okay sweetheart he said thered still be blood on the floor he could understand but ill walk you to your door not she took a deep shuddering breath i meant both of us not to your bedroom i thought maybe youd come to mine the security guards behind them had paused they stayed impassive maybe they didnt follow english nick thought hopefully of course he said it was totally understandable that she didnt want to stay in the bedroom by herself he thought so why his heart should lurch thank you she said simply and they didnt say another word until they were in her suite with the door locked behind them securely with a key and the key stayed on the inside of the door with a bolt besides rose placed hoppy on the floor hoppy looked up at his mistress and gave a sleepy wag of his tail it was four in the morning after all and a dog had need of beauty sleep he hopped through to the big bed in the next room leaped lightly up onto the pillows and proceeded to go back to sleep great watchdog nick said and smiled i think were safe tonight she said yes itll have been jacques probably he said and julianna she was still deathly pale dressed only in her chemise she was shivering it was warm enough and the fire made it more so but still she shook juliannas my sister she said distressed i never dreamed she shuddered she must hate me i never thought back home this seemed so simple but how did we ever think we could do it take over a throne just like that you know somehow because julianna was planning to do it herself it seemed possible feasible even marry you have the great adventure save a country its the stuff of storybooks where there are happy endings and everythings resolved byi dont know kissing a frog she hiccupped on a sob and he reached for her and tugged her against him holding her simply holding her as she sobbed and sobbed the front of his shirt grew wet from her weeping but still she wept great shuddering sobs that wracked her whole body he held her for as long as it took but finally she cried herself out he felt her body go limp he was halfsupporting her she felt soso so much his wife that was what it felt like it felt like he had all the time in the world it felt that indeed this was his wedding night or more that this was his wedding moment hed sworn never to fall in love but he had he had if shed been killed tonight he kissed her gently wonderingly on the top of her head and maybe he shuddered himself for she drew back a little and looked up at him in the firelight im ssorry she said hiccupping slightly as she tried to find her voice i dont cry i can see that about you no really she said and somehow she made her voice firm i dont i dont know what im about tonight you shot a man he said gently how you did thathe felt his gut clench at the thought of what shed done how the hell did you do it he asked thinking it through to wake up and get the gun and actually fire the thing im a vet she said simply im not sure that that explains it fully he tugged her close again not because he needed tooh fine yes he needed tobut not for comfort just because this was rose his wife i deal with big animals she said and and i had to learn to deal with firearms the first time i ever needed towell there was an injured bull there was no way i could get near it but i couldnt leave it the farmer handed me his gun and expected me to use it he handed you the gun what sort of wimp had this guy been farmers get attached to their animals its hard to put them down so you did not that time she said i couldnt iwell the farmer had to do it and it took him two shots and he cried i went home that night and said i couldnt do it and my fatherinlaw said hed take the practice back over for a week while i did a firearms course he what hell where was max in all this ill he was only well for a short time so you had to do the shooting not often but he could hear it in her voicetoo often did you want to do biganimal stuff id started vet school wanting to look after dogs she said and sniffed and cats and canaries and kids tortoises cases where sheer strength isnt an issue when an animals in pain she was hugged against him as naturally as if she belonged there but the family needed me maxs family and now your familys trying to kill you he said youve had a rum deal no she hugged him a bit closer while she thought about it which was fine with him more than fine i asked for this she said at last but its been a shockthat julianna would she hesitated maybe she didnt know maybe she didnt maybe it wasnt even jacques do you think whoever it was really meant to kill us yes there was no point in lying to her the man behind the gun hadnt hesitated he had aimed at the figure in the bed with one thought in mind hed have been expecting there to be two in the bed maybe the far side of the bed had been in shadow but hed had six bullets in the chamber hed come to kill hed even brought a knife as a backup to finish the job if he had to rose knew it as well as he did he felt her shudder and held her tighter juliannas my sister she whispered bleakly my family theres no one else he couldnt bear it there is someone else he said pulling her hard against him so strongly that he could feel her heartbeat against his you have a husband as of today its time someone took care of you its time youre only here for four weeks or so ill stay for as long as you need me i donti dont think you dont need to think leave thinking for the morning sweetheart he told her youre done i am she hesitated hoppys asleep on the bed so he is you want me to shift him to the settee ino it seems a shame to shift him right roses suite was the same as his a living room with fire bedroom through the farther door from where he stood her bed looked vast far too big for one there was plenty of room for rose to sleep and not disturb the dog but nick mmm you wouldnt like to share the settee with me there was a moments pause while he thought about it her heartbeat was synchronised with his he thought and it felt fine it felt right share the settee to sleep but the way he was thinking of herif we did that he said cautiously we might just yes she said and it was an answer to a question he hadnt asked yes yes she said again and she smiled he put her at arms length searching her face in the moonlight astounded rose are you sure yes but you were so sure we shouldnt yes but things have changed she whispered for tonight its not the same i dont want to be an adventurer for tonight what id really like is to be a wife you are my wife he said yes and youre sure yes and she smiled again he kissed her then softly sweetly wonderously she melted into his kiss and her arms wound round his neck and held yes she said again nick i need you please i need you in my bed youre my husband nick and i want to be your wife and then suddenly before any more of these stupid scruples could get in the way she tugged her chemise over her head underneath she was wearing scant lacy knickers nothing more with her eyes not leaving his face she slipped them down and let them fall stepping out of them and taking a step back standing before him in the firelight gloriously naked his wife her auburn curls loose and floating round her shoulders almost seemed to be dancing in the firelight her eyes were too big in her toopale face yet she smiled tremulously as if she wasnt sure what she was offering was wanted how could she doubt that he caught her hands and held her out from him glorying in her nakedness glorying in the fact that this could be happening that such a woman could want him that such a woman could be his wife the words hed spoken this afternoon came back to him and they seemed so right how could he ever have thought hed never marry he hadnt understood until tonight what it was marriage the joining of man and woman making one but he needed to be sure he wouldnt take this woman unless she understood rose theres the contraceptive thing theres condoms in my toiletries bag she told him and he almost gasped but you said i know what i said she told him but i was coming here to be married to the worlds sexiest man and a girl would have to be crazy not to plan for all eventualities the worlds sexiest man he needed to put that aside but if theres a baby there wont be rose okay there might be she said slight chance im risking it earlier tonight you wouldnt earlier tonight i was ten years younger than i am now nick i need you are you saying no not just for sex rose he shook his head confused but at some deep level understanding that he was in uncharted territory this was important a voice in the back of his head was hammering with dogged insistence get this right hed never felt like this about a woman and he wouldnt mess with it for want of patience or for want of restraint no matter how much that restraint might cost he wouldnt risk her waking in the morning and reacting with horror at what theyd done this needs to be an act of love he said and as he said it he knew that it was right something was changing inside him something he hadnt been aware could be changed she was smiling in the firelight standing on tiptoes so she could kiss him his hands dropped to her waist and the feel of her silksmooth skin if she was to move away she had to do it now he thought and his thoughts were getting a little blurred he was offering her the chance to change her mind but a man was only human if she said no now she did no such thing she lifted one of his hands from her waist lifting it high so the back of his hand was against her cheek so she could feel the roughness of his skin against her then she moved his hand slowly down gently guiding it so the palm of his hand was cupping her breast it seemed she had no doubts for this night she was his wife for this night their vows would hold the terrors of the night overwhelming appalling out of their world were slipping away now as if theyd been a bad dream this was the reality and only this she put her hands up and touched his face gently tenderly never letting her eyes move from his nick he bent and he kissed her and in that instant her world readjusted the awful tilting somehow righted itself for this wondrous moment the horrors of the night and the bleakness of the past few years made way for for nick for loving for wonder nicks mouth was on hers and he tasted wonderful his hands were on her waist tugging her against him his hands were a mans hands big strong but caressing with a tenderness that made her want to weep but the time for weeping was past she was tracing the contours of his cheeks with her fingers feeling the roughness of the beginning of stubble glorying in his sheer masculinity it had been too long since shed held a man any man shed loved max but for years hed been ill and her touch had needed to be tender shed been the one doing the giving not here not now she could feel the strength in nick the unleashed power and she wanted it oh she wanted it but shed never guessed until this moment how much he was deepening the kiss and she gloried in it her lips parted and her tongue did its own exploring her breasts were pressed hard against him against the soft linen of his shirt feeling the strength of his chest feeling all she was doing was feeling all she wanted to do was to feel hed kept his trousers and his shirt on during all the troubles of this night but she wanted them gone now but to ask him to remove themto remove them herselfwas to break the moment and how could she it was nick who paused it was nick who moved back just a little holding her at arms length so he could look into her eyes his eyes were dark in the firelight almost black and when he spoke his voice was deep and husky with desire this is lovemaking he said softly rose what were doing its because of love i should say she knew what he wanted to say this was a marriage of convenience a marriage for a month he wanted no commitment and he was an honourable man too honourable when she wanted this so much we can be in love only for tonight she whispered knowing it was what he wanted to hear it was what she wanted herselfwasnt it but she no longer knew and she no longer cared tomorrow was for tomorrow for now yes im loving you i just want you to love me please nick now the now didnt quite work for she couldnt quite form the word before her lips were claimed again her mouth was being plundered by his his hands were tugging her close pulling her up against him almost lifting her in a long triumphant loving kiss where the night dissolved around them and doubts were swept away and there was only nick in her world and there was room for nothing else she closed her eyes her whole body responding with sensual pleasure as he deepened the kiss she was holding his face in her hands aching for him to be closer closer his hands were in the small of her back pressing her against him sending shivers of ecstasy though her whole body nickher man her hands slipped under the fine fabric of his shirt tugging him against her moulding to him letting him take her weight as she gloried in the strength of him for rose whod had to be strong for so long to let go now to let this man take her this was some romantic fantasy that was suddenly gloriously real this was happening in truth and not in dreams shed married this man today this was her husband she had every right to demand that he take her as he could demand that she surrender glorious surrender only it worked both ways this surrender she was plundering him as he was plundering her as he was surrendering to her he groaned softly into the night and she thought yes he was out of control and so was she and this was their right his mouth was moving now still he held her against him so her feet were barely on the floor but he had total control he kissed her as she ached to be kissed her neck her lips her eyelids she arched her neck and let him do as he willed her body heating as shed never known it could heat her whole world centred around the pattern he was making with his tongue he was lowering her now to the rug before the fire following her down his hands his mouth still conjuring their magic but he was still in his clothes she needed him closer she wanted his skin against hers she wanted his body and this man was her husband she had the right she pulled back just a little the flickering firelight was lighting his face shadows and contours illuminating the strength of his bone structure showing the passion deep in his eyes a passion that she was sure was matched in her own he watched her intent tracking every expression as her fingers unfastened the buttons of his shirt she was lying fulllength against him side by side and she could feel his breathing deepening as she made her way downward button by button slow but sure there was no rush she had all the time in the world and this was her man his shirt was gone now and she couldnt think how she didnt need to know how she shifted downward a little and pushed him back just slightly so he rolled onto his back and she could lie her cheek on his chest his fingers caressed her hair as she kissed his chest she found his nipples one after the other tasted them in turn teased them with her tongue and felt him groan again he was at her mercy her man hers she pulled herself over him so her body lay fulllength on his she tugged his arms up holding them then lowering her mouth so she could kiss him as he needed to be kissed then her own arms were captured and he pulled her upward lifting her higher she lay motionless gasping her pleasure as his tongue found her breasts slowly slowly he explored each breast and kissed them in turn taking her sensory awareness to a new plane a place shed never known was there he rolled her sideways then so they were side by side again her lips cried out a protest but this time it was needful his mouth claimed hers again but she felt his fingers fumble for the catch of his pants yes her fingers moved to help him and his kiss stopped and he gave a low chuckle of pure sensory pleasure i can undress myself madam wife not fast enoughmy husband she murmured and she chuckled and tugged the zip down in one triumphant tug away hed have to do the rest himself for as his trousers disappeared her hands stayed where they were she was going nowhere this was what she wanted most in the entire world there was nothing except this place this time this man shed made her vows and this was her right how could she have wanted this to be a marriage on paper only how could she have denied herself this joy yes this was for now nick had no want of an everyday wife and she wanted her freedom or she thought she wanted her freedom but that was for tomorrow and to deny herself this pleasure this wonder this sensation that she was where she most wanted to be in the world that she had at last found her home where did you say this condom was he growled and she came as near as a hairs width of saying no no need for to lose him now to have him move awaybut somehow sense prevailed somehow she managed to whisper directions somehow she made herself release him and wait and hold her breath in case the magic was lost but then he was back sinking down onto the wonderful thick firesiderug smiling down at her in the moonlight and making love to her with his eyes and now he whispered softly in a slow sensual whisper that made her body tingle with aching need and now he was above her lowering himself with tantalising slowness skin against skin not all at once but inch by glorious inch until they lay fulllength naked against each other oh the wonder of him he was kissing her neck her breasts a rain of kisses while his wonderful hands caressed her body her navel her belly and beyond he was so beautiful he wasnick the fire crackled spitting out a tiny shower of sparks like an exclamation mark into the night she could hear the fire hear nicks breathing and shed never felt so alive as she did at this moment nick she whispered my love i want you not half as much as i want you he whispered and he shifted pushing himself upward holding her firm within the strong bounds of his thighs she gasped with pleasure with aching need arched upward aching to be closer closer closer nick he was too slow she held his hips and tugged him forwards but he leaned forward and kissed her slowly languorously a foretaste of what was to come my rose he whispered my wife i need you her thighs were aching with need her body was creating a flame all of its own but still he resisted he smiled at her his smile a caress and then he kissed her he moved dreamily downward tasting her loving her moving from lips to neck to belly and beyond until she was ready to cry with frustration and pleasure and want and aching throbbing need this was no onesided love match she thought as her need took over this was her man her husband the last dreary yearsthe fear of maxs illness a husband who had no strength to take her a desolate widowhoodthey had been far too long to wait a moment longer to take what she most wanted in the whole world nick he was rising again thinking where next his mouth should explore but she was no longer interested in his mouth with a fierceness that surprised him her hands moved to have to hold to centre him exactly where he needed to be centred my love she whispered and he was there he was where she most needed him to be and he came down deep deep inside her strong and gentle plundering yet loving she arched wanting him deeper deeper she moved with him moving sensuously on the fireside rug as he needed her to move letting him take her where he wanted but assuaging her own need taking her to where she was meant to be she loved him for this moment she loved him and how could she not she was wedded to this man and that he could be her husband left her wideeyed with wonder her husband her mate but then she stopped thinking as her body reacted in the most primeval of ways this was meant to happena man taking a woman unto him and becoming one that was how she felt as if she was dissolving and becoming part of him losing a part of herself and gaining him in turn the warmth the dark and the firelight the terrors of the immediate past and the bleakness of the last few years none of them could impinge on what was happening herethis wondrous fulfilment of passion that had her body taking its need and causing the night around them to merge into a mist of heat and firelight and whitehot love it went on and on blissfully achingly magically and the moment the sensation eased another started to build over and over and when it finished when finally they lay back exhausted still she held him her nick who knew what tomorrow held but for tonight she was where she was meant to be she was in her husbands arms they rolled until they were side by side the fire was warm in the small of her back somehow she found the energy to pull away just far enough so she could kiss him tenderly on the mouth so she could smile at him in the firelight and watch him smile back she loved his smile she loved the way his eyes crinkled at the corners she loved nick thank you she whispered thanks surprise was mixed with the remnants of spent passion youre thanking me rose do you have any idea how beautiful you are youre the most desirable woman he groaned and how do you think i can walk away after that her thoughts clouded a little just a little as reality returned but tomorrow was for tomorrow she refused to let it cloud right now we should go to sleep she whispered hoppy has the bed so he has are you warm he asked and she chuckled youre really asking that i guess im not he said and kissed her again do you really want to go to sleep i guess you guess maybe not good he said and tugged her to him again good my love hoppy has the bed and he needs his beauty sleep but you dont need beauty sleep for how could you be any more beautiful than you are right now so if you dont need beauty sleep have you any more suggestions as to how we can fill the time im guessing here she said smiling at him maybe twenty questions there is that he said with mock seriousness or i spy maybe we could find that pack of cards i have another suggestion he said and lifted himself up so his eyes were gleaming down at her in the firelight its a really good suggestion whatwhat is it thats for me to know and you to find out he whispered just lie back my love think of england and let me show you chapter ten morning came too soon or maybe it wasnt morning rose stirred where she lay she was still before the fire which was now a pile of glowing embers in the grate at some stage of the night nick had thrown on another log and fetched pillows and a vast downfilled duvet so as the fire had died theyd stayed warm she was still cradled against his body the small of her back pressed gently into the curve of his chest as if she belonged there there was a soft knock on the door maybe that was what had woken her she lifted nicks wrist a little so she could see his watchand she yelped but instead of releasing her nicks arms held her tighter he nuzzled her ear and she felt rather than heard his low chuckle going somewhere wife the doornick its two in the afternoon golly he said and hugged her still tighter and kissed the nape of her neck she giggled and rolled sideways sighed and reluctantly sat up the sun was entering through the chinks in the drapes hoppy was sitting on the settee looking down at them with lopsided concern the knock sounded again gently insistent the world wanted to come in whoever it was wasnt going away nick reached for his trousers just roll away while i open the door he told her roll where somewhere he smiled down at her you want to be found naked on the sittingroom floor hmm she smiled back up at him last night someone had tried to kill her yet right now she felt light and free and deliriously happy roll he told her and he leaned over bundled the duvet round her and pushed she chuckled and rolled behind the settee and then wiggled a bit so she was obediently out of sight nick walked to the door barechested rose peeked out from behind the setteeand there were her panties right where shed stepped out of them the night before nick wait too late yes nick said and opened the door it was a maid one of the normally somber uniformed staff who kept the wheels of domesticity turning at the sight of nick naked from the waist up she gasped can we help you nick said politely if you please sir she said but she ran out of words she was gazing at his chest then looking past him her mouth sagged open yes he said encouragingly and she gasped again imonsieur erhard has asked me to tell you mmm she swallowed and made an herculean effort to get things straight he wants to see you he sayshe says hes sorry but its urgent we told him you hadnt had breakfast so hes asked us to serve croissants and juice in the conservatory i think we might have breakfast in our room nick said the girl had spotted the panties now her lips were pressed together hard in disapproval ino she said and pressed her lips closed again no monsieur erhard says you have company she said desperately clamping her lips tight together again company monsieur erhard himself and the princess julianna the princess roseanitras sister and a lady i dont know she says she knows you and her name is ruby ruby nick said blankly if you please sir theyre all in the conservatory and monsieur erhard says maybe you could be down in half an hour but if there was anything you needed before thenumanything at all i believe we have everything we need nick said attempting to sound severe and the girls tightlipped expression finally cracked yes sir she said and she smiled and then she giggled yes sir i see that you do you realise discipline in this castle is shot to pieces yes said rose chuckling more than the girl had chuckled and hugging hoppy as she rolled back out from behind the settee i believe theyre my knickers youre standing on sir he bent and picked them up they were pink and white and lacy with butterflies embroidered on them my god he said with reverence and i stood on them why didnt i notice these last night were these special for your wedding of course she said and then she giggled again nope i tell a lie i wear knickers like this all the time youre kidding me he held them to the light as one might hold up a piece of priceless art you wear these as a country vet i wear brown grungy overalls and mud and i smell like cattle she said i have to be a girl some time its a tragedy he said awed all that time theyve been under brown overalls um she choked back another giggle then thought about what the girl had said and suddenly it was easy to stop laughing she said julianna was here and ruby nick said in a tone of deep foreboding ruby if its the ruby i think it is its my foster mother your foster mother she gathered her duvet round her and rose awkwardly to her feet i didnt she frowned you didnt ask her to the wedding i sort of did i told her she was welcome but it was a political move business only and there was no reason for her to come did you ask your inlaws he retaliated as a matter of fact i did she said not only did they know why i was coming here i told them the date of the wedding and i told them theyd be welcome gladys slammed the phone down on me so why does rubys arrival make you sound scared because she grinned you sound about ten years old because why because shell care i see she said cautiously and this would be a disaster shell hate that its not a real marriage he said shell hate that its a fraud it was like a slap rose stilled a fraud she whispered ioh yes sorry shes always wanted her boys to marry he said not seeing her dismay as he concentrated on the possible consequences of rubys arrival she married for love and its her ambition to see us fall in love just like her shed never understand why we did this but ruby knows i go my own road why shes here now and julianna rose whispered pushing aside nicks troubles in the face of her own why would she be here she was invited to the wedding but she didnt come either i havent seen her since that awful night and theyre all waiting for us in the conservatory nick said morosely you think we ought to knot sheets and escape through the window its hardly dangerous she said if rubys mad at me it might be if rubys mad at you then you deserve something dire hey youre on my side says who can i have my panties please are you going to put them on i think bluebirds today she said with dignity can i remind yousirthat this is my bedroom and all my clothes are here and everything you own is in your bedroom down the hall therefore you should leave right he said dazed bluebirds he almost visibly swallowed but rose yes ill wait for you at the head of the stairs he told her i think we should go down together theres safety in numbers i hope there is he said nick returned to his bedroom the domestic staff had been before him all evidence of the nights intrusion had disappeared he showered and dressed as fast as he could then returned to the head of the stairs rose was already waiting for him how the you obviously take longer putting on your makeup than i do she told him and smirked and started down the stairs she was wearing ancient jeans an oversized sweatshirt and shabby sneakers shed tugged her hair back into a simple ponytail her face was scrubbed clean of all makeup anyone further from the elegant bride of yesterday he couldnt imagine but somewhere under those jeans were bluebirds he stood at the top of the stairs and forgot to move so she had to stop at the first landing and turn to him exasperated coming sure he said uncertainly and she grinned i couldnt find the bluebirds its bumblebees he nearly tripped and fell all the way to the bottom somehow he kept his feet and managed to follow her through the maze of corridors to the conservatory bumblebees they passed three of the domestic staff on their way and each had a smile as wide as a house plastered on their faces this wasnt a house shocked to the core by news of an assassination attempt he thought their movements since the intrusion had obviously been noted and were giving pleasure maybe news of the butterflies was winging its way round the castle right now but not the bumblebees he was feeling decidedly proprietary about those bumblebees his mind was having trouble focusing on anything it should be focusing on and it was almost a relief when they reached the conservatory and rose pushed open the door this was an orangery a conservatory planned in the days when oranges had been an inconceivable luxury in a climate too cold for them there were orange trees in beautifully ordered lines under the magnificent glassroof a truly royal tiled floora coat of arms in tileswas magnificent enough to take the breath away but nick scarcely saw it there was a table in the bow window at the end of the long glasspanelled conservatory there were three people sitting at it erhard julianna ruby uhoh maybe he shouldnt have told her he thought nervously but shed have found out anyway ruby was a diminutive whitehaired lady she was dressed in her customary pastel twinset tweed skirt and sensible shoes a string of pearls her foster sons had given her for her sixtieth birthday showed shed considered this day worth dressing up for but there was little of the celebration about her small person now she looked very very hostile she rose and nick had the same urge to run that hed had when hed been ten years old and shed discovered him making lolliesrolling dollops of butter in brown sugar and eating them with delicious abandonment half a pound of butter had disappeared before shed found him nikolai jean louis de montez she said now in exactly the same voice as shed used then what do you think youre doing he had an almost irresistible urge to hold rose in front of him like a shield only the knowledge that rose was staring at julianna like she was seeing a ghost stopped him i did say id fly you over if you wanted to come he said weakly and ruby stalked towards him with such determined anger that for an awful moment he was afraid shed box his ears when had she ever though even after the butter incident shed simply made him walk the two miles to the nearest dairy to buy some more and then go without butter on his toast for a week but she was angry boy was she angry you told me she said icily that you were marrying a european princess in name only so she could claim the throne you said it wasnt a real marriage a contract only if im not mistaken two signatures on a piece of paper why would i want to come and watch that it was only supposed to be he shook his head not knowing where to go from here how did you get here he tried instead never you mind she snapped sam said i was never to tell anyone such nice soldiers they had me here before breakfast he might have known ruby had her own means of getting where she wanted when she wanted and he wasnt off the hook yet i would have come before she said darkly glowering but i was babysitting pierces children there i was stuck with four kiddies when i opened this weeks womans journalit has the best macramé patternsand there you were and there was rose bending over a whole litter of piglets and i knew the moment i saw her that this wasnt a paper contract then i had to wait for pierce to get home and for sam to organise transport before i could come and i missed it she fixed him with a look that said stay right there ill deal with you later and she turned to rose but rose was facing her own demons julianna it was julianna but she was barely recognisable this wasnt the elegant young woman nick had met the first night theyd been in the country julianna was dressed in quality trousers and blouse as she had been that night but that was as far as the elegance went a savage bruise marred her left eye something had hit her hard her hair twisted into an elegant chignon the last time nick had seen her was now a riot of unmanaged curls her face was blotched from weeping and rivulets of mascara had edged down her cheeks she looked much older than rose he thought drawn haggard rose i never meant she was saying while rose kept staring at her like she was seeing a ghost never meant what she whispered last night i swear i didnt know i thought what are you talking about rose asked and julianna choked on a sob reached for her sisters hands but then seemed to think better of it she retreated backing against the table holding to the table edge for support i thought jacques had given up she whispered he said wed go to parishe said wed skimmed all we needed and the panel was never going to come down on our side rose i married jacques when i was seventeen i know thats no excuse and i could have left him but i kept hoping things would be better i thought i loved him i never you wanted to rule rose said bluntly and julianna blenched even further from the time i was little our father told me it was my right he said i was the one he made it sound so wonderful and i always felt the chosen one but of course there was always keifer and konrad and ruling seemed impossible only now it turns out jacques knew konrad would die young because she faltered then took a deep breath and continued forcing every word out as if she could scarcely bear it i swear i didnt know but maybe our father knew i think now thats why jacques married me oh jules what did your father know erhard asked but she shook her head whatever had to be said must be said in her own time i knew by the time konrad died that jacques didnt love me she said and she tilted her chin in a gesture that mirrored roses ive been so miserable i just stoppedseeing when erhard came to see me after konrad was killed i told him that jacques could do what he wanted with the country i didnt care they were all focused on her now ruby had turned from nick and was looking at julianna with a look nick recognised ruby had raised seven fostersons when a new boy had arrived at her home this was the look shed used here was a chick that needed a mother hen her look said but julianna was in her late twenties you sound like you have that depression thing ruby said sympathetically i had it after my husband died it was like i was in a fog and the fog was too thick to push through i did julianna said choking on a sob i do last week after that awful time with the crowd we went to paris but then yesterday jacques said we had to come back he said we werent coming to the wedding but we had to be near why erhard asked and she put her hands to her face again as if she couldnt bear to go on he didnt tell me she whispered hes stopped telling me anything i think hes even stopped thinking i can hear its my stupid fault its just been easier to agree to do what he says to be left alone only last night erhard prodded he was excited julianna whispered we were staying in one of the palace huntinglodges which was weird all on its own but i wasnt thinking or maybe i was thinkingof you rose and your wedding and how you were my sister and you were being married and i wasnt there you werent either ruby said and sniffed her disgust i might have known i went to bed julianna said too miserable to be deflected but i heard him downstairs pacing pacing and then i started thinking the fog lifted a little i heard him on the phone saying we were only twenty miles away and we could be at the palace in an hour and of course thered be suspicions but the money transfer was impossible to trace and there was no proof and hadnt he succeeded with konrad a car crash with a drunk driver he said and he sounded really pleased with himself no proof at all and then erhard she looked wildly at erhard as if she couldnt believe he could be here he said to whoever it was but you should have done better with fritz the old man turned up today you were meant to hit him so hard hed never stick his nose into whats not his business again he had you bashed he he didnt erhard said gently reluctantly his thugs came to my home two weeks ago my wifes poodle raised the alarm they killed our chloe but hilda and i managed to escape he closed his eyes remembering the terror but then he looked directly at rose and then at nick im sorry he said i should have told you i thought with all the publicity hed never try to hurt you two i so wanted this wedding to go ahead i took hilda out of the country because she was terrified i reassured her but i didnt think hed tryi misjudged we all misjudged julianna whispered i never thought he would but he did jacques did well get away with them both he told the guy on the end of the phone i knew what he was saying hed killed konrad and he was going to kill rose and nick there was an appalled silence julianna was staring blindly at rose youre my sister rose she whispered i cant get away from that when i thought of what he was planning she swallowed fighting for the energy to go on finally i went downstairs and asked him she managed even then i couldnt believe hed go that far but he just looked at me as if i was stupid as if i was nothing and then he hit me oh my dear ruby whispered he pulled me back up to the bedroom and locked me in julianna said dully he ripped out my phone extension he said i was in it up to my neck and if i said a word id go down first and i couldnt get out i tried and i yelled but he laughed and told me to take a tranquillizer take five he yelled and then the phone rang downstairs i heard jacques say one word well thats all then silence she swallowed and nick could see the horrors of the night were still with her i was sick she whispered i thought it was over she took a jagged breath and looked at rose as if she still couldnt believe her sister could still be alive then the front door slammed and i heard his car the lodgekeeper came by this morning and let me out but jacques was gone i rang here and they said you were safe but i had to see the lodgekeeper brought me here she shook her head as if trying to shake away a nightmare rose i swear i didnt know what he intended id neverid never i know you wouldnt rose said softly ruby moved asideas ruby would the woman had the most finely tuned intuition nick had ever knownand rose took juliannas hands even last night when nick said it had to be jacques i still knew it couldnt be you rose said softly youre my sister oh god julianna said and she pulled back and put her face in her hands what must you all think of me i dont want this i hate it i want to be out i want to be ordinary i want to go somewhere breed horses take in washing anything but this i dont want to be royal taking in washings a bit extreme rose said and julianna choked on something between laughter and a sob i dont care but how can i do anything jacques will never let me no one owns you rose said im just figuring that out you need to do what you need to do as for the royal bitcant you resign you cant just resign edward did rose said back in england with mrs simpson isnt that right he was supposed to be king but he signed something that said he was giving up his rights to the throne erhard cant julianna resign i dont know the old man looked grey he groped blindly for a chair and nick pulled one forward for him there was too much emotion here nick thought if he wasnt careful erhard would collapse he strode out through the conservatory doors to the sitting room beyond there were decanters on the sideboard he poured a generous brandy for the old man and carried it back erhard hardly registered when he placed it in his fingers i should have warned you of the dangers he whispered i wanted this wedding to go ahead so much drink a little nick urged and dont look like youve just confessed murder we have our assassin from last night under lock and key and everything else palls into insignificance he shook his head and youve lost your dog i suspect rose will say theres nothing so dreadful erhard looked up at him and nick smiled he put a hand on the old mans shoulder and squeezed were here now were alive well find jacques and youll tell me the truth ruby said nicks foster mother had been quiet for a whole five minutes nowalmost a course recordbut it seemed shed been talking aside to rose urgently rose tells me this wedding is a fraud a marriage of convenience rose he said helplessly and rose shrugged and tried to smile why not be honest it is a fraud but thats what you called it this morning she said he had but last nightover and over the image played in his head rose standing in her bare feet and chemise aiming her gun with her eyes filled with terror rose against the world rose with bumblebees rose in his arms but rose was moving on if julianna is resigning then i could too she said attempting to sound brisk and businesslike ive just thoughtif neither julianna or i will take the crown then nick is crown prince which makes sense my father wasnt really royal and you want it dont you nick did he want it suddenly they were all looking at him and the question hung of course he did this had started as something that seemed exciting almost as a boys own adventure but somewhere in there my mother was a princess here he said slowly she was so homesick shed want me to take it on there you go then rose said you can do it but together ruby said urgently sensing trouble because youre married no nick took a deep breath maybe its time for rose not to be married ruby sighed she put her hands on her hips and surveyed him with care right she said at last you know im getting really muddled here didnt you just get married yesterday yes but rose didnt want to get married he explained she did it out of obligation rose has had too many obligations for too long like julianna she needs to be free if juliannas prepared to renounce her succession too then it leaves rose free to do what she likes we can have the marriage annulled and she can renounce her succession too if she wishes i have a feeling the people in this country are going to get very confused ruby said darkly if im anything to go by theyll be very confused indeed maybe theyll kick nick out rose said the group seemed to be reviving now just a little roses words contained just a trace of her old perkiness he loved that about her he loved her to distraction how could he let her go he could let her go because he loved her you know they might julianna said breaking back into the conversation she was suddenly tremulously hopeful shed faced the nightmare and come out the other side the riot when we put you under housearrest was frightening ive never seen anything like it until then i hadnt realisedmaybe i still dont realise what power the throne has i cant see nick taking on the throne alone erhard said ruby had been concentrating really really hard she still looked confused but she wasnt prepared to be relegated to the role of mere onlooker yet nick will do whatever needs doing she declared hes a very responsible boy yeah that was rose shed been hugging julianna but her attention was caught by that her eyes flew to nicks responsibleis he just well well id never have thought it and suddenly she smiled then gave him a measured look which was suddenly all about whod remembered the condom last night it was like the sun had come out after all this emotion after all this fear she was suddenly teasing him hed never realised he could blush why dont you want the throne julianna asked rose i suspect no ones asked rose what shes wanted for a very long time ruby said putting her oar in again did you know her motherand fatherinlaw were trying to make her have babies with her dead husbands sperm no one knew what to say to that especially nick he stared at ruby then he stared at rose appalled is this true rose nodded her eyes suspiciously bright yes but how ruby found out i found out exactly the same way as monsieur fritz found out about nick ruby said with asperity my friend eloise at my macramé club told me shed been talking to someone who was asking about you nick so i did the same i have a friend who lives in your district in yorkshire rose and i got an indepth report of what youve been going through youve been bullied into taking over your poor husbands life and now youve been bullied into taking over this one enough i chose rose ventured the worst of two alternatives nick said slowly watching her and suddenly things were clear or as clear as they could be in the circumstances she should never have been asked to do this he thought in all of this that shed been asked to take on more responsibility why did you ask rose he said to erhard and there was something in his voice that made them all turn to him roses father thought rose wasnt royal youve inferred julianna wasnt erics legitimate child either youve said the dna thing isnt an issue but maybe it could be you didnt go down that path why not shouldnt i have been the one to take responsibility but i didnt know you erhard said bluntly you didnt know rose i did erhard was still clutching his brandy glass as if he needed it but a little colour had crept back rose was here until she was fifteen she was always the reliable one her mother was ill her father was a drunk the old prince was failing she took everything on her shoulders worrying about everything when i enquired about her it seemed shed kept right on doing that in yorkshire she was responsible and that was what i wanted you wanted rose to keep on taking the burden i didnt think no nick said gently we couldnt expect you to be thinking of roses welfare you were frightened for your country and you wanted what was best rose is the best we all know that but its time someone looked out for her interests that time is now and that someone is me rose was looking confused he reached out and tugged her against him feeling almost compelled to hold her close but he wouldnt hold her he mustnt he loved her too much so heres the plan he said softly feeling rose mould to his body loving the feel of her but knowing he had to offer her freedom julianna you abdicate well do our best to find jacques and put him in jail but maybe for the time being you could go home with ruby he smiled at ruby i know youre annoyed with me but im asking for your help and when have you ever refused it ruby lives in dolphin bay which is the best place in the world to recuperate maybe erhard you could go too youre looking ill there are two wonderful doctors at dolphin bay he grinned and there are all sorts of weird and wonderful dogs if you take your wife ill guarantee you come home with a new puppy and rose ruby asked sounding wary not hostile to his plan though just thoughtful i think rose should go too he said im not going anywhere rose said stiffening you must oh sure and leave you here to get yourself killed well that wont happen ruby said still sounding thoughtful ive organised that you have nick blinked youre not the only one who can organise ruby retorted this is a mess people going round at midnight shooting other peoplei brought my boys up to be responsible citizens which is why theyre all flying in tonight all pierce will be a bit longer because hes coming from australia she said sam couldnt go back to fetch him but when i got here this morning and found out about the shooting i said enough i need all my boys so theyll be here sams taking security over right nowmonsieur fritz has set it up for him and sam swears well have this jacques person locked up by lunchtime blakes got the legal mind darcy can sort out the army between them theyll have this place sorted and then itll be time for rose to decide whether she wants to come back again i dont rose tried but nick smiled and shook his head youre trying to argue with ruby im not leaving you she said you dont need to worry ruby said i realise nick is a very goodlooking boy and he has a very nice smile but hes got to give you time to think dont worry about him being lonelyhis brothers will be here but i cant afford you can afford nick said feeling gutted but knowing he had to let her go ive looked into the royal exchequer this week for all the poverty in the country the royal fortune is practically obscene i want to plough some of that into capital works to get the economy going but theres more than enough to let you and julianna spend the rest of your lives in comfort you can take that trip around australia you wanted to do you can do anything you want you have no responsibilities rose not one there was a moments stunned pause so im free rose said when i said i could resign she swallowed i didnt think and i couldnt take hoppyor not straight away whos hoppy ruby asked and rose motioned to the little dog whod been standing in the background looking innocuous as well he might hed come via the kitchens where hed been given a rather large hambone leftover from the festivities of the day before he was paying attention to the goings onbut only just theres quarantine regulations in australia rose said i cant leave my dog so she took a deep breath i do have a responsibility nick will look after your dog ruby said nicks not very responsible rose retorted you should know nick said and smiled youre my wife you said it was a sham marriage ruby said sharply looking from one to the other that was nick rose said do you want it to be nick asked sham that is i havent learned to swim yet she said and she was smiling tremulously as if she was about to take a very large step and wasnt quite sure if it was in the right direction so its not sham ruby said ask nick what i have on my knickers rose whispered bumblebees nick said promptly and my wedding knickers butterflies there you go then rose said how sham is that there was a loaded silence no one said a word you know ruby said finally looking vaguely into middle distance yet not looking at anyone at all i could really use a brandy it was very inconsiderate of nick to bring one for erhard and not for me im a frail old lady and i need my sustenance julianna erhard if you were to take an arm each i might just be able to stagger feebly forth and find my own brandy youre sure theyre safe to leave alone erhard asked but he was smiling theyre talking bumblebees and butterflies ruby said unless youre interested in botany i have a feeling this conversation is going to get really really boring chapter eleven they were left alone apart from hoppy whod gone back to bone munching nick was aware that it behoved him to tread warily very warily there was so much at stake he had to forget the bumblebees and start from scratch he decided repeat the conversation theyd just had and hope he got the same outcome had he got an outcome he found his heart was having trouble beating maybe because he was having trouble breathing so much depended on these next few minutes that was frivolous he said and she nodded yes so we need to be businesslike yes im not sure where to start he said which seemed a good sort of start it was the best he could do under the circumstances start by telling me that you still want this job rose said being brisk trying not to smile and tell me why he hesitated rose i didnt think this through he admitted yes it appealed that i could do a bit of good and it seemed an amazing offerto be prince consortto spend a few weeks here and get off scotfree but theres the but he said it had to happen and it has i cant walk away now im in too deep the kid who rescued hoppy is depending on uson meas are his parents and his aunts and uncles and his whole extended family the countrys a mess and it can be put to rights i want that job rose and i intend to take it so i really can walk away she said wondering its up to you i told you theres more than enough money in the royal coffers to provide well for you and for julianna theres no need to be a princess to have a life of ease you deserve the choice he smiled julianna wont have to take in that washing after all i dont want a life of ease she said you wanted to travel around australia you told me that i figure this gives you the freedom to do it ill be prince regent when youve done with your travelling maybe you can come back decide whether or not to take on the throne and i can leave or stay whatever you wish but that puts your life in limbo no he said forcibly i want this job rose theres so much i can do there are so many plans to makeso much to do to get the economy turned round its the most exciting job ive ever taken onits an honour to be asked to take it but she said but i wouldnt mind helping you can at the end of the year or you can now you can take over in your own right im not a legitimate princess youre the acknowledged daughter of a prince youre my wife youre legitimate in every sense of the word it was a fake marriage we signed all the documents he said it felt real to me he smiled and youve personally introduced your botany collection to the world therell not be one person in this castle wholl believe our marriage is sham now but you dont want me to staywith you it was a soft whisper but behind itwas he imagining it or had there been a tiny thread of hope you want to be free nick said trying not to let his heart leap she couldnt want him he had to be imagining it theirs was a marriage of convenience but damn it he wasnt going to let her go without giving it a shot though i wouldnt mind he said softly if you wanted to stay i mean freedom means freedom of choice so there is that option freedom does mean choice she whispered back so if i chose say not to travel round australia but instead maybe to travel say round the perimeter of this castlewith my dog and my companion what sort of companion ooh maybe a husband the world stilled the world held its breath what about that for an idea she said cautiously in theory are there things about it that might appeal to you there might be he said just as cautiously like um what sharing a tent is always fun he said the smile was returning to her eyes it was the smile hed fallen for he smiled back and for rose it was the same nicks was the smile that had lifted her from the bleakness of her past and propelled her into the future theres probably room in the grounds of the royal castle for a small tent she told him but wed have to get your brothers security forces to leave us be floodlights in the wee small hours sweeping our tent might not be as romantic as id like youd like it to be romantic wouldnt you his smile died the look he gave her was searching he wasnt touching her why not she wanted so badly to be touched she couldnt reach out to him she wouldnt a girl had some pride rose your freedom what about your freedom she asked you never wanted to be married i never wanted to be married to anyone at all until i met you now i never want to be married to anyone but you but i wont hold you rose i want to be held youve never been free freedoms got some downsides it needs some inclusions like what you there it was out in front for both of them to see and his smile didnt fade one bit it changed deepened broadened and the smile in his eyes was a caress all by itself i love you rose he said simply and her heart did that stupid stopping thing all over again hed said it she looked deep into his eyes and saw immutable truth love and wonder and need but also a trace of bleaknesseven fearas though even now he felt like he was exposing himself a child whod been brought up in foster homes whod struggled to be independent whod struggled not to need and whod come to the same sweet conclusion that she had that need wasnt such a bad thing in fact need could be the most glorious thing in the world how can you love me she managed and he smiled in a million ways far too many to count but rose your freedom i am free she told him im free to go wherever i want in the world im free to leave the shadows of max behind and move forward without guilt or regret youve given me that im not sure how and im not sure why but you have im free to be my own woman and im free to love and i do love nick i choose to love you you do yes still he didnt move it was like he couldnt believe what he was hearing well have to live here oh no a castle in the most beautiful country in the world she smiled up at him feeling dizzy with happiness ill try to bear it well be in the public eye its a goldfish bowl royalty it might be fun she said with a certainty that was becoming stronger by the minute i felt claustrophobic here as a kid but id have a lot more freedom now us in our tent on the front lawni expect wed shock the socks off the tabloid press at least once a week ill never ask you to have babies she stilled there was so much between them why was he not holding her you wont she whispered rose to be asked to bear maxs baby it was different she said thinking it through trying to figure things out for herself it was justit just felt wrong you know max had that sperm frozen when he was seventeen years old he never discussed it with me it was like a bolt from the blue if id had a baby it would have been like bearing a child that belonged to maxs past and any baby i have i want to belong to the future so if you and i wanted a baby i never thought i would he said softly wondrously i never imagined i could possibly want to bring a child into the world but you know with youif we had a castle and ruby as a grandma shed make a great grandma she will his smile was back now with vengeance and maybe we could even include gladys and bob just a little bit youd do that ill talk to them he said if you want theyve been part of your life for so long that it might hurt if they dont give us their blessing he frowned maybe some of that independence money youve just knocked back could set up a fund for a veterinarian practice in the townin maxs name oh nick she said awed i know he said softly and grinned im wonderful and handsome and kind and clever and humble he said dont forget humble ill give you humble she said and glowered and her glower was so delicious that he chuckled rose yes most of all i want you he said nick yes if you dont kiss me right this minute i might do something i might regret what might that be i might have to kiss you first she said and it was a near thing a very near thing who kissed who rose didnt know she didnt care she fell into nicks arms and he kissed her until her toes curled while at the glass doors of the conservatory three people stood and watched this second weddingceremony the joining of this man to this woman to become man and wife i did get to see it after all ruby said and smiled and smiled and theres the coronation to come erhard said deeply satisfied and maybe julianna smiled through the glass at her sister and then turned to usher the two oldies away after all what was a sister for but to protect her sibling maybe therell be the odd christening to come too she said softly i think the succession to the throne of alp de montez is assured and i think we can safely leave them to it marion lennox
