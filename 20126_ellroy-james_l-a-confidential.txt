gentlemen presenting dreamadreamland exley construction will build it in pomona california and the opening date will be april it will be the most sophisticated amusement park in history a selfcontained universe where children of all ages can enjoy the message of fun and goodwill that is the hallmark of raymond dieterling the father of modern animation dreamadreamland will feature all your favorite dieterling characters and it will be a haven for the young and young at heart ed stared at his father fiftyseven coming off fortyfive a cop from a long line of cops holding forth in a hancock park mansion politicos giving up their christmas eve at a snap of his fingers the guests applauded preston pointed to a snowcapped mountain pauls world ladies and gentlemen an exactscale replica of a mountain in the sierra nevada pauls world will feature a thrilling toboggan ride and a ski lodge where moochie scooter and danny will perform skits for the whole family and who is the

moochie mouse on the dreamadream houralways nibbling cheese with his big buck teeth valburn nudged the man beside him the man nudged back art de spain caught eds eye valburn kicked off a moochie routine ed steered de spain to the hallway this is a hell of a surprise art dieterlings announcing it on the dream hour didnt your dad tell you no and i didnt know he knew dieterling did he meet him back during the atherton case wasnt wee willie wennerhoim one of dieterlings kid stars de spain smiled i was your dads lowly adjutant then and i dont think the two great men ever crossed paths preston just knows people and by the way did you spot the mouse man and his pal ed nodded who is he laughter from the den de spain steered ed to the study hes billy dieterling rays son hes a cameraman on badge of honor which lauds our beloved lapd to millions of television viewers each week maybe timmy spreads some cheese on his whatsis before he blows him ed laughed art youre a pisser de spain sprawled in a chair eddie excop to cop you say words like pisser and you sound like a college professor and youre not really an eddie youre an edmund ed squared his glasses i see avuncular advice coming stick in patrol because parker made chief that way adniinistrate my way up because i have no command presence youve got no sense of humor and cant you get rid of those specs squint or something outside of thad green i cant think of one bureau guy who wears glasses god you miss the department i think that if you could give up exley construction and fifty thousand a year for a spot as an lapd rookie you would de spain lit a cigar only if your dad came with me just like that just like that i was a lieutenant to preston s inspector and im still a number two man itd be nice to be even with him if you didnt know lumber exley construction wouldnt exist thanks and get rid of those glasses ed picked up a framed photo his brother thomas in uniformtaken the day before he died if you were a rookie id break you for insubordination you would too what did you place on the lieutenants exam first out of twentythree applicants i was the youngest applicant by eight years with the shortest time in grade as a sergeant and the shortest amount of time on the department and you want the detective bureau ed put the photo down yes then first you have to figure a year minimum for an opening to come up then you have to realize that it will probably be a patrol opening then you have to realize that a transfer to the bureau will take years and lots of ass kissing youre twentynine now yes then youll be a lieutenant at thirty or thirtyone brass that young create resentment ed all kidding aside youre not one of the guys youre not a strongarm type youre not bureau and parker as chief has set a precedent for patrol officers to go all the way think about that ed said art i want to work cases im connected and i won the distinguished service cross which some people might construe as strongarm and i will have a bureau appointment de spain brushed ash off his cummerbund can we talk turkey sunny jim the endearment rankled of course well youre good and in time you might be really good and i dont doubt your killer instinct for a second but your father was ruthless and likable and youre not so ed made fists so uncle arthur cop who left the department for money to cop who never wouldwhats your advice de spain ifinched so be a sycophant and suck up to the right men kiss william h parkers ass and pray to be in the right place at the right time like you and my father touché sunny jim ed looked at his uniform custom blues on a hanger razorcreased sergeants stripes a single hashmark de spain said gold bars soon eddie and braid on your cap and i wouldnt jerk your chain if i didnt care i know and you are a goddamned war hero ed changed the subject its christmas youre thinking about thomas i keep thinking i could have told him something he didnt even have his holster flap open a purse snatcher with a gun he couldnt have known de spain put out his cigar thomas was a natural and i always thought he should be telling me things thats why i tend to spell things out for you hes twelve years dead and ill bury him as a policeman ill forget you said that no remember it remember it when i make the bureau and when father offers toasts to thomas and mother dont get maudlin it ruins him for days de spain stood up flushing preston exley walked in with snifters and a bottle ed said merry christmas father and congratulations preston poured drinks thank you exley construction tops the arroyo seco freeway job with a kingdom for a glorified rodent and ill never eat another piece of cheese a toast gentlemen to the eternal rest of my son thomas and my wife marguerite to the three of us assembled here the men drank de spain fixed refills ed offered his fathers favorite toast to the solving of crimes that require absolute justice three more shots downed ed said father i didnt know you knew raymond dieterling preston smiled ive known him in a business sense for years art and i have kept the contract secret at raymonds requesthe wants to announce it on that infantile television program of his did you meet him during the atherton case no and of course i wasnt in the construction business then arthur do you have a toast to propose de spain poured short ones to a bureau assignment for our soontobe lieutenant laughter hearhears preston said joan morrow was inquiring about your love life edmund i think shes smitten do you see a debutante as a cops wife no but i could picture her married to a ranking policeman chief of detectives no i was thinking more along the lines of commander of the patrol division father thomas was going to be your chief of detectives but hes dead dont deny me my opportunity dont make me live an old dream of yours preston stared at his son point taken and i commend you for speaking up and granted that was my original dream but the truth is that i dont think you have the eye for human weakness that makes a good detective his brother a math brain crazed for pretty girls and thomas did yes father i would have shot that purse snatcher the second he went for his pocket de spain said goddammit preston shushed him thats all right edmund a few questions before i return to my guests one would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment id have to answer yes or no i no would you be willing to shoot hardened armed robbers in the back to offset the chance that they might utilize flaws in the legal system and go free i yes or no edmund no and would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty no would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorneys working hypothesis no preston sighed then for gods sake stick to assignments where you wont have to make those choices use the superior inteffigence the good lord gave you ed looked at his uniform ill use that intelligence as a detective preston smiled detective or not you have qualities of persistence that thomas lacked youll excel my war hero the phone rang de spain picked it up ed thought of rigged jap trenchesand couldnt meet preston s eyes dc spain said its lieutenant frieling at the station he said the jails almost full and two officers were assaulted earlier in the evening two suspects are in custody with four more outstanding he said you should clock in early ed turned back to his father preston was down the hall swapping jokes

all three men could see him parker said officer you know deputy chief green and im sure you know of lieutenant smith the lieutenant has been serving me as an advisor during this crisis weve been having green lit a cigarette officer youre being given a last chance to cooperate youve been questioned repeatedly by internal affairs and youve repeatedly refused to cooperate normally you would have been suspended from duty but youre a fine detective and chief parker and i are convinced that your actions at the party were relatively blameless you were provoked officer you were not wantonly violent like most of the men accused bud started to talk smith cut him off lad im sure that i speak for chief parker in this so i will take the liberty of stating it without ellipses its a danm pity that the six scum who assaulted our brother officers werent shot on the spot and the violence visited upon them i deem mild but parenthetically police officers who cannot control their impulses have no business being police officers and the shenanigans perpetrated by the men outside have made the los angeles police department a laughingstock this cannot be tolerated heads must roll we must have cooperative policemen witnesses to offset the damage done to the departments imagean image that has vastly improved under the leadership of chief parker we have one major policeman witness already and deputy da ellis loew stands firm in his desire not to prosecute lapd officers even if the grand jury hands down true bills lad will you testify for the department not the prosecution bud checked the mirrora twoway for suremake das bureau goons taking notes no sir i wont parker scanned a sheet of paper officer you picked a man up by the neck and tried to bash his brains out that looks very bad and even though you were verbally provoked the action stands out more than most of the abuse heaped on the prisoners that goes against you but you were heard muttering this is a goddamned disgrace when you left the cellblock which is in your favor now do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness could offset the disadvantages caused by your imaginative show of force a snap exleys their boy he heard me locked in the storeroom sir i wont testify parker flushed bright red smith said lad lets talk turkey i admire your refusal to betray fellow officers and i sense that loyalty to your partner is what stands behind it i admire that especially and chief parker has authorized me to offer you a deal if you testify as to dick stenslands actions and the grand jury hands down a bill against him stensland will serve no time in jail if convicted we have ellis loews word on that stensland will be dismissed from the department without pension but his pension will be paid to him sub rosa through monies diverted from the widows and orphans fund lad will you testify but stared at the mirror sir i wont testify thad green pointed to the door be at division grand jury chambers tomorrow at be

salute was just icing ed tapped the speaker static crackled the closet was hot but not stifling like the central jail storeroom he thought of his last two weeks hed played it brass balls with parker presenting all three depositions agreeing to testify as the departments key witness parker considered his assessment of the situation brilliant the mark of an exemplary officer he gave the least damaging of the three statements to ellis loew and his favorite das investigator a young law school graduatebob gallaudet the blame was shifted more than deservedly to sergeant richard stensland and officer wendell white less deservedly to three men with their pensions already secured the chiefs reward to his exemplary witness a transfer to a detective squadrooma huge promotion with the

fish an easy readpure contempt gallaudet stood by the door smoking loew said sergeant well get right to it youve been very cooperative with la which is to your credit but nine witnesses have identified you as hitting juan carbijal and four drunk tank prisoners saw you carrying in a case of rum you see your notoriety preceded you even drunks read the scandal sheets dudley smith took over lad we need your notoriety we have a stellar witness who will tell the grand jury that you hit back only after being hit and since that is probably the truth further prisoner testimony will vindicate you but we need you to admit bringing the liquor the men got drunk on admit to that interdepartmental infraction and youll get off with a trial board mr loew guarantees a quashed criminal indictment should one arise trashcan kept still ed read in bud white brought most of the booze hes afraid to inform on him parker said there will have to be a large shakeup within the department testify and youll receive a minor trial board no suspension no demotion ill guarantee you a light slap on the wrista transfer to administrative vice for a year or so vincennes to loew ellis have i got any more

krugman sergeant tucker and officer pratt all three men have already earned their pensions our key witness will testify roundly but you can plead ignorance to questions directed at the other men

situation has been very astute any last thoughts before you testify sir am i correct in assuming that whatever criminal bills the grand jury hands down will be stalled or quashed during mr loews postindictment process loew grimaced hed hit a nervejust like his father said he would sir am i correct in that loew patronizing have you attended law school sergeant no sir i havent then your esteemed father has given you good counsel voice steady no sir he hasnt smith said lets assume youre correct lets assume that we are bending our efforts toward what all loyal policemen want no brother officers tried publicly assuming that what do you advise the pitch hed rehearsedverbatim the public will demand more than true bills stalling tactics and dismissed indictments interdepartmental trial boards suspensions and a big transfer shakeup wont be enough you told officer white that heads must roll i agree and for the sake of the chiefs prestige and the prestige of the department i think we need criminal convictions and jail sentences lad i am shocked at the relish with which you just said that ed to parker sir youve brought the department back from horrall and worton your reputation is exemplary and the departments has greatly improved you can assure that it stays that way loew said spill it exley exactly what does our junior officer informant think we should do ed eyes on parker

that white had in fact attempted to grievously injure carbijal sergeant exleys testimony is not considered tainted since it resulted in probable indictments against seven other officers however although the grand jurors doubted the credibility of the recantings they deemed them sufficient to deny the das office true bills against officer white deputy da ellis loew told reporters something

try to top it exley smiled again im addressing the los angeles county board of supervisors and the state legislature next week he said the subject will be the cost of southern california mass rapid transit and the best way to link the southland by freeway frankly i want the job and im ready to offer the county an enticing bid and then exley smiled and sighed and then theres all these politico fellows whove been pestering me he said they think id be a natural for mayor governor senator or whatever even though i keep teffing them that fletcher bowron dick nixon and earl warren are friends of mine but is he ruling politics out i rule nothing out preston exley said setting limitations is against my nature and as our reporters discovered his son edmund now a detective sergeant with the lapds hollywood division feels the same way recently in the news for testifying in a trial related to the bloody christmas police scandal ed exley sees blue skies ahead although he plans to keep police work his sole career speaking to our correspondent at his familys lake arrowhead cabin exley junior said i want nothing other than to be a valuable ranking detective presented with challenging cases my father had the loren atherton casea reference to the child murderer who claimed six victims including child star wee willie wennerholmand id like to be in a position to work cases of that importance being in the right place at the right time is important and i have a deep need to solve things and create order out of chaotic situations which i believe is a good drive for a detective to have exley was certainly in the right place at the right time in the fall of when the sole survivor of a bayonet attack on his platoon he singlehandedly wiped out three trenches full of japanese infantry he was in the right place at the right time for justice when he courageously testified against fellow officers in a massive police brutality scandal exley says of the two incidents thats the past and right now im building for my future im getting solid experience working hollywood detectives and my father art de spain and i spend evenings performing mock questionings to help me perfect my interrogation techniques my father wants the world but all i want is the most this police department has to offer preston exley and ed exley survive thomas and marguerite nee tibbetts exley the clans matriarch who died of cancer six years ago do they feel the loss in their personal lives preston said god yes every day they are both irreplaceable on that subject edmund was more reflective thomas was thomas he said i was seventeen when he died and i dont think i ever knew him my mother was different i knew her she was kind and brave and strong and there was something sad about her i miss her and i think the

annual fitness report duty dates subject white wendell a badge grade police officer detective civil serv rate division detective bureau homicide adjunct surveillance detail commanding officer lt dudley l smith badge gentlemen this memorandum serves both as a fitness report on officer white and an update on the first nine months of the surveillance details existence of the sixteen men working the squad i consider white my finest officer to date he has been attentive thorough and has put in long hours without complaint he has a perfect attendance record and has often worked twoweek stretches of eighteenhour days white transferred to surveillance under the cloud of last years unfortunate christmas mess and deputy chief green citing the four excessiveforce complaints filed against him had some misgivings about the transfer ie that whites propensity for violence and the potentially violent nature of the assignment would prove to be a disastrous combination this has not proven to be the case and i unhesitatingly give officer white straight a markings in every fitness category he has often evinced spectacular bravery by way of example i would like to cite several instances of whites performance above and beyond the call of duty on a liquor store stakeout officer white who is plagued by old football injuries chased a fleeing armed suspect for a half mile the suspect fired repeatedly back at officer white who did not return his fire for fear of hitting innocent civilians the suspect took a woman hostage and held a gun to her head which held off the backup officers who had caught up with officer white white then walked through a side alley while his partners attempted to calm the suspect down the suspect refused to release the woman and white shot and killed him at pointblank range the woman was unharmed numerous instances one of the key duties of the surveillance detail is to meet paroled prison inmates upon their return to los angeles and try to convince them of the folly of committing violent crimes in our city this job requires great physical presence and officer white has frankly been instrumental in scaring many hardened criminals into a docile parole he has spent much offduty time tailing parolees with particularly violent records and he is responsible for the arrest of john big dog cassese a twiceconvicted rapist and armed robber on white while surveilling cassese inside a cocktail lounge overheard him attempting to suborn a minor female into prostitution cassese attempted to resist arrest and officer white subdued him through physical means later white and two other surveillance officers sgt michael breuning officer r j carlisle questioned cassese extensively about his postparole activities cassese confessed to the rapemurders of three women see homicide arrest report a dated cassese was tried convicted and executed at san quentin officer white while surveilling parolee percy haskins observed haskins in a known criminal assembly with robert mackey and karl carter goff all three men possessed long armedrobbery records and white sensed that a major felony was in the making and proceeded on that assumption he tailed haskins mackey and goff to a market at s berendo the three robbed the market and white attempted to arrest them outside the three refused to relinquish their weapons white shot and killed goff and severely wounded mackey haskins surrendered mackey later died of his wounds and haskins pleaded guilty to armed robbery with priors and was given a life sentence in summary officer white has taken the high ground and has been instrumental in making the surveillance details first year a resounding success i will be returning to my regular homicide duties effective and would like officer white to join my squad as a regular homicide detective in my opinion he has the makings of a fme case man respectfully dudley l smith badge lieutenant homicide division lapd annual fitness report marked confidential dated filed by capt russell millard copies to personnel and administration divisions annual fitness report duty dates subject vincennes john badge grade detective sergeant civil serv rate division detective bureau administrative vice commanding officer capt russell a millard badge gentlemen an overall d fitness rating for sergeant vincennes along with some comments a since he doesnt drink vincennes is excellent at liquor violation operations b vincennes oversteps his bounds where narcotics are concerned insisting on making possession arrests when dope is found collaterally at ad vice crime scenes c he has not fulfilled my fears that he would neglect his ad vice duties to offer assistance to his bureau mentor lt dudley smith this is to vincennes credit d vincennes is not terribly resented for his testimony in the christmas assaults matter because he lost his much coveted narco assignment and because none of the officers he specifically informed on went to jail e vincennes is continually pressing me to return him to narco i will not sign his transfer papers until he makes a major case at ad vicethis is a longstanding ad vice transfer stipulation vincennes has had deputy da ellis loew exert pressure on me to transfer him and i have refused i will continue to refuse even if loew is elected da f there are rumors that vincennes leaks interdepartmental information to the hushhush scandal rag i have warned him never leak word of our work or i will have your hide g in conclusion vincennes has proven himself a barely adequate ad vice officer his attendance is good his reports are well written and i suspect padded he is too well known to operate bookmakers and adequate at working prostitution sweeps he has not neglected his duties to fulfill his tv show commitments which is to his credit ad vice has a probable pornography crackdown coming up within the next few months and vincennes has a chance to prove his mettle and earn his major case transfer requirement on that again an overall d rating respectfully russell a millard badge commanding officer administrative vice lapd annual fitness report marked confidental dated filed by lt arnold reddin commander hollywood division detective squad copies to personnel and administration divisions annual fitness report duty dates subject exley edmund j badge grade detective sergeant civil serv rate division detective hollywood squad commanding officer lt arnold d reddin badge gentlemen on sergeant exley this man has obvious gifts as a detective he is thorough intelligent seems to have no personal life and works very long hours he is only thirty years old and in his nine months as a detective he has amassed a brilliant arrest record with a percent conviction rate on the cases mostly minor felony property crimes he has made he is a thorough and succinct report writer exley works poorly with partners and well by himself so i have let him conduct interviews alone he is a peerless interrogator and to my mind has gotten many miraculous confessions without physical force all well and good and my overall fitness grade on exley is a solid a but he is roundly hated by his fellow officers the result of his serving as an informant in the christmas shakeup and he is despised for receiving a bureau assignment out of it it seems to be common knowledge that exley made the detective bureau as a result of his informing also exley does not like to employ force with suspects and most of the men consider him a coward exley has passed the lieutenants exam with very high marks and an opening is probably coming up for him i think he is both too young and too inexperienced to be a detective lieutenant and that such a promotion would create great resentment i think he would be a roundly hated

elected crimefighter in the southland for the next four years both men campaigned on the issues how to deploy the citys legal budget the best way how to most efficaciously fight crime both men predictably claimed they would fight crime the hardest the la law enforcement establishment considered mcpherson soft on crime and too liberal in general and threw their support to loew union organizations supported the incumbent mcpherson stood pat on his status quo record and played off his niceguy personality and loew tried a young firebrand routine that didnt work he came off as theatrical and votehungry it was a gentlemans campaign until the february issue of hushhush magazine hit the stands most people take hushhush and other scandal sheets with a grain of salt but this was election time an article alleged that da mcpherson happily married for twentysix years cavorted with young negro women the da ignored the article which was accompanied by photographs of him and a negro girl taken at a nightclub in south central los angeles mrs mcpherson did not ignore the articleshe filed for divorce ellis loew did not mention the article in his campaign and mcpherson began to slip in the polls then three days before the election sheriffs deputies raided the lilac view motel on the sunset strip acting on the tip of an unknown informant who called in with word of an illegal assignation in room the assignators proved to be da mcpherson and a young negro prostitute age the deputies arrested mcpherson on statutory rape charges and heard out the story of marvell wilkins a minor with two soliciting arrests she told them that mcpherson picked her up on south western avenue offered her twenty dollars for an hour of her time and drove her to the lilac view mcpherson pleaded amnesia he recalled having several martinis at a dinner meeting with supporters at the pacific dining car restaurant then getting into his car he remembers nothing after that the rest is history reporters and photographers arrived at the lilac view motel shortly after the deputies mcpherson became frontpage news and on tuesday ellis loew was elected city district attorney by a landslide something seems fishy here scandalrag journalism should not dictate the thrust of political campaigns although we at the daily news admitted mcpherson supporters would never abridge their right to print whatever filth they desire we have tried to locate marvell wilkins but the girl released from custody seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth without pointing fmgers we at

is a heinous crime that requires a hard and swift resolution the press and public will demand it and since we already have solid leads we will give it to them there were six people dead in that lockerthree men and three women i have spoken to the nite owls owner and he told me that three of the dead are likely patty chesimard and donna deluca female caucasians the lateshift waitress and cash register girl and gilbert escobar male mexican the cook and dishwasher the three other victimstwo men one woman were almost certainly customers the cash register and safe were empty and the victims pockets and handbags were picked clean which means that robbery was obviously the motive sid is doing the forensic nowso far they have nothing but rubber glove prints on the cash register and food locker door no time of death on the victims but the scant number of customers and another lead we have indicates am as the time of the killings a total of fortyfive spent gauge remington shotgun shells were found in the locker this indicates three men with fiveshotcapacity pumps all of them reloading twice i do not have to tell you how gratuitous forty of those rounds were lads we are dealing with stark raving mad beasts here bud looked around still no exley a hundred men jotting notes jack vincennes in a corner no notebook thad green took over no blood tracks leading outside we were hoping for footprints to run eliminations against but we didnt find any and ray pinker from sid says the forensic will take at least fortyeight hours the coroner says ids on the customer victims will be extremely difficult because of the condition of the bodies but we do have one very hot lead hollywood division has taken a total of four crime reports on this so listen well over the past two weeks a carload of negro youths were seen discharging shotguns into the air up at griffith park there were three of them and the shotguns were pumps the punks were not apprehended but eyeball witnesses idd

owl last night around am the room went loud a big rumbling green gestured for quiet it gets better so listen well there are no to purple mercurys on the hot sheet so it is very doubtful that were dealing with a stolen car and the state dmv has given us a registration list on to mercurys statewide purple was an original color on the to coupe models and those models were favored by negroes over

blowing horses whatever you desire chapter twentytwo parker said ed you were brilliant the other day i disapprove of officer whites intrusion but i cant complain with the results i need smart men like you and direct men like bud and i want both of you on the nite owl job sir i dont think white and i can work together you wont have to dudley smiths heading up the investigation and white will report directly to him two other men mike breuning and dick carlisle will work with whitehowever dudley wants to play it the hollywood squad will be in on the job reporting to lieutenant reddin wholl report to dudley weve got divisional contacts assigned and every man in the bureau is caffing in informant favors chief green says russ millard wants to be detached from ad vice to run the show with dud so thats a possibility that makes twentyfour fulltime officers what specifically do i do parker pointed to a case graph on an easel one we have not found the shotguns or coates car and until that girl those thugs assaulted clears them on the time element we have to assume that they are still our prime suspects since whites little escapade theyve refused to talk and theyve been booked on kidnap and rape charges i think sir id be glad to have another try at them let me finish two we still have no ids on the other three victims doc laymans working overtime on that and were logging in four hundred calls a day from people worried about missing loved ones theres an outside chance that this might be more than just a set of robbery killings and if that proves to be the case i want you on that end of things as of now youre liaison to sid the das office and the divisional contacts i want you to go over every field report every day assess them and share your thoughts with me personally i want daily written summaries copies to chief green and myself ed tried not to smilethe stitches in his chin helped sir some thoughts before we continue parker leaned his chair back of course ed ticked points one what about searching for comparable shell samples in griffith park two if the girl clears our suspects on the time element what was that purple car doing across from the nite owl three how likely are we to turn the guns and the car four the suspects said they took the girl to a building on dunkirk first what kind of evidence did we get there good points but one shell samples to compare is a long shot with breechload weapons the rounds might have expelled back into the car those punks were driving the actual locations listed in the crime reports were vague griffith park is all hillsides weve had rain and mudslides over the past two weeks and that park ranger has waffled on iding the three in custody two the news vendor who idd the car by the nite owl says now that maybe it was a ford or a chevy so our registration checks are now a nightmare if youre thinking the car was placed there as a plant i think thats nonsensehow would anyone know to plant it there three the th street squad is tearing up the goddamn southside for the car and the guns muscling kas the megillah and four there was blood and semen all over a mattress in that building on dunkirk ed said it all comes back to the girl parker picked up a report form inez soto age twentyone a college student shes at queen of angels and she just came out of sedation this morning has anyone spoken to her bud white went with her to the hospital nobodys talked to her in thirtysix hours and i dont envy you the task sir can i do this alone no ellis loew wants to prosecute our boys for little lindberghkidnapping and rape he wants them in the gas chamber for that the nite owl or both and he wants a das investigator and a woman officer present youre to meet bob gallaudet and a sheriffs matron at queen of angels in an hour i dont have to mention that the course of this investigation will be determined by what our miss soto tells you ed stood up parker said off the record do you make the coloreds for the job sir im not sure you cleared them temporarily did you think id be angry with you for that sir we both want absolute justice and you like me too much parker smiled edmund dont dwell on what white did the other day youre worth a dozen of him hes killed three men line of duty but thats nothing compared to what you did in the war remember that gallaudet met him outside the girls room the hall reeked of disinfectantfamiliar his mother died one floor down hello sergeant its bob and ellis loew sends his thanks he was afraid the suspects would get beaten to death and he wouldnt get to prosecute ed laughed they might be cleared on the nite owl i dont care and neither does loew little lindbergh with rape carries the death penalty loew wants those guys in the ground so do i so will you once you talk to the girl so heres the sixtyfourdollar question did they do it ed shook his head based on their reactions id lean against it but fontaine said they drove the girl around sold her out was the phrase he reacted to i think it could have been sugar coates and a little pickup gang maybe two of the guys they sold her to none of the three had money on them when they were arrested and either waynite owl or gang rapei think that money is stashed somewhere covered with bloodlike the bloody clothes coates burned gallaudet whistled so we need the girls word on the time element and ids on the other rapers right and our suspects are clammed and bud white killed the one witness who could have helped us that guy whites a pisser isnt he dont look so spooked being scared of him means youre sane now come on lets talk to the young lady they walked into the room a sheriffs matron blocked the bedtall fat short hair waxed straight back gallaudet said ed exley dot rothstein the woman nodded stepped aside inez soto black eyes her face cut and bruised dark hair shaved to the forehead sutures tubes in her arms tubes under the sheets cut knuckles split nailsshe fought ed saw his mother bald sixty pounds in an iron lung gallaudet said miss soto this is sergeant exley ed leaned on the bed rail im sorry we couldnt have given you more time to recuperate and ill try to make this as brief as possible inez soto stared at himdark eyes bloodshot a raspy voice i wont look at any more pictures gallaudet miss soto identified coates fontaine and jones from mugshots i told her we might need her to look at some mugshots for ids on the other men ed shook his head that wont be necessary right now right now miss soto i need you to try to remember a chronology of the events that happened to you two nights ago we can do this very slowly and for now we wont need details when youre more rested we can go over it again please take your time and start when the three men kidnapped you inez pushed up on her pillows they werent men ed gripped the rail i know and theyre going to be punished for what they did to you but before we can do that we need to eliminate or confirm them as suspects on another crime i want them dead i heard the radio i want them dead for that we cant do that because then the other ones who hurt you will go free we have to do this correctly a hoarse whisper correctly means six white people are more important than a mexican girl from boyle heights those animals ripped me up and did their business in my mouth they stuck guns in me my family thinks i brought it on myself because i didnt marry a stupid cholo when i was sixteen i will tell you nothing cabrón gallaudet miss soto sergeant exley saved your life he ruined my life

crime scene found an envelope addressed to miss janeway and recognized your rather unformed handwriting immediately explain with brevity ladsergeant dicenzo is heading the investigation and wants you eliminated as a suspect a body shotlittle kathy sobbing bud got his lies straight i was on the cathcart background check and this hooker who worked for cathcart told me the janeway girl was cathcarts last squeeze but he didnt pimp her i talked to the girl but she didnt know nothing worth reporting she told me the hooker was holding cash from cathcart for her but she wouldnt kick loose i shook her down and mailed the money to the kid dicenzo shook his head do you routinely shake down hookers dudley sighed bud has a sentimental weakness for females and i fmd his account plausible within the limitations of that limitation lad who was this hooker you mentioned cynthia benavides aka sinful cindy lad you didnt include mention of her in any of the reports youve filed which have been rather threadbare i might add lies hold back on smut cathcarts pad tossed the pimp who sold kathy to duke i didnt think she was important stuff lad she is a tangential nite owl witness and havent i taught

door lad you cannot shake down prostitutes for money to pay off underaged mistresses i understand your sentimental attachment to women and i know that it is an essential component of your policemans persona but such overinvolvement cannot be tolerated and as of this moment you are off the cathcart and lunceford checks and back on the darktown end of the case now chief parker and i are convinced that the three negroes in custody are our perpetrators or at the very most another jigaboo gang is responsible we still have no murder weapons and no shake on coates car and ellis loew wants more evidence for a grand jury presentation our fair miss soto will not talk and im afraid we must urge her to take pentothal and endure a questioning session your job is to check files and question known

wheres he working out of th street station hes been assigned to roust jigaboos with sex offender records hes on daywatch at th and youll be clocking in and out there as well dud youre a lifesaver would you care to elaborate on that lad no chapter twentynine memo from chief parker to dep chief green capt r millard lt d smith sgt e exley conference chiefs office pm topic questioning of witness inez soto his fathers note shes wonderful and ray dieterlings much taken with her but shes a material witness and a mexican and i advise you not to get too attached to her and under no circumstances should you shack up with her cohabitation is against departmental regs and being with a mexican woman could seriously stall your career parker kicked things off ed the nite owl case is narrowing down to the negroes in custody or some other colored gang now word has it that youve gotten close to the soto girl lieutenant smith and i deem it imperative that she undergo questioning in order to clear up the time element alibi or not alibi the three in custody and identify the other men who assaulted her we think pentothal is the best way to get results and pentothal works best when a subject is at ease we want you to convince miss soto to cooperate she probably trusts you so youll have credibility inez poststensland shellshocked hardpressed to move to arrowhead sir i think all our evidence so far is circumstantial i think we should get other corroboration before i approach miss soto and i want to try questioning coates jones and fontaine again smith laughed lad they refused to talk to you the other day and now they have a pinko public defender whos advising them to stay mute ellis loew wants a grand jury presentationnite owl and little lindberghand you can facilitate it kid gloves has gotten us nowhere with our fair miss soto and its time we quit coddling her russ millard lieutenant i agree with sergeant exley if we keep pressing on the southside well turn rape witnesses and maybe find coates car and the murder weapons my instincts tell me the girls recollections of that night might be too muddled to do us any good and if we make her remember it might wreck her life more than its been wrecked already can you picture ellis loew badgering her in front of the grand jury not very pretty is it smith laughedstraight at millard captain you politicked very hard to share this command with me and now you advance a sob sister sensibility this is a brutal mass murder that requires a swift and hard resolution not a sorority party and ellis loew is a brilliant attorney and a compassionate man im sure he would handle miss soto with care millard swallowed a pill chased it with water ellis loew is a headlinegrubbing buffoon not a policeman and he should not be directing the thrust of this investigation fair captain i deem that comment near seditious in its parker raised a hand gentlemen enough thad will you take captain millard and lieutenant smith down the hall and buy them coffee while i talk to the sergeant here green ushered the two outside parker said ed dudley s right ed kept quiet parker pointed to a stack of newspapers the press and the public demand justice well look very bad if we dont clear this up soon sir i know do you care about the girl yes you know that sooner or later shell have to cooperatc sir dont underestimate her shes steel inside parker

lynn bracken is one of them i bought lynn from gilette a few years ago and if gilette tried to chew up my name it was because he knows that i hate and fear the police and he thoughtcorrectlythat i

give me a line on this guy patchett crossed his legs stretched so you think this guy might have killed kathy janeway no i dont think that or you think hes behind that nite owl thing i thought negro youths were supposed to be the killers what crime are you investigating mr white bud gripped the chairfabric ripped patchett put his hands up palms out the answer to your questions is no dwight

and baxter englekling will be granted immunity from prosecution in all matters pertaining to the said including accessory conspiracy and all collateral felonies and misdemeanors mr kellerman do your clients understand the aforesaid yes mr loew they do do they understand that they may be asked to submit to questioning after their statement has been read they do read the statement counselor kellerman put on bifocals ive eliminated peter and baxters more colorful colloquialisms and cleaned up their language and syntax please bear that in mind loew tugged at his vest were capable of discerning that please continue kellerman read we peter and baxter englekling do swear that this statement is entirely true in late march of this year approximately three weeks before the nite owl killings we were approached at our legitimate business the speedy king printshop in san bernardino the man who approached us was one delbert duke cathcart who said that he had gotten our names from mr xy an acquaintance from our youth camp sentence days mr xy had informed cathcart that we ran a printshop which featured a highspeed offset press of our own design which was true mr xy had also told cathcart that we were always interested in quote turning a quick buck unquote which was also true chuckles ed wrote vict susan lefferts from s berdoo connection loew said continue mr kellerman were all capable of laughing and thinking at the same time kellerman cathcart showed us photographs of people engaged in explicit sexual activities some of them homosexual in nature some of the photographs were quote artyfarty unquote ie people in colorful costumes and animated red ink embossed on some of the snapshots cathcart said that he heard we could manufacture highquality magazinetype books very fast and we said this was true cathcart also stated that a number of magazinetype books had already been manufactured using the obscene photographs and quoted us the cost involved we knew we could make the books at one eighth of that cost ed passed millard a note isnt ad vice working a pornography job the brothers smirked loew and gallaudet whispered millard passed a note back yesno leads from a man team a cold trail tracking the strange costumed per the statement bookswere dropping it also no field reports submitted so far link cathcart to pornography kellerman sipped water cathcart then told us that he heard our late father franz doc englekling was friends with meyer harris mickey cohen los angeles mobster currently incarcerated at mcneil island penitentiary we said this was true cathcart then made his basic proposal he said that distribution of the pornographic books would have to be quote very close unquote because the quote strange cats unquote who took the photographs and did the pasteup work seemed like they had lots to hide he did not elaborate on this further he said that he had access to a network of quote rich perverts unquote who would pay large sums for the books and proposed that we could also manufacture quote regular fucksuck shit unquote that could be distributed in large quantities cathcart claimed to have access to quote pervert mailing list unquote quote junkies and whores unquote to serve as models and access to quote classy call girls unquote who might pose for a lark if their quote crazy sugar daddyo unquote agreed again cathcart did not elaborate on any of his claims nor did he mention specific names or locations kellerman flipped pages cathcart told us that he would be the procurer talent scout and middleman we would be the manufacturers of the books we were also to visit mickey cohen at mcneil island and get him to release funds to get the business started we were also to solicit his advice on starting a distribution system in exchange for the above cohen would be given a quote bonaroo unquote percentage cut ed passed a note no followup namesits too convenient millard whispered and the nite owl is not mickeys style bar englekling chuckled pete poked his ears with a pencil kellerman read we visited mickey cohen in his cell at mcneil approximately two weeks before the nite owl killings we proposed the idea to him he refused to help and became very angry when we told him the idea was conceived by duke cathcart whom he referred to as quote a notorious statch rapeo shitbird unquote in conclusion we believe that gunmen employed by mickey cohen perpetrated the nite owl massacre a killsixtogetone ruse undertaken out of his hatred for duke cathcart another possibility is that cohen talked up cathcarts proposed scheme on the prison yard and word got out to cohen rival jack the enforcer whalen who always looking for new rackets to crash assassinated cathcart and five innocent bystanders as subterfuge we believe that if the killings were the result of pornography intrigue we too might become victims we swear that this deposition is true and not rendered under physical or mental duress the brothers clapped kellerman said my clients welcome questions loew pointed to the bedroom after i talk to my colleagues they walked in loew closed the door conclusions bob you first gallaudet lit a cigarette mickey cohen despite his many faults does not murder people out of pique and jack whalens only interested in gambling rackets i believe their story but everything weve dug up on cathcart makes him look like a pathetic chump who couldnt get something this big going i say its tangent stuff at best i still make the boogies for the job i agree captain your opinion millard said i like one possible scenariowith major reservations maybe cohen talked up the job on the yard at mcneil word got to the outside and somebody took it from there butif this deal is smutconnected then the englekling boys would either have been killed or approached by now ive been running a stag book investigation out of ad vice for two weeks and my squad has heard nothing on this and hit one brick wall after another i think ed and bob should talk to whalen then fly up to mcneil and talk to mickey ill question those lowlifes in the next room and ill talk to my ad vice men ive read every field report filed by every man on the nite owl and there is not one mention of pornography i think bobs right its a tangent were dealing with agreed bob you and exley talk to cohen and whalen captain did you have capable men on your job millard smiled three capable men and trashcan jack vincennes no offense ellis i know hes involved with your wifes sister loew flushed exley do you have anything to add bob and the captain covered my points but theres two things i want to mention one susan lefferts was from san berdoo two if its not the negroes in custody or another colored gang then the car by the nite owl was a plant and we are dealing with one huge conspiracy i think we have our killers and on that note are you making progress with miss soto im working at it work harder good efforts are for schoolboys results are what counts go to it gentlemen ed drove to his apartmenta change of clothes for the run to mcneil he found a note on the door exley i still think youre everything i said you were but i called the house and talked to my sister and she said you came by and were obviously concerned about my welfare so im thawing a little bit youve been nice to me when you werent covering angles or beating up people and maybe im an opportunist myself and im just using you for shelter until i get better and can accept mr dieterlings offer so since i live in a glass house i shouldnt throw stones at you thats as close to an apology as im going to give you and i will continue to refuse to cooperate get the picture is mr dieterling for real about a job at dreamadreamland im going shopping today with the rest of the money you gave me keeping busy makes me think about it less ill come by tonight leave a light burning inez ed changed and taped his spare key to the door he left a light burning chapter

merc millards bomb still exploding lucky he heard by phonehe would have shit his pants otherwise vincennes two witnesses have contacted ellis loew they said duke cathcart was involved in some kind of unrealized scheme to push that smut weve been chasing my guess is that it doesnt connect to the nite owl but have you come up with anything he said no he asked if the other guys on the squad hit pay dirt millard said no he didnt tell him his reports were all bullshit he didnt tell him he didnt care if the smut gig and the nite owl were doubled up from here to mars he didnt tell him he wouldnt

lynn said the paintings are real and im a prostitute ive never heard of kathy whatshername and dwight gilette would never sexually abuse a female if he were going to kill one he would have used a knife i have heard of that man duke cathcart essentially that he was a loser with a soft spot for his girls and thats all the news thats fit to print you finished no i have no information on dwights other girls and all i know about that nite owl thing is what i read in the papers satisfied bud almost laughed you and patchett had some talk did he call you last night no this morning why never mind its officer white isnt it its bud lynn laughed bud do you believe what pierce and i have told you yeah pretty much and you know why were humoring you you use words like that you might make me mad yes but you know yeah i know patchetts running whores maybe other stuff on the side you dont want me to report you on it thats right our motives are selfish so were cooperating you want some advice miss bracken its lynn miss bracken heres my advice keep cooperating and dont fucking ever try to bribe me or threaten me or ill have you and patchett in shit up to your ears lynn smiled bud caught it veronica lake in some turkey he saw alan ladd comes home from the war to find his bitch wife snuffed do you want a drink bud yeah plain scotch lynn walked to the kitchen came back with two short ones are they making progress on the girls killing bud knocked his back theres three men on it its a sex job so theyll round up all the usual perverts theyll give it a decent shot for a couple of weeks then let it go but you wont let it go maybe maybe not why are you so concerned old stuff old personal stuff yeah lynn sipped her drink just asking and what about the nite owl thing thats coming down to these mgcolored guys we arrested its a big fucking mess you say fuck a lot you fuck for money theres blood on your shirt is that an integral part of your job yeah do you enjoy it when they deserve it meaning men who hurt women bright girl did they deserve it today no but you did it anyway yeah just like the half dozen guys you screwed today lynn laughed actually it was two off the record did you beat up dwight gilette off the record i stuck his hand down a garbage disposal no gasp no double take did you enjoy it well no lynn coughed im being a bad hostess would you like to sit down bud sat on the sofa lynn sat an arms length over homicide detectives are different youre the first man ive met in five years who didnt tell me i look like veronica lake inside of a minute you look better than veronica lake lynn lit a cigarette thank you i wont tell your lady friend you said that how do you know i got a lady friend your jacket is a mess and reeks of perfume youre wrong this is me taking a pass on a pass which you yeah which i seldom fucking do keep cooperating miss bracken tell me about pierce patchett and this racket of his off the yeah off the record lynn smoked sipped scotch well putting what hes done for me aside pierce is a renaissance man he dabbles in chemistry he knows judo he takes good care of his body he loves having beautiful women beholden to him he had a marriage that failed he had a daughter who died very young hes very honest with his girls and he only lets us date wellbehaved wealthy men so call it a savior complex pierce loves beautiful women he loves manipulating them and making money off them but theres real affection there too when i first met pierce i told him my little sister was killed by a drunken driver he actually cried pierce patchett is a hardcase businessman and yes he runs call girls but hes a good man it played straight what else has patchett got going nothing illegal he puts business deals and movie deals together he advises his girls on business matters smut god not pierce he likes to do it not look at it or sell it yes or sell it almost too smoothlike patchetts smut hink needed a whitewash im starting to think youre snowing me theres gotta be a perv deal here sugarpimpings one thing but you make this guy out to be fucking jesus lets start with patchetts little studio lynn put out her cigarette suppose i dont want to talk about that suppose i give you and patchett to administrative vice lynn shook her head pierce thinks you have your own private vendetta going that its in your best interest to eliminate him as a suspect in whatever it is youre investigating and keep quiet about his dealings he thinks you wont inform on him that it would be stupid for you to do it stupid is my middle name what else does patchett think hes waiting for you to mention money i dont do shakedowns then why maybe im just fucking curious so be it do you know who dr terry lux is sure he runs a dryout farm in malibu hes dirty to the core correct on both counts and hes also a plastic surgeon he did a plastic on patchett right nobody his age looks that young i dont know about that what terry lux does do is alter girls for pierces little studio theres ava and kate and rita and betty read that as gardner hepburn hayworth and grable pierce finds girls with middling resemblances to movie stars terry performs plastic surgery for exact resemblances call them pierces concubines they sleep with pierce and selected clients men who can help him put together movie and business deals perverse perhaps but pierce takes a cut of all his girls earnings and invests it for them he makes his girls quit the life at thirtyno exceptions he doesnt let his girls use narcotics and he doesnt abuse them and i owe him a great deal can your policemans mentality grasp those contradictions bud said jesus fucking christ no mr white pierce morehouse patchett lux cut you to look like veronica lake lynn touched her hair no i refused pierce loved me for it im really a brunette but the rest is me and how old are you ill be thirty next month and ill be opening up a dress shop see how time changes things if youd met me a month from now i wouldnt be a whore id be a brunette who didnt look quite so much like veronica lake jesus christ no lynn margaret bracken too quickalmost a blurt look i want to see you again are you asking me for a date yeah because i cant afford what patchett charges you could wait a month no i cant no more shoptalk then i dont want to be somebodys suspect bud made a check mark in the air

looked up mickey cohen walked in holding a box of dog biscuits he said i have never killed no man that did not deserve killing by the standards of our way of life i have never distributed no obscene shit to be used for the purpose of masturbation and only took a confabulation with pete and bar englekling because of my fondness for their late father may god rest his soul even though he was a fucking kraut i do not kill innocent bystanders because its a mitzvah not to and because i adhere to the ten commandments except when it is bad for business warden hopkins told me why you was here and i made you wait because you must be stupid morons to make me for this vicious and stupid caper obviously the handiwork of stupid shvartzcs but since mickey junior likes you i will give you five

mention any other names besides cathcart no and cathcart i never met myself i heard he had a statch rape jacket so i judged him on that the bible says judge not lest ye be judged so since i am willing to be judged i say judge on mickster did you give the brothers any advice on setting up a distribution system no as god and my beloved mickey junior are my witnesses no gallaudet mick heres the key

the pornography job and theyve got nothing no cathcart no leads on the books russ went through all the nite owl field reports and got nothing bud white background checked cathcart and he reported nothing ed susie lefferts from san berdoo is just a coincidence cathcart couldnt make a smut deal happen if he tried this whole thing was the engleklings buying out of some old warrants and a dog show

between them they of course did not fmd the killer or killers spent most of their days here at the hushhush office reading back issues for clues scarfing coffee and doughnuts and ogling the comely editorial assistants who flock to hushhush because we know where the bodies are buried we at hushhush tap the inside pulse of the city of the fallen angels and we have investigated the sidsters death on our own we have gotten nowhere and we ask the los angeles police department the following questions sids pad was ransacked what happened to the ultra on the qt ultra secret and ultra hushhush files the sidster was supposed to be keepingsinuendo even too scalding for us to publish why didnt da ellis loew elected largely on the strength of a hushhush article exposing the peccadillos of his incumbent opponent give us a backscratch in return and use his legal juice to force the lapd to track down the sidsters slayer celebrity cop john jack vincennes the famous dope scourge big v was a close friend of sids and was responsible for many of his crusading exposés on the menace of narcotics why didnt jack heavily connected to ellis loewwe wont utter the word bagman but feel free to think it investigate the killing on his own out of paiship for his beloved buddy the sidster unanswerable questions for nowunless you the reading public take up the cry look for updates in future issuesand

passed without justice being done so heres some more questions where are sid hudgens ultra sintillating and sinsational secret filesthe files too hot for even scalding hushhush to handle did da loew quash the hudgens murder investigation because the crusading sidster recently published an exposé on badge of honor producerdirector max pelts and his bent for teenage girls and pelts was a five figure contributor to loews das campaign fund has loew ignored our pleas for justice because hes too busy gearing up for his spring reelection campaign is jack we wont use the word bagman vincennes again shaking down hollywoodites for contributions for brotherinlaw ellis and thus unable to investigate the sidsters death more on the bigtime big v is vincennes dopebuster supreme on the sauce and

disposition with the lapds harbor division open file were not holding our breath now dig it children all four of these gangconnected or would be gangconnected chumps were shot dead by threeman trigger gangs the cases were barely investigated because the respective investigating agencies considered the victims lowlifes whose deaths did not merit justice we wish we could say that ballistics reports indicate that the same guns were used for all three shootings but they werentalthough ripples pistols were the killers mo all three times and we at hushhush know that no interagency effort has been launched to catch the killers in fact we at hushhush are the first even to connect the crimes in theory tsk tsk we do know that jack whalen and his chief factotums are alibied up tight as a crabs pincer for the times of the killings and that mickey c and davey g have been questioned and have no idea who the bad boys are intriguing right dear reader so far no overt moves have been made to take over siesta time kingdom cohen but we have word that mickey minion morris jahelka has packed up and moved to florida scared witless and the mickster is soon to be paroled what will happen then remember dear reader you saw it here first off the record on the qt and very hushhush confidential lapd report compiled by internal affairs division dated investigating officer sgt d w fisk badge iad submitted at the request of deputy chief thad green chief of detectives subject white wendell a homicide division sir when you initiated this investigation you stated that officer white passing the sergeants exam with high marks after two failing attempts and nine years in the bureau startled you especially in the light of lt dudley smiths recent promotion to captain i have thoroughly investigated officer white and have come up with many contradictory items which should interest you since you already have access to officer whites arrest record and personnel sheet i will concentrate solely on those items white who is unmarried and without immediate family has been intimately involved on a sporadic basis with one lynn margaret bracken age for the past several years this woman the owner of veronicas dress shop in santa monica is rumored unsubstantiated by police records to be an exprostitute white who was brought into homicide by lt smith in has of course not turned into the superior case man that now capt smith assumed he would be his work under lt smith with the surveillance detail was of course legendary and resulted in whites killing two men in the line of duty since his april shooting of nite owl case collateral suspect sylvester fitch white has served under ltcapt smith with little formal distinction however rather amazingly there have been no excessive force complaints filed against him see whites personnel sheets for records of his previous dismissed complaints it is known that during those years and up until the spring of white visited paroled wife beaters and verbally andor physically abused them evidence points to the fact that these illegal forays have not recurred for almost four years white remains volatile as you know he received a departmental reprimand for punching out windows in the homicide pen when he received word that his former partner sgt r a stensland had been sentenced to death but it is known that he has sometimes avoided work with ltcapt smiths mobster squad straining his relationship with smith his bureau mentor citing the violent nature of the assignment white has been quoted as saying ive got no more stomach left for that stuff interesting when given whites reputation and past record in spring white took nine months accumulated sick leave and vacation time when capt e j exley rotated in as acting commander of homicide a wellknown hatred exists between white and capt exley deriving from the christmas brutality affair during his time off from duty white whose academy scores indicate only average intelligence and below average literacy attended criminology and forensics classes at usc and took and passed at his own expense the fbis criminal investigation procedures seminar at quantico virginia white had failed the sergeants exam twice before embarking on these studies and on his third attempt passed with a score of his sergeantcy should come in before the end of the calendar year in november r a stensland was executed at san quentin white asked for and received permission to attend the execution he spent the night before the execution on death row drinking with stensland i was told the assistant warden overlooked this infraction of prison rules out of a regard for stenslands expoliceman status capt exley also attended the execution and it is not known if he and white had words before or after the event i saved the most interesting item for last it is interesting in that it illustrates whites continued and perhaps increasing tendency to overinvolve himself in matters pertaining to abused and now murdered women ie white has shown undue curiosity in a number of unsolved prostitute killings that he believes to be connected murders that have taken place in california and various parts of the west over the past several years the victims names dods and locations of death are jane mildred hamsher san diego kathy nmi janeway los angeles sharon susan palwick bakersfield calif sally nmi dewayne needles ariz chrissie virginia renfro san francisco white has told other homicide officers that he thinks evidential similarities point to one killer and he has traveled at his own expense to the abovelisted cities where the crimes occurred naturally the detectives that white has talked to considered him a pest and were reluctant to share information with him and it is not known whether he has made progress toward solving any of the above cases lt j s dicenzo commander of the west valley station squad stated that he thinks whites hookerkilling fixation dates back to the time of the nite owl case when white became personally concerned about the murder of a young prostitute kathy janeway he was acquainted with all in all a surprising investigation personally i admire whites initiative and persistence in pursuing a sergeantcy and his albeit untoward tenacity in the matter of the prostitute homicides a list of my interview references will follow in a separate memo respectfully sgt d w fisk lad confidential lapd report compiled by internal affairs division dated investigating officer sgt donald kieckner badge iad submitted at the request of william h parker chief of police subject vincennes john sergeant surveillance detail sir you stated that you wished to explore in light of sgt vincennes deteriorating duty performance the advisability of offering him early retirement by stress pension before the twentieth anniversary of his lapd appointment comes up in may i deem that measure inappropriate at this time granted vincennes is an obvious alcoholic granted also his alcoholism cost him his job with badge of honor and thus cost the lapd a small fortune in promotional considerations granted again at he is too old to be working a highrisk assignment such as the surveillance detail as for his admittedly deteriorating performance it is only deteriorating because vincennes was during his narcotics division heyday a bold and inspired policeman from my interviews i have concluded that he does not drink on duty and that his deteriorating performance can best be summed up by sluggishness and bad reflexes moreover should vincennes reject an early retirement offer my guess is that the pension board would back him up sir i know that you consider vincennes a disgrace as a policeman i agree with you but advise you to consider his connection to district attorney loew the department needs loew to prosecute our cases as your new chief aide capt smith will tell you vincennes continues to solicit funds and run errands for loew and should loew as expected be reelected next week he would most likely intercede if you decided to pressure vincennes out of the department my recommendation is as follows keep vincennes on surveillance until when a new commander is scheduled to rotate in with his own replacement officers then assign him to menial duties in a patrol division until his retirement date arrives at that time vincennes humbled by a return to uniformed duty could probably be persuaded to separate from the department with all due speed respectfully donald j kieckner iad banner la times march loew reelected

agency investigation report required on all incoming commanders of internal affairs division los angeles police department requested by chief william h parker dear bill god we were sergeants together it seems like a million years ago and you were right i did relish the chance to slip briefly back into harness and play detective again i felt slightly treacherous interviewing officers behind ed and prestons back but again you were right firstly in your overall policy of outside agency validation for incoming ia chiefs and secondly in choosing an expoliceman predisposed to like ed exley to query brother officers on the man hell bill we both love ed which makes me happy to state that basic investigation aside the das bureau is conducting it arent they i have nothing but positives to report i spoke to a number of detective bureau men and a number of uniformed officers one consensus of opinion held ed exley is very well respected some officers considered his shooting of the nite owl suspects injudicious most considered it bold and a few tagged it as intentionally grandstanding whatever my opinion is that that act is what ed exley is most remembered for and that it has largely eclipsed the bad feelings he generated by serving as an informant in the bloody christmas matter eds jump from sergeant to captain was greatly resented but he is considered to have proven his mettle as divisional floater the man has run seven divisions in under five years established many valuable contacts and has earned the general respect of the men serving under him your basic concern that his not one of the boys nature would provoke anger when it was learned that he would be running ia seems so far to be unfounded word is out that ed will take over la early in and it is tacitly assumed that he will vigorously pursue the assignment my guess is that his reputation for sternness and intelligence will deter many potentially bent cops into sticking to the straight and narrow it is also known that ed has passed the exam for promotion to inspector and is first on the promotion list here some notes of discord appear it is generally viewed that thad green will retire in the next several years and that ed might well be chosen to replace him as chief of detectives the great majority of the men i spoke to voiced the opinion that capt dudley smith older much more experienced and more the leader type should have the job some personal observations to supplant your outside agency report eds relationship with inez soto is physically intimate but i know he would never violate departmental regs by cohabitating with her inez is a great kid by the way shes become good friends with preston ray dieterling and myself and her public relations work for dreamadreamland is near briffiant and so what if shes a mexican spoke to ia sgts fisk and kieckner about edthe two worked robbery under him are junior straightarrow exley types and are positively ecstatic that their hero is about to become their co as someone who has known ed exley since he was a child and as an expolice officer ill go on the record hes as good as his father and id be willing to bet that if you made a tally youd see that hes made more major cases than any lapd detective ever im also willing to bet that hes wise to this affectionate little ploy youve initiated all good cops have intelligence networks ill close with a favor im thinking of writing a book of reminiscences about my years with the department would it be possible for me to borrow the file on the loren atherton case without preston and ed knowing pleasei dont want them to think ive gone artyfarty in my waning years i hope this little addendum serves you well best to helen and thanks for the opportunity to be a cop again sincerely art de spain

come on bob were partners youre clean but inez was put under loose surveillance for two weeks just routine ed oh shit shes sleeping with bud white the ceremonyone big blur parker made a speech policemen were subject to the same temptations as civilians but needed to keep their baser urges in check to a greater degree in order to serve as moral exemplars for a society increasingly undercut by the pervasive influence of communism crime liberalism and general moral turpitude a morally upright exemplar was needed to command the division that served as a guarantor of police morality and captain edmund j exley war hero and hero of the nite owl murder case was that man he made a speech himself more pap on morality duane fisk and don kleckner wished him luck he read their minds through

have the smarts to pursue it the niggers escaped exley gunned them down the nite owl case was closedthe weird side bits around it forgotten years passed he went back to the janeway snuff discovered a string and little kathy made him think nite owl nite owl nite owl brainwork back in dwight gilette and cindy benavideskathy janeway kastold him a guy who came on like duke cathcart was talking up muscling cathcarts pimp business what pimp businessduke had only two skags in his stable but he had been talking up going into the smut bizat first it sounded like a pipe dream coming from a majorleague pipe dreamerbut it got validated when the englekling brothers came forward and told their story of cathcart approaching them with a deal theyd print the smut hed distribute it theyd approach mickey cohen for financing cut to facts he was inside dukes pad postnite owl it was tidied up and printwiped dukes clothes had been gone through the san bernardino yellow pages were ruffledthe pages for printing shops especially pete and bar englekling owned a printshop in san berdoo nite owl victim susan nancy lefferts was originally from san berdoo cut to the coroners report the examining pathologist based his identification of cathcarts body on two things dental plate fragments crosschecked against cathcarts prison dental records and the dc monogrammed sports jacket the stiff was wearing the plate fragments were standard california prison issueany excon whod done time in the state penal system could have plastic like that in his mouth cut to his insider skinny kathy janeway mentioned a cute scar on dukes chest there was no mention of that scar anywhere in doc laymans autopsy reportand cathcarts chest was not obliterated by shotgun pellets a final kicker the nite owl stiff was measured at cathcarts prison measurement chart listed him at conclusion a cathcart impersonator was killed at the nite owl cut to smut cindy benavides said duke was getting ready to push it ad vice was investigating smut back thenhed read through squad s reportsall the men reported no leads russ millard died the fuck book gig fell by the wayside the englekling brothers told their story of duke cathcarts smut approach how they visited mickey cohen in prison how he refused to bankroll the deal they thought cohen ordered the nite owl snuffs out of batshit moral convictionsa ridiculous ideabut what if some kind of nite owl plot got started with the mick exley submitted a report that said he and bob gallaudet talked up that theory but the jigs escaped around thenand the nite owl got pinned on them cut to his theory what if cohen told some prison punk about the cathcartenglekling planor his man davey goldman did what if the punk got paroled talked up crashing dukes stable while he was really just shoring up juice for his duke impersonation what if he killed duke stole some of his clothes and ended up at the nite owl by chancebecause duke frequented the place or more likelyas part of some kind of criminal rendezvous that went bad the killers leaving coming back with shotguns blasting the cathcart impersonator and five innocent bystanders to make it look like a robbery flaw in his theory so far hed checked mcneil parole records only negroes latins and white men too large or two small to be the cathcart impersonator were released between the time of the cohen englekling brothers meeting and the nite owl butcohen could have talked up the cathcart smut proposal word could have leaked to the outside the impersonation could have been four or five times fucking removed theories on top of theories theories that proved he had the brains to call himself a detective say the nite owl snuffs came out of smut intrigue that meant the niggers were innocent the real killers planted the shotguns in ray coates carwhich meant that the purple merc seen outside the nite owl was a coincidencethe killers couldnt have known that three spooks were recently seen discharging shotguns in griffith park and would rank as natural first suspects somehow the killers found coates car before the lapdand planted the shotguns printwiped it could have happened a half dozen ways coates in jail could have told his lawyer where the car was stashed the killers or their front man could have approached him for the informationor could have coerced him into making coates talk the jigs could have spilled the location to one of their fellow inmatesmaybe a planted inmate in with the killers his favorite because it was simplest the killers were smarter than the lapd did their own garage search checked out garages behind deserted houses firstwhile the police went at it in grids or the spooks told other inmates who got relcased and got approached by the killers orunlikelya cop finger man told them how the block search was breaking down impossible to check it all out the hall of justice jail destroyed its records to make way for more storage space or the jigs really were guilty or it was some other bunch of boogies riding around blasting the air in griffith park killing six people at the nite owl their fordchevymerc was never located because the purple paint job was homemade never listed on a dmv form brainwork from a guy who never thought he had much of a brainand he didnt make a shine gang for the snuffs because the englekling brothers sold their printshop mid then dropped off the face of the earth two years ago he issued a whereabouts bulletin no results no positive results on the cadaver bulletins hed been tracking statewide zilch on the brothers no stiffs that might be the real duke cathcart and six months ago following up in san berdoo he got a hot lead he found a san berdoo townie whod seen susan nancy lefferts with a man matching duke cathcarts descriptiontwo weeks before the nite owl killings he showed him some cathcart mugshots the man said close but no cigar the nite owl forensic had susan nancy flailing to touch the man sitting at the next table duke cathcart really the impersonator supposedly unknown to her why were they sitting at different tables the kicker he tried to interview sue lefferts mother a chance to run the boyfriend by her she refused to talk to him why bud packed up mementoes ten pounds of paper stalemates for nowno new whore leads the nite owl dead until he braced mickey cohen out to the

dividing line between the old police work and the new the old system of promotion through patronage and enforcement through intimidation and a new emerging system the elite police corps that impartially asserts its authority in the name of a stern and unbiased justice that punishes its own with a stern moral vigor should they prove duplicitous to the higher moral standards an elite corps demands of its members and finally we are the protectors of the public image of the los angeles police department know that when you read interdepartmental complaints filed against your brother

russ millard commanding the division a pornography investigation running concurrent with the nite owl and a big anomaly assigned to trace smut vincennes repeatedly reported no leads commented that the

april of do that then locate them a half hour for results sergeant george henderson officer thomas kifka retired sergeant lewis stathis working bunco ed called his co stathis walked in ten minutes later a burly mantall stooped nervousan ia bracing out of nowhere was a spooker ed pointed him to a chair stathis said sir this is about sergeant this has nothing to do with you this has to do with an officer you worked ad vice with captain my ad vice tour was years ago i know late through the summer of you transferred out just as i rotated in on my floater assignment sergeant how closely did you work with jack vincennes stathis smiled ed said why are you grinning well i read in the paper that vincennes juked these two heist guys and talk around the bureau has it that he bugged out on the scene unannounced thats a big infraction so i was smiling cause it figured hed be the ad vice guy youd be interested in i see and did you work closely with him stathis shook his head jack was strictly the singleo type you know the beat of a different drummer sometimes we worked the same general assignments but that was it your squad worked a pornography investigation in the spring of do you recall that yeah it was a colossal waste of time dirty skin books a waste of time you yourself reported no leads yeah and neither did trashcan or the other guys russ millard got coopted to that nite owl thing and the skin book caper fell through do you recall vincennes acting strangely during that time not really i remember he only showed up at the squadroom at odd times and that him and russ millard didnt like each other like i said vincennes was a loner he didnt pal around with the guys on the squad do you recall millard making specific queries of the squad when two printshop operators came forward with smut information stathis nodded yeah something to do with the nite owl that didnt pan out we all told old russ that those skin books could not be traced hell or high water one hunch going dry sergeant the department was running a fever with the nite owl back then can you recall how vincennes reacted to it any little thing out of the ordinary stathis said sir can i be blunt of course well then ill tell you that i always figured vincennes was a cheapshot cop on the take somehow put that aside i remember he was sort of nervous around the time of the skin book job on the nite owl id say he was bored with it he was in on the arrest of those colored guys he was there when our guys found the car and the shotguns and he still seemed bored by it coming on againno facts just instincts sergeant think vincennes behavior around the time of the nite owl and the pornography investigation anything out of the ordinary with him think stathis shrugged maybe one thing but i dont think it amounts to tell me anyway well back then vincennes had the cubicle next to mine and sometimes i could hear him pretty good i was at my desk and heard part of a conversation him and dudley smith and and smith asked vincennes to put a tail on bud white he said whited gotten personally involved in a hooker homicide and he didnt want him doing nothing rash skin pricldes what else did you hear i heard vincennes agree and the rest of it was garbled this was during the nite owl investigation yes sir right in the middle of it sergeant do you remember sid hudgens the scandal sheet man being killed around that time yeah an unsolved do you recall vincennes talking about it no but the rumor was that him and hudgens were buddies ed smiled sergeant thank you this was off the record but i dont want you to repeat our conversation do you understand stathis got up i wont but i feel bad about vincennes i heard hes topping out his twenty in a few months maybe he vamoosed cause shooting those heist guys got to him ed said good day sergeant something old wrong ed sat with his door open goldbraided flags just outside opportunities knocked vmcennes might have dirt on bud white instincts trash

proper decorum what did you say your name was again sergeant white sergeant white then i will tell you there is no end to the grief in my life i am like jesus your goy savior carrying the weight of the world on his back back in prison these fershtunkener goons attack me and my man davey goldman davey gets his brains scrambled gets paroled and starts walking around in public with his shlong hanging out its big i dont blame him for advertising but the beverly hills cops aint so enlightened and now hes doing ninety days observation at the camarillo nut bin as if that is not enough grief

davey true i am well known for my cell business confabs but not a soul on this earth did i tell i told that guy exley that when we sbmoozed on the topic years ago and heres a bonus insight from the

those shvartzes the hero kid bumped took the ticket and probably did the job anyway bud said i dont think duke cathcart was killed at the nite owl i think it was a guy impersonating him i think the

uniform chafedhe hadnt worn it since exley looked creepyskinny grayhaired rimless glasses that made his eyes come off brutal i was wondering my guess is ellis had seconds thoughts on the complaint he filed bad publicity and all that exley shook his head loew considers you a liability to his career and his marriage and leaving that crime scene and assaulting that officer are enough in themselves to warrant a suspension and a dismissal yeah then why havent i been suspended because for the moment ive interceded with loew and chief parker any other questions yeah wheres the tape recorder and the steno i didnt want them here jack pulled his chair up captain what do you want ill throw that back at you do you want to flush your career down the toilet or would you like to skate for a few months and cash out your twenty easy karens face when he told her okay ill play now what do you want exley leaned close in the spring of your friend and business associate sid hudgens was murdered and two detectives who worked the case under russ millard told me you referred to hudgens as scum and were visibly agitated on the morning his body was discovered during this time frame dudley smith asked you to tail bud white and you agreed during this time frame the nite owl case was active and you worked a pornography investigation with ad vice and repeatedly submitted nolead reports when your longstanding procedure was to jam every report you wrote full of filler during this time two men peter and barter englekling came forward to offer states evidence on an alleged pornography link to the nite owl russ millard queried you on it you went along with your no leads routine throughout the smut investigation you repeatedly urged that the job be dropped those same two detectives sergeants fisk and kieckner overheard you urging ellis loew to softpedal the hudgens investigation and one of your fellow ad vice officers recalls you as being atypically nervous throughout the smut job and absent from the squadroom for unusually long periods of time put it all together for me would you jack ten counts guiltyhe knew he was gawking blinking twitching how the fuck did you it doesnt matter now lets hear your interpretation of what i want jack caught some breath okay so i tailed bud white dud was afraid hed go apeshit over some hooker snuff cause white had that tendency where young stuff was concerned okay so i tailed him and didnt pick up anything worth a damn you and white hate each other everyone knows it you figure someday hell try to get you for your job on dick stensland and youll cut me slack with loew and parker in exchange for some dirt on him is that what you want call that twenty percent of it and give me something you learned about white such as how about him and women white likes women but thats no news flash iad ran a personal on white after he passed the sergeants exam the report had him seeing a woman named lynn bracken did white know her back in jack shrugged i dont know i never heard that name vincennes your face says youre a liar but put the bracken woman aside she doesnt interest me was white seeing inez soto during the time you were tailing him he almost laughed no not while i had my tail on him is that what youre so worked up on you think white and your exley raised a hand im not going to ask you if you killed hudgens im not going to make you put that spring together for me not yet and maybe never just give me your opinion on something you were up to your ears on the smut job and you worked the nite owl do you make the three negroes for the killings jack inched backget away from those eyes theres loose ends out there i knew it then if it wasnt the three you got maybe it was some other spooks maybe they knew where coates hid his car and planted the shotguns maybe its tied to the smut do you care those niggers raped your woman so what you did was right whats this about captain exley smiled jack pegged it a man sticking one foot off a cliff hopping on one leg captain whats this no my motives are my business and heres my first guess hudgens was connected to the smut somehow and he had a file on you thats why you were all over that mess quicksand yeah i did something really bad once you know shit sometimes i think sometimes i think i dont care who finds out anymore exley stood up ive already squared the complaints against you therell be no trial board no charges part of the agreement i made with chief parker is a stipulation that you voluntarily retire in may i told him youd agree and i convinced him that you deserve a full pension he didnt question my motives and i dont want you to question them either jack stood up and the trade if the nite owl ever goes wide you and everything you know belong to me jack stuck out his hand jesus you turned into a cold son of a bitch calendar februarymarch whisper magazine february issue wrong man killed in nite owl slaughter web of mystery spreads you remember the nite owl brouhaha dont you on april three shotguntoting killers entered the convivial nite owl coffee shop just off hollywood boulevard in sunny los angeles robbed and murdered three employees and three patrons and got away with an estimated three hundred scoots which divided by six comes to about fifty bucks a life the los angeles police department threw itself into the case with characteristic zeal arrested three young negro men on suspicion of committing the murders and also charged them with kidnapping and raping a young mexican girl the lapd was not quite certain that the three negroesraymond sugar ray coates tyrone jones and leroy fontainecommitted the nite owl killings but they were sure that the young men were the rapists of inez soto a college student the nite owl investigation continued with much attendant publicity and great pressure on the lapd to solve las crime of the century the lapd pursued fruitless leads for two weeks then discovered the murder weapons

thickens again now whisper is the underdog of what the squaresyule press calls scandal sheet journalism were not the mighty hushhush were based out of new york and our beat is primarily the east coast but we do have our la sources and among them is a crusading private eye who wishes to remain anonymous this man has been obsessed with the nite owl case for years has investigated it extensively and has come up with some startling revelations this man whom we shall call private eye x spoke to whisper correspondents and revealed the following private eye eyetem during the nite owl investigation two brothers peter and baxter englekling printshop operators from san bernardino california came forth and told authorities an account of how nite owl victim delbert duke cathcart approached them with a plan to print pornographic material then theorized that the nite owl killings were the result of intrigue within the pornography underworld the lapd poohpoohed the brothers theory in their haste to pin the crime on the negroes and now the engleklings seem to have disappeared off the face of the globe private eye eyetem mrs hilda lefferts mother of san bernardino born and bred nite owl victim susan nancy lefferts told private eye x that immediately before the killings her daughter had a mysterious unnamed boyfriend who greatly resembled duke cathcart and she even heard him tell susan nancy call me duke get used to the idea mrs lefferts could not identifyr the man from privately hoarded mugshots that private eye x showed her x then developed what we consider an xcellent and xciting theory x theory eyetem we think that mystery boyfriend x killed duke cathcart in an attempt to take over his pornography business impersonated duke cathcart and wound up at the nite owl coffee shop to do biz with the three men who perpetrated the slaughter susan nancy sat nearby in order to watch her boyfriend wheel and deal private eye x offers the following unimpeachable evidence as proof mrs lefferts said boyfriend x looked just like duke cathcart the body identified as cathcarts was too decimated to correctly id the coroners final identification was based on a partial dental plate reconstruction crosschecked against cathcarts prison dental recordsyet other prison records listed cathcarts height at while the body discovered at the nite owl was all in all unmistakable proof that an impersonator not duke cathcart was killed at the nite owl coffee shop xciting xtrapolations that we believe will lead to some xtremely interesting revelations xasperate the triggerhappy los angeles police department and perhaps xonerate the three negroes falsely accused of the nite owl killings we at whisper urge the los angeles district attorneys office to xhume the bodies of the nite owl victims we xcoriate captain ed exley for his coldblooded murder of four societal victims and xpressly petition the lapd redeem your old wrongs in the name of justice reopen the nite owl case extract san francisco chronicle february gaitsville slayings baffle police gaitsville calif feb a bizarre double murder has the citizens of gaitsville a small town sixty miles north of san francisco scaredand the mann county sheriffs baffled two days ago the bodies of peter and barter englekling and were discovered at their apartment next door to the printshop where they were employed as typesetters the two brothers in the words of mann county sheriffs lieutenant eugene hatcher were shady characters with criminal connections the lieutenant guardedly elaborated to chronicle reporter george woods both engleklings had criminal records for narcotics offenses lieutenant hatcher said granted theyve been clean for a number of years but they were still shady characters for instance they were working at the printing shop under assumed names so far we have no clues but we do think were dealing with a tortureforinformation scenario the englekling brothers worked at rapid bobs printing on east verdugo road in gaitsville and lived in the apartment building next door their employer robert dunkquist knew the pair as pete and bar girard and discovered their bodies on tuesday morning pete and bar had worked for me for a year and they were as regular as clockwork when they were late for work on tuesday i knew something was up also the shop had been ransacked and i wanted them to help me find the culprits the englekling brothers whose true identities were revealed by a fingerprint teletype check were shot to death and lieutenant hatcher is certain the killer used a revolver equipped with a silencer our baffistics man found iron shavings embedded in the rounds we took out of the victims this indicates a silencer and also indicates why the neighbors never reported any shots lieutenant hatcher would not reveal the status of his investigation but he did state that all the standard investigatory approaches are being utilized he stated that both victims were tortured prior to being shot but would not describe the crime scene we want to keep that knowledge private he said sometimes publicityseeking lunatics confess to crimes like this even though they didnt commit them keeping your facts private helps eliminate the guilty from the innocent peter and barter englekling have no known living relatives and their bodies are being held at the gaitsville city coroners office lieutenant hatcher urged all parties who might have information concerning the homicides to contact the mann county sheriffs department extract san francisco examiner march murder victims linked to

hung up we verified it with the das bureau down in la and they said it was true i dont think it has anything to do with our case but i called the los angeles police department anyway and ran it by

robbed and shotgunned to death at a hollywood coffee shop in april was solved incorrectly at a great cost to justice we want to see the case reopened and true justice achieved raymond coates leroy fontaine and tyrone jonesdo you recall those names they were the three negro youths criminals and sex offenders to be sure who were railroaded by the los angeles police department arrested shortly after the nite owl murders they offered a heffish alibi they could not have committed the killings because they were engaged in the kidnap and gang rape of a young woman named inez soto they abused miss soto at a deserted building in south los angeles then confessed that they drove her around and sold her out to their friends for more sexual abuse they left miss soto with a man named sylvester fitch and an lapd officer shot and killed him while effecting the brave young womans escape miss soto refused to cooperate with the police investigation which at the time centered on the imperative of establishing where coates jones and fontaine were at the time of the nite owl killings were they with her and the other alleged rapists none of whom besides fitch were ever identified did they have time to drive from south los angeles to hollywood commit the nite owl killings then return to heap more abuse upon her was she conscious throughout the total sum of her degradation unanswered questionsuntil now the police investigation spread into two forks searching for evidence to corroborate jones coates and fontaine as the killers searching for general evidence standard police work based on the supposition that the three youths were guilty only of kidnap and rape but not murder miss soto still refused to cooperate both investigatory forks proved moot when coates jones and fontaine escaped from jail and were gunned down by our aforementioned hero lapd sergeant edmund exley college man world war ii hero son of the illustrious preston exley ed exley used the nite owl case as a springboard for his ruthless personal ambition he was promoted to captain at age and as of this writing will soon become an inspectorat the youngest in lapd history he is mentioned as a potential republican officeseeker almost as often as his constructionking father a few persistent rumors surround him that the men killed were unarmed that da ellis loew dreamed up the nite owl confession that coates jones and fontaine allegedly made before they escaped what is not generally known is that ed exley was in love with inez soto and condoned her lack of cooperation during the investigation later bought her a house and has been intimately involved with her for close to five years and now two recent developments have blown the nite owl case wide open back in two men brothers came forward as material wimesses with information on the nite owl killings those men peter and baxter englekling asserted that a pornography plot was at the base of the coffee shop massacre per a scheme devised by one of the victims exconvict delbert duke cathcart the lapd chose to ignore this information then almost five years later peter and baxter englekling were viciously murdered in the small upstate town of gaitsville those kiffings which took place on february are unsolved with a complete absence of clues but a longunanswered question was about to be answered at san quentin penitentiary a negro prisoner named otis john shottell read a san francisco newspaper account of the englekling brothers killings an account which mentioned their tenuous connection to the nite owl case the article got otis john shortell thinking he requested an audience with the assistant warden and made a startling confession otis john shortell in prison on an accumulation of grandtheft auto convictions and franldy desiring a sentence reduction as a reward for his cooperation confessed that he was one of the men coates fontaine and jones sold inez soto to he was with miss soto and the three youths between the hours of and on the morning of the nite owl killings during the entire murder time frame he told the warden that he never came forward to exonerate the three for fear of rape charges being filed against him he further stated that coates had a large quantity of narcotics in his car and that that was the reason he never relinquished its location to the police shortell cited a recent conversion to pentecostal christianity as his reason for finally making his confession but prison authorities were dubious shortell petitioned for an incell lie detector test to prove his veracity and was given a total of four polygraph examinations he passed all four tests conclusively shortells attorney morris waxman has sent notarized copies of the polygraph examiners reports to the daily news and the lapd we have advanced this article what will the lapd do we decry the injustice of shotgun justice we decry the motives of triggerman ed exley we openly challenge the los angeles police department to reopen the nite owl murder case extract la times march nite owl hue and cry building a welter of unrelated events and a fire fanned by a series of articles in the los angeles daily news are pressuring the los angeles police department to reopen the nite owl murder case investigation lapd chief william h parker called the controversy a powder keg with a wet fuse its all a bunch of baloney the testimony of a degenerate criminal and an unrelated double murder do not constitute a reason to reopen a case successfully solved five years ago i stood by captain ed exleys actions in and i stand by them now chief parkers references allude to the february murders of peter and baxter englekling material witnesses to the original nite owl investigation and the recent testimony of san quentin inmate otis john shortell who claimed to be with the three formerly accused killers during the time frame of the nite owl murders citing shottells inprison lie detector tests his attorney morris waxman stated polygraphs dont lie otis is a religious man who carries a great burden of guilt for not coming forth to exonerate innocent men five years ago and now he wants to see justice done he has given three dead victims a lie detector validated alibi and now he wants to see the real killers punished i will not cease publicizing this matter until the lapd agrees to do their duty and reopen the case richard tunstell city editor of the los angeles daily news echoed that sentiment weve got our teeth sunk into something important were not going to let go banners la daily news march

been through this thing should be cake ed rubbed his eyes im not so sure itll pass i think it will the gaitsville police wont cooperate on the englekling homicides and that negro at quentin has nil

and dont interrupt me and dont tell me youre so suicidally naive as to think reopening the case will do one whit of good now im waiting for it to pass and the attorney general up in sacramento is

especially since a little birdie in sacramento has informed me that the attorney general will soon press to reopen the case ellis loew has an injunction prepared should things get dicey so i think it is safe to assume that the nite owl is regrettably our hot potato once again political infighting lad the pinko democrats have taken the tack of jigaboos wrongly accused intend to press the issue

series of criminal conspiracies at least five years old resulting in no fewer than four and perhaps as many as a dozen major crimes the other men filed inparker dudley smith ellis loew nods quick sitdowns parker said were reopening the ags office wants to usurp the job but ellis has filed a restraining order against them which should buy us two weeks time weve got two weeks to clear the case and recover the respect we lost weve got two weeks before sacramento comes down here and makes us a laughingstock i want this case cleared legally inviolate and in the hands of the grand jury within twelve days do you understand gentlemen nods all around loew said im personally in a difficult position here since coates jones and fontaine did confess to me on reflection i must admit that they were stupid and naive boys psychologically susceptible to suggestion so smith cut in ellis thats blood under the bridge we simply got the wrong coloreds not the ones who fired off those shotguns in griffith park the real culprits are some smart darktown strutters who knew where coates stashed his car then planted the weapons lads who knew niggertown well and simply beat us to the location the purple car seen by the nite owl was just a coincidence that the killers capitalized on i think the griffith park car was stolen or out of state and in any event i think its not applicable we have to begin by shaking down the southside again ed smiledsmiths tack played into his plan essentially i agree and ive got one of my ia men checking old registrations but arent we ahead of ourselves shouldnt we set up a chain of command first loew coughed ed i think your shooting those thugs was a noble act whatever your motives but i think giving you the command would just make the press and the public more resentful i think you should take a subsidiary role in this investigation outrage down pat im tired of being the bad guy on the six oclock news and im tired of my sex life in the papers im also the best detective in the parker cut in you are the best detective we have and i understand your need to cut your losses but ellis is right this is too personal with you ive given dudley the command hell recruit a team from homicide and various squadrooms and take it from there and me do i get a piece of the case parker nodded ill give you anything within reason the kill i want the chance to develop my own evidence with ia autonomy i want the use of my two personal aides from ia and my choice of two officers to serve as field runners thats fine by me dudley yes i think thats fair lad who did you have in mind for runners jack vincennes and bud white smith almost gawked parker said strange bedfellows but then its a strange case twelve days gentlemen not one minute longer chapter

wing on my house and found not a thing amiss young man youre a policeman arent you jack shook his headit felt sludgy lady what are you teffing me im telling you that mr private eye policeman or whatever crawled around under my house two months or so ago because i told him susan nancys beau did the same thing right after this ruckus they had with this other fellow right before that nite owl thing that you people keep tormenting me over may susie and the other victims rest in peace all he found were rodents not signs of foul play so there so there granny pointed to a crawlspace flush with the groundso there it fucking could not be bud white did not have the brains to let a card that strong sit jack took a flashlight down underhilda lefferts stood watching so there dust rot mothball stinklight on dirt rats rat eyes glowing burlap mothballs gristlecaked bones a skull with a hole between the eyes chapter fiftyfour ed watched lynn bracken through the twoway kleckner was questioning her a nice guy setup for mr bad guyhimself shed been repentothaled ray pinker was testing her blood three hours in a cell hadnt broken hershe was still lying with style ed turned the speaker up kleckner im not saying that i dont believe you im just saying my policemans experience has shown me that pimps usually hate women so i dont buy patchett as such a philanthropist you have to look at his background how he lost a little girl to crib death im sure your policemans mentality can grasp the cause and effect even if you cant accept it lets talk about his background then youve described patchett as a fmancier with la roots going back thirty years youve said that he puts deals together so be specific about the deals lynn sighedpure panache movie financing deals real estate and contracting deals heres one for all you movie fans in the audience pierce told me hed financed a few of raymond dieterlings early shorts cozy bud whites girlfriends pimp knew preston exleys good buddy kleckner changed tape ed studied the whore beautifula good part of it hung on the fact that she wasnt perfect her nose was too pointed she had crease lines on her forehead big shoulders big handsbeautifully formed all the more stunning for being large blue eyes that probably danced when a man said the right thing she probably thought bud white had primitive integrity and respected him for not trying to impress her with gifts he didnt have she kept her clothing subtle because she knew it would make more of an impression on the people she wanted to impress she thought most men were weak and trusted her brains to slide her through anything suppositions leading up to a hunch couple her brains with the counterdope in her system and you got a pentothalimmune witness dissembling with impunityand style captain you got a call its vincennes fisk had his phone stretched to the end of the cord ed took it vincennes yeah and listen close cause that scandal sheet story was kosher and theres lots more white yeah white was that phony pi and he braced old lady lefferts two months or so ago she told him that story of her daughters boyfriend who looked like duke cathcart and another doozie what just listen a couple weeks before the nite owl a neighbor saw susie and the boyfriend alone at the house and heard them get into a ruckus with another guy the boyfriend was seen crawling around under the house later that same day now when white braced the old lady he called pc bell and checked their records for toll calls from the house to la midmarch to midapril i did the same thing and got three tollers all to a pay phone in hollywood near the nite owl now you think thats hot you goddammit captain listen white crawled around under the house and told granny there was nothing there i went under and found a stiff wrapped in mothballs to kill the stink and a fucking bullet hole in the head i got doc layman up to san berdoo he brought duke carthcarts prison dental file the coroners office copy it was a perfect match the first id was bogus off a partial plate just like that article said fuck i cant believe white put all this together and just left the stiff there captain you there ed grabbed fisk wheres bud white fisk looked scared i heard he went up north with dudley smith the mann sheriffs decided to kick loose on the engleklings back to trashcan that article said the woman saw some mugs yeah white brought back some shots marked state records bureau now we both know the state sets run light so my guess is white didnt want to bring her down here to check our books anyway she couldnt id the boyfriend and if the boyfriend was one of the nite owl stiffs well have him cause nort layman took prison dental plate fragments out of his head back in bring her down show her our books do it fisk took the phone ray pinker walked up holding a chem sheet prestilphyozine captain its an extremely rare experimental antipsychotic drug used to tranquilize violent mental patients somebody professional slipped it to our lady friend because only a pro would know this breed of phyozine would be likely to counteract penthothal skipper you should sit down you look like youre about to have a coronary chemistry whiz patchett the englekling brothers father a themist who developed antipsychotic compounds bud whites whore across the glassalone now a tape recorder spinning ed walked in lynn said you again thats right dont you have to charge me or release me not for another sixtyeight hours arent you violating my constitutional rights constitutional rights have been waived for this one this one dont play dumb this one is pierce patchett distributing pornography including picturebook photographs that exactly match the mutilations on a murder victim namely his late partner sid hudgens this one is one of the supposed nite owl victims tied in to a conspiracy to distribute that pornography and your friend bud white withholding major evidence on who the real victim was now white told you to cooperate and you came here under the influence of a drug to counteract penthothal thats against you but you can still save yourself and white a lot of trouble by cooperating bud can look after himself and you look terrible your face is all red ed sat down turned off the tape you dont even feel the dosage do you i feel like ive had four martinis and four martinis just make me that much more lucid patchett sent you in without a lawyer to buy time i know it he knows you were called in as part of the nite owl reopening so he knows hes a material witness at least personally i dont see him as a killer i know a great deal about patchetts various enterprises and you can save him a great deal of trouble by cooperating with me lynn smiled bud said you were quite smart what else did he say that you were a weak angry man competing with your father let it pass then lets concentrate on my smarts patchett is a chemist and it may be reaching but im betting he studied under franz englekling a pharmacologist who developed drugs such as the antipsychotic compound patchett put you under to beat the pentothal englekling had two sons who were murdered in northern california last month those two men came forward during the base nite owl investigation and mentioned a quote crazy sugar daddyo unquote who had access to lots of quote highclass call girls unquote obviously patchett obviously tied to a wouldbe smut merchant named duke cathcart one of the alleged nite owl victims obviously patchett is all over this thing and in for some trouble he doesnt need and you can help circumvent lynn lit a cigarette so youre very very smart yes and im a very good detective with a fiveyear backlog of withheld evidence to work from i know about your fileburning episode i know about patchetts proposed extortion plan with hudgens ive read the deposition vincennes bargained you with and i know all about patchetts various enterprises including fleurdelis so youre assuming that pierce has some very damaging information on vincennes yes which the district attorney and i will quash in the interest of protecting the reputation of the los angeles police department fluster lynn dropped her cigarette fumbled her lighter ed said you and patchett cant win ive got twelve days to square this thing right and if i cant do it im going to start looking for subsidiary indictments theres at least a dozen i can hang on patchett and believe me if i dont make this case ill do anything i can to make myself look good lynn stared at him ed stared back patchett made you didnt he you were a pompom girl from bisbee arizona and a whore he taught you how to dress and talk and think and i am very impressed with the results but ive got twelve days to keep my life out of the toilet and if i cant do it im going to take you and patchett down lynn turned on the tape player pierce patchetts whore for the record im not afraid of you and ive never loved bud white more it makes me happy that he withheld evidence and got the better of you and youre a fool for underestimating him i used to be jealous of him sleeping with inez soto but now i respect the poor girls good sense in leaving a moral coward for a man ed pressed erase stop start for the record sixtyseven hours to go and my next interrogation wont be so cordial kleckner opened the door passed him a

completion ed pushed a carocean to foothills his fathers voice i thought youd be working south central today ed turned around what preston smiled i thought youd be making up for your recent bad press non sequitursthe atherton photos came back father excuse me but i dont know what youre talking about preston laughed weve seen each other so seldom lately that weve forgotten the amenities father theres something im sorry i was referring to dudley smiths statement to the herald today he said the reopening investigation was being centered on the southside that youre looking for another negro gang no thats not the way its going preston put a hand on his shoulder you look frightened edmund you do not look like a ranking policeman and you did not come here to enjoy my completion celebration the hand felt warm father outside of the department whos seen the old atherton photographs now ill say what youre referring to the photographs in the case file the ones i showed you and thomas years ago yes son what are you talking about those photographs are sealed lapd evidence never released to the press or the public now tell me father the nite owl is collateral to several other major crimes and negro gangs have nothing to do with it one of them is then explain the evidence the way i taught you ive had cases like nobody has ever had a case like this im a better detective than you ever were and ive never had a case like this preston clamped both hands downed felt his shoulders go numb im sorry for that but its true and ive got a fiveyearold mutilation homicide connected to the nite owl case that says so the victim was cut identically to loren athertons victims and identical to some inkembossed pornographic photographs tangential to the nite owl which means that either somebody saw the atherton pictures and took it from there or you got the wrong suspect in the man didnt even blink loren atherton was incontrovertibly guilty with a confession and eyewitness vertification you and thomas saw his photographs and i doubt seriously that those photographs have ever left the homicide pen downtown unless you hypothesize a policeman killer which i find absurd then the only explanation is that atherton showed the photographs to some person or persons prior to his arrest you got the wrong men in your glory casei did not make that error think before you raise your voice to your father ed stepped backhis legs brushed the model broke off a piece of freeway i apologize and i should be asking your advice not competing with you father is there anything about the atherton case you havent told me apology accepted and no there isnt you art and i went over the case constantly during our seminar period and i expect that you know it as well as i do did atherton have any known associates preston shook his head emphatically no he was the very model of a psychotic loner a deep breath i want to interview ray dieterling why because one of his child stars was killed by atherton no because a witness identified dieterling as a ka of a criminal tangential to the nite owl how long ago thirty years or so this persons name pierce patchett preston shrugged ive never heard of him and i dont want you bothering raymond emphatically no a thirtyyearold acquaintanceship does not warrant bothering a man of ray dieterlings stature ill ask ray about him and report back to you will that suffice ed looked at the model hypnotic la grown huge exley construction containing it his fathers hands gentle now son youve come very far and youve earned my respect absolutely youve taken a beating for inez and those men you killed and i think youre bearing up strongly for now though i want you to consider this the nite owl case got you where you are today and a quick resolution on the reopening will keep you there collateral homicide investigations however compelling might seriously distract you from your main objective and thus destroy your career please remember that ed squeezed his fathers hands absolute justice remember that chapter fiftyfive both crime scenes sealedthe printshop the pad next door one mann sheriffa fat guy named hatcher a lab man talking nonstop crime scene the back room at rapid bobs printing bud scoped dudley nonstop flashing back to his pitch we thought you were going to kill him so we stopped you im sorry if we were untoward but you were a handful hinton is associated with some very bad people and ill elaborate in all due time he didnt press itdud might have stuff on him lynn in custody exleys slap in the face the lab man pointed to a rack of dumped shelves okay so the front of the shop looked hunkydory so our perpetrator didnt bother with it we found cigarette butts in an ashtray here two brands so lets assume the engleklings were working late lets assume the perpetrator picked the front door lock tiptoed up and got the drop on them glove prints on the jamb of the connecting door so that backs it up he comes in he makes our boys open those cabinets i showed you he doesnt find what he wants he gets pissed and yanks those shelves to the floor glove prints on the fourth shelf up indicate a righthanded man of average height the brothers open the boxes that spilled offwe got a whole load of smudged latents that indicate pete and bax were a bit panicked by this time so the perpetrator obviously didnt find what he wanted and marched our boys across the driveway to their apartment gentlemen follow me out the door across an alley the lab guy carried a flashlight bud stuck to the back lynn cockyconvinced she could beat truth juice with her brains dud probably had his own insider leadsbut he still kept talking up niggers the lab man said note the dirt on the driveway on the morning the bodies were found our tech crew discovered and photographed three sets of footmarks too shallowly placed to make exemplers from two sets walking ahead of a single set which indicates a march at gunpoint over to a bungalow court dudley stone quieton the plane he hardly talked would whisper hit play the stiff under the house against exleyho w tape on the doorhatcher peeled it off the lab man opened up with a pass key lights insidebud squeezed in first a shamblesall forensicked up blood spills on a walltowall carpettapemarked glass tubes on the floorcircled held in seethrough evidence bags scattered around photo negativesdozenscracked scalded surfaces overturned chairs a dumped dresser a sofa with the stuffing ripped out tucked in the largest rip a glassine bag tagged heroin the lab guy spieled those tubes contain chemicals that weve idd as antipsychotic drugs the negatives were mostly too blurred to identify but we were able to figure out that most of them were pornographic photographs the images were mostly burned off with chemicals taken from the refrigerator in the kitchen our boys owned a whole cornucopia of corrosive solutions ill hypothesize here peter and baxter englekling were tortured before they were shot to deaththat we know i think the killer showed them each negative individually asked them questions then burned themand the pictures what was he looking for i dont know maybe he wanted the picture participants identified we found a magnifying glass under the couch so im leaning toward that theory now also note the plastic bag marked heroin extruding from the couch the contents of which of course we locked up four bags total in a safe little hideyhole the killer left a small fortune in salable dope behind into the kitchen more chaos the icebox openspilling tubes bottles marked with chemical symbols stacked by the sink something like printing press plates the tech man pointed to the mess another hypothesis gentlemen in my crime scene report youll note that ive listed no less than twentysix separate chemical substances found on the premises the killer tortured pete and bax englekling with chemicals and he knew which chemicals would scald flesh id call his torture method a means of opportunity so im betting the man had an engineering a medical or a chemistry background now the bedroom bud thought patchett back to the bedroom blood drops in the hall along the way a small room a twelvebytwelve slaughterhouse two body outlinesone on the bed one on the floor dried blood tapetotape both places clothesline sash wrapped around the bedposts more sash on the floor taped circles on the bedsheets the floor a nightstand by the bed a bullet hole circled on one wall a forensic display on a corkboard more scalded negatives lab man just glove prints and englekling prints on the negatives we dusted every one of them then placed most of them back in their original locations the ones on the board were found here in the bedroom which as you can tell was where the torture and the killings took place now those small circles on the bed and elsewhere indicate sections of torso arm and leg tissue scalded off the englekling brothers and if you look closely at the floor youll be able to see patches of singed carpet caused by chemical spills both men were shot twice with a silencerfitted revolver baffling threads we took off the shells indicate the silencer and indicate why no shots were heard the bullet hole in the wall is our one real lead and its easy to reconstruct what happened bax englekling got free of his bonds got ahold of the gun and fired a wounding shot before the killer got the gun back and shot him the shell we took out of the wall had shredded caucasian flesh and gray arm hair stuck to it along with plus blood both englekling boys were abminus so we know the perpetrator was hit the blood drops leading out to the living room and the negatives that he took out to look at indicate that it wasnt a major wound lieutenant hatchers crew found a bloodsoaked plus towel in a sewer down the street so that was his tourniquet my last hypothesis is that this bastard really had a hardon for those negatives hatcher spoke up and weve got nothing weve canvassed two dozen times weve got no eyewitnesses and those goddamned brothers did not have a single ka that weve been able to turn we hit doctors offices emergency rooms train stations airports and bus stations looking for sightings of a wounded man and got nothing if the brothers had an address book it was taken nobody saw anything or heard anything like my science buddy says our guy really had a boner for those negatives which mightand i emphasize mighthave something to do with our victims coming forth on that nite owl case of yours years ago they had a dirtypicture theory then right dudley said they did indeed quite unsubstantiated and the la papers said you just reopened the case yes thats correct captain i regret that we didnt decide to cooperate with you earlier but put that aside have you got anything to give me on the new end of your case that i can use dudley smiled chief parker has authorized me to secure a copy of your case file to read he said that if i find evidential links to our homicides hell release a transcription of the englekling brothers testimony which you say pertains to pornography which our case sure as hell does dudley lit a cigarette yes if it doesnt pertain to heroin just as much hatcher snorted captain if our boy got his chops licked over white horse hed have stolen that stuff stashed in the couch yes or the killer was simply a frothingatthemouth psychopath who evinced a psychopathic reaction to the negatives for unfathomable reasons of his own frankly the heroin angle interests me have you any evidence that the brothers were either selling or manufacturing it hatcher shook his head none and as far as our case goes i dont think it plays have you got a pornography angle on the reopening no not as yet again after ive read your case file ill be in touch hatcherready to bust captain you came all the way up here for our evidence and you got nothing to give in return i came up here at the urging of chief parker who pledges his full cooperation should your case warrant reciprocity big words sahib that i dont like the sound of getting uglydudley dug in with a big blarney smile bud walked out to the curb dug in by their rental scared standing on go dudley walked out hatcher and the lab man locked the printshop bud said i dont follow you at all these days boss starting when lad lets try last night with hinton dudley laughed you were your old cruel self last night it warmed my heart and convinced me that the extracurricular work i have planned for you remains within your grasp what work in due time what happened to hinton we released him wellchastised and terrified of sergeant wendell white yeah but what were you pressing him on lad you have your extracurricular secrets i have mine well hold a clarification session soon go no i just want to know where we both stand on the nite owl now edmund exley lad we both stand there whatscared to his own ears edmund jennings exley hes been your raison dêtre since bloody christmas and hes why you dont tell me certain things i love you so i respect your omissions now reciprocate my love and respect my lack of clarification for the next twelve days and youll see him destroyed what are you a little kids voice youve never accorded him credit so ill tell you now as a man hes less than negligible but as a detective he far exceeds even myself there god and yourself witness plaudits for a man i despise now will you respect my omissionsas i respect yours past go no just fucking tell me what you want me to do just explain it dudley laughed smiled do nothing for now but listen ive found out that thad green will be retiring to take over the us border patrol later this spring our new chief of detectives will be either edmund exley or myself his upcoming inspectorship gives exley the inside track and parker favors him personally i plan on using certain aspects of our mutually withheld evidence to clear the nite owl posthaste establish myself as the new frontrunner and ruin exley in the process lad bear with me for a few more days and ill guarantee you your own personal revenge the deal was exleydudley vs exley no contest past go the crumbs he spilled to exley exleys promise liaison the hooker snuffs boss is there a carrot in this for me besides our friends downfall yeah and in exchange for a full disclosure beyond what you gave exley as part of your field runner agreement jesus what the man knew right ho ho ho lad you drive a hard bargain but will a chief of detectives special inquiry suffice say pc multiple various jurisdictions bud stuck out his hand deal dudley said stay away from exley and treat yourself to a grand clean room at the victory ill be by to see you in a day or so you take the car i got business

crumbshowever she managed it patchett knew a whitewash wouldnt wash lynn funneled out her call girl taleand patchett had to have lawyers waiting in case that crumb went to indictments reopening day one was pure insane dudley smith up in gaitsville while his hot dogs shook down darktown vincennes body under the house and his id on dean van gelderdavey goldmans mcneil visitor prenite owl bud white for a runner then his whisper leak breakinghe was a fool to trust him for a second all of that he could take he was a professional detective used to dealing with chaos but the atherton case and his father circuiting in was something else now he felt suspended one simple instinct running him the nite owl had a life past any detectives volitionand the will to make its horror known whether he was there to probe evidence or not whether he was capable of forming plans or just hanging on for the ride he had a plan to work bracken and patchett lynn blew smoke rings out the window down two blocks and turn left you can stop there im right near the corner ed braked short one last question at the bureau you implied that you knew patchett and sid hudgens were planning to work an extortion racket i dont recall endorsing that statement you didnt dispute it i was tired and bored you endorsed it implicitly and its in jack vincennes deposition then perhaps vincennes lied about that part he used to be quite a celebrity wouldnt you also call him quite a selfdramatist an opening yes and do you think you can trust him fake chagrin oozing i dont know hes my weak point so there you are mr exley are you going to arrest me im beginning to think it wouldnt do any good what did white say when he told you to come in for questioning just to come clean did you show him vincennes deposition the truthmake her grateful no im glad because im sure its full of lies why didnt you show it to him because hes a limited detective and the less he knows the better hes also a protégé of a rival officer on the case and i didnt want him passing information to him are you speaking of dudley smith yes do you know him no but bud speaks of him often i think hes afraid of him which means that smith must be quite a man dudleys brilliant and vicious to the core but im better and look its late can i give you a drink why you spat in my face today well given the circumstances her smile made his smile easy given the circumstances one drink lynn got out of the car ed watched her move high heels a shit daybut her feet hardly touched the ground she led him to her building unlocked the bottom door and hit a light ed walked in exquisitethe fabrics the art lynn kicked off her shoes and poured brandies ed sat on a sofapure velvet lynn joined him ed took his drink sipped lynn warmed the glass with her hands do you know why i invited you in youre too inteffigent to try to wrangle a deal so ill guess youre just curious about me bud hates you more than he loves me or anyone else im beginning to see why i dont really want your opinion i was leading up to a compliment some other time all right ill change the subject then hows inez soto handling the publicity shes been all over the papers shes taking it poorly and i dont want to talk about her it galls you that i know so much about you you dont have information to compete move the wedge i have vincennes deposition which i suspect you doubt the truth of throw the changeup you mentioned that patchett financed some early raymond dieterling films can you elaborate on that why because your father is associated with dieterling you see the disadvantages of being the son of a famous man no hink a deft touch with the knife just a policemans question lynn shrugged pierce mentioned it to me in passing several years ago the phone ranglynn ignored it i can tell you dont want to talk about jack vincennes i can tell you do i havent seen much in the news about him lately thats because he flushed everything he had down the toilet badge of honor his friendship with miller stanton all of it sid hudgens getting murdered didnt help since hushhush owed half its filth to vincennes shakedowns lynn sipped brandy you dont like jack no but theres part of his deposition that i believe absolutely patchett has carbons of sid hudgens private dirt files including a carbon of a file on vincennes himself you can do yourself some good by acknowledging it if she bit shed start now i cant acknowledge it and the next time we speak ill have a lawyer but i can tell you that i think i know what such a file would contain first wedge in place and well i think the year was vincennes got involved in a gunfight at the beach he was under the influence of narcotics and shot and killed two innocent people a husband and wife my source has verification including the testimony of an ambulance deputy and a notarized statement from the doctor who treated jack for his wounds my source has blood test results that show the drugs in his system and testimony from eyewitnesses who didnt come forth is that information youd suppress to protect a brother officer captain the malibu rendezvous trashcans glory job the phone ranglynn let it go ed said jesus christ no need to fake yes you know when i read about vincennes i always thought he had some very dark reasons for persecuting dope users so i wasnt surprised when i found that out and captain if pierce did have file carbons im sure he would have destroyed them her last bit rang fakeed played a lie off it i know jack loves dope its been a rumor around the bureau for years and i know youre lying about the

the captain wants a statement from him well hell be lucky to get one last july mr goldman and his confrere mickey cohen were attacked with knives and pipes at mcneil island prison unidentified assailants apparently and cohen was relatively unharmed while mr goldman suffered serious brain damage both men were paroled late last year and mr goldman began to behave quite erratically late in december he was arrested for urinating in public in beverly hills and the judge ordered him here for ninety days observation weve had him since christmas and weve just recycled him in for another ninety frankly we cant do a thing with him and the only thing mysterious is that mr cohen visited and offered to transfer mr goldman to a private treatment facility at his own expense but mr goldman refused and acted terrified of him isnt that odd maybe not where is he on the other side of that door be gentle with him please the man was a gangster but hes just a sad human being now jack opened the door a small padded room davey goldman on a long padded bench he needed a shave he reeked of lysol slackjawed davey scoping a national geographic jack sat beside himgoldman moved away jack said

snuff cathcartor maybe buy in on the dealhowdid he have a bug planted in cohens cell davey tell me about the bug goldman started humming in the mood the doctor opened the door thats it officer youve bothered this man long enough exley okayed it on the phone a run to mcneil to check for evidence of bugging apparatus in mickey cohens former cell the ventura county airport was a few miles awayhe was to fly to puget sound take a cab to the pen bob gallaudet would have a prisons bureau man there to run liaisonthe mcneil administrators pampered cohen probably took bribes for the service might not cooperate without a push exley called the bug theory a long shot he ranted that bud white was missingfisk and kleckner were out looking for him the bastard was probably running from his whisper piece and the body in san berdoo fisk left him a note mentioned the discovery parker said dudley smith was studying the englekling case file and would report on it soon lynn bracken was still holding back jack said what do we do about that exley said the dining car at midnight well discuss it scary captain ed closing ominous jack drove to ventura caught his ffightexley called ahead vouchered his ticket a stewardess handed out newspapers he grabbed a times and daily news and read nite owl dudleys boys were ripping up darktown hauling in known negro offenders looking for the real punks popping shotguns in griffith park pure bullshit whoever planted the weapons in ray coates car planted the matching shells in the park feeding off location leads in the pressonly pros would have the brains and the balls to do it mike breuning and dick carlisle were running a command post at th street stationthe entire squad and twenty extra men from homicide detached to work the case no way were crazed darkies guiltyit was starting to look like all over again the daily news showed photos central avenue swarmed by placardwaving boogies the house exley bought inez soto a dandy shot in the timesinez outside ray dieterlings place in laguna shielding her eyes from flashbulbs jack kept reading the state attorney generals office issued a statement ellis loew outfoxed them by planting a restraining order but they were still interested in the case and would intercede when the order lapsedunless the lapd solved the nite owl mess to the satisfaction of the los angeles county grand jury within a suitable period of time lapd issued a press releasea detailpacked doozie on inez sotos gang rape accompanied by a heartwarming rendition of how captain ed exley helped her rebuild her life exleys old man got a treatment the daily news played up the completion of the southern california freeway system and reported a latebreaking rumorbig preston was soon to announce his candidacy in the governors race a scant two and a half months before the republican primary the eleventhhour announcement strategy a ploy to capitalize on upcoming freeway brouhaha how would his sons bad press affect his chances jack measured his own chances he was back on with karen because she saw he was trying the best way to keep it going was to cash in his twenty grab his pension get out of la the next two months would be a sprint dodging bullets the reopening what patchett and bracken had on him odds you couldnt figurefor a sprinter he was scared and tiredand starting to feel old exley had sprint moves in mindlate dinner meets werent his style bracken and patchett might deal his dirt in parker might quash it to protect the department but karen would know and what was left of the marriage would go downbecause she could just barely take that shed married a drunk and a bagman murderer was one bullet they both couldnt dodge three hours in the air three hours pent up thinking the plane touched down at puget sound jack caught a cab to mcneil ugly a gray monolith on a gray rock island gray walls gray fog barbed wire at the edge of gray water jack got out at the guard hut the gatekeeper checked his id nodded steel gates slid back into stone jack walked in a wiry little man met him in the sallyport sergeant vincennes im agent goddard prisons bureau a good handshake did exley tell you what its about bob gallaudet did youre on the nite owl and related conspiracy cases and you think cohens cell might have been bugged were looking for evidence to support that theory which i dont think is so farfetched why they walked bucking windgoddard talked above it cohen got the royal treatment here goldman too privileges up the wazoo unlimited visitors and not too much scrutiny on the stuff brought into their tier so a bug could have been planted are you thinking goldman crossed mickey something like that well could be they had cells two doors apart on a tier mickey requested because half the cells had ruined plumbing and you couldnt house inmates in them youll see ive got the whole row vacated and closed off checkpoints the blockssixstory tiers linked by catwalks upstairs to a corridoreight empty cells goddard said the penthouse quiet underpopulated and a nice day room for the boys to play cards in we have an informant who says cohen got approval on the inmates placed up here can you feature the cheek of that jack said jesus youre good and fast well exley and gallaudet carry weight and the powers that be here didnt have time to prepare now check the goodies i brought on the day room table crowbars chisels mallets a long thin pole with a hook at the end on a blanket a tape recorder a tangle of wires goddard said first we tear this tier up i admit its a long shot but i brought a recorder along in case we find tape id call that a maybe goldman and cohen got paroled last fall but they got bushwacked in july and davey got his brains scrambled im thinking if he was the one monitoring the tape then maybe he was too wetbrained to pull the machine enough gabbing lets dig they dug goddard plumbed a line from the heat duct in cohens cell to the heat duct in goldmans marked a line on the ceilings of the two cells in between started probing with a mallet and chisel jack pried a protection plate off the duct on mickeys wall banged around inside the chute with the hook device nothing but hollow tin walls no wires just inside frustrating it was the logical place to plant a microphone heat boomed out the duct jack changed his mind washington was cold the heat would be on too much of the time drowning out conversation he checked the walls and ceiling for other conduitsnothingthen the area around the vent irregularly applied spackling dotted with pinholes right by the protector plate he smashed his mallet until half the wall came down and a small spacklecovered microphone dangling off a wire came loose the wire jerked from his hand straight back into the wall five seconds later goddard stood there holding itattached to a tape recorder covered with plastic halfway between the cells a little hideyhole right off the vent lets listen huh they fired it up in the day room goddard hooked up his machine changed spools pushed buttonstaperecorded tape static a dog yipping there there bubelehmickey cohens voice goddard said they let him keep a dog in his cell only in america huh cohen quit licking your schnitzel little precious more yips a long silence a clickoff sound goddard said i was timing it voiceactivated mike five minutes and it goes off automatically jack brushed plaster off his hands howd goldman get in to change the tape he must have had some kind of hook thing like that pole i gave you the grate on his heat vent was loose so we know somebody was poking around in there jesus this thing has been in there how long and goldman had to have help this is no oneman operation listen here that click another click a strange voice for how much ill have that guard place the bet cohen a thousand on basilio that little guinea is mean and take a run by the infirmary and see davey my god a goddamn turnip those goons turned him into i swear i will live to see them in a vegetable puree overlapping voices mumbles mickey cooing his dog yipping nail the time goldman and cohen had been attacked mickey laid down an early bet on the robinsonbasilio fight last september he was probably out by thenhe got down before the odds dropped click off click on fortysix minutes of mickey and at least two other men playing cards mumbling flushing the toilet the used tape almost gone click off click on the fucking dog yowling mickey six years and ten months here and to lose daveys redoubtable brain right before i leave such tsurus to go home on mickey junior quit licking your putt you faigeleh a strange voice get him a bitch and he wont have to cohen my god to be so nimble and so hung like heifetz on the fiddle with his shlong

you do play cribbage good no abe has grown too soft to work muscle too much grease noshed at his deli such grease clogs the arteries that inspire mayhem and lee vachss loves death too much to be discerning lana what a snatch she must have like cashmere the tape ran out goddard said mickey sure does have a verbal style but what did all that have to do with the nite owl case hows nothing sound chapter sixty one wall of his den was now a graph nite owl related case players connected by horizontal lines vertical lines linking them to a large sheet of cardboard blocked off into information sectionsevents culled from vincennes deposition ed wrote margin notes his fathers call still hammered him edmund im running for governor your recent notoriety may have hurt me but put that aside i dont want the atherton case resurrected in print and tied to your various cases and i dont want ray dieterling bothered i want you to direct all your queries along those lines to me and between the two of us well work things out he agreed it rankled it made him feel like a childlike sleeping with lynn bracken made him feel whorish and too many dieterling names were popping up on the graph ed crossed lines sid hudgens lined to the ink smut vincennes found in the smut lined to pierce patchett line to christine bergeron her son daryl and bobby inge smut posers who disappeared almost

inspector preston exley would make discreet inquiries when asked a theoretical linepierce patchett to duke cathcart lynn bracken denied it a lie vincennes deposition had patchett pushing the smut cathcart planned to distributebut who made it hudgens to patchett and bracken the dirtmonger was terrified that vincennes was nosing around fleurdelis lynn told jack that patchett and hudgens were going in on a gig together she now denied it another lie he needed another graph just to chart lieshe didnt have a room big enough to hold it more lines davey goldman to dean van gelder to duke

time maybe you look lousy exley people keep telling me that then maybe its true look if you want to stay and talk awhile fine but please dont talk about bud or all this mierda thats going on i wasnt planning on it but small talk was never our forte she walked up ed embraced her she grabbed his arms and pushed herself away ed tried a smile i saw some gray hairs when youre my age youll probably be as gray as i am hows that for small talk small and i can do better prestons running for governor unless his notorious son ruins his chances im going to be his campaign coordinator governor dad did he say id ruin his chances no because hed never say bad things about you just try to do what you can not to hurt him reporters outsideed heard them laughing i dont want father to be hurt either and you can help me prevent it how a favor a favor between you and me nobody else to know what explain it its very complicated and it involves ray dieterling do you know the name pierce patchett inez shook her head no who is he hes an investor of sorts thats all i can tell you i need you to use your access at dreamadreamland to check his financial connections to dieterling check back to the late s very quietly will you do that for me exley this sounds like police business and what does it have to do with your father recoiling doubting the man who formed him father might be in some tax trouble i need you to check dieterlings financial records for mention of him bad trouble yes check back to or so when they began planning for dreamadreamland no go back to i know youve seen the books at dieterling productions and i know you can do it with explanations to follow more recoil on election day come on inez you love him almost as much as i do all right for your father no other reason all right for what youve done for me and the friends you gave me and if that sounds cruel im sorry a moochie mouse clock struck ten ed said i should go ive got a meeting in la go out the back way i think i still hear the vultures the recoil got squared driving back call it standard elimination procedure if his father really did know ray dieterling during the time of the atherton case he had a valid reason for not revealing it he was probably embarrassed at plumbing business deals with a man he once rubbed shoulders with in the process of a hellish murder investigation preston exley believed that policemen striking friendships with influential civilians was inimical to the concept of impartial absolute justice and if he fell short of his own standards it was understandable that he would not want the fact known squared with love and respect ed made the dining car early the maître d said his guest was waiting he walked back to his favorite bootha private nook behind the bar vincennes was there holding a tape spool ed sat down thats tape off a bug vincennes slid the spool over yeah filled with mickey c running off at the mouth on stuff that has nothing to do with the nite owl too bad but i think we can put davey down as a traitor to mickey and i think he must have heard the engleklings offer mick the cathcart deal he liked the sound of it and sent van gelder after duke and thats as far as i can take it the man looked shot good work jack really i mean it thanks and that first name bit just went over large ed picked up a menu emptied his pockets underneath it its midnight and im all out of subtlety youre working up to something whatd you get out of bracken nothing but lies and youre right sergeant the mcneil end is dead for now so so tomorrow im hitting patchett im sealing la off from dudley and his men and bringing in terry lux chester yorkin and every patchett flunky that fisk and kleckner can find yeah but what about bracken and patchett ed saw lynn naked bracken tried to buy out of your deposition she snitched you on that escapade in malibu and i played her back on it trash slammed his head down on two clenched fists ed said i told her youd do anything to get the file back i told her you still love dope and youre in hock to some bookies youre up for a trial board and you want to crash patchetts rackets vincennes raised his headpale knucklegouged so tell me youll square whats in the file ed picked up his menu underneath heroin benzedrine a switchblade a mm automatic youre going to shake patchett down he snorts heroin so you offer him some if you want some stuff to get your own juice up youve got it youre going after him to get your file back and to find out who made the blood smut and killed hudgens im working on a script and youll have it by tomorrow

pierce had this old string of girls that he let go this was around when we were moving them picture books some guy i dont know his name he talked some of the girls and their johns into posing for them pictures he made books out of them and went to pierce to get money to move the books wide you know he promised pierce a cut pierce he liked the idea but he didnt want to expose his girls or their johns he bought a bunch of the books off the guy to move through fleurdelis you know just a close distribution he called it like a test market he figured he could keep track of the stuff that way old lines crossing the close distribution wasnt that close ad vice retrieved throwaway copiesvincennes to the case keep going chester well the guy who made the stuff somehow he weaseled some info on the englekling brothers out of pierce how they had this printing press place and was always bent for money he found himself a front man and the front man he approached the brothers you know a plan to make

brought patchett the eighteen pounds of h for development the man who also loved pornography and convinced patchett to manufacture new books from the prototypes an instinct cohen was mr patsy going back eight years in and out of jail a focal point who never dealt his own hand into the welter of cases a line to a conclusion the nite owl killings were semiprofessional at least an attempt to take over the heroin and pornography rackets of pierce patchett cathcart attempting to push the smut on his own was the focus of the kiffings did he misrepresent his importance to the wrong people or did the shooters deliberately take out van gelder knowing or not knowing he was a cathcart impersonator lines to organized crime intrigue semipro at least with all mob lines dead or incapacitated franz

acquaintances of his perfecting already existing resemblances to exact resemblances of several notable actors and actresses unsubstantiated rumors hold that patchett employs these young people for purposes of prostitution but i have no conclusive evidence that this is true duly sworn et cetera ed said not good enough duane you take yorkin and rita hayworth across the street and book them aiding and abetting and leave the arrest dates blank allow them one phone call each then go down to long beach and seize linden thats a fleurdelis drop and im sure patchetts cleaned it out but do it anyway if you find the place virgin bust it up and leave the door open fisk swallowed uh sir bust it up and no booking date on our suspects bust it up make a statement and dont question my orders fisk said uh yes sir ed closed the door buzzed kleckner don send dr lux and mr geisler in yes sir loud on the intercom whispered theyre pissed captain thought you should know ed opened the door geisler and lux walked upbrusque no handshakes geisler said franidy that lunch didnt begin to cover the hourly rate im going to have to charge dr lux i think its reprehensible that he came here voluntarily and was

the same thing the cabin was musty the bed unmadestale from last time with inez ed kept the lights on the more he saw the less hed think it helped him through the act counting lynns freckles kept him from peaking slow on the act both of them making up for their tumble off the couch lynn had bruises ed knew they came from bud white for a tightrope act they were gentle their long embrace after felt like payback for their lies when they started talking theyd never stop ed wondered whod say bud white first lynn said it bud was the fulcrum that convinced her to lie to patchett the police investigation was a joke they were grasping at straws white knew of patchetts milder doings she was afraid hed get in trouble if pierce fought back pierce might try to buy his friendship he thought everyone had a price tag he didnt know her wendell couldnt be bought bud got her thinking the more she thought the more she hurt a certain police captain kissing a certain exwhore at the only moment she would have let him just added to the partys over pierce made me but hes bad deep down if i let him go then maybe ill get back some of the good things hes killed in me ed winced through the words knew he couldnt return her candornow jack vincennes was going in barefoot hed counted on lynn to push patchett to panic past fisk taking a fire axe to the drop past his people grilled and arrested

his clock all snappingone more span of skewed time and hed do it some point early am kathy janeway hit him upkathy the way she looked then she found him a date for the wee small hoursthe man who killed her and spade cooley stood him up he went by the biltmore talked to the cowboy rhythm bandspade was still gone deuce perkins was off on his own toot the das bureau night clerk gave him the brushwere they even on the case another tear through chinatown a run by his apartmenta couple of ia hardons parked out front a wolfed meal at a burger stand dawn creeping up a pile of heralds that told him it was friday a nite owl headline jigs crying police brutality chief parker promising justice he felt tired one second keyed up the next he tried to set his watch to the radio the hands stuck he threw a hundreddollar gruen out the window tired he saw kathy keyed up he saw exley and lynn he drove to nottingham drive to check cars no white packardand lynn always parked the same place bud walked around the buildingno sign of exleys blue plymouth a neighbor woman bringing in milk she said good morning youre miss brackens friend arent you the old snooplynn said she peeped bedrooms thats right well as you can see shes not here yeah and you dont know where she is well well what you seen her with a man tall glasses no i havent and mind your tone young man well what indeed bud badged her well what lady you were gonna tell me something until you got cheeky i was going to tell you where miss bracken went i heard her talking to the manager last night she was asking for directions where to lake arrowhead and i would have told you before you got cheeky exleys place inez told him about it a cabin flying flags american state lapd bud drove to arrowhead cruised by the lake found it banners cutting wind no blue plymouth lynns packard in the driveway a brodie to the porch a leap up the steps bud punched in a window unlatched the door no response to the noisejust a musty front room done up hunting lodge provincial he walked into the bedroom sweat stink lipstick blots on the bed he kicked the feathers out of the pillows dumped the mattress saw a leather binder underneath lynns scarlet letters for sureshed been talking up her diary for years bud grabbed it got ready to ripdown the spine like his old phone book trick the smell made him stopif he didnt look he was a coward flip to the last page lynns handwriting bold black ink the gold pen hed bought her march more on ee he just drove off and i could tell he was chagrined by all the things he told me last night he looked vulnerable in the am light stumbling to the bathroom without his glasses i pity pierce his misfortune in encountering such an essentially frightened and unyielding man ee makes love like my wendell like he never wants it to end because when it ends he will have to return to what he is he is perhaps the only man i have ever met who is as compromised as i am who is so smart circumspect and cautious that you can always see his wheels turning and thus wish you could always talk in the dark so that face value would be less complex he is so smart and pragmatic that he makes ww appear childish and thus less heroic than he really is and considering his dilemma my betiayal of pierces friendship and patronage seem frankly callow this man has been so obsessively beholden to his father for so long that the crux of it must influence every step he takes yet he is still taking steps which amazes me ee didnt delve too far into specifics but the basic thrust is that some of the more artful pornographic books that pierce was selling five years ago have diagrams that match the mutilations on sid hudgens body and the wounds on the victims of a murderer named loren atherton who was apprehended by preston exley in the s pe is soon to announce his candidacy for governor and ee now considers that his father solved the atherton case incorrectly and inferred that he suspects pe of establishing business relations with raymond dieterling at the time of that case one of athertons victims was a dieterling child star another strange crux ee my tris smart pragmatist considers his father such a moral exemplar and paragon of efficacy that he is terrified of accepting normal incompetence and rational business selfinterest as within the bounds of acceptable human behavior he is afraid that solving his nite owl related cases will reveal pes fallibility to the world and destroy his gubernatorial chances and he is obviously even more afraid of having to accept his father as a mortal especially difficult since he has never accepted himself as one but he will go ahead with his cases deep down he seems quite determined as much as i love him in the same situation my wendell would just shoot everyone involved then look for somebody a bit more inteffigent to sort out the bodies like that urbane irishman dudley smith he always mentions more on this and related matters after a walk breakfast and three strong cups of coffee now he rippeddown the spine across the grain leather and paper shredded to bits the phone iad direct buzz buzz internal affairs kleckner its white put exley on white youre in troub a new voice on the line this is exley white where are you arrowhead i just read lynns diary and got the whole story on your old man atherton and dieterling the whole

like youre writing an occurrence chronology white smiledpure kamikaze i been tracking a string of hooker killings for years it started with this girl kathy janeway she got snuffed back in right around the nite owl she was duke cathcarts girlfriend ed nodded i know that story ia ran a personal on you when you passed the sergeants exam oh yeah what you dont know is that a few years ago my case broke i thought my killer was spade cooleyhis band was in all the hooker snuff cities on the dods i was wrong cooley ratted off the real killerburt arthur perkins vincennes spoke up i buy deuce as a woman killer hes wrong to the core white said you should know cause cooley said he was pals with johnny stompanato and back around you told me you rousted him hanging out with johnny stomp kikey t and lee vachss cooley told me johnny and deuce were tight so i went looking for johnny ed said all right so you went to stompanato white lit a cigarette nix now i tell you that dudley smith has been using me for strongarm jobs on the mobster squad going back years you know how he talks containment thats one of his favorite words contain crime contain this contain that hes been beating around the bush about offering me outside work and the other night he said i could be useful keeping the obstreperous italian thats afraid of me in line johnny stomps afraid of mehe used to snitch for me and i used to muscle him good you know how duds this socalled gangland peacemaker well the other night him carlisle and breuning worked over this guy lamar hinton at the victory supposedly a mobster squad job bullshitall dudley asked him about was nite owl stuffsmut pierce patchett ed bugeyed this cant be coming so you went to stompanato looking for perkins right i go to kikes deli and johnnys there with kikey i ask johnny about deuce and johnnys all hiked kikeys hinked worse and they both lie and say deuce is just some bumfuck acquaintance they deny that deuce is tight with lee vachss when i know goddamn otherwise johnny uses the word containment which is not a johnnytype word hink all over these guys and i drop that im on the nite owl reopening and they almost shit deuce for the nite owl ho ho i leave go to a pay phone and have pc bell put a fifteenminute trace on all calls out of the deli two callsone to dot rothstein dudleys good pal and kikeys cousin one to dudleys house vincennes said holy fucking shit ed jerked a hand to his gunwrongwhite was a cop give me corroboration white flicked his smoke out the window crim the niggers didnt do it so dud and his gang planted a car by the nite owl i went to the dmv and checked april registrations caucasians this time dot rothstein bought a merc primer gray on april a phony name a phony address but the stupid bitch used the real digits on her own phone number vincennes looked shellshocked ed reeled in a line so he wouldnt scream dudley right before the nite owl i was working late at hollywood station spade cooley was playing a retirement party downstairs and i saw burt perkins roaming the halls try this theory mal lunceford exlapd patrolman call him the forgotten nite owl victim and remember he worked hollywood division for most of his time on the department now did one of the shooters have a grudge against lunceford was perkins removing records of it that night at the station did the conspirators know that lunceford was a nite owl regular and plan their cathcart or cathcartimpersonator hit so that they could clip him too white answered dudley put me on the lunceford background check probably because he thought id fuck it up i checked for old lunceford fis and couldnt find a goddamn one i buy that theory dudley past screaminged held it down vincennes fisk told me about patchett how he got the cohendragna summit heroin how him and this unnamed bad guy whos obviously dudley were getting ready to push it now i know for a fact that dud bodyguarded that deal and there was this rumor floating around years agothat dud led this posse that killed this guy buzz meeks who heisted the summit fisk said that patchett got most of the white horse that got clouted some from the englekling brothers and their father some from this bad guy whos obviously dudley okay so what im thinking iscould lunceford have been in on the posse was that when dudley got the dope white shook his headnew stuff for him you fill me in on that because i got a lead that ties in dud was talking up his containment shit and he said something about keeping the niggers sedated which sounds like heroin to me ed said call that done for now jack run with the goldman van gelder angle put it together with our new leads trash stood up steadied himself on the bed rail okay lets say davey g was in with dudley stompanato kikey vachss and dot how any of them could trust a psycho like deuce i dont know but fuck it anyway theyre all conspiring against mickey c white you dont know this but goldman had a bug in mickeys cell at mcneil im betting dudley and his friends were in with davey from the beginning but fuck it however it happened davey heard the englekling brothers approach mickey with duke cathcarts smut deal ed raised a hand chester yorkin said that the man who brought patchett the bulk of the heroinlets assume its dudleyhad a hardon for smut and quote contacts in south america and pervert mailing lists i always wondered about the profit on pornography and now dudleys connection makes it seem more feasible vincennes said let me keep going dud worked with the oss in paraguay after the war and he ran ad vice back in or so so i know hes got those contacts but sit on that right now weve got goldman going to smith and stompanato with the word on the smut plan everybody especially dud likes the idea and they decide to crash the racket on his own a double cross i dont know davey sends dean van gelder his prison visitor to talk to cathcart van gelder decides to crash dukes prostie racket and the smut gig on his own hed been seen by davey facetoface but the outside prison men had never seen him he figured he looked like cathcart so he could impersonate cathcart and cut his own deal by the time the impersonation was found out hed be too far in good with the outside men for davey to care what hed done so van gelder moved to san berdoo to be close to the englekling brothers he fell in with sue lefferts and snuffed duke he knew the names of at least one of the outside men called them at a pay phone from the lefferts house and asked for a meet he went in tough and suggested a public place he figured sue could sit nearby and hed be safe one of the outside guys put lunceford together with the nite owl and said lets meet there dud or one of his guys approached patchett right before the nite owl and told him to get his loose ends tidied patchett didnt know exactly what was gonna happen but he had chris bergeron and her kid and bobby inge blow town just as i was starting in on the smut gig for ad vice an aircooled roomed felt every word boost the temperature let me throw out a chronology starting right after van gelder as cathcart contacts the outside men now we know dudley loves pornography we know hes been sitting on eighteen pounds ofh since the cohendragna deal try this theory he breaks into cathcarts apartment and finds something that leads him to patchett something that includes mention of his chemistry background and his connection to old dr englekling he goes to patchett they strike a dealdevelop the heroin push the smut hes astounded that patchetts thinking along the same lines that hes already got some of the horse from doc englekling now dudley wants cathcart killed mal lunceford silenced for whatever reasonand he wants patchett terrified hes a policeman and hes read about those negroes discharging shotguns in griffith park he sets up the meet at the nite owl knowing lunceford will be there and jacks righthe was ambiguous but he told patchett to get rid of his loose ends moving ahead the investigation goes wider than dudley thinks it willbecause the negroes dont get killed during their arrest and they dont confess he puts white on the cathcart background check and he probably didnt know that perkins killed the janeway girl but he wanted white steered away from getting involved on general principleshe wanted him to steer clear of possible cathcartnite owl connections all eyes on bud white the zealot okay dudley put me on the cathcart check because he thought id screw up but i checked out dukes pad and saw that it was printwiped and i figured that somebody had tried on his clothes the dudley guys wiped the place but they didnt touch the phone books and i could tell that the san berdoo printshop listings had been looked over now i got a theory when i was on the carthcart check i met kathy janeway at this motel out in the valley two days later shes raped and killed when i left the motel i thought i was being tailed but then i forgot about it i think the tail was deuce perkins i think dud put a tail on cathcarts kas just to keep tabs on the investigation which explains how hes always known so much about all this stuff that ive always kept secret so deuce whos a rapeo shitbird psycho sees kathy and goes for her maybe dudley knew he killed her maybe he didnt either way he fucking pays vincennes lit a cigarette coughed weve got no evidence but ive got some more stuff to tie in one doc layman took five slugs out of patchett and he said they match this gang unsolved in riverside county when davey goldman was babbling away up in camarillo he said something about three triggers he babbled some other stuff that keeps running through my head but it doesnt make any sense exley did you listen to that tape i found at mcneil ed nodded youre right nothing salient at all just a passing mention of some gang hits white theres been a bunch of mob unsolveds i know cause a suspect spilled some tangent stuff on them on a mobster squad roust always three triggers cohen franchise holders and upstart hoods clipped easy money stompanato vachss and teitlebaum keeping things copacetic for mickey cs parole they wanted to keep things chilled for their containment gig and they figured when mickey got out theyd test the wind and either clip him or use him my bets on clip they had cohen and goldman bushwhacked in prisona pure cross on davey mickeys house got bombed and mickey lived to tell theyll clip him before too long and theyll contain real good cause duds mr mobster squad and hes got parkers fuckingwhats the word mandateto keep outoftown muscle out do you fucking believe it trash laughed grand lad grand and all the hits were paving the way for dud to push patchetts heroin he got the command on the reopening so he could find some new patsies and hes set to push the horse hes got the smut stashed and he didnt warn patchett about the investigation because he was already planning to kill him he didnt touch lynn bracken because he figured patchett kept her in the dark on all his worst stuff he let her come in for questioning because he figured shed stall exleys part of the investigation lynn bracken ed winced moved toward the door and we still dont know who made the smut and killed hudgens or the englekling brothers which doesnt look like a pro job white you went up to gaitsville with dudley and he submitted a softpedal report on it was another psycho job heroin lying around and the killer just left it he tortured the brothers with chemicals and burned up a bunch of smut negatives with acid solutions the lab tech said he thought the killer was trying to id the people in the pictures the chemistry stuff made me think patchett but then i thought he mustve already known who the picture people were i dont really think their heroin ties to our heroin the brothers were dope peddlers on and off for years chemists and dope peddlers and if patchett wanted their dope he wouldve stolen it i think the brothers got killed by somebody i dont know outside the center of this mess trash sighed theres no evidence patchett and the whole englekling family are dead and dud probably killed lamar hinton you got nothing at the fleurdelis drop and whites little grandstand with stompanato and teitlebaum means that now dudleys been alerted and hes taking care of his loose ends i dont think weve got much of a case ed thought it through chester yorkin told me patchett had a boobytrapped safe outside his house the house is being guarded now the west la squad has a team on it in a day or so ill go lift the guards there might be something in that safe that nails dudley white said so right now what no evidence and stompanatos leaving for acapulco today with lana turner what now ed opened the doorfisk was outside drinking coffee duane get back in touch with valburn stanton billy dieterling and pelts change the meeting to the downtown statler at call the hotel and set up three suites and call bob

too upscale to take muscle hotel good guybad guy rankledthey should be muscling dudley at the victory bob gallaudet took max pelts trashcan was grilling miller stanton gallaudet got briefed by exleyeverything but the atherton angle he thought he could prosecute dudley smith exley didnt tell him dud and deuce perkins were paid for fucking exley wouldnt let him out of his sighthe took him through every piece of the case step by step like they were partners who could trust each other the case all put together was amazing exley had an amazing fucking brainbut he was stupid if he didnt

they bought fleurdelis dope yes they knew pierce patchett socially yes pierce snorted h we heard rumors he sold pornographic booksbut we never indulged in such things kid gloves the fruits thought the patchett snuff was why they got the royal hotel treatment captain exley would never be nasty preston exley was running for governor ray dieterling throwing hot financial backup exley loud gentlemen theres an old homicide that might tie in to the patchett killing bud walked in exley said this is sergeant white he has a few questions for you then i think we can wrap it up timmy valburn sighed well im not surprised miller stanton and max pelts are down the hall and the last time the police questioned all of us was when that awful man sid hudgens was killed so im not surprised bud pulled a chair up whyd you say awful you kill him oh sergeant really do i look like the killer type to you yeah you do guy who makes his living playing a mouse has gotta be capable of anything sergeant really besides you werent called in on the hudgens job billy tell you about it a little pillow talk maybe billy dieterling to exley captain i dont like this mans tone exley said sergeant keep it clean bud laughed thats the pot calling the kettle black but screw it you guys alibied each other for hudgens now its five years later and you alibi each other up for patchett hinky to me my take on fruits is that they cant stick to the same bed for five minutes let alone five years valburn youre an animal bud pulled out a file sheet alibis on the hudgens case you and billy in bed together max pelts porking some teenage quiff miller stanton at a party where your queer buddy brett chase also happens to be so far we got a real allamerican crew on badge of honor david mertens the set man hes at home with his male nurse so maybe hes fruit too what i want exley on cue sergeant watch your language and get to the point valburn seethed billy d faked boredom but something in the last spiel nudged himhis eyes went from good guy to bad guy the point is that sid hudgens had a boner for badge of honor at the time he was killed patchett gets killed five years later and him and hudgens were partners these homos here theyre both tied to badge of honor and they kicked loose with intimate details on patchetts rackets captain if it walks talks and quacks like a duck then its a ducknot a mouse valburn said quack quack idiot captain will you tell this man who hes dealing with exley stern sergeant these gentlemen arent suspects theyre voluntary interviewees well shit sir i dont see no difference exley exasperated gentlemen to end this once and for all please tell the sergeant did either of you even know sid hudgens personally two no head shakes bud flewexley poetry if it squeaks like a mouse and swishes its a queer mouse captain think these guys bought dope off fleurdelis and they admitted they knew patchett sniffed horse and pushed pornography theyve got the lowdown on patchetts rackets but they claim they didnt know patchett and hudgens were partners i say we take them through patchetts little enterprises and see what they do know exley raised his handsfake helpless a few more

the wall bright eyes glazed over a toobright voice if i keep doing things ill be fine a group shot came down i need a full statement oh youll get one mertens killed hudgens billy and marsalas plus wee willie and those other children i need the why timmy look at me timmy plucked a framed photo we were together since we had our little indiscretions but we always stayed together and loved each other dont give me a speech about getting his killer ed i just couldnt bear it ill tell you what you want to know but try not to be déclassé timmy valburn threw the frame at the wall david mertens goddamn you glass shattered the picture landed face up raymond dieterling holding an inkwell start with the pornography jack vincennes talked to you about it five years ago and he thought you were holding back is this another third degree dont make it one timmy squared a stack of frames jerry marsalas made david create that strange filth jerry was a very bad man hed been davids companion for years and he regulated the drugs that kept him relatively normal sometimes hed escalate and deescalate his dosages and get david to do commercial art piecework just so he could keep the money raymond paid jerry to look after david he got david the job at badge of honor so that billy could look after him toobilly ran the camera crew since the show first went on ed said dont get ahead of yourself where did marsalas and mertens find the posers timmy hugged his pictures fleurdelis marsalas had used the service for years hed buy call girls when he was flush and he knew lots of pierces old string of girls and lots of sexually adventurous people that the girls told him about he found out that a lot of fleurdelis customers had a bent for specialty smut and he talked some of pierces old girls into letting him voyeur their sex parties jerry took pictures david took pictures and jerry escalated davids drug intake and made him do pasteup work the ink blood was all davids idea jerry hired some studio art director to make finished books out of the pictures and took them to pierce do you follow i dont know what you know ed got out his notebook miller stanton told us some background things patchett and dieterling were partners at the time of the atherton killings and you know i make mertens for them just keep going if i need something clarified ill tell you timmy said all right then if you dont know it the ink pictures were similar to the woundings on the atherton victims pierce didnt know it when he saw the books i guess only policemen saw the evidence photos he also didnt know that david mertens was the wennerholm killers new identity so when marsalas hatched this plan to sell the books and went to pierce for financing he just thought it was dirty books that compromised his prostitutes and their customers he turned marsalas down on his offer but he did buy some of the books to sell through fleurdelis then marsalas went to this man duke cathcart and he went to these people the englekling brothers ed your mr fisk hinted that all this has to do with the nite owl case but i dont ill tell you later youre talking about early and im following you so far just keep telling it in order timmy laid his pictures down then patchett went to sid hudgens he and hudgens were going to be partners in some extortion thing that i dont know anything about and pierce told hudgens about marsalas and his smut hed had marsalas checked out and he knew he was a regular on the badge of honor set which interested hudgens because he had always wanted to do an exposé on the show for hushhush pierce gave hudgens a few of the books hed held back from fleurdelis and hudgens approached marsalas he demanded information on the shows stars and threatened jerry with exposure of his smut dealings if he didnt cooperate jerry gave him some tame stuff on max pelts and a little while later it appeared in print then hudgens was murdered and of course it was jerry who put david up to it he lowered his drug dosage and drove him insane david reverted to his old to the way he killed the children marsalas did it because he was afraid hudgens would keep trying to extort him he went with david and he stole hudgens badge of honor files from his house including an incomplete file hudgens had on him and david i dont think he knew that pierce already had carbons of the files he and hudgens were going to use for their blackmail thing or that pierce knew the bank where hudgens kept his original files stashed three key questions coming up more corroboration first timmy when vincennes questioned you five years ago you acted suspiciously did you know back then that mertens made the smut yes but i didnt know who david was all i knew was that billy kept an eye on him so i kept quiet to jack question number one how do you know all this everything youve told me timmys eyes glazed fresh i found out tonight after the hotel billy wanted that awful policemans hints about johnny stompanato explained billys known most of the story for years but he wanted to know the rest we went to raymonds house in laguna raymond knew about the more recent things from pierce and he told billy the whole story i just listened and inez was there yes she heard it all she blames you sweetie pandoras box and all that she knew his father probably knew full disclosure as good as public so patchett supplied the dope thats kept mertens docile all these years yes hes quite physiologically ill he gets brain inflammations periodically and thats when hes most dangerous and dieterling got him the job with badge of honor so billy could look after him yes after the hudgens killing raymond read about the mutilations and thought they sounded like the ones from the old child murders he contacted patchett who he knew was friendly with hudgens raymond revealed davids identity to pierce and pierce became terrified raymond was afraid to take david away from jerry and hes been paying jerry extraordinary money to keep david drugged up key question two youve been waiting for this one timmy why has ray dieterling gone to all this trouble for david timmy turned a picture aroundbilly a lumpfaced man david is raymonds illegitimate son hes billys half brother and look at him terry lux has cut him so often that hes so ugly next to my sweet billy that you almost cant look moving on griefed cut in before he snapped what happened tonight tonight raymond filled billy in on everything going back to sid hudgenshe didnt know any of it billy made me stay with inez at laguna he told me he was going to snatch david from jerrys house and wean him off the drugs he must have tried it and marsalas must have retaliated i saw those pills on the floor and oh god david must have just gone insane he couldnt understand who was good and who was bad and just three at the hotel you reacted to johnny stompanato why stompanatos been blackmailing pierces customers for years he caught me with another man and got part of the mertens story out of me not much just that raymond paid for davids upkeep it it was before i knew very much stompanatos been preparing a dossier to bleed raymond dry hes been threatening billy with notes but i dont think he knows who david is billy was trying to convince his father to have him killed sun broke through a windowit caught timmy when his tears broke through he held billys picture a hand over davids face chapter seventythree an ia goon relieved him at pissed that he was sleeping slumped in the doorway with his gun out the house stayed virginno

negro youths who were arrested on suspicion of the crime the three raymond coates tyrone jones and leroy fontaine escaped from jail and were killed resisting arrest the three allegedly confessed to district attorney ellis loew prior to their escape and the case was assumed to have been solved four years and ten months later a san quentin inmate otis john shortell came forward with information that led many to believe that the three youths were innocent of the nite owl killings shortell said that he was in the presence of coates jones and fontaine while they were engaged in the gang rape of a young woman at the exact time of the coffee shop slaughter shortells testimony verified by lie detector tests created a public clamor to reopen the case the clamor was fanned by the february murders

intrigue involving pornography the englekling killings remain unsolved in the words of mann county sheriffs lieutenant eugene hatcher no leads at all but were still trying the nite owl case was
