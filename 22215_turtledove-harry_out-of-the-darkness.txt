secretary shazliking of zuwayza tewfikhajjajs majordomo one ealstan intended to kill an algarvian officer had the young forthwegian not been fussy about which redhead he killed or had he not cared whether he lived or died in the doing he would have had an easier time of it but with a wife and daughter to think about he wanted to get away with it if he could hed even promised vanai he wouldnt do anything foolish he regretted that promise now but hed always been honorable to the point of stubbornness so he still felt himself bound by it and he wanted to rid the world of one of mezentios men in particular oh he would have been delighted to see all of them dead but he especially wanted to be the means by which this one died considering what the whoreson did to vanai and made her do for him who could blame me but like a lot of rhetorical questions that one had an obvious unrhetorical answer all the other algarvians in eoforwic the algarvians ruled the capital of forthweg with a mailed fist these days ealstan had been part of the uprising that almost threw them out of eoforwic as in most things though almost wasnt good enough he counted himself lucky to remain among the living saxburh smiled and gurgled at him from her cradle as he walked by the baby seemed proud of cutting a new tooth ealstan was glad shed finally done it too shed been fussy and noisy for several nights before it broke through ealstan yawned he and vanai had lost sleep because of that his wife was in the kitchen building up the fire to boil barley for porridge im off ealstan said no work for a bookkeeper in eoforwic these days but plenty for someone with a strong back vanai gave him a knotted cloth heres cheese and olives and an onion she said i only wish it were more itll do he said im not starving he told the truth he was hungry but everyone in eoforwic except somenot allof the algarvians was hungry these days he still had his strength to do a laborers work he needed it too wagging a finger at her he added make sure youve got enough for yourself youre nursing the baby dont worry about me vanai said ill do fine and so will saxburh she leaned toward him to kiss him goodbye as their lips brushed her face changedliterally her eyes went from brown to bluegray her skin from swarthy to pale her nose from proud and hooked to short and straight her hair stayed dark but that was because it was dyed he could see the golden roots which he hadnt been able to do a moment before she seemed suddenly taller and slimmer too not stubby and broadshouldered like most forthwegians including ealstan himself he finished the kiss nothing as far as he was concerned was more important than that then he said your masking spell just slipped her mouth twisted in annoyance then she shrugged i knew i was going to have to renew it pretty soon anyhow as long as it happens inside the flat its not so bad not bad at all ealstan said and gave her another kiss as she smiled he went on i like the way you look just fine regardless of whether you seem like a forthwegian or a kaunian you know that vanai nodded but her smile slipped instead of getting bigger as hed hoped not many do she said most forthwegians have no use for me and the algarvians would cut my throat to use my life energy against unkerlant if they saw me the way i really am i suppose there are other kaunians here but how would i know if they want to stay alive they have to stay hidden the same as i do ealstan remembered the golden roots hed seen you should dye your hair again too its growing out aye i know ill take care of it vanai promised one way the algarvians checked to see whether someone was a sorcerously disguised kaunian was by pulling out a few hairs and seeing if they turned yellow when removed from the suspects scalp ordinary hair dye countered that the algarvians being who and what they were thoroughness in such matters paid off vanai kept the hair between her legs dark too carrying his meager lunch ealstan went downstairs and out onto the street the two blocks of flats across from his own were only piles of rubble these days the algarvians had smashed both of them during the forthwegian uprising ealstan thanked the powers above that his own building had survived it was he knew only luck a forthwegian man in a threadbare kneelength tunic scrabbled through the wreckage across the street looking for wood or whatever else he could find he stared up in alarm at ealstan his mouth a wide circle of fright in the midst of his shaggy gray beard and mustache ealstan waved like everyone else in eoforwic hed spent his share of time guddling through ruins too the shaggy man relaxed and waved back not a lot of people were on the streets only a handful compared to the days before the uprising and before the latest unkerlanter advance stalledor was allowed to stallin eoforwics suburbs on the west bank of the twegen river ealstan cocked his head to one side he didnt hear many eggs bursting king swemmels soldiers there on the far bank of the twegen were taking it easy on eoforwic today his boots squelched in mud fall and winter were the rainy season in eoforwic as in the rest of forthweg at least i wont have to worry much about snow the way the unkerlanters would if they were back home ealstan thought he spotted a mushroom pale against the dark dirt of another muddy patch and stooped to pick it like all forthwegians like all the kaunians in forthweg and emphatically unlike the algarvian occupiershe was wild for mushrooms of all sorts he suddenly shook his head and straightened up he was wild for mushrooms of almost all sorts this one though could stay where it was he knew a destroying power when he saw one his father hestan back in gromheort had used direct and often painful methods to make sure he could tell a good mushroom from a poisonous one i wish the redheads liked mushrooms he thought maybe one of them would pick that one and kill himself algarvians directed forthwegians hauling rubble to shore up the defenses against the unkerlanter attack everyone in the city knew was coming forthwegian women in armbands of blue and whitehildes helpers they called themselves brought food to the redheads but not to their countrymen who were working harder ealstan scowled at the women they were the female equivalent of the men of plegmunds brigade forthwegians who fought for king mezentio of algarve his cousin sidroc fought in plegmunds brigade if he hadnt been killed yet ealstan hoped he had instead of joining the forthwegian laborers as he often did ealstan turned away toward the center of town he hadnt been there for a while not since he and a couple of other forthwegians teamed up to assassinate an algarvian official theyd worn algarvian uniforms to do it and theyd been otherwise disguised too back then the redheads had held only a slender corridor into the heart of eoforwicbut enough curse them to use to bring in reinforcements now the whole city was theirs again at least until such time as the unkerlanters chose to try to run them out ealstan had a demon of a time finding the particular abandoned building he was looking for it has to be around here somewhere he muttered but where eoforwic had taken quite a pounding since hed last come to these parts if this doesnt work ill think of something else he told himself still this had to be his best chance there was the building farther into eoforwic than hed recalled it didnt look much worse than it had when he and his pals ducked into it to change from algarvian tunics and kilts to forthwegianstyle long tunics ealstan ducked inside the next obvious question was whether anyone had stolen the uniforms he and his comrades had abandoned why would anybody he wondered forthwegians didnt wouldnt wear kilts any more than their unkerlanter cousins would ealstan didnt think anybody could get much for selling the clothes and so with a little luck he felt like shouting when he saw the uniforms still lying where theyd been thrown when he and his friends got rid of them he picked up the one hed worn it was muddier and grimier than it had been rain and dirt and dust had had their way with it but a lot of algarvians in eoforwic these days wore uniforms that had known better years ealstan held it up and nodded he could get away with it he pulled his own tunic off over his head then got into the algarvian clothes the high tight collar was as uncomfortable as he remembered his tunic went into the pack he took from his belt pouch first a small stick then a length of dark brown yarn and another of red he twisted them together and began a chant in classical kaunian his spell that would temporarily disguise him as an algarvian was modeled after the one vanai had created to let herand other kaunianslook like the forthwegian majority and keep mezentios men from seizing them when ealstan looked at himself he could see no change even a mirror wouldnt have helped that was the sorcerys drawback only someone else could tell you if it had workedand you found out the hard way if it wore off at the wrong time he plucked at his beard it was shaggier than algarvians usually wore theirs they often went in for side whiskers and imperials and waxed mustachios but a lot of them were more unkempt than they had been too he thought he could get by with the impersonationprovided the spell had worked only one way to learn he thought again he strode out of the building he hadnt gone more than half a block before two algarvian troopers walked by they both saluted one said good morning lieutenant ealstan returned the salute without answering he spoke some algarvian but with a sonorous forthwegian accent he shruggedthen shrugged again turning it into a production as algarvians were wont to do with any gesture hed passed the test now he had several hours in which to hunt down that son of a whore of a spinello the stick he carried was more likely to be a robbers weapon than a constables or an officers but that didnt matter so much these days either if a stick blazed mezentios men would use it algarvian soldiers saluted him he saluted officers forthwegians gave him sullen looks no one paid much attention to him he hurried west toward the riverfront looking like a man on important business and so he was that was where hed seen spinello he could lure the redhead away blaze him and then use a counterspell to turn back into his proper self in moments he could if he could find spinello the fellow stood out in a crowd he was a bantam rooster of a man always crowing always bragging but he wasnt where ealstan had hoped and expected him to be had the unkerlanters killed him how would i ever know ealstan thought i want to make sure hes dead and who has a better right to kill him than i do wheres the old man one redheaded footsoldier asked another colonel spinello the other soldier returned the first man nodded ealstan pricked up his ears the second algarvian said he went over to one of the officers brothels by the palace the lucky bastard said he had a meeting somewhere later on so he might as well have some fun first if its anything important you could hunt him up i bet nah the first redhead made a dismissive gesture he asked me to let him know how my sister was doingshe got hurt when those stinking kuusamans dropped eggs on trapani my father writes that shell pull through ill tell him when i see him thats all thats good the second soldier said glad to hear it ealstan turned away in frustration he wouldnt get spinello today braving an algarvian officers brothel was beyond him even if murder wasnt he also found himself surprised to learn spinello cared about his men and their families but then he thought well why shouldnt he its not as if they were kaunians for four years and more the west wing of the mansion on the outskirts of priekule had housed the algarvians who administered the capital of valmiera for the redheaded conquerors no more occupying it these days were marquis skarnu his fiancée merkela and gedominu their son who was just starting to pull himself upright skarnus sister marchioness krasta still lived in the east wing as she had all through the occupation shed had an algarvian colonel warming her bed all through the occupation too but she loudly insisted the baby she was carrying belonged to viscount valnu whod been an underground leader valnu didnt disagree with her either worse luck that kept skarnu from throwing krasta out of the mansion on her shapely backside he had to content himself with seeing his sister as little as he could a couple of times hed also had to keep merkela from marching into the east wing and wringing krastas neck the algarvians had taken merkelas first husband hostage and blazed him she hated collaborators even more than redheads we dont know everything skarnu said not for the first time we know enough merkela answered with peasant directness all right so she slept with valnu too but she let the redhead futter her for as long as he was here she has to pay the price no one ever said she didnt no one ever said she wont while skarnu was out in the provinces hed got used to thinking of himself as being without a sister after hed learned that krasta was keeping company with her algarvian colonel finding things werent quite so simple jolted him too he sighed and added were not quite sure what the price should be thats all im sure but merkela grimaced and turned away she didnt sound sure not even to herself doing her best to recover the fierceness shed had when fighting algarve seemed futile she brushed blond hair back from her face and said she deserves worse than this this is nothing we cant be too hard on her not when we dont know for certain whose baby it is skarnu said theyd had that argument before too before they could get deeply into it again someone knocked on the door to their bedchamber skarnu went to open it with more than a little relief the butler valmiru bowed to him your excellency a gentleman from the palace to see you and your ah companion he wasnt used to having merkela in the mansion not anywhere close to it and treated her as he might have treated any other dangerous wild animal her blue eyes widened now from the palace she breathed gentlemen from the palace were not in the habit of calling on farms outside the hamlet of pavilosta indeed valmiru said his eyes were blue too like those of merkela of skarnu and of almost all folk of kaunian blood but a blue frosty rather than fiery over the years his hair had faded almost imperceptibly from kaunian blond toward white merkela pushed at skarnu go see what the fellow wants i know one thing he wants skarnu said he wants to see both of us when merkela hung back he took her hand adding you werent afraid to face the redheads when they were blazing at you come on merkela glanced toward gedominu but the baby offered her no excuse to hang back he lay asleep in his cradle rolling her eyes up to the ceiling like a frightened unicorn she went with skarnu good day your excellency milady the man from the royal palace bowed first to skarnu and then just as deeply to merkela he was handsome and dapper his tunic and trousers too tight to be quite practical skarnu had outfits like that but hed come to appreciate comfort in his own time on a farm merkelas tunics and trousers were all of the practical sort needed if one were to do actual work in them instead of working the functionary handed skarnu a sealed envelope then bowed again what have we here skarnu murmured and opened it someone who practiced elegant calligraphy instead of working had written to the marquis skarnu and the lady merkela the pleasure of your company is requested by his majesty king gainibu of valmiera at a reception this evening to honor those who upheld valmieran courage during the dark days of occupation i trust you will come the palace functionary said skarnu nodded but merkela asked a question that sounded all the sharper for being so nervous is krasta invited she gave skarnus sister no title whatever voice bland the functionary replied this is the only invitation i was charged to bring here valmiru sighed when he heard that all the servants would hear it in short order so would krasta and that was liable to be ugly but merkela nodded as sharply as if her family had been noble for ten generations then well be there she declared the functionary bowed and departed only after the butler had closed the door behind him did merkela let out something that sounded very much like a wail but what am i going to wearv go out go shopping skarnu saideven he a mere man could see why she might be worried but he couldnt guess how worried she was in something like despair merkela cried but how do i know what people wear to the palace i dont want to look like a fool and i dont want to look like a whore either valmiru coughed to draw her notice then said you might do well to take someone who is knowledgeable in such matters with youbauska perhaps bauska merkela exclaimed with her halfalgarvian bastard shes krastas maidservant skarnu said she knows clothes better than anyone else here she knows what i think of her too merkela said shed probably get me to buy something ugly just for spite whatever she suggests bring it back and try it on for me first skarnu said i know enough not to let that happen but bauskas the best person you could choose unless you wanted to go out with krasta as hed thought it would that made merkela violently shake her head it also persuaded her to go out with the maidservant skarnu hadnt been so sure that would happen gedominu woke up while his mother was on her expedition to priekule proving hed been away from his servants for a long time skarnu changed him himself and fed him little bits of bread the baby hummed happily while he ate skarnu wished he himself were so easy to amuse a peremptory knock on the door warned him he was about to be anything but amused he thought about ignoring it but that wouldnt do sure enough krasta stood in the hallway without preamble she said whats this i hear about you and that woman going to the palace tonight its true skarnu answered his majesty invited both of us why didnt he invite me his sister demanded both her voice and the line of her jaw seemed particularly hard and unyielding i have no idea skarnu said why dont you ask him the next time you see him and then his own temper boiling over he asked will he recognize you if youre not on an algarvians arm futter you krasta said crisply she turned and stalked away skarnu resisted the impulse to give her a good boot in the rear to speed her passage she is pregnant he reminded himself dada gedominu said and skarnus grim mood lightened his son made him remember what was really important when merkela returned festooned with boxes and packages he waited to see what shed bought then clapped his hands together the turquoise tunic and black trousers set off her eyes emphasized her shape without going too far and made the most of her suntanned skin youre beautiful skarnu said ive known it for years now everyone else will too despite her tan she turned red nonsense she said or a coarse backcountry phrase that meant the same thing everyone at the court will sneer at me skarnu answered with the same coarse phrase merkela blinked and then laughed on the way to the palace she snarled whenever she saw a woman shaved bald or with hair growing out after a shaving the mark of many whod collaborated horizontally i wonder if viscount valnu will have his hair shaved too skarnu remarked merkela gave him a scandalized look whatever he did he did for the kingdom i know valnu skarnu told her he may have done it for the kingdom but that doesnt mean he didnt enjoy every minute of it merkela clucked but didnt answer when they pulled up in front of the palace skarnu handed merkela down though he knew she was used to descending for herself the driver took out a flask with which to keep himself warm a flunky checked skarnu and merkelas names off a list go down this corridor the fellow said pointing the reception will be in the grand hall the grand hall merkela murmured her eyes were already enormous they got bigger with every step she took along the splendid corridor this is like something out of a romance or a fairy tale its real enough its where king gainibu declared war on algarve skarnu said i didnt see him do it id already been called to my regiment but the kingdom didnt live happily ever after ill tell you that at the entry to the grand hall another flunky in a fancy uniform called out marquis skarnu and the lady merkela merkela turned red again skarnu watched her eyeing the women already in the grand hall and a moment later he watched her back straighten as she realized she wasnt out of place after all as far as looks and clothes went skarnu took her arm come on he said and steered her toward the receiving line time for the king to meet you that flustered her anew he added remember this is why he invited you merkela nodded but nervously the line moved slowly which gave her the chance to get back some of her composure even so she squeezed skarnus hand and whispered i dont believe this is really happening before skarnu could answer the two of them stood before the king gainibu had aged more than the years that lay between now and the last time skarnu saw him the red veins in his nose said hed pickled as well as aged but his grip was firm as he clasped skarnus hand and he spoke clearly enough a pleasure your excellency and your charming companion is my fiancée your majesty skarnu answered merkela of pavilosta your majesty merkela whispered her curtsy was awkward but it served a pleasure to meet you milady the king said and raised her hand to his lips ive seen skarnus sister at enough of these functions but she was always with that colonel lurcanio some things cant be helped still this is better thank you your majesty merkela said she had her spirit back now and looked around the grand hall as if to challenge anyone to say she didnt belong there no one did of course but anyone who tried would have been sorry skarnu glanced back at gainibu as he led merkela away gainibu plainly had not had an easy time during the algarvian occupation even so he still remembered how to act like a king the dragon farm lay just outside a yaninan village called psinthos sleet blew into count sabrinos face as he trudged toward the farmhouse where hed rest till it was time to take his wing into the air and throw the dragonfliers at the unkerlanters yet again mostly the mud squelched under his boots but it also had a gritty crunch that hadnt been there a couple of days before its starting to freeze up and get hard sabrino thought thats not so good it means better footing for behemoths and that means king swemmels soldiers will come nosing forward again things have been pretty quiet down here the last couple of days nothing wrong with that i like quiet he opened the door to the farmhouse then slammed it and barred it to keep the wind from ripping it out of his hands then he built up the fire feeding it wood one of the dragonhandlers had cut the wood was damp and smoked when it burned sabrino didnt much care maybe itll smother me went through his mind who would care if it did my wife might a little my mistress he snorted his mistress had left him for a younger man only to discover the other fellow wasnt so inclined to support her in the luxury to which shed been accustomed count sabrino snorted again i wish i could leave me for a younger man he was nearer sixty than fifty hed fought as a footsoldier in the six years war more than a generation before hed started flying dragons because he didnt want to get caught up once more in the great slaughters on the ground of which hed seen entirely too many in the last war and so in this war hed seen plenty of slaughters from the air it was less of an improvement than hed hoped smoky or not the fire was warm little by little the chill began to leach out of sabrinos bones heading into the fourth winter of the war against unkerlant he shook his head in slow wonder who would have imagined that back in the days when mezentio of algarve hurtled his army west against swemmel one kick and the whole rotten structure of unkerlant would come crashing down that was what the algarvians had thought then theyd learned some hard lessons since joints clicking sabrino got to his feet i had a flask somewhere he thumped his forehead with the heel of his hand i really am getting old if i cant remember where he snapped his fingers in the beddingthats right he said aloud as if talking to himself werent another sign of too many years when he found the flask it felt lighter than it should have of that he had no doubt whatever if that dragonhandler gives me wood i dont suppose i can begrudge him a knock of spirits he yanked out the stopper and poured down a knock himself the spirits were yaninan aniseflavored and strong as a demon ah sabrino said fire spread outward from his belly he nodded slowly and deliberately im going to live i may even decide i want to at that he was better off than a lot of algarvian footsoldiers psinthos was far enough behind the line to be out of range of unkerlanter eggtossers how long that would last with the ground freezing he couldnt guess but it remained true for the time being and the furs and leather he wore to fly his dragon also helped keep him warm on the ground someone knocked on the door whos there sabrino called the answer came in algarvian with a chuckle attached well its not the king not today king mezentio had visited sabrino more than once he wished the king hadnt they didnt see eye to eye and never would that was the reason sabrino whod started the war as a colonel and wing commander had never once been promoted he opened the door and held out the flask hello orosio here have some of this itll put hair on your chest thanks sir captain orosio said dont mind if i do the squadron commander drank while sabrino shut the door after drinking orosio made a horrible face burn the hair off my chest more likely but still better bad spirits than none at all he took another swig what can i do for you sabrino asked feels like a freeze is coming orosio said as he walked over to stand in front of the fire he was in his late thirties almost as old for a captain as sabrino was for a colonel part of that came from serving under sabrinoa man under a cloud naturally put his subordinates under one too and part of it sprang from orosios own background hed had barely enough noble blood to make officers rank and not enough to get promoted but that didnt mean he was stupid and it didnt mean he was wrong i thought the same thing myself walking back here after we landed sabrino said if the ground firms upand especially if the rivers start freezing overthe unkerlanters will move aye orosio said the single word hung in the air a shadow of menace orosio turned so that he faced east back toward algarve we havent got a lot of room left to play with sir not any more before long swemmels bastards are going to crash right on into our kingdom unless we stop them and throw them back sabrino said aye sir unless those words hung in the air too orosio didnt believe it sabrino sighed he didnt blame his squadron commander how could he when he didnt believe it either the derlavaian war was far and away the greatest fight the world had ever knownbig enough to dwarf the six years war which the young sabrino whod served in the earlier struggle would never have imagined possible at the timeand algarve barring a miracle or several miracles looked to be on the losing end of it just as she had before king mezentio promised miracles miracles of sorcery that would throw back not only the unkerlanters but also the kuusamans and lagoans in the east so far sabrino had seen only promises not miracles mezentio couldnt even make peace things being as they were no one was willing to make peace with him what did what could a soldier trapped in a losing war do sabrino strode over and set a hand on orosios shoulder my dear fellow we have to keep doing the best we can for our own honors sake if nothing else he said what other choice have we what else is there orosio nodded nothing else sir i know that its only theres not a lot of honor left to save any more either is there after we started massacring kaunians to gain the sorcerous energy we needed to beat unkerlant after we mixed modern sophisticated sorcery and ancient barbarism and still didn t get everything we wanted because swemmel was willing to be every bit as savage as we were and an extra six inches besides no wonder no one wants to make peace with us i wouldnt if i were our enemies but he couldnt tell orosio that he said what he could you know my views captain you also know that no one of rank higher than mine pays the least attention to them let me have that flask again if i drink enough maybe i wont care he hadnt even raised it to his lips though when someone else knocked on the door he opened it and discovered a crystallomancer shivering there the mage said sir i just got word from the front unkerlanter artificers are trying to throw a bridge over the skamandros river if they do therell be big trouble sabrino finished for him the crystallomancer nodded sabrino asked arent there any dragons closer and less worn than this poor miserable wing we just came in from another mission you know of course sir the crystallomancer said but no sir there arent you know how thin were stretched these days dont i just sabrino turned back to orosio do you think we can get them into the air again captain i suppose so sir the squadron commander answered powers above help us if the unkerlanters hit us with fresh beasts while were in the air thoughor even the yaninans or even the yaninans sabrino echoed with a sour smile tsavellas small kingdom lay between algarve and unkerlant hed taken yanina into the derlavaian war as algarves allynot that yaninan soldiers had covered themselves with glory on the austral continent or in unkerlant and when unkerlanter soldiers poured into yanina tsavellas had switched sides with revoltingly good timing with another sour smile sabrino went on as we said we have to do what we can lets go do it his dragonhandler squawked in dismay when he reappeared his dragon screamed in brainless furythe only kind it hadwhen he took his place once more at the base of its long scaly neck more handlers brought a couple of eggs to fasten under its belly it didnt claw at them though sabrino couldnt figure out why keep feeding it he told the handler who tossed the dragon chunks of meat covered with crushed brimstone and cinnabar to make it flame hotter and farther algarve was desperately short of cinnabar these days sabrino wondered what his kingdom would do when it ran out altogether what will we do well do without thats what before long all twentyone dragonfliers were aboard their mounts the wing had a paper strength of sixtyfour and hadnt been anywhere close to it since the opening days of the war against unkerlant stretched too thin sabrino thought again he nodded to the handler who undid the chain that held the dragon to an iron stake sabrino whacked the beast with an irontipped goad with another scream of fury the dragon sprang into the air batwings thundering the rest of the men he led followed each dragon painted in a different pattern of algarves green red and white with low clouds overhead the wing had to stay close to the ground if it wanted to find its target you cant let unkerlanters gain a bridgehead sabrino knew that as well as every other algarvian officer king swemmels men were too cursed good at bursting out of such abscesses in the front when they judged the time ripe orosios image appeared tiny and perfect in the crystal sabrino carried theres the bridge sir he said on the bend of the river a little north of us sabrino turned his head to the right aye i see it he said and guided his dragon toward it the wing will follow me in the attack with a little luck the rain will weaken the beams from the unkerlanters heavy sticks they would know the algarvians had to wreck a bridge if they could and they would want to stop mezentios men from doing it that meant blazing dragons from the sky if they could manage it as sabrino guided his dragon into a dive toward the bridge snaking across the skamandros the unkerlanters on the ground did start blazing at him he was the lead man he drew the beams he could hear raindrops and sleet sizzling into steam as beams burned through them when one passed close he smelled a breaths worth of lightning in the air had it struck but it missed below him the bridge swelled with startling speed he released the eggs under his dragons belly then urged the beast higher into the air once more he saw the flashes of sorcerous energy and heard the roars as the eggs burst behind him more flashes and roars said his dragonfliers were striking the bridge too he twisted in his harness trying to see what had happened he let out a whoop on spotting what was left of the bridge three or four eggs had burst right on it you bastards will be a while fixing that he shouted and turned his dragon back toward the farm in what passed for triumph these days only eighteen dragons landed with his the bridge had cost the other two and the men who flew them it was unquestionably a victory but how many more such victories could algarve afford before she had no dragonfliers left lieutenant leudast stared glumly east across the skamandros river the river running harder than usual because of the latefall rains and not yet ready to freeze over had stalled unkerlants armies longer than its commanders would have wanted artificers were supposed to have bridged it by now but algarvian dragons had put paid to that now the artificers or those of them the attack from the air hadnt killed were trying again captain drogden came up to leudast drogden was a rugged forty like leudast himself hed seen a lot of war he headed the regiment of which leudast commanded a company both of them wore hooded capes over their tunics and both of them had the hoods up to fight the freezing rain both of them also wore wool leggings wool drawers and stout felt boots cold was one thing unkerlanter warriors knew how to beat maybe well get it across this time drogden said peering through the nasty rain at the artificers at work maybe leudast didnt sound convinced but not if the stinking redheads send more dragons and we havent got any on patrol that wasnt what youd call efficient king swemmel had tried mightily to make efficiency unkerlants watchword his subjects mouthed his slogansinspectors made sure of that but they had a good deal of trouble living up to them captain drogden rubbed his nose like leudastlike most unkerlanters he boasted a fine hooked beak one that was sometimes vulnerable to cold weather he said i hear theres a new commander at the closest dragon farm the old commanders gone to a penal battalion oh leudast said and said no more once in a while the men who fought in a penal battalion escaped it by conspicuous deathdefying heroism far more often they simply died softening up tough algarvian positions so the soldiers who followed them in the attack got a better chance of success chief dowser almost went with him drogden added rain must have saved the mage leudast said his superior nodded dowsers spotted dragons at long range by sorcerously detecting the motion of their wingbeats finding that motion in the midst of millions of raindrops taxed dowsing rods spells and the men who used them a gang of yaninan peasants squelched by carrying timbers for the unkerlanter artificers and their bridgebuilding the yaninans were as swarthy as unkerlanters but they were mostly lean men with long faces not stocky men with broad cheekbones they grew bushy mustaches where leudast and his countrymen shaved when they got the chance they wore tight tunics trousers so tight they were almost leggings and absurdly shoes with pompoms on them they also wore unhappy expressions at being shepherded along by a couple of unkerlanter soldiers with sticks our allies leudast said scornfully drogden nodded as long as we dont turn our backs on them anyhow powers below eat them for kicking us when we were down and for getting away with switching sides when they did we could have smashed them right along with the redheads probably sir leudast agreed but the way i look at it is like this their whole fornicating kingdom is a penal battalion these days and they know it toolook at their faces the regimental commander thought about that then laughed and nodded and slapped leudast on the back a penal kingdom drogden said i like that curse me if i dont youre dead right king swemmel will find a way to make them pay of course he will leudast said both men took care to speak as if they were paying the king a huge compliment no one in unkerlant dared speak of swemmel any other way you never could tell who might be listening one of the oldest sayings in unkerlant was when three men conspire one is a fool and the other two are royal inspectors it held a lot of truth under any king who ruled from cottbus under swemmel whod had to win a civil war against his twin brother before taking the throne and who scented plots whether they were there or not it might as well have been a law of nature a few eggs burst perhaps a quarter of a mile away algarvian eggtossers feeling for the new bridge the bursts werent particularly close to it either a couple of the yaninans in the work gang dropped the log they were carrying and made as if to run one of the soldiers with them blazed a puff of steam from the wet ground in front of them they probably didnt understand his curses but that message needed no translation they picked up the log and went back to work surprised he didnt blaze em drogden remarked aye leudast said back when the war was newwhen we moved into forthweg or wed just started fighting the yaninansidve taken cover when i heard bursts that close i know better than to bother now those dumb buggers dont youve been in it from the start drogden asked i sure have sir leudast answered before the start eveni was fighting the gongs in the elsung mountains way out west when algarves neighbors declared war on her i was in forthweg when the redheads jumped on our back and ive been trying to kill those whoresons ever since theyve been trying to kill me too but they only blazed me twice add it all up and ive been pretty lucky matter of fact theyve got me twice too drogden said once in the leg and once he held up his left hand till he did it leudast hadnt noticed he was missing the last two joints of that little finger were you in from the very beginning too leudast asked him ive been in the army since then aye but i only went to the front a year and a half ago drogden said really leudast said you dont mind my asking sir how did you manage to stay away so long who kept you safe went through his mind so did who finally got angry enough at you to make you come work for a living like everybody else but drogden said for a long time i was in charge of one of the big behemothbreeding farms in the far southwest it was crazy there especially after the redheads started overrunning so many of the farms here in the east we were getting breeding stock and fodder out as best we could and sending the animals and everything else across the kingdom so we could go on breeding them in places where the enemys dragons couldnt reach we did it aye but it wasnt easy i believe that leudast said there had been plenty of times the first year and a half of the war when hed wondered if the kingdom would hold together there had been more than a few times when hed feared it wouldnt he went on you had an important job sir what are you doing here with a shrug drogden replied they replaced me with a man who knew behemoths but whod lost an arm he couldnt fight any more but he could be useful in my old slot that freed me up to go into battle efficiency efficiency leudast echoed for once he didnt feel like a hypocrite saying it the move captain drogden described made good sense even if he might have preferred to stay thousands of miles away from the war on the other hand uh sir why didnt they put you in among the behemothriders if you were in charge of a breeding farm actually i trained as a footsoldier drogden answered raising behemoths was the family business i joined the army because i didnt feel like going into it he laughed a brief sardonic laugh things dont always work out the way you plan thats true enough leudast agreed a couple of more algarvian eggs burst these were a little closer but not enough to get excited about he went on if things had worked out the way the redheads planned theyd have marched into cottbus before the snow fell that first winter of the war youre right drogden said from what ive seen mezentios men are almost as smart as they think they are that makes them pretty cursed dangerous on account of they really are a pack of smart buggers weve seen that curse them leudast said his regimental commander nodded sometimes though they think they can do more than they really can thats when weve made em pay and now by the powers above theyll pay plenty aye savage hunger filled leudasts voice like almost all unkerlanter soldiers whod seen what the algarvians had done withdone tothe part of his kingdom theyd occupied he wanted algarve to suffer as much or more drogden looked up to the dripping sky a raindrop hit him in the eye he rubbed at his face as he said i hope the weather stays bad the worse it is the more trouble the algarvians will have hitting that bridgeand however many others were building across the skamandros when the bad weather comes thats always been our time leudast started to say something moreto say that if not for unkerlants dreadful winters the redheads might well have taken cottbusbut held his tongue drogden might have reckoned that criticism of king swemmel the fewer chances you took the fewer risks you ran leudast looked across the skamandros again facing the enemy he had to take chances facing his friends he didnt sunshine greeted him when he woke up the next morning at first he took that with a shrug but then remembering captain drogdens words he cursed the business ends of some large number of heavy sticks poked up to the sky on the west bank of the skamandros any algarvian dragons that did dive on the bridge wouldnt have an easy time of it mezentios dragonfliers hadnt had it easy the last time they attacked either but theyd wrecked the bridge leudast ordered his own company forward all the way up to the edge of the river the beams from their sticks couldnt blaze a dragon from the sky without the wildest luck but they might wound or even kill a dragonflier that was worth trying the algarvians will throw everything theyve got at us he warned his men they cant afford to let us get a foothold on the far side of the skamandros as if to underscore his words a flight of unkerlanter dragons all painted the same rockgray as his uniform tunic and cloak flew low over the river to pound the algarvian positions on the eastern side the soldiers nodded approvingly if the redheads were catching it they would have a harder time dishing it out and when the algarvian strike at the bridge came leudast didnt even notice it at first one dragon flying so high that it seemed only a speck in the sky he was tempted to laugh at mezentios men a few of the heavy sticks blazed at it most didnt bother they had no real hope of bringing it down not from that height he didnt see the two eggs the dragon dropped either not till they fell far enough to make them look larger looks like theyll land on the redheads one of his men said pointing serve em right the bastards but it did not do to depend on the algarvians to be fools as the eggs neared the ground they suddenly seemed to swerve in midair and those swerves brought them down square on the bridge over the skamandros a long length of it tumbled into the river what sort of sorcery is that leudast howled he got no answer till that evening when he put the same question to captain drogden the redheads have something new there the regimental commander replied with what leudast reckoned commendable calm steering eggs by sorcery is hard even for them so they dont do it very often and it doesnt always work it worked here leudast said morosely drogden nodded the unkerlanters stayed on the west bank of the skamandros a while longer hajjaj was glad to return to bishah the zuwayzi foreign minister was glad hed been allowed to return to his capital he was glad bishah remained the capital of the kingdom of zuwayza and that unkerlant hadnt chosen to swallow his small hot homeland after knocking it out of the derlavaian war but most of all he was glad to have escaped from cottbus i can understand that your excellency qutuz his secretary said on the day when he returned to king shazlis palace imagine being stuck in a place where they wear clothes all the time its not so much that they wear them all the time hajjaj replied like qutuz he was a lean dark brown man though his hair and beard were white rather than black and like qutuz like almost all zuwayzin he wore only sandals and sometimes a hat unless meeting with foreigners who would be scandalized at nudity he groped for words its that they need to wear them so much of the time that they would really and truly die if they didnt wear them until youve been down to the south you have no idea what weather can donone i tell you qutuz shuddered that probably helps make the unkerlanters what they are i wouldnt be surprised hajjaj answered of course other derlavaians ones who dont live where the weathers quite so beastly wear clothes too i wouldnt care to guess what that says about them and the kuusamans have a climate every bit as beastly as unkerlants and they are by and large very nice people so you never can tell i suppose not his secretary said and then in musing tones kuusamans we havent seen many of them in zuwayza for a while no indeed hajjaj agreed a few captives from sunken ships a few more from leviathans killed off our shores but otherwise he shook his head well have a lot of closed ministries opening up again before long ansovald is already back at the unkerlanter ministry qutuz observed so he is hajjaj said and let it go at that he despised the unkerlanter minister to zuwayza who was crude and harsh even by the standards of his kingdom hed despised him when ansovald served here before unkerlant and zuwayza went to war and hed despised him down in cottbus when ansovald had presented king swemmels terms for ending the war to him ansovald knew he didnt care if anything he found it funny that only made hajjaj despise him more kuusamans qutuz repeated unkerlanters he sighed but went on lagoans valmierans jelgavans new people to deal with we do what we can we do what we must hajjaj said ive heard that marquis balastro did safely reach algarve good news qutuz said nodding im glad to hear it too balastro wasnt a bad man not at all no he wasnt hajjaj agreed wishing the same could be said of the cause for which algarve fought having the algarvian ministry standing empty felt as strange as imagining the others filled not even hajjaj could blame swemmel of unkerlant for requiring zuwayza to renounce her old ally and cleave to her new ones hed never liked many of the things algarve had done hed loathed some of them and told balastro so to his face but any kingdom that could help zuwayza get revenge against unkerlant had looked like a reasonable ally and so and so zuwayza had gambled and so zuwayza had lost with a sigh hajjaj said and now we have to make the best of it the unkerlanters had made zuwayza switch sides theyd made her yield land and yield ports for her ships theyd made her promise to consult with them on issues pertaining to their dealings with other kingdomsthat particularly galled hajjaj but they hadnt deposed king shazli and set up the reformed principality of zuwayza with a puppet prince as theyd threatened to do during the war they hadnt deposed shazli and set up ansovald as governor in bishah either however much hajjaj disliked swemmel and his countrymen they might have done worse than they had and they would have if they werent still fighting hard against algarveand not quite so hard against gyongyos hajjaj thought well if theyve chosen to be sensible i wont complain one of the kings serving women came into the office and curtsied to hajjaj may it please your excellency his majesty would confer with you she said but for some beads and bracelets and rings she wore no more than hajjaj and qutuz hajjaj noticed her nudity more than he would have if he hadnt just come from a kingdom where women shrouded themselves in baggy anklelength tunics thank you maryem he replied ill come of course he followed her to shazlis private audience chamber he enjoyed following her she was wellmade and shapely but i dont stare like the paleskinned foreigners who drape themselves he thought we may scandalize them but who really has the more barbarous way of looking at things he chuckled to himself if he hadnt studied at the university of trapani in algarve such a notion probably never would have occurred to him your majesty he murmured bowing as he came into king shazlis presence always a pleasure to see you your excellency shazli replied he too was nude but for sandals and a thin gold circlet on his brow he was a slightly plump mannearing forty now which startled hajjaj whenever he thought about it with a sharp mind and a good heart though perhaps without enormous force of character hajjaj liked him and had since he was a baby please sit down the king said make yourself comfortable thank you your majesty zuwayzin used thick rugs and piles of cushions in place of the chairs and sofas common elsewhere in derlavai hajjaj made himself a mound of them and leaned back against it shazli waited till hed finished then asked shall i have tea and wine and cakes sent in as you wish your majesty if you would rather get down to business i shant be offended zuwayzin wasted endless convivial hours in the ritual of hospitality surrounding tea and wine and cakes hajjaj often used them as a diplomatic weapon when he didnt feel like talking about something right away no no shazli hadnt had a foreign education and clung to traditional zuwayzi ways more strongly than his much older foreign minister and so another serving girl fetched in tea fragrant with mint date wine hajjaj actually preferred grape wine but the thicker sweeter stuff did cast his memory back to childhood and cakes dusted with sugar and full of pistachios and cashews only small talk passed over tea and wine and cakes today hajjaj endured the rituals instead of enjoying them at last the king sighed and blotted his lips with a linen napkin and remarked the first unkerlanter ships put in at najran today i hope they were suitably dismayed hajjaj remarked indeed king shazli said i am given to understand that their captains made some pointed remarks to the officers in charge of the port i warned ansovald when i signed the peace agreement that the unkerlanters would get less use from our eastern ports than they seemed to expect hajjaj said they didnt seem to believe me the only reason najran is a port at all is that a ley line runs through it and out into the bay of ajlun hed been there even by zuwayzi standards it was a sunblazed desolate place you understand that your excellency and i also understand it shazli said but if the unkerlanters fail to understand it they could make our lives very unpleasant if they land soldiers at najran those soldiers can make the acquaintance of the kaunians who managed to escape from forthweg hajjaj said i dont know how much else they could do even now when the weather is as cool and wet as it ever gets i can hardly see them marching overland to bishah can you your majesty well possibly not the king admitted but if they want an excuse to revise the agreement they forced on us if they want such an excuse your majesty they can always find one hajjaj didnt often interrupt his sovereign but here hed done it twice in a row my belief is that this is nothing but unkerlanter bluster and if you are wrong shazli asked then swemmels men will do whatever they do and we shall have to live with it hajjaj replied that unfortunately is what comes of losing a war the king grimaced but did not answer hajjaj heaved himself to his feet and departed a little later he knew he hadnt pleased shazli but reckoned telling his sovereign the truth more important he hoped shazli felt the same and if not he shrugged hed been foreign minister longer than shazli had been king if his sovereign decided his services were no longer required he would go into retirement without the slightest murmur of protest shazli gave no sign of displeasure hajjaj almost wished the king had for the next day ansovald summoned him to the unkerlanter ministry and i shall have to go too he told qutuz with a martyred sigh the price we pay for defeat as i remarked to his majesty given a choice i would sooner visit the dentist he enjoys the pain he inflicts less than ansovald does hajjaj dutifully donned an unkerlanterstyle tunic to visit ansovald he minded that less than he would have in high summer calling on the jelgavans and valmierans means wearing trousers he thought and imagined he was breaking out in hives at the mere idea another sigh most heartfelt burst from him two stolid unkerlanter sentries stood guard outside the ministry they werent so stolid however as to keep their eyes from shifting to follow goodlooking women going by with nothing on but hats and sandals and jewelry with luck the sentries didnt speak zuwayzisome of the womens comments about them would have flayed the hide from a behemoth ansovald was large and bluff and blocky hello your excellency he said in algarvian the only language he and hajjaj had in common hajjaj savored the irony of that he had little else to savor for ansovald bulled ahead ive got some complaints for you i listen hajjaj did his best to look politely attentive sure enough the unkerlanter minister fussed and fumed about the many shortcomings of najran when he finished hajjaj inclined his head and replied i am most sorry your excellency but i did warn you about the state of our ports we shall do what we can to cooperate with your captains but we can only do what we can do if you take my meaning who would have thought you ever told so much of the truth ansovald growled staying polite wasnt easy ido it for my kingdom hajjaj thought is there anything more he asked getting ready to leave but ansovald said aye there is i listen hajjaj said again wondering what would come next minister iskakis tells me youve got his wifetassi i think the bitchs name isat your house up in the hills tassi is not a bitch hajjaj said more or less truthfully nor is she iskakis wife she has received a divorce here in zuwayza he wants her back ansovald said yanina is unkerlants ally nowadays and so is zuwayza if i tell you to give her back you bloody well will no hajjaj said and enjoyed the look of astonishment the word brought to the unkerlanters face he also enjoyed amplifying it if iskakis had her back he would use her as he uses boys if he used her at all he prefers boys she prefers not being used so unkerlant is indeed zuwayzas ally even her superior i admit it but your excellency that does not make you into my master not on any individual level and so good day tassi stays he enjoyed turning his back and walking out on ansovald most of all every now and againmore often in fact than every now and againistvan felt guilty about being alive it wasnt so much that he remained a kuusaman captive on the island of obuda gyongyosians reckoned themselves a warrior race and knew that captivity might befall a warrior but to have stayed alive after his countrymen sacrificed themselves to harm kuusamo that was something else something harder to bear in good conscience we knew he said to corporal kun as the two of them chopped wood in the midst of a chilly rain we knew and we didnt do anything sergeant we did what needed doing kun answered his next stroke buried his axehead in the ground not in the chunk of pine in front of him maybe his conscience bothered him too in spite of his bold words or maybe he just couldnt see what he was doing he wore spectacles and the rain couldnt be doing them any good indeed he muttered cant see a cursed thing before going on we didnt get our throats cut either and that puts us ahead of the game or will you tell me im wrong no istvan said though he didnt sound altogether convinced he explained why half of me feels we should have told the kuusamans what was coming so our comrades would still be alive the other half he shrugged i keep wondering if the stars will refuse to shine on my spirit because i didnt do everything i could to hurt the slanteyes how many times have we been over this kun said patiently as if he had the higher rank and istvan the lower did captain frigyes really hurt the kuusamans not bloody much you can tell by lookingwell you could if it werent raining his precision was a hint that hed been a mages apprentice in gyorvar the capital before getting conscripted into ekrekek arpads army istvan sighed kunhegyes his home village lay in a mountain valley far in distance and even further in ideas from gyorvar he clung to the old ways of gyongyos as best he could not least because he hardly knew any others he was a big broadshouldered man with a mane of tawny yellow hair and a thick bushy beard a shade darker like a lot of his countrymen he looked leonine so did kun but he made a distinctly scrawny lion even when he wasnt wearing his spectacles though he dwarfed the kuusaman guards he was neither tall nor wide by gyongyosian standards and his beard had always been and probably would always be on the patchy side with another sigh istvan said a pox on it lets just work when im chopping wood i dont have to think since everything happened i dont much feel like thinking aye i believe that kun answered in a different tone of voice the words would have sounded sympathetic instead as usual kun only sounded sardonic ahh go bugger a goat istvan said but his heart wasnt in the curse kun was as he was as the stars had made him and no one could change him now you two lousy gongs you talk too much a kuusaman guard yelled in bad gyongyosian the guards didnt usually give their captives as much leeway as istvan and kun had the patter of the rain and the curtain of falling drops must have kept them from noticing what was going on for a while to work harder the small dark slanteyed man added he carried a stick which meant the gyongyosians had to pay heed to him or at least pretend they did after a while the woodchopping shift ended the kuusamans collected the axes from the detail and carefully counted them before dismissing the captives they tried to take no chancesbut theyd let the gyongyosians turn loose a sorcery that had wrecked big stretches of obuda all through not paying quite enough attention to what their captives were up to kun said youve got your nerve sergeant talking about goats to me istvan looked around nervously before answering oh shut up his voice was rough and full of loathing goats were forbidden beasts to gyongyosians perhaps because of their lasciviousness and habit of eating anything whatever the reason forbidden they were it was perhaps the strongest prohibition the folk of gyongyos knew bandit bands and perverts sometimes ate goat to mark themselves off from ordinary decent peopleand when they got caught at it they were most often buried alive kun for a wonder did shut up but he held out his left hand palm up and open so the rain splashed down onto it along with a woodcutters calluses he had a scar on the palm between his second and third fingers unwillingly istvan held out his hand too his palm bore an identical scar he had a scar on the back of his hand too as if a knife had gone all the way through it had kun bore a like scar there too were the only ones left now i think istvan said kun nodded somberly neither one said what they were left from istvan wished he could forget he knew he never would not to his dying day back when the squad hed led were fighting in the great pine woods of western unkerlant theyd ambushed some unkerlanters in a little clearing not least so they could take the stew swemmels soldiers were cooking it turned out to be goat stew the whole squad had eaten of it before the company commander came up and realized what it was captain tivadar would have been within his rights to blaze them all he hadnt done it after theyd stuck fingers down their throats to puke up their appalling meal hed cut every one of them to atone for their inadvertent sin not a man had cried out theyd all counted themselves lucky to be known as a goateater in gyongyos istvan shuddered he hadnt done it on purpose but how much difference did that really make he still often wondered if he was accursed tivadar was dead killed in those endless woods so far as istvan knew hed never said a word about what hed done there in the clearing the other men in the squad had died in other fights szonyi as good a fighting man as any istvan had known had chosen to let his throat be cut here on obuda istvan hadnt been able to talk him out of it only kun and me sure enough istvan thought his eyes slid toward the exmages apprentice he wished no one else knew what hed done he wished it with all his soul but on the other hand how much difference did a wish like that make he knew hed had goats flesh on his tongue and its mark scarred his spirit as tivadars knife had scarred his hand perhaps deliberately changing the subject kun said just as well the kuusamans didnt ask us too many questions after frigyes loosed his spell why should they have istvan returned we didnt have anything to do with it wed both come down with the runs hours before it happened kun walked a little straighter for a couple of paces hed found the leaves that turned their guts inside out but then he said if id been the one picking up the pieces after that sorcery idve wondered why a couple of men just happened to get sick right then idve wondered whether they knew more than they were letting on by the stars youve got a nasty suspicious mind istvan said thank you kun answered which spoiled the insult kun went on if im the fellow investigating something like that im supposed to have a nasty suspicious mind eh maybe istvan said i guess so somehow i get the feeling kuusamans arent as suspicious as they ought to be you may be right kun thought it over as they neared their barracks aye sure enough you may be right it doesnt mean theyre not dangerous though i never said it did istvan replied we fought them here on obuda you and i but its their island now most of the islands in the bothnian ocean are theirs now i know kun said i cant help but know can i and what does that tell you what that you know it tells me youre not a complete fooljust mostly kun gave istvan a sour look youre being stupid on purpose youre not nearly so funny when you do that as when youre stupid because you dont know any better what does it tell you that the kuusamans hold most of the islands in the bothnian ocean and that we arent taking any back the way we would when the war was new the barracks loomed ahead an ugly leaky building of raw timber the cots inside though were better and less crowded than had been the cots in the gyongyosian barracks where istvan had stayed before while stationed on obuda but that wasnt why the barracks felt like a refuge now if he got inside maybe he wouldnt have to answer his comrades question kun coughed sharply again acting as if his rank were higher than istvans he said you know the answer as well as i do why wont you say it you know why curse it istvan mumbled is the truth less the truth because you dont name it kun asked inexorably do you think it will go away do you think the stars wont shine their light on it or do you just want me to have to do the dirty work and say it out loud thats exactly what i want but istvan didnt want anyone to say it out loud because he did feel that somehow made it more real but if hed gone forward against the kuusamans if hed gone forward against the unkerlanters couldnt he go forward against the truth too almost as if he were attacking kun he shouted into the smaller mans face theyre taking the fornicating islands because were losing the fornicating war there are you fornicating happy now kun gave back a pacea couple of paces in fact then he had to rally and he did youre honest at any rate he said the next question is what do we do if we keep on losing i dont know istvan answered and you dont know either its been a long time since gyongyos lost a war he spoke with the pride to be expected of a man from a warrior race thats because we havent fought a whole lot of them lately kun said when you think about what alls gone on in this one thats not so bad is it istvan started to reply then realized he had no good reply to give what was the point of being a man from a warrior race without any wars to fight on the other hand what was the point of fighting a war and losing it shaking his head and muttering to himself istvan went into the barracks some of the captives already inside nodded to him most of the men hed known best the men from his own company were dead thanks to captain frigyes most of the faces here now the men lounging on cots the fellow putting more wood on the stove were strangers to him but they were of his kind they looked like him they spoke his tongue maybe in a captives camp he was a sheep among sheep with them not a wolf among wolves still he was with his own that would do it would have to two bembo strutted through the ravaged streets of eoforwic twirling his bludgeon by its leather strap as if he were the king of the world once upon a time algarvians on occupation duty in forthweg might as well have been kings of the world the constable sighed pining for the good old days he put on his show at least as much to keep up his own spirits as to impress the forthwegians around him from behind him somebody called out in pretty good algarvian hey tubby the unkerlantersll press you for oil when they cross the twegen by the time bembo and his partner oraste had whirled nobody back there looked to have opened his mouth none of the forthwegians on the street so much as smiled that left the constable with nobody to blame smartmouthed son of a whore bembo said he started to set his free hand on his belly as if to deny he had too much of it then as if afraid the gesture would call attention to his ample flesh he left it uncompleted oraste unlike bembo was not the typical highspirited excitable algarvian he was in fact dour as an unkerlanter most of the time but he was laughing now laughing at bembo he got you good he did oh shut up bembo muttered he didnt say it very loud oraste had a formidable temper and bembo didnt care to have it aimed at him one of the reasons he enjoyed being a constable was that it meant he could dish out trouble without having to take it all that had broken down during the forthwegian uprising here constables and soldiers had fought side by side then what with the rebels giving almost as much trouble as they were getting and with the unkerlanters indeed just on the other side of the river nobody could feel safe at nightor for that matter during the daytime if they started tossing eggs again bembo looked around for the closest hole into which to jump as hed expected he wouldnt have to run far eoforwic these days was little but holes and rubble he and oraste turned a corner a couple of forthwegians had been shouting at each other when they saw the constables they abruptly fell silent bembo let out a small sigh he might have had the chance to shake them down if theyd kept squabbling oraste sighed too he probably would sooner have beaten them up than put a bribe in his belt pouch but no accounting for taste a squad of algarvian soldiers tramped by on their way down to the twegen one of them pointed to bembo and oraste and called you constable bastards thought you were lucky all safe and comfy back here in forthweg away from the western front well now the unkerlanters have bloody well come to you since you didnt have the balls to go to them his pals laughed there were a dozen of them because there were a dozen of them bembo replied in a whisper only oraste could hear if you soldier bastards hadnt got run out of unkerlant we wouldnt be worrying about swemmels buggers now his partner grunted and nodded and said if i ever see that particular son of a whore by himself hell be sorry his mother let the nextdoor neighbor in for a quickie whenever her husband went to work bembo guffawed a couple of soldiers looked back suspiciously come on you lugs get moving called the corporal in charge of them what do we care about a couple of fornicating constables i wish i was a fornicating constable right now bembo said itd be a lot more fun than what i am doing oraste laughed less than bembo thought the joke deserved that made bembo sulk instead of strutting as he and oraste paced off their beat a lot of algarvians would have jollied him along till he was in a good humor again oraste a sullen fellow himself didnt careindeed didnt noticewhat sort of humor the people around him were in they ought to send us all back to algarve bembo said after a while looking for something new to complain about all us constables i mean that made oraste laugh but not in the way bembo had intended oh aye the soldiers would really love us then he said wake up fool sleepy times over but what good are we doing here bembo demanded now that hed started his complaints made perfect senseto him at least this whole miserable city is under military occupation and martial law what are constables good for then for whatever soldiers dont feel like doing oraste answered i know whats eating you old pal you cant fool me you just dont want to be here when swemmels bastards finally get around to swarming over the twegen oh and you do bembo retorted ill just bet you do sweetheart oraste didnt answer that because he didnt bembo concluded he had no answer there was no answer no algarvian in his right mindprobably no crazy algarvian eitherwanted to be in a town the unkerlanters overran if you were in there then either you wouldnt come out or youd come out a captive bembo wondered which was worse he hoped he wouldnt have to find out a forthwegian labor gang went by herded by a couple of algarvians with sticks wonder how many of those whoresons are kaunians in sorcerous disguise bembo said too many oraste answered oned be too many however this stinking war turns out weve got rid of a whole great raft of blonds that was worth doing bembo shrugged back before the war he hadnt thought much about kaunians one way or the other a few blonds had lived in tricarico as a few sometimes more than a fewhad lived in a lot of cities in the north of algarve reminders of where the kaunian empire had once stretched but theyd been taken away while the war was new bembo supposed that made sense how loyal would blonds in algarve be when king mezentio was at war with jelgava and valmiera both kaunian lands and with forthweg a kingdom where blonds had more than their share of money and power his own notions about kaunians had changed after the derlavaian war broke out he remembered that now that he thought about it a little how could they have helped but change when the bookstores were filled with romances about the slutty blond women of imperial days and other choice bits and when every fence and wall sprouted broadsheets telling the worldor at least the algarvian part of itwhat a pack of monsters kaunians were he blinked you know something he said to oraste we were made to hate the blonds it didnt just happen his partners shoulders broad as a forthwegians went up and down in a businesslike shrug altogether different from the usual algarvian production speak for yourself oraste said he jabbed a thumb at his own chest me i never needed any help a lot of algarviansand from everything bembo had seen even more forthwegiansfelt the same way before the war bembo began what was the he didnt finish for bells began clanging all over eoforwic dragons oraste exclaimed futtering unkerlanter dragons he looked around his eyes wild as did bembo now where in blazes is a cellar i dont see one bembo wasnt the least ashamed of the fear in his voice most almost all the buildings hereabouts were wrecks their cellars if theyd ever had them buried under rubble he moaned but i see the dragons they flew low as they usually did on raids like this only a couple of hundred feet above the waters of the twegen the rockgray paint swemmels men gave them made them all the harder to spot but bembo could see how many of them there were and that no algarvian beasts rose to challenge them one or two tumbled out of the sky hit by beams from heavy sticks but the rest came on eggs slung under their bellies no cellars oraste said as some of those eggs began to fall and to release bursts of the sorcerous energy trapped inside them next best thing is the deepest hole in the ground we can find he started to run so did bembo his belly jiggling oraste jumped into a hole but it was plainly too small for a pair of goodsized men bembo kept running while the roars from bursting eggs came closer and closer as the unkerlanter dragons penetrated deeper and deeper over eoforwic bembo spotted a likely hole and dashed towards it he was only a couple of strides away when an egg burst much too closeand then he wasnt running any more but flying through the air it wasnt anything like his dreams of flying for one thing he had no control over it whatever for another it didnt last more than half a heartbeatand when he hit a pile of rubble he hit hard he felt something snap in his leg he heard it too that was almost worseat least till the pain reached his mind which took a couple of extra heartbeats somebody close by was screaming whoever he was he had to be close by bembo could hear him through the din of the eggs after a moment he realized those screams came from his own mouth he tried to make them stop but it was like trying to recork a fizzing bottle of sparkling wineonce that stopper was out no getting it in again he bawled on and on and hoped an egg would burst on him and kill him then at least it would be over no such luck what did i ever do to deserve this wondered some small part of his brain still able to think unfortunately he had no trouble coming up with answers few algarvians whod served in forthweg would have the dragons kept dropping eggs for what seemed like forever bembo kept screaming all that while too and he kept screaming after the unkerlanter dragons flew back toward the west oh shut up oraste told him lets have a look at you he did with rough competence the accent being on rough when he finished he said well bembo my lad you are one lucky son of a whore that startled bembo enough to make him stop screaming for a moment lucky he howled why you he called oraste every name he knew considering the decade or so hed spent in the constabulary he knew a lot of names oraste slapped him in the face shut up he said again this time in a flat angry voice i said lucky and i meant fornicating lucky youre hurt bad enough they wont keep you around here on account of you wont be good for a fornicating thing for a long time that means you wont be here when the unkerlanters finally do come over the twegen and if thats not lucky what in blazes is you want me to try splinting your leg or you want me to wait for a healer bembo cursed him again not quite so savagely as before then the pain made everything blurry for some little while when he fully returned to himself someone he didnt recognize was leaning over him saying here constable drink this he drank it tasted nastya horrible blend of spirits and poppy seeds after a bit the pain ebbedor he felt as if he were floating away from it better he mumbled good the healer said now im going to set that leg go ahead bembo thought vaguely i wont care but he did the decoction hed drunk wasnt strong enough to keep him from feeling the ends of the broken bone grinding against each other as the healer manipulated them bembo shrieked almost done the healer assured him and youll be going back to algarve to get better after that theyll take good care of you oraste was right bembo said in drowsy drugged wonder a couple of forthwegians put him on a litterand hauled him off toward the leyline caravan depot when he got there another healer poured more of the decoction down him he never remembered getting carried aboard the caravan when he woke up he was on his way back to algarve outside the royal palace in patras a blizzard howled marshal rathar had little use for the palace or for the capital of yanina he wore a heavy cloak over his kneelength rockgray tunic and was none too warm even with it why do you people not heat your buildings in the wintertime he growled at king tsavellas the king of yanina was a skinny little bald man with a big gray mustache and dark sorrowful eyes we do he answered we heat them so we are comfortable we do not turn them into ovens as you unkerlanters like to do both the king of yanina and the marshal of unkerlant spoke algarvian it was the only tongue they had in common classical kaunian was much less studied in their kingdoms than farther east on the continent of derlavai rathar savored the irony tsavellas had had no trouble talking with his erstwhile allies the redheads now he could use his command of their language to talk with the new masters of yanina if you are indoors you should be warm rathar insisted he enjoyed telling a king what to do especially since tsavellas had to listen to him king swemmel this time rathars shiver had nothing to do with the chilly halls through which he walked the king of unkerlant was a law unto himself all kings of unkerlant were but swemmel more so than most warm is one thing tsavellas said warm enough to cook his expressive shrug might almost have come from an algarvian rathar didnt answer he was eyeing the painted panels that ornamented the walls yaninans in oldfashioned robesbut always with pompoms on their shoesstared out of the panels at him from enormous somber eyes sometimes they fought algarvians other times unkerlanters always they were shown triumphant rathar supposed the artists whod created them had had to paint what their patrons wanted those patrons had lost no sleep worrying about the truth he couldnt read the legends picked out in gold leaf beside some of the figures on the walls he couldnt even sound them out yanina used a script different from every other way of writing in derlavai rathar reckoned that typical of the yaninans the most contrary fractious factionridden folk in the world here we are tsavellas said leading him into a room with more yaninans painted on the walls and with maps on the tables a yaninan officer in a uniform much fancier than ratharshis short tunic over kilt and leggings glittered with gold leaf and even his pompoms were gildedsprang to his feat and bowed tsavellas went on i present to you general mantzaros the commander of all my forces he speaks algarvian he would rathar rumbled he was hardly fifty himselfburly vigorous and dour any man whod spent so much time dealing with king swemmel had earned the right to be dour when he held out his hand mantzaros clasped his wrist instead in the algarvian style rathar raised an eyebrow have you forgotten whose side youre on these days general by no means marshal mantzaros drew himself up to his full height which was a couple of inches less than rathars do you seek to insult me yaninans were some of the touchiest people on earth too without the style algarvians brought to their feuds no i seek to get some use out of the rabble you call an army rathar said brutally that made both mantzaros and king tsavellas splutter the general found his voice first our brave soldiers are doing everything they can to aid our allies of unkerlant you have not got more than a handful of brave soldiers we saw that when you were fighting against us rathar said ignoring the yaninans cries of protest he went on now that you are on our side you had better get your men moving against the cursed redheads that was the bargain you struck when you became our alliesour puppets he thoughtand you are going to live up to it your men will spearhead several attacks we have planned you will use them to weaken the algarvians so you can win on the cheap tsavellas said shrilly this is not war this is murder if you try to go back on your agreement your majestyrathar used the title with savage gleeyou will find out what murder is i promise you that do you understand me tsavellas and mantzaros both shivered and turned pale beneath their swarthy skins the algarvians killed kaunians for the life energy that powered their strongest deadliest sorceries to fight back swemmel ordered the deaths of criminals and of the old and useless of unkerlant but now that his soldiers held yanina in a grip of iron what was to stop him from killing tsavellas folk instead nothing at all as anyone who knew him had to realize we are loyal tsavellas said to yourselves perhaps rathar answered the king looked indignant indeed almost shocked no yaninan would have dared speak to him so but marshal rathar was no yaninanfor which he thanked the powers aboveand had to deal with a king ever so much more fearsome than tsavellas he went on king swemmel still recalls how you would not turn over king penda of forthweg to him when penda fled here early in the war general mantzaros said something in yaninan if it wasnt i told you so rathar would have been mightily surprised tsavellas snapped something pungent in his own language then returned to algarvian king penda escaped my palace i still do not know how he came to lagoas on the whole rathar believed him but that had nothing to do with anything in a voice like sounding brass he said but you had penda here in patras here in your palace and you would not give him to swemmel when my sovereign demanded his person he was a king tsavellas protested he is a king one does not surrender a king as one does a burglar is a king who has no kingdom still a king rathar asked i did not give him to mezentio of algarve either and he wanted him too rathars shrug held a world of indifference you did not surrender him to king swemmel swemmel reckons that a slight i speak no secrets when i tell you king swemmels memory for slights is very long indeed tsavellas shivered again it is easy for your king to have a long memory he is strong for a man who rules a small kingdom a weak kingdom trapped between two strong ones things are not so easy unkerlant wasistrapped between gyongyos and algarveand yanina rathar said you may redeem yourself but you will pay whatever price king swemmel demands if you balk you shall not redeem yourself and you will pay much more do you understand that your majesty once more he enjoyed using the kings formal title as he dictated to him king tsavellas wilted rathar had expected nothing less the king of yanina found himself in an impossible situation hed saved his throne by switching sides at just the right moment but hed left himself a hostage to unkerlant in doing so if he didnt obey swemmel could easily find some pliant yaninan nobleor an unkerlanter governorwho would aye tsavellas said sullenly tell us what you require and we shall do it is it not so general it is so general mantzaros agreed it will bleed our kingdom white but it is so do you think unkerlant has not been bled white rathar said do you think yanina did not help bleed unkerlant white this is what you bought and this is the price you will pay for it you know the algarvians are holding along the line of the skamandros river aye the king and his general said together rathar wasnt so sure how much they knew but accepted their word for the time being he said i intend to throw yaninan armies across the river here and herehe pointed to the spots he had in mindin three days time you will have them ready or it will go hard for you and your kingdom in three days mantzaros croaked that is not possible this is your last chance to keep yaninan armies under yaninan officers general rathar said coldly if you do not move the men as we require we shall do it for you that will be the end of your army as an army we will use it as part of oursas a small part of ours have you any questions no mantzaros whispered he spoke in yaninan to king tsavellas who replied in the same tongue mantzaros dipped his head as yaninans usually did in place of nodding returning to algarvian he said we obey good that is what is required of you no moreand no less he turned his back on the general and the king and strode out of the map room the painted yaninans on the hallway walls stared reproachfully from their big round liquid eyes he ignored them as he had ignored the king and the general once they gave him what he wanted he also ignored the anxious yaninan courtiers who tried to get him to tell them what was going on after fawning they cringed rathars carriage waited outside the palace take me to our headquarters he told the driver the soldier a stolid unkerlanter nodded and obeyed without a word that suited rathar fine the headquarters was an appropriated house quite fine in a district full of fancy shopscertainly fancier than any in cottbus the yaninans couldnt fight worth a lick but they lived well when rathar walked in he smelled a pungent smoky odor hed never met before and heard general vatran coughing powers above whats that stink he demanded im breathing the smoke of these leaves i got from the grocer across the street vatran answered between wheezes he was stocky and whitehaired almost twenty years older than rathar one of the few truly senior officers to have survived a generation of swemmels rages but a solid soldier nonetheless varvakis says they come from some island in the great northern sea and the natives there all swear by them for what rathar asked fumigation no no no health vatran said none of these natives ever dies before hes a hundred and fifty years old if you believe varvakis and even if you cut what he says in half that doesnt sound too bad to me he coughed again so did rathar nasty stench he said if you have to breathe this cursed smoke all the time i think id sooner die itll probably rot your lungs and if these natives are so bloody wonderful why do they belong to some derlavaian kingdom nowadays all those islands do you know you havent got the right attitude vatran said reproachfully i dont care rathar answered ill tell you this though tsavellas and mantzaros would agree with you ill bet they would vatran said you got what you wanted from them i expect of course i did rathar told him it was that or pull this kingdom down around their ears well throw yaninans over the skamandros till they bridge it with their bodies if we have to then well clean out the stinking redheads ourselves he paused they dont stink any worse than those leaves sorry sir vatran didnt sound sorry he was grinning so was rathar why not when they were pushing the algarvians back rain blew out of the west into colonel spinellos face it could be worse the algarvian officer thought as he peered from his riverfront hole in the ground in eoforwic across the twegen toward the unkerlanter positions on the west bank when he said that aloud one of the men in his brigade gave him an odd look how could it be worse sir the trooper asked real curiosity in his voice for one thing it could be snowing spinello had no trouble coming up with reasons hed seen the worst the unkerlanters and the weather could do down in the south it would be snowing it probably is right this minute and swemmels whoresons could have us surrounded the way they did down in sulingen they could have snipers as close to us as you are to me one of those bastards blazed me down there straight through the chest im lucky im here so you see things arent so bad he was a prancing handsome little gamecock of a man one who stayed dapper even when things were at their worst as always he spoke with great conviction he believed what he was saying when he said it and usually made others believe it too that was one of the reasons he had such good luck with women that and technique he thought smugly every once in a while of course even conviction didnt pay off the trooper said oh aye some luck sir you were so lucky they got you repaired and sent you up here to give the unkerlanters another chance at doing you in you can call that luck if you want but its the kind of luck you can keep if you ask me well who did ask you spinello said but that was a gibe not a reprimand freeborn algarvians even common soldiers would speak their minds that was part of what made them better soldiers than unkerlanters who were liable to end up sacrificed if they talked out of turn and if were such splendid soldiers what are we doing fighting way back here in the middle of forthweg he asked himself he knew the answer perfectly well enough indifferent soldiers could overwhelm a smaller number of good ones they could aye but when king mezentio ordered the algarvian army into unkerlant who had imagined that they might mezentio hadnt spinello was sure of that shouldnt he have spinello wondered he just assumed unkerlant would fall to pieces the way all our other enemies did when we hit them he peered across the river again he couldnt see any unkerlanter soldiers stirring about but he knew they were there it didnt work out quite the way mezentio and the generals thought it would too bad a few eggs burst on this side of the twegen but not close enough to make him do anything but note them it was on the whole a quiet day before long he feared swemmels men would burst out of their bridgeheads north and south of eoforwic they would probably try to cut off and surround the city as they had with sulingen he wondered if the battered algarvian forces in the neighborhood could stop them he had his doubts though he would have gone on the rack before admitting as much and if the unkerlanters do cut us off well then things will be pretty bad motion he caught out of the corner of his eye made him whirl stick swinging up ready to blaze but it was only a couple of hildes helpers the forthwegian women who worked hard to keep the algarvians in eoforwic fed some of themnot allkept the algarvians happy other ways too but a man had to listen if one of them said no offending them might mean going hungry and that would have been very bad they wore hooded cloaks over their long baggy tunics one of them came up to spinello and the trooper in the hole with him she took a loaf from under the cloak and gave it to spinello bread with olive she said in bad algarvian i myself to bake thank you sweetheart spinello bowed as if she were a duchess he tried talking with her for a little while but she didnt speak enough of his language to follow much and he had next to no forthwegian we could probably get along in classical kaunian he thought he was fluent in the language of scholarship and sorcery and in forthweg as nowhere else it remained a living language too many forthwegians had learned it to deal with their kaunian neighbors but spinello didnt try it most kaunians who had lived in forthweg were dead by now slain to fuel algarves sorcerous onslaught against unkerlant and most forthwegians werent particularly sorry about that had they been the algarvians would have had a much harder time doing what theyd done so no classical kaunian didnt seem like a good idea he tore the loaf in half and gave one piece to the soldier in the hole with him they both ate greedily powers above thats good spinello exclaimed the trooper nodded his cheeks as full of bread as a dormouses could get full of seeds the clouds were thick enough that nightfall took spinello by surprise he hadnt expected it to get dark for some little while yet and hadnt seen anything in the least resembling a sunset have to keep our eyes open he called to his men swemmels buggers are liable to try to sneak raiders across the river theyd done that a couple of times lately and created more chaos than the small number of soldiers whod paddled across the twegen should have been able to spawn but a couple of hours later two algarvians came up to the river not far from where spinello still kept his station when he climbed out of his hole to find out what they were doing one of them shook his head you havent seen us the fellow said weve never been here talk sense spinello snapped i command this brigade if i say the word you bloody well wont have been here muttering the man whod spoken stepped closer to him close enough to let him see the mages badge on the fellows tunic if you command this brigade get us a little rowboat i have work to do he said and if you try interfering with me youll end up envying what happens to the cursed blonds i promise you spinello almost told him to go futter himself outside the army he would have hed come close to a couple of duels in his time but discipline and curiosity both restrained him what are you going to do he asked my job the mage answered which stirred spinellos temper all over again now get me that boat aye your highness spinello said the wizard only laughed spinello called orders to his men they came up with a rowboat it was undoubtedly stolen from a forthwegian spinello cared nothing about that he bowed to the mage and to the fellow with him whod said not a word welcome to the royal algarvian navy he got not even a smile let alone a laugh and set them down for a couple of wet blankets the mage began to incant some of his charms were in oldfashioned algarvian others in classical kaunian still others in what sounded like unkerlanter spinello could follow the first two not the third the mage finished cocked his head to one side and nodded the confusion spell should hold for a whilethey arent expecting it he said now lets tend to you his comrade only nodded he got to work again this time with a simple charm in classical kaunian before spinellos eyes the silent algarvians appearance changedhe took on the seeming of an unkerlanter he then stripped off his own uniform and took from his pack that of an unkerlanter major he got into the rowboat and started rowing west across the twegen good luck spinello called after him bite somebody hard why send a man in sorcerous disguise into unkerlanterheld territory if not to bite somebody hard from the boat the fellow gave back the only three words spinello ever heard from him i intend to then he vanished from sight sooner than spinello expected the confusion spell he thought he looked around for the mage to show off his own cleverness but the fellow had already disappeared spinello wondered if the disguised algarvian would return to his stretch of the riverfront but he never saw the man again the next day the unkerlanters stirred and milled around in a way that made him hope the fellow had accomplished something worth doing but no one to whom he talked seemed to know more of hildes helpers came by to give the algarvians dishes theyd cooked a rather pretty girlpity shes got that blocky forthwegian build spinello thoughtwith a blueandwhite armband gave him a bowl with a spoon stuck in it he sniffed and nodded smells good darling whats in it barley olives cheese little sausage she answered in halting algarvian her voice was sweet and might have been familiar laughing spinello wagged a finger at her ill bet you put some mushrooms in too just to drive me mad he had to repeat himself before she understood when she did she jerked in surprise then managed a nod of her own a halting one aye for to taste to flavor chop very fine she mimed cutting them not to notice only for to taste for to taste good spinello considered after some of the things hed had to eat in unkerlant what were a few mushrooms he grinned at the girl kiss me and ill eat em she jerked again harder than she had before he wondered if some other algarvian had given her a hard time who could guess when youve got to be careful with hildes helpers he reminded himself treat em like noblewomen even if they are just shopgirls this one though hesitated only a moment she nodded and leaned toward him he did a good thorough job of kissing her now she said you to eat eat he did it is good he said in some small surprise after the first mouthful and wolfed down the rest of the bowl the forthwegian girl was right except for the flavor they added he hardly knew the mushrooms were there hed dreaded biting into some big fleshy chunk but that didnt happen at all when hed eaten every bit of the stew he got to his feet bowed and made a production of returning bowl and spoon another kiss he asked she shook her head go to make more for others she hurried off a crystallomancer shouted hey colonel ive just picked up some emanations from the fornicating unkerlanters sounds like somebody just bumped off general gurmun i bet that was our pal last night i bet youre right spinello breathed and i bet theyd trade a couple of brigades of ordinary men for that gurmun whoreson too he was far and away the best they had with behemoths the confusion on the other side of the twegen continued the whole day long the unkerlanters hardly bothered harassing eoforwic spinello didnt take that for granted his guess was they would start pummeling the city hard when they began to recover but he enjoyed the respite while he had it his own respite didnt last so long as eoforwics he woke in the middle of the night with belly pains and an urgent need to squat a pox he grumbled ive come down with a flux but squatting didnt help and the pain only got worse when morning came his men exclaimed in horror powers above colonel get to a healer one of them said youre yellow as a lemon yellow spinello stared down at himself whats wrong with me he scratched his head he didnt argue about going to a healer he felt as bad as he looked maybe worse i wonder if it was those mushrooms plenty of reasons we dont eat them i bet he got a powerful emetic from the healers that just gave him one more misery and did nothing to make him feel better nothing the healers did could make him feel better or even ease his torment it ended for good three days later with him still wondering about those mushrooms vanai splashed hot water very hot water water as hot as she could stand it onto her face again and again especially around her mouth then she rubbed and rubbed and rubbed at her lips with the roughest scratchiest towel she had finally when shed rubbed her mouth bloody she gave up she could still feel spinellos lips on hers even after all that but then she snatched saxburh out of her cradle and danced around the flat with the baby in her arms saxburh liked that she squealed with glee it was worth it by the powers above it was worth it her little daughter wouldnt have argued for the world she was having the time of her life she squealed again do you know what i did vanai said do you have any idea what i did saxburh had no idea she chortled anyhow still dancing ignoring the sandpapered state of her lips vanai went on i put four death caps in his stew not one not two not three four four death caps could kill a troop of behemoths let alone one fornicating algarvian she kept right on dancing saxburh kept right on laughing fornicating algarvian is right vanai thought savagely her mouth was sore but she didnt care idve put my lips on his prong to get him to take that bowl of stew powers below eat him why not its not as if he didnt make me do it before teach me tricks will you see how you ii like the one i just taught you spinello without a doubt felt fine right now that was one of the things that made death caps and their close cousins the destroying powers so deadly people who ate them didnt feel anything wrong for several hours sometimes even for a couple of days by then it was far too late for them to puke up what theyd eaten the poison stayed inside them working and no healer or mage had ever found a cure for it soon enough spinello would know what shed done isnt that fine vanai asked saxburh isnt that just the most splendid thing you ever heard in all your days the baby didnt have many days but by the way she gurgled and wriggled with glee it might have been all forthwegians hunted mushrooms whenever they got the chance in that if in few other things the kaunians in forthweg agreed with their neighbors no onenot even algarvian soldiers not any morepaid much attention to people walking with their heads down eyes on the ground and who was likely to notice what sort of mushrooms went into a basket one thing vanais grandfather had taught her was how to tell the poisonous from the safe everyone in forthweg learned those lessons this once vanai had chosen to stand them on their head and so you too have some measure of revenge my grandfather she whispered in classical kaunian brivibas would never have approved of her saying any such thing to him in mere forthwegian saxburhs eyesthey would be dark like ealstans for they were already darkening from the blue of almost all newborns eyeswidened she could hear that the sounds of this language were different from those of the forthwegian vanai and ealstan usually spoke i will teach you this tongue too vanai told her daughter still in classical kaunian i do not know if you will thank me for it this is a tongue whose speakers have more than their share of trouble more than their share of woe but it is as much yours as forthwegian and you should learn it what do you think of that dada saxburh said vanai laughed no you silly thing im your mama she said falling back into forthwegian without noticing shed done it till after the words passed her lips saxburh babbled more cheerful nonsense none of which sounded like either forthwegian or classical kaunian then she screwed up her face and grunted knowing what that meant even before she caught the smell vanai squatted down laid saxburh on the floor and cleaned her bottom saxburh even thought that was funny where she often fussed over it vanai laughed too but she had to work to keep the corners of her mouth turned up she wouldnt have used forthwegian so much before she started disguising herself it really was as if thelberge the forthwegian semblance she had to wear were gaining at the expense of vanai the kaunian reality within even if the algarvians lose the war even if the unkerlanters drive them out of forthweg what will it be like for the blonds left alive here will theywill wego on wearing sorcerous disguises and speaking forthwegian because its easier because the forthwegiansthe real forthwegianswont hate us so much then if we do what happens to the kaunianity the sense of ourselves as something special and apart that weve kept alive ever since the empire fell she cursed softly she had no answer for that she wondered if anyone else did if anyone else could if not even if the algarvians lost the derlavaian war wouldnt they have won a great battle in their endless struggle against the kaunians whod been civilized while they still painted themselves strange colors and ran naked through their native forests throwing spears the familiar coded knock ealstan used interrupted her gloomy reverie she snatched up saxburh and hurried to unbar the door ealstan gave her a kiss then he wrinkled his nose i know what youve been doing he said he kissed saxburh and i know what youve been doing too he took her from vanai and rocked her in his arms aye i do you cant fool me i know just what youve been doing she cant help it vanai said and its something everybody else does too i should hope so ealstan answered otherwise wed all burst like eggs and who would clean up after us then vanai hadnt thought of it like that when she did she giggled ealstan went on and what did you do with your morning before vanai realized she would she answered while saxburh was taking a nap i put on a blueandwhite armband and went out and pretended i was one of hildes helpers powers above youre joking ealstan exclaimed dont say things like that or youll make me drop the baby he mimed doing just that which made vanai start and made saxburh laugh vanai said i really did and do you want to know why ealstan studied her to make sure she wasnt kidding him what he saw on her face must have satisfied him for he replied id love to know why the only reason that occurs to me right now is that youve gone crazy and i dont think thats right no vanai said that in forthwegian but then switched to classical kaunian i wore the armband because i wanted to give a certain officer of the redheaded barbarians a special dishand i did it a special dish ealstan echoed in his own slow thoughtful classical kaunian what kind of oh he didnt need long to figure out what she meant his eyes glowed how special was it four death caps she answered proudly four he blinked that would kill anybody ten times over aye i know vanai wished she could have killed spinello ten times over i hope he enjoyed them too people who eat them say theyre supposed to be tasty ive heard the same thing ealstan answered falling back into forthwegian not something i ever wanted to find out for myself he carefully set saxburh in her little seat then came back and took vanai in his arms you told me not to take chances and then you went and did this i ought to beat you the way forthwegian husbands are supposed to it wasnt so risky for me as it would have been for you she answered i just gave him the food took back the bowl and went on my way he still feels fineim sure of itbut pretty soon he wont what was i to him just another forthwegian just another wench she thought remembering the feel of his lips on hers but the last wench the very last its a good thing you did get the bowland the spoon too i hope ealstan said vanai nodded he went on if you hadnt the algarvian mages could have used the law of contagion to trace them back to you i know i thought of that its the reason i waited for them vanai didnt tell ealstan about the couple of quizzical looks spinello had sent her while he ate her tasty dish of death had he half recognized or wondered if he recognized her voice back in oyngestun theyd always spoken classical kaunian here of course vanai had used what scraps of algarvian she had that and the difference in her looks had kept spinello from figuring out who she was well the son of a whore is gone now even if he hasnt figured it out yet four death caps ealstan whistled you could have killed off half the redheads in eoforwic with four death caps pity you couldnt have found some way to do it it is isnt it vanai said but i got rid of the one i most wanted dead that was as much as shed ever said since ealstan found out about spinello ealstan nodded now i believe that he said and let it go hed never pushed her for details for which she was grateful saxburh started to cry ealstan joggled her but this time it didnt restore her smile give her to me i think shes getting fussy vanai said shes been up for a while now and ive been dancing with her dancing because of what i just did to spinello and i still feel like dancing by the powers above she sat down on the couch and undid the toggles that held her tunic closed ealstan reached out and gently cupped her left breast as she bared it i know its not for me right now he said but maybe later maybe she said by her tone it probably meant aye as saxburh settled in and began to nurse vanai wondered why that should be so wouldnt seeing spinello have soured her on men and anything to do with men till she first gave herself to ealstan shed thought the algarvian had soured her on lovemaking forever now now i just fed him four death caps and i want to celebrate come on sweetheart she crooned to saxburh youre getting sleepy arent you ealstan whod gone into the kitchen heard that and laughed he came back with a couple of mugs of something that wasnt water he gave vanai one here shall we drink to to freedom to freedom vanai echoed and raised the cup to her lips plum brandy slid hot down her throat she glanced toward saxburh sometimes the baby was interested in what her mother ate and drank not now though saxburhs eyes started to slide shut vanais nipple slid out of the babys mouth hoisting her daughter to her shoulder vanai got a sleepy burp from her then rocked her till she fell asleep saxburh didnt wake up when she set her in the cradle either her tunic still hanging open vanai turned back to ealstan what were you saying about later he raised an eyebrow she wasnt usually so bold i dont kill a man i hated every day either she thought back in the bedchamber she straddled ealstan and rode herselfand him with herto joy with short hard quick strokes then sprawled down on his chest to kiss him i wish i did if only it would make me feel like this every time even the afterglow seemed hotter than usual laughing she kissed him again winter roared into the naantali district of kuusamo as if it were part of the land of the ice people the blizzard outside the hostel howled and shrieked blowing snow parallel to the ground pekkas home town of kajaani didnt usually get quite such wretched weather even though it lay farther south it also lay by the sea which helped moderate its climate pekka had hoped to be able to experiment in the scant hours of daylight that came here but scrubbed the idea when she saw what the weather was like no matter how much kuusamans took cold nasty weather in stride everything had its limits and its not as if ive got nothing else to do she thought brushing a lock of coarse black hair back from her eyes as she waded through paperwork the greatest drawback shed found to running a large project was that it transformed her from a theoretical sorcerer which was all shed ever wanted to be to a bureaucrat a fate not quite worse than death but not enjoyable either someone knocked on the door to her chamber she sprang to her feet a smile suddenly illuminating her broad highcheekboned face any excuse for getting away from that pile of papers was a good one and it might be fernao that idea sang in her she hadnt expected to fall in love with the lagoan mage especially when she hadnt fallen out of love with her own husband but leino was far awayin jelgava now battling against the algarvians bloodthirsty magicand had been for a long time while fernao was here and working side by side with her and had saved her life more than once and shed stopped worrying about reasons she just knew what was knew it and delighted in it but when pekka opened the door no tall redhaired lagoan with narrow eyes bespeaking a touch of kuusaman blood stood there oh she said master ilmarinen good morning ilmarinen laughed in her face your lovers off somewhere else he said so youre stuck with me with master siuntio dead ilmarinen was without a doubt the greatest theoretical sorcerer in kuusamo probably in the world that didnt keep him from also being a firstclass nuisance he leered and laughed again at pekkas expression the few wispy white hairs that sprouted from his chinkuusaman men were only lightly beardedwagged up and down getting angry at him did no good pekka had long since learned that treating him as she did uto her little boy worked better what can i do for you she asked as sweetly as she could ilmarinen leaned forward to kiss her on the cheek that was going too far even for him then he said ive come to say goodbye goodbye pekka echoed as if shed never heard the word before goodbye ilmarinen repeated to you to this hostel to the naantali district it took some wanglingi had to talk to more than one of the seven princes of kuusamobut i did it and im free or im going to be free anyhow as soon as this ghastly weather lets me escape youre leavingpekka said ilmarinen nodded she wondered if her senses were failing her or if more likely he was playing one of his horrid practical jokes you cant do that she blurted youd better revise your hypothesis ilmarinen said im going to falsify it with contradictory data when you see that im gone you will also see that you were mistaken it happens to us all now and again he means it she realized but why she asked is it anything ive done if it is is there anything i can do to change your mind and make you stay no and no the master mage answered i can tell you exactly whats wrong here at least the way i look at things were not doing anything new and different any more were just refining what weve already got any secondrank mage who can get to ten twice running when he counts on his fingers can do that work me id sooner look for something a little more interesting thank you kindly what is there pekka asked im going to the war ilmarinen answered im going to jelgava if you want me to be properly precise and im sure you doyoure like that if those fornicating algarvian mages start killing kaunians and aiming all that sorcerous energy at me i aim to boot em into the middle of next week time to really use all this sorcery weve dreamed up time to see what it can do and what more we need to do to fancy it up even more but pekka floundered how will we go on without you youll do pretty well i expect the master mage said and ill have a chance to play with my own ideas maybe i really will figure out a way to knock the algarvians into the middle of next week i still say the potential for that lies at the heart of the experimental work weve done and i still say youre out of your mind pekka answered automatically of course you do ilmarinen said youre the one who opened this hole in the ice and now you dont want to fish in it for fear a leviathan will take hold of your line and pull you under those are the kinds of forces youre talking about pekka said even if you were rightand youre not curse it you almost killed yourself and took half of kuusamo with you because youd miscalculated if you recalleven if you were right i tell you youd never be able to come up with a usable sorcery paradoxes would prevent it whenever a mage says a spell is possible hes likely right ilmarinen replied whenever he says a spell is impossible hes likely wrong thats an old rule i just made up but it covers the history of pure and applied sorcery over the past hundred and fifty years pretty well i think he had a point though pekka didnt intend to admit it she said i think youre being very foolish you were talking about secondrank mages master what will you be able to do in jelgava that any secondrank mage cant i dont know he answered cheerfully thats why im going there to find out i know everything i can do here andhe yawned with almost as much theatrical flair as an algarvian might haveim bored that shouldnt be reason enough to abandon something of which youre such an important part pekka insisted maybe it shouldnt but for me it is ilmarinens foxy features donned that leer once more if i happen to run into your husband while im in jelgava what shall i tell him not a thing not a fornicating thing pekka wanted to shout just before she did she realized that was the worst thing she could possibly say with studied indifference she answered tell him whatever you please you will anyway that took the leer off his face it got her what might have been a respectful glance youre cooler about the whole business than i thought ilmarinen said pekka just then felt anything but cool letting him know that though didnt strike her as a good idea she said if youre bound and determined to do this powers above keep you safe for which i thank you ilmarinen said i will miss you curse me if i wont your hearts in the right place i think even if i cant imagine what you see in that overgrown lagoan mage hes not overgrown indignation crackled in pekkas voice and youre a fine one to talk what do you see in linna the serving girl a pretty face and a tight twat he answered at once im a man men arent supposed to need any more than that are they but women now women should have better sense dont you think actually pekka did think that or something like that anyway but ilmarinen was the last person with whom she wanted to talk about it instead of talking she hugged him hard enough to make him wheeze as the air came out of him then for good measure she kissed him too i still think youre being a fool but youre a fool im fond of youre stuck with me a while longer he said till this accursed weather eases up but then im flyingor more likely sailingnorth for the winter off he went down the hallway pekka wondered why shed even tried to change his mind he was no more inclined to listen to her than she was to pay attention to the advice she got from a clerk at a grocers shop he did what he wanted and reveled in it if he wants to tell leino ill kill him she thought but that worried her less than it had when he first asked his sardonic question had ilmarinen really intended to blab to her husband if he saw him he wouldnt have teased her about it first she was surewell she was pretty sureof that still shaking her head in astonishment she went back to the paperwork a few minutes later another knock on the door interrupted her this time it was fernao tall and redheaded and but for his eyes most unkuusaman looking even the neat ponytail in which he wore his hair shouted that he was a lagoan but over the past couple of years hed got pretty fluent in kuusaman youll never guess what he said now he even had something of a kajaani accent which only showed hed done a lot of talking and listening to pekka about ilmarinen disappearing she said and watched his jaw drop he came to me first she told him how did you find out about it hes in the refectory pouring down ale and boasting about the wires he pulled to get away fernao answered that sounds like him pekka said sourly hes really off to jelgava fernao asked thats what he says pekka replied he has connections with the seven princes that go back longer than either one of us has been alive so i suppose he is i havent seen the paperwork but he wouldnt carry on like that without it no he wouldnt fernao didnt sound particularly happy after a moment he showed pekka why if he goes to jelgava if he sees your husband there will he talk you kuusamans are such a straitlaced folk i fear he might were no such thing pekka exclaimed then a little sheepishly she asked is that how lagoans see us a lot of the time aye he said you often take such things too seriously do we pekka suddenly remembered fleeing his bedchamber in tears after the first time theyd made love well maybe we do but i dont think ilmarinen will talk too much to leino hes not an ordinary kuusaman you know really fernaos voice was dry i never would have noticed what did you do tell him youd put a lifetime itching spell on his drawers if he ever opened his mouth pekka giggled its a pretty good idea but no if id threatened him he would blab to leino if he ever saw him he may not see him of course he probably wont in factjelgava is a goodsized kingdom but when he teased me about it i told him to do whatever he wanted so he wont feel he has to run off at the mouth good thinking fernao quirked up an eyebrow and what do you want to do its more fun than paperwork pekka said realizing a heartbeat too late how imperfect that was as praise she did her best to show himand herself exactly how much more fun than paperwork it really was a new broadsheet went up all over the jelgavan town of skrunda talsu read a copy pasted to the front wall of the crowded block of flats where he and his family had moved exchange of currency the headline read below it in almost equally large characters it declared all coins bearing the impress of the false king usurper and vicious tyrant mainardo the cursed algarvian must be exchanged for those minted under the auspices of his glorious jelgavan majesty donalitu iii bythe date named was less than two weeks away the broadsheet continued any attempt to pass the monies of the false king and vicious tyrant after the date aforesaid shall be punished with the greatest possible severity by order of his glorious jelgavan majesty long may he reign talsu his wife gailisa his younger sister and his mother and father shared one room none too large and a tiny cramped kitchen bathroom and toilet were at the end of the hall that was talsu supposed better than sharing a tent as theyd done after a lagoan or kuusaman dragon raid burned down trakus tailors shop and the rooms above it where the family had lived still it did produce its share of friction when talsu climbed the stairs to the flat he found his father doing some hand stitching on a pair of trousers before using a spell to extend the stitchery down along the entire length of the hem traku set the work down when talsu came in hello son he said in his gravelly voice he lookedand soundedmore like a bruiser than a tailor whats new in the outside world i dont get to see it much a new broadsheet went up talsu answered and explained what was on it from the kitchen his mother called thats good thats very good by the powers above if i never see mainardos cursed pointy nose on another piece of silver ill stand up and cheer the faster we forget the redheads ever conquered us the happier ill be i dont know laitsina traku said did you hear what talsu said theyll do to you if you make a mistake well have to sift through all our silver i dont want to spend a stretch in the dungeons just because i was careless king donalitu is still king donalitu talsu said and he didnt mean it as praise if the redheads had picked one of our nobles instead of mezentios brother they would have had an easier time getting people to put up with them they didnt care a fart whether we put up with em or not traku said they thought they had the world by the short hairs and that what we thought didnt matter what were we just a pack of kaunians thats why the arch on the far side of the square isnt standing any more even though it had been there since the days of the kaunian empire thats right talsu said i was taking some clothes across town when the redheads wrecked the old arch they said it insulted them because it talked about how the kaunians of long ago beat the oldtime algarvians they did things like that all over jelgavaall over valmiera too traku lowered his voice and they did a lot worse to the kaunians of forthweg by what everybody says talsus sister ausra came out of the kitchen wearing an apron over her tunic and trousers and said what do you want to bet they find some way to cheat us when we turn in the money the algarvians issued i wouldnt be surprised talsu said neither would i traku agreed im glad we dont have king mainardo and the redheads running things any more but id be almost gladder if we didnt have donalitu back that was treason if anybody besides his family heard it traku might end up in a dungeon regardless of whether he exchanged mainardos coins for donalitus back before the algarvians ran donalitu out of jelgava his dungeons had had an evil reputation all over derlavai he wasnt a madman or the next thing to it as swemmel of unkerlant was said to be but no one loved him wistfully talsu said the kuusamans have seven princes maybe they could spare one for us the kuusaman soldiers i dealt with when i was with the irregulars were all good people they didnt act like they were afraid of their officers either neither did the redheads come to that ausra said no they didnt talsu admitted unhappily but they had other things wrong with themstarting with thinking everybody who had yellow hair was fair game donalitus bad they were worse neither his sister nor his father argued with him traku said they arent gone yet either the whoresons theyre still hanging on in the western part of the kingdom the sooner were rid of them forever the better but if they leave they know the lagoans and kuusamans will follow them right into algarve talsu said traku grunted good i wish wed gone deeper into algarve back before we got beat then maybe all this never would have happened to us for a long time talsus father had blamed him almost personally for jelgavas lost war against algarve traku had been too young to fight in the six years war and didnt know what the armyespecially the jelgavan armywas like talsu said if our officers had been any good we would have gone deeper but if our officers were any good a lot of things about this kingdom would be different that was about as much as he cared to say about that even in the bosom of his family ausra said theyre putting together a new army for the kingdom now that we have our own king back again that was the last set of broadsheets before this one about exchanging mainardos money i saw it talsu said it wont be a new armyyou wait and see itll be the same old army with the same old noble officers who dont know their he broke off before using a phrase from that same old army in front of his sister in spite of having to stop hed got out what had been wrong with the jelgavan army in which hed served as in most armies nobles held almost all officers slots and jelgavan nobles from king donalitu on down were some of the most hidebound stubborn backwardslooking men the world had ever seen gailisa came into the flat then talsu was glad to break off and give her a hug and a kiss she returned them a little absently she hadnt been quite the same since her father got killed when kuusaman and lagoan dragons dropped eggs on skrunda about a week before the algarvians had to clear out of the town for good talsu had shown kuusaman footsoldiers and behemoths an undefended way through the redheads lines he wished hed done it sooner maybe the islanders dragons wouldnt have flown that night his late fatherinlaw had been a grocer gailisa had helped him these days she was working for another grocer one named pumpru whose shop had survived she said do you know about the new moneychanging decree we were just talking about it a few minutes ago talsu answered i saw the broadsheets on my way home from delivering a cloak its a cheat gailisa said what have they turned out light coins that are supposed to be worth the same as the older heavier ones talsu asked thats what mainardo did donalitus not too proud to steal tricks from an algarvian eh close but not quite gailisa said pumpru took some of mainardos money in to be changed as soon as he saw one of the broadsheets if king donalitu told everybody to jump off a roof hed do that just as fasthes one of those people but he wasnt happy when he came back to the store he wasnt happy at all whats wrong with the new money traku asked it is new money gailisa nodded if theyd given old silver weight for weight that would have been fair but all the coins pumpru got are shiny new and theyre too hard and they dont sound right when you ring them on a counter you dont have to be a jeweler to figure out theres not as much silver in them as theres supposed to be and donalitu puts the difference in his pocket talsu said gailisa nodded again talsu made as if to pound his head against the wall of the flat what a cheap trick he didnt waste much time reminding people what he is did he hes the king thats what he is traku said but he didnt blindly follow king donalitu the way pumpru the grocer did for he went on and if you get on his wrong side youll find yourself in a nice cozy dungeon cell too so watch what you say i will father talsu promised ive already spent more time in a dungeon cell than i ever want to but that was for making the algarvians angry not the proper king ausra said same dungeon talsu replied dryly and it wasnt the redheads running it eitherit was jelgavans just like you and me theyd worked for donalitu before mainardo came in one of them said hed go back to working for donalitu if mainardo ever got thrown out he meant it thats terrible his sister exclaimed son of a whore ought to be dragged out of his fornicating dungeon and blazed his father growled of course he should talsu said but what do you want to bet he was right what do you want to bet hes still just where he always was except now hes making things hot for people who got in bed with the algarvians instead of for people who wanted us to get our own rightful king back slowly one at a time gailisa traku and ausra nodded talsus wife said ausras right that is terrible it isnt the way the worlds supposed to work do you know what the worst part of all is though talsu said this time his family shook their heads he went on the worst part of all this is none of you argued with me no matter how terrible it is you think its pretty likely too the same as i do it shouldnt be this way gailisa insisted but then her courage wilted it always seems to be thoughhere in jelgava anyhow the people who have a lot keep grabbing more and more thats the story of this kingdom sure enough traku said always has been just like you said gailisa powers below eat me if i think itll ever change and its likely the same way everywhere when mezentios buggers were holding us down they werent shy about grabbing everything they could get their hands on from what i saw of the kuusamans theyre different talsu said their officers and men seemed to be friends and the ones with the higher ranks didnt ride roughshod over the ordinary soldiers come to think of it i even had one regimental commander like that back when we were still in the war what happened to him gailisa asked colonel adomu talsu said about what youd expecthe actually went out to do some real fighting so he got killed pretty quick i never knew another officer like him not in our army anyhow the algarvians had had a fair number of that stripe too but he didnt care to say so out loud he didnt want to praise the redheads not after everything theyd done suppers ready his mother called and that gave him something happier to think about three bauska marchioness krasta shouted from her bedchamber powers below eat you bauska where have you gone and hidden coming milady the maidservant said hurrying inand panting a little to show how much she was hurrying she dropped krasta a curtsy what can i do for you milady at least you sound properly respectful krasta said some of the servants these days she made a horrible face the servants didnt come close to giving her the respect she deserved they all took their lead from her brother and that hateful cow of a farm girl hed brought home with him there were times when krasta almost wished the algarvians had managed to hunt skarnu down then he wouldnt have had the chance to rub his virtue in her face bauskas answering smile was bleak well milady were in the same boat you and i arent we i should say not krasta answered indignantly your snotnosed little brat has an algarvian papa sure as sure one look at her would tell that to anybody viscount valnu is father to my child she firmly believed it these days of course milady bauska said the words were right the tone called krasta a liaroh not quite blatantly enough to let her bound up and slap bauskas face but it did it did the maidservant went on and even if thats so she broke off not quite in the nick of time even if thats so she didnt say everybody knows you opened your legs for colonel lurcanio for years and years krasta tossed her head so what she said as if bauska had made the accusation out loud but the rest of her impassioned defense was silent too what if i did the algarvians looked like winning the war everybody thought so i was better off with a redhead in my bed than i would have been without i wasnt the only one i wasnt even close to the only one it seemed like a good idea at the time it had been a good idea at the time krasta remained convinced of that once she got an ideawhich didnt happen all that oftenshe clung to it through thick and thin but shed never expected times to change so drastically taking an algarvian lover didnt look like a good idea any more what it looked like these days in a valmiera no longer occupied was something very much like treason with her own sandyheaded little bastard bauska couldnt very well say that she had to count herself lucky that she hadnt had her head shaved and her scalp daubed with red paint as had happened to so many valmieran women whod given themselves to mezentios soldiers with a sigh the maidservant repeated what can i do for you milady my trousers dont fit me anymore krasta said peevishly hardly any of them even come close to fitting any more look at me im still in these summery silk pyjamas with the elastic waist and im about to freeze my tits off maybe i ought to get a great big long loose tunic to cover all of me the kind unkerlanter women wear she shuddered at the mere idea but bauskas voice was serious as she answered maybe you should milady the unkerlanters have done so much to fight the algarvians everything about them is stylish these days one of their tunics might be just the thing for a woman with child to wear do you think so krasta asked intrigued she considered then shook her head no i dont want to i dont care whether their clothes are stylish or not theyre too ugly to stand i want trousers but i want some that fit me properly aye milady bauska sighed but that sigh wasnt aimed at krasta for she went on more to herself than to the marchioness maybe youre right when i think about captain mosco i dont suppose i want to see unkerlanterstyle clothes catch on here in valmiera mosco had been colonel lurcanios aideand was father to bauskas bastard daughter hed never seen his child by her though before brindza was born hed gone off to fight in unkerlant he was one of the first algarvians pulled west by the ever more desperate battle against king swemmels men but far from the last hed never sent so much as a line back once ordered away from priekule maybe that meant hed been a heartbreaker from the start maybe on the other hand it meant hed died almost as soon as he made the acquaintance of warfare so much more savage than any that had washed over valmiera with a sniff krasta said remember you silly goose he had a wife somewhere back in algarve i know bauska sighed again what that meant was she didnt care had mosco walked into the mansion right thenassuming he could have come anywhere close to it without getting blazed by vengeful valmieransshe would have greeted him with open arms and no doubt open legs fool krasta thought little fool lurcanio had a wife somewhere back in algarve too hed never denied it or worried about it krasta hadnt cared men in her considerable experience got what they could where they could shed never imagined herself in love with lurcanio as bauska had with mosco hed given her skill in bed and protection from other redheads and she hadnt really looked for anything more now that lurcanio was gone from her bed gone from priekule goneshe thoughtfrom valmiera though he could have been one of the algarvians hanging on in the rugged country of the northwest there were times when krasta missed him now that he was gone she remembered with a warm glow what hed been able to do for her and she conveniently forgot how hed frightened and intimidated her he being the only man whod ever managed to do that forgetting came all the easier but she couldnt forget how even these pyjama bottoms were starting to grow cruelly tight where in blazes do i go to find clothes i can wear she demanded as far as i know there was only one shop on the whole boulevard of horsemen that catered to pregnant women and its been closed up with night and fog scrawled across the window for two years now the boulevard of horsemen was far and away the toniest street of shops in priekule that meant it was the only one krasta cared about going anywhere else would have been stepping down in class and she would sooner have been buried alive but if the boulevard didnt have what she needed she could look elsewhere without social penalty bauska said i found the clothes i needed on threadneedle street milady plenty of such shops there some cheap some not so threadneedle street krasta echoed she remembered bauskas clothes as being ugly she could do better though she was sure of it she had more taste and more money how could she go wrong musingly she said ive never been down to threadneedle street never milady bauska looked astonished but everybody buys clothes there i dont do what everybody else does krasta said in lofty tones and if i hadnt taken an algarvian lover when so many other women did but it was much too late to worry about that after some rummaging bauska found her a pair of trousers she could at least wear her tunics were getting tight too both at what was left of her waist and at the chest she reckoned only part of that a drawback the rest was an asset especially when dealing with men her driver gave her a bleary look when she told him she wanted to go out he was drinking much too much these days krasta couldnt even yell at him the way she wanted to who could guess what would happen if she antagonized the servants they were liable to go to her brother and she had enough trouble with skarnu as things were the day was clear and cold and crisp as the carriage rattled into the heart of priekule people on the streets looked shabby but they looked happy lively in a way they hadnt when the algarvians held the city krasta still wasnt used to not seeing redheads strolling along and taking in the sights when algarvian soldiers in unkerlant got leave they often came east to rest and relax in the capital of a kingdom that had at least for a while truly yielded to them no valmieran wore kilts these days either theyd grown moderately popular among those who wanted to curry favor with the occupiers or just wanted to show off shapely legs no more though now if the algarvianstyle garments werent thrown out they lay at the bottom of clothes chests and in the back of closets for a valmieran to put on a kilt today might well be to risk a life threadneedle street milady krastas driver said glumly best you get out now so i can find a place to put the carriage oh very well krasta said the street was crowded not only with carriages but also with goods wagons and with a swarm of foot traffic tradesmen and shopgirls and riffraff like that krasta thought scornfully if these are the people bauska thinks of as everybody powers above be praised that i have some idea of what true quality is worth but her maidservant had been right plenty of the cramped little shops along threadneedle street sported names like for a mother and clothes for you both and evendismayingly as far as krasta was concernedmaybe its twins she rolled her eyes she didnt particularly want one baby if she were to have two she wondered if valnu could have sired one and lurcanio the other wouldnt that be a scandal she had no idea if it were possible and even less idea of whom to ask not asking anyone struck her as a pretty good plan shopping here she rapidly discovered was different from shopping on the boulevard of horsemen no fawning shopgirls guided her from one elegant creation to the next instead clothes were crammed onto racks in shops with sale painted on their windows getting anything took harder fighting than most of what the valmieran army had done commoner women much more extravagantly pregnant than krasta elbowed her aside to get at a pair of loosefitting trousers or a baggy tunic they wanted she didnt need many lessons along those lines before long she gave as good as she got if not better after all wasnt elbowing commoners aside a proper sport for a noblewoman the clothes were cheaper than shed expected they were also none too sturdily made when she complained about that to a shopkeeper he said lady use your head you think youre gonna be in em long enough to wear em out what he said made good sense but his tone infuriated her do you know who i am she demanded somebody trying to waste my time and i aint got it to waste he answered and turned to a woman holding out some trousers to him you like these darling thats two and a half in silver thank you very much krasta didnt buy anything there the only revenge she could take she did get what she needed and she hunted down her driver who stowed away his flask when he saw her coming home she said and escaped threadneedle street with nothing but relief back at the mansion though merkela happened to be walking outside when krasta came up the drive the farm womans son toddled beside her holding her hand for balance what have you got in the sacks merkela snapped as if suspecting krasta of smuggling secrets to the algarvians clothes krasta answered shortly she had as little to do with merkela as she could it was either that or claw her and merkela would delight in clawing back she clawed now with words instead of nails oh aye for your bulging belly at least i know who my sons father is dont you wish you could say the same krasta snarled an unpleasantry at her and stalkedas well as a pregnant woman could stalkinto the mansion fernaos head ached like a lot of the mages at the hostel in the naantali district hed had too much to drink bidding ilmarinen farewell the night before he looked at the mirror above the sink in his roomlooked at it and winced powers above he muttered my eyes are as red as my hair pekka came up beside him the bed theyd shared was narrow for two to sleep in but theyd both poured down enough spirits to keep them from moving much pekka also winced she said my eyes are red too and i havent even got red hair he draped an arm around her shoulder i like what you have he said i like everything you have including red eyes she made a face at him i dont like that and i dont care what you think i need strong tea maybe with just a splash of spirits in it to take the edge off that sounds wonderful fernao limped over to the closet and chose a tunic and kilt he would limp for the rest of his life and one shoulder wasnt everything it might have been either hed almost died down in the land of the ice people when an algarvian egg burst much too close to him for quite a while he wished he had no more timeand falling in lovehad changed that pekka kept a couple of outfits in his closet these days as he had a couple in hers that helped them spend nights together and maintain the polite fiction that they were doing no such thing she changed her clothes while he got his cane he wasnt an old manfar from it not so long before he would have shaken his head in sorrow at the sight of someone his age who needed a cane to get around now he counted himself lucky for a long time hed been on crutches compared to that a single stick didnt seem so bad after running a brush through her hair pekka looked in the mirror again it will have to do she said sadly you always look good to me fernao said i hope you have better taste than that pekka said my one consolation is everybody who was at the farewell will be feeling the same way we do i have trouble believing ilmarinen is really gone fernao said as he went to the door the project wont be the same without him thats why he lefthe said the project already wasnt the same pekka answered it wont be the same for me now ill tell you that with master siuntio dead with master ilmarinen gone she sighed its as if the adults had all left and now things are in the childrens hands she walked out into the hallway fernao followed and closed the door behind them as they headed for the stairs that would take them to the refectory he said we arent children you know not for everyday things pekka agreed in this next to siuntio and ilmarinenwhat else are we colleagues fernao answered pekka squeezed his hand you do sound like a lagoan she said fondly your people have their share of algarvic arrogance i wasnt thinking about me so much fernao said i was thinking about you you were the one who made the key experiments siuntio knew it ilmarinen knew it they tried to give you credit i honor them for thata lot of mages would have tried to steal it instead several of his own countrymen sprang to mind starting with grandmaster pinhiero of the lagoan guild of mages he doggedly plowed ahead but you dont seem to want to take it whats the opposite of arrogance selfabnegation the last word necessarily was in classical kaunian he had no idea how to say it in kuusaman pekka started to get angry then she shrugged and laughed instead kuusamans see lagoans as one thing i dont suppose its any surprise that you should see us as the opposite to a mirror the real world must look backwards irked in turn fernao started to growl but checked himself and wagged a finger at her ah but who is the mirrorlagoans or kuusamans both of course pekka answered at once that made fernao laugh hed never known a woman who made him laugh so easily must be love he thought one more sign of it anyhow when they walked into the refectory he saw right away that pekka had known whereof she spoke all the mages already there looked subdued some of them looked a good deal worse for wear than merely subdued no one moved very fast or made loud noises of any sort when a mug slipped off a serving girls overloaded tray and shattered everybody flinched fernao pulled out a chair for pekka she smiled at him as she sat i could get used to these fancy lagoan manners she said they make me feel pampered i think is the word i want thats what theyre for fernao agreed his leg and hip yelped as he too went from standing to sitting little by little he was getting used to the idea that they would probably do that as long as he lived after a quick nod pekka frowned maybe you have them and we dont because we have an easier time with the idea that women and men can mostly do the same jobs than you lagoans do do the fancy manners and the deference men show your women help keep them from thinking about things they cant have i dont know fernao confessed i havent the faintest idea to tell you the truth i never would have thought of connecting manners and anything else manners are just manners arent they but were they just manners now that pekka had raised the question her remark made a disturbing amount of sense before he could say so one of the serving girls came up and asked what would you like this morning oh hello linna fernao said how are you today my head hurts she answered matteroffactly shed been at ilmarinens farewell celebration for all fernao knew shed given the master mage a special farewell of her own once the celebration wound down fernao wondered just what ilmarinen had seen in her to him she wasnt especially pretty or especially bright but ilmarinen had bristled like a young buck whenever anyone else so much as gave her a good day now she sighed and went on ill miss the old soandso powers below eat me if i wont hell miss you too pekka said i doubt it linna replied with casually devastating cynicism oh maybe a little till he finds somebody else to sleep with him up in jelgava but after that she shook her head not likely but i will miss him ive never known anybody like him and i dont suppose i ever will there isnt anybody like ilmarinen pekka said with great conviction they only minted one of that particular coin youre right there linna said hes even good in bed would you believe it i finally told him aye as much to shut him up as for any other reason i can think of hed been pestering me for so longi figured we might as well get it over with and then i could let him know i wasnt interested any more but he fooled me she shook her head again this time in slow wonder once he got started i never wanted him to stop fernao coughed and looked down at his hands that was more than hed expected or wanted to hear kuusamansespecially their womenwere a lot franker about some things than lagoans casting about for some sort of answer he said ilmarinen would be good at anything he set his mind to he probably would pekka agreed linna didnt say anything but the look on her face did argue that ilmarinen had indeed been good at something recalling herselfshe needed a moment to do soshe said what can i bring you you never did tell me tea hot tea lots of hot tea and a jar of spirits to splash into it fernao said same for me pekka added and a big bowl of tripe soup to go alongside linna nodded and hurried off toward the kitchens tripe soup fernao echoed wondering whether hed heard right but pekka nodded so he must have he gave her an odd look do kuusamans really eat things like that i thought you were civilized we eat all sorts of strange things pekka answered a twinkle in her eye we just dont always do it where foreigners can see us chicken gizzards duck hearts reindeer tongue boiled with carrots and onions and tripe soup she laughed at him turn up your nose all you like but there arent many things better when youve had too much to drink the night before ive had tongue fernao said beef tongue not reindeer they sell it smoked and sliced in fancy butchers shops in setubal its not bad as long as you dont think about what youre eating the twinkle in pekkas eye only got more dangerous youve never had brains scrambled together with eggs and cream where what youre eating thinks about you fernaos stomach did a slow lurch as it had been known to do when waves started pounding a leyline ship on which he was serving only one way to deal with this he thought when linna came back with the tea and the strengthener and a big steaming bowl of soup he pointed to it and said let me have some of that too pekkas eyebrows flew up like a couple of startled blackbirds linna just nodded good for what ails you she said though who wouldve thought a lagoan had wit enough to know it are you sure pekka asked pausing with a spoonful of soupand a chunk of something thin and grayish brown in the bowl of the spoonhalfway to her mouth no fernao answered honestly but if its nastier than i think i dont have to eat it all he spooned honey into his tea and poured in a splash of spirits too hot and sweet and spiked the brew did make him feel better he gulped it down pekka drank fortified tea too but concentrated on the soup linna brought fernaos bowl back almost at once cook did up a big pot of it this morning she said setting it down in front of him after what all went on last night he figured people would need it i had some myself back in the kitchen looking around the refectory fernao saw several kuusamans with bowls like his in front of them if it doesnt hurt them it probably wont kill me either he thought pekka eyed him inscrutably as he picked up his spoon of all the things hed expected actually liking the soup was among the last thats good he said and sounded suspicious even as he spoke as if he suspected someone of tricking him but it was the broth was hot and greasy and salty and full of the flavors of garlic and chopped scallions and the tripe while chewy didnt taste like much of anything his headache receded too maybe that was the tea but on the other hand maybe it wasnt he beamed at pekka well if this is barbarism who needs civilization she laughed why not her bowl was already empty like all the forthwegians in plegmunds brigade sidroc hated winters in the south this was the third one hed been through and they got no easier with practice he didnt think yanina was quite so cold as southern unkerlant had been but it was a lot worse than gromheort his home town there snow had been a curiosity it was nothing but an eternal nuisance here he remembered throwing snowballs with his cousins ealstan and leofsig one day when white did cover the ground up there hed been perhaps nine the same age as ealstan with ealstans older brother in his early teens sidroc grunted in his frozen hole in the ground no more playing with them ealstan had done his best to break his head and he himself had broken leofsigs broken it with a chair whoreson gave me one hard time too many sidroc thought good riddance to him the whole familys a pack of filthy kaunianlovers somebody called his namean algarvian by the trill he put in it here sir sidroc sang out speaking algarvian himself even now after more than two years of desperate fighting there wasnt a forthwegian officer in plegmunds brigadenobody higher than sergeant the redheads reserved the top slots for themselves lieutenant puliano wasnt an algarvian noble though he was a veteran sergeant whod finally become an officer for the most basic and desperate reason of all there werent enough nobles left to fill the places that needed filling all but invisible in a white snow smock puliano slithered along the ground till he dropped into the hole next to sidroc ive got something for you he said a present you might say what kind of present sidroc asked suspiciously some of the presents officers gave he didnt want to get puliano laughed you werent born yesterday were you with his gravelly voice and nononsense attitude he sounded like a sergeant in fact he put sidroc in mind of sergeant werferth whod been his squad leaderand without the rank his company commandertill he got blazed outside a yaninan village that village didnt exist anymore sidroc and his comrades had slaughtered everybody there in revenge for him puliano went on its nothing bad no extra sentrygo no volunteering to storm the enemy bridgehead over the skamandros singlehanded sidroc just grunted again what is it then he remained suspicious officers didnt go around handing out presents it felt unnatural but lieutenant puliano dug into his belt pouch and gave sidroc a straight cloth stripe for the shoulder straps of his tunic and two cloth twostripe chevrons for the tunic sleeveforthwegian and algarvian blazons of rank men of plegmunds brigade wore both when they could get them though the algarvian insignia were more important congratulations corporal sidroc puliano said and kissed him on both cheeks sergeant werferth never would have done that well dip me in dung sidroc said startled into forthwegian he was more polite in algarvian thank you sir you are welcome puliano said and who knows you may make sergeant yet you may even make officer yet that startled sidroc in fact it startled him right out of politeness who me he said not fornicating likelyuh sir i am a forthwegian in case you had not noticed oh i noticed youre too ugly to make a proper algarvian puliano spoke without malice which didnt necessarily say he meant it for a joke before sidroc could sort that out the redhead went on if they made me into an officer who knows where theyll stop he had something there the only kingdom that really didnt care whether its officers were noblemen or not was unkerlant swemmel had got rid of old nobles much faster than hed created new ones if the unkerlanters hadnt let commoners become officers they wouldnt have had any puliano grinned and pointed west now corporalsidroc didnt care for the way the redhead emphasized his shiny new rankwe have to see what we can do about that bridgehead on this side of the skamandros what you and me and nobody else sidroc said the unkerlanters had spent lives like water to force their way across the river after being balked for some considerable while most of the lives theyd spent forcing the crossing were those of yaninans thatll teach tsavellas to turn his coat sidroc thought savagely no lackwit puliano answered you and me and everything the fellows in the fancy uniforms can scrape together he might have been reading sidrocs mind for he went on its not the nasty little whoresons in the pompom shoes in the bridgehead any more i wish it were we could deal with them he spat in fine contempt but its unkerlanters in there now unkerlanters and as many stinking behemoths as they can cram into the space and if we wait for them to bust out sidroc made a very unhappy noise hed seen too often what happened when the unkerlanters burst from their bridgeheads he didnt want to be on the receiving end of that again but he asked have we got any real chance of flinging them back across the river pulianos shrug was as theatrical as his scornful spitting to a forthwegians eyes algarvians overacted all the time we have to try he said if we dont try we just sit here waiting for them to futter us if we try who knows what might happen he had a point most of the time the unkerlanters were as stubborn in defense as any general could want every so often though especially when they got hit at a time or from a direction they didnt expect they would panic and then the men attacking them got victories on the cheap we have enough behemoths of our own to throw at them sidroc persisted we have enough kaunians to kill to put some kick in our attack behemoths puliano gave another shrug melodramatic and cynical at the same time we havent had enough behemoths since the battles in the durrwangen bulge this wont be any different from any other fight the past year and a half blonds powers above were even short on blonds but his battered features didnt seem unduly disheartened of course since tsavellas isnt on our side any more we dont have to worry about what happens to these stinking yaninans their life energy works as well as anybody elses heh sidroc said i would sooner kill kaunians i never did like kaunians we are better off without them but nobody will miss these yaninan bastards either just so puliano agreed kaunians are the great enemies of algarve of real derlavaian civilization always and forever but as you say the yaninans betrayed us theyll pay for it indeed they will he clapped sidroc on the back one more time then went off to spread the news elsewhere sidroc waited in his hole wondering if the unkerlanters would spend some more yaninans or even some of their own men in a spoiling attack to disrupt whatever the algarvians had in mind it didnt happen before his relief came to take his place hullo sudaku he said everything is pretty quiet there for now it wont last though not if the lieutenant has the straight goods we have to take out the bridgehead sudaku answered seriously if we do not the unkerlanters will come forth and take us out they both spoke algarvian it was the only tongue they shared sudaku was no forthwegian he and a good many others like him had attached themselves to plegmunds brigade in the grim fighting during the breakout from the mandelsloh pocket in the eastern duchy of grelz no one had bothered to detach them since the algarvians had more important things to worry about by now some of the men from the phalanx of valmiera could curse fluently in forthwegian and by now sidroc had stopped worrying about the obvious fact that sudaku and his countrymen were tall and blond and blueeyedwere in fact every bit as kaunian as the blonds from forthweg whom mezentios men massacred whenever they needed to he did sometimes wonder why the valmierans fought for algarve the reasons theyd given didnt seem good enough to him but then his own probably looked flimsy to them too all he really worried about was whether he could count on them in a tight place hed seen again and again that he could sudaku asked do we hear right are you promoted oh that thinking about assailing the unkerlanter bridgehead sidroc had almost forgotten about his new rank aye its true good for you the valmieran said sidroc shrugged he didnt know whether it was good or not not really then sudaku smiled a sly smile and added now you will be able to tell ceorl what to do ah sidroc said and smiled he hadnt thought of that he and the ruffian had been giving each other a hard time for a couple of years now at last he had the upper hand of course if he rode ceorl too hard he was liable to end up dead in the attack on the bridgehead regardless of whether the unkerlanters blazed him neither the phalanx of valmiera nor plegmunds brigade worried overmuch about keeping hard cases from their ranks when sidroc got back to his squadhis squad indeed nowceorl greeted him with well heres a fine outfit ruined plegmunds brigades been in trouble ever since it took you in sidroc retorted but he went on we may be ruined if we really do have to try and smash the unkerlanter bridgehead it wont be easy that job never is lieutenant puliano hadnt been joking sidroc wished it were otherwise he didnt get so much as the chance to sew his new insignia of rank to his tunic before he and the men with him got ordered forward some behemoths came with them the beasts wore snowshoes to help them get over and through the drifts an unkerlanter notion that had dreadfully embarrassed the algarvians the first winter of the war and that mezentios men had since stolen seeing behemoths with algarvians aboard them raised sidrocs spirits it proved the redheads were serious about this attack they also brought up eggtossers to pound the unkerlanter positions on the east side of the skamandros the pounding didnt last long all too soon officers whistles shrilled forward puliano shouted along with his fellow commanders to his credit he went forward too algarvian officers led from the front one reason mezentios men needed so many replacements sidroc ran past a few dead and dying unkerlanters whose blood stained the snow for a heady moment he thought the attack might have surprised swemmels soldiers then they struck back dragonssome of them painted yaninan red and whitestreaked over from the west side of the river the algarvians didnt have nearly enough beasts in the air to hold them off despite the algarvian behemoths stiffening the attack far more unkerlanter animals trudged forward to oppose them as always the unkerlanters turned a bridgehead into a spiky hedgehog as fast as they could this time they didnt wait for the algarvians to start killing kaunians or yaninans before striking back in kind the ground shuddered beneath sidrocs feet violet flames shot up from it men shrieked behemoths bellowed in mortal agony and when the algarvian mages did resort to their own murderous magic it was to defend against what swemmels sorcerers were doing not to aid in the attack crouching behind a great gray stone sidroc called out to puliano we cannot do this we have to the algarvian lieutenant answered if we dont theyll futter us later if we do they will futter us now sidroc retorted he hoped puliano would tell him he was full of nonsense but the redheaded veteran only grimaced another attack did go in the unkerlanters held it off and beat it back after that sullenly the algarviansand the forthwegians and valmierans and grelzers and the handful of yaninans who couldnt stomach serving swemmeldrew back sidroc knew what that meant it meant trouble puliano was dead right and it means we arent strong enough to stop the trouble he thought he shrugged a broadshouldered shrug hed been in a lot of trouble in this war what was once more in all his life garivald had never gone throughhad in fact never imagined a winter without snow he came from a little village called zossen down in the duchy of grelz blizzards there were so much a fact of life that every peasant hut had its doorway facing north or northeast away from the direction from which the bad weather was likeliest to come even in his time as an irregular in the woods west of herborn the grelzer capital hed known no different winters zossen these days no longer existed the algarvians had made a stand there when unkerlanter armies fought their way back into grelz and nothing was left of the village or of the family garivald had had there and swemmels impressers a few months later had efficiently dragged him into the army even though he and obilot the woman with whom hed taken up while in the irregulars were working an abandoned farm well away from any other village an algarvian egg burst not too far from garivalds hole in the ground in the unkerlanter bridgehead south of eoforwic no snow here just rain through the fall and into the winter people had told garivald it would be like that but he hadnt believed it till he saw it himself another egg burst he saw the flash as all the sorcerous energy trapped inside the egg was released at once and the fountain of mud and dirt that rose the redheads had tried several times to drive the unkerlanters back across the twegen river tried and failed they hadnt mounted any fullscale attacks against this bridgehead lately but they didnt let the unkerlanters rest easy here either from the rear somebody called sergeant fariulf im here garivald answered swemmels impressers hadnt been perfectly efficient when they swept him into their net theyd got him into the army but they didnt know who they had as fariulf hed just been one peasant recruit among many as garivald the leader of an irregular band the composer of patriotic songs he was a target hed led men hed influenced men without taking orders directly from king swemmel that made him dangerous at least in swemmels eyes lieutenant andelot wants you sergeant the soldier said im coming garivald told him a couple of more eggs burst in front of his hole as he scrambled out and went back toward his company commander even had the algarvians been pounding the bridgehead just then with everything they had he still would have had to go no one in swemmels army got away with disobeying orders hello sergeant andelot said he was several years younger than garivald but he was an educated man not a peasant and spoke with a cultured cottbus accent garivald liked him as well as he could like anyone set in authority over him what can i do for you sir garivald asked now andelot set his hand on some papers i just wanted to say this report you wrote after the last time the redheads tapped us is quite good thank you sir garivald grinned his pleasure at the praise with a chuckle andelot said anyone could tell youre new to having your letters once youve been writing for a while youll come to see what a nuisance putting reports and such together can be its your own fault sir for teaching me garivald replied only a handful of people in zossen had been able to read and write the village had had no school and not much of anything else hed shaped and carried all his songs in his head he still did for that matterputting them down on paper would have put swemmels inspectors on his trail faster than anything else he could think of i dont think well have the leisure for reports and such for very much longer andelot said ah garivald leaned toward him are we finally going to break out andelot nodded thats the idea good garivald said im sick of looking at this same little chunk of forthweg day after dayespecially since it gets more torn up every single day his nostrils flared if it werent winteror as close to winter as they get around herewe wouldnt be able to stand the stink its pretty bad even so mezentios men have hurt us the company commander agreed but weve hurt them too and were going to hurt them more when we do break out of hereand out of our other bridgehead north of eoforwicthe city will fall aye sir now garivald nodded thats what i thought but andelot hadnt finished and thats not all fariulf he went on as if garivald hadnt spoken once we break the hard crust of their line we storm eastward with everything weve got and do you know what i dont think they can stop us or even slow us down much this side of the algarvian border the algarvian border garivald echoed in dreamy tones then he asked a question that showed his ignorance of the world outside zossen and the duchy of grelz how far is it from here to the algarvian border a couple of hundred miles andelot answered lightly garivald gaped but only for a little while even though hed been dragged into the army relatively late hed seen how fast it could move when things went well andelot went on we strike them at sunrise day after tomorrow have your men ready aye sir garivald saluted and went up to his muddy hole in the ground once more he knew dismissal when he heard it behemoths came forward that evening under cover of darkness some of them sheltered under what trees still stood others stayed out in the open but with great rolls of mudcolored cloth spread over them to make them harder for algarvian dragons to spot from the air the deception must have worked for the redheads flung no more eggs than usual at the bridgehead the next day the following night still more behemoths tramped up toward the fighting front and some time in the dark usually quiet hours between midnight and dawn that calm was shattered when every unkerlanter eggtosser in the bridgehead suddenly started hurling eggs at the algarvians as fast as it could the din the flashes of light the quivering of the earth beneath garivald were all plenty to terrify him what they were doing to the redheads among whom the eggs were landing was something he didnt care to think about the worse they get hit the better did go through his mind the worse the algarvians got hit at the beginning the more trouble they would have fighting back as dawn stained the sky ahead with pink officers whistles shrilled forward the cry echoed all through the bridgehead forward men garivald yelled at the top of his lungs forward urra king swemmel urra and then he added a new cry one that had just occurred to him on to algarve on to algarve the men in his squad echoed moving on to algarve was easier when whole regiments of behemoths thundered forward alongside the footsoldiers here and there algarvian resistance was tough garivald had discovered that however much he hated them the redheads made brave and resourceful foes wherever they hadnt been smashed flat they clung to strongpoints held on and pushed back the advancing unkerlanters as best they could that was what the behemoths advancing with his countrymen were for the eggtossers and heavy sticks they bore on their backs made short work of positions the footsoldiers couldnt possibly have cleared by themselves come on keep moving garivald shouted till he grew hoarse weve got to keep up with the behemoths in spite of the pounding the eggtossers had given the algarvian lines the first days advance went slowly mezentios men had put as many rings of fieldworks around the rim of the unkerlanter bridgehead as they could and had to be dug out of them one battered set of trenches at a time whatever reserves they had close by they threw into the fight they knew what was at stake here no less than the unkerlanters did toward evening garivald found himself huddled behind a burnedout barn only a few feet from andelot he couldnt quite remember how hed got there all he could feel was relief that nobody was blazing at him for the moment panting he asked how do you think were doing sir not too bad andelot answered i think we might be better off if they hadnt managed to murder general gurmun he was one of our good ones our really good ones but we have room to spare and the redheads dont how did they do that sir garivald asked nobody knows because we never caught the whoreson who killed him andelot answered my guess is they did something like what they tried to do here in the bridgehead only you caught it and gurmuns guards cursed well didnt they sent in a redhead sorcerously disguised as a forthwegian sir garivald asked maybe more likely though they sent in an algarvian disguised as one of us andelot said we dont look much different from forthwegians and they have people who speak our language somebody like that could get in to see gurmun without much trouble hed come out and disappearand after a while somebody would have gone in and found gurmun dead i dont know thats how it happened mind you im just a lieutenantnobody tells me these things but its my best guess well go slower than we would have with gurmun in charge im sure of that garivald snatched a little sleep in the dubious shelter the barn gave screeching whistles roused him well before dawn he got his men up and moving beams from the business end of unkerlanter and algarvian sticks flashed and flickered like fireflies he wondered if mezentios men would loose their fearsome murderbased magic they didnt maybe the unkerlanter attacks had killed most of their mages or wrecked the camps where they kept kaunians before slaughtering them he knew less about that than andelot knew about how general gurmun had died but it seemed a reasonable guess what garivald did know was that midway through the second day of the breakout unkerlanter men and behemoths smashed past the last prepared algarvian positions and out into open country come on boys he shouted lets see them try and stop us now he trotted east doing his best to keep up with the behemoths peering west leino had no trouble seeing the bratanu mountains the border between jelgava and algarve on the algarvian side of the border they were called the bradano mountains but since the kaunian ancestors of the jelgavans had given them their name the kuusaman mage preferred the blonds version looking ahead to the mountains made him wistful too see he pointed to the snow that at this season of the year reached halfway down from the peaks you can find winter in this kingdom if you go high enough he spoke classical kaunian the only language he had in common with xavega the lagoan sorcerer tossed her head sending coppery curls flying so you can but we are still down here in the flatlands and powers above only know when we shall drive the cursed algarvians back beyond their own frontier patience leino stood up on his toes to give her a kiss she was taller than he it was only this past summer that we came ashore on the beaches near balvi and here we are at the other side of the kingdom i do not see how the algarvians can keep us from crossing the mountains they do not have the men the behemoths or the dragons to do it patience xavega spoke the word as if it were an obscenity i have no patience i want this war to be over and done i want to go back to setubal and pick up the pieces of my life i hate the algarvians as much for what they have done to me as for what they have done to derlavai i believe that leino murmured xavega was invincibly selfcentered he hadnt been going to bed with her because he admired her character he didnt hed been going to bed with her because she was tall and shapely somewhere between very pretty and outrageously beautiful and as ferociously talented while horizontal as anyone looking at her vertical could have hoped with a small sigh he said i want to go back to kajaani and start over too kajaani xavega sniffed what is a kuusaman provincial town when set beside setubal the greatest city the world has ever known the capital of lagoas was indeed a marvel leino had gone there a couple of times for sorcerers convocations and had always been amazed so much to see so much to do even yliharma kuusamos capital couldnt really compare but leino had an answer with which even shorttempered xavega couldnt quarrel what is kajaani kajaani is home he missed pekka he missed uto their son he missed their house up a hill from the leyline terminal stop he missed the practical magecraft hed been doing at kajaani city college would he miss xavega if the chances of war swept them apart he chuckled under his breath some specific part of him would miss her he could hardly deny that but the rest he ruefully shook his head xavega didnt even like kuusamans not as a general working rule that she made an exception for him was almost as embarrassing as it was enjoyable and how would he explain her to his wife if the powers above were kind hed never have to if they werent id been away from you for a long long time sweetheart was about as good as he could come up with would pekka stand for that she might kuusamans did recognize that men and women had their flaws and foibles but she wouldnt be very happy and leino didnt see how he could blame her he almost wished she were carrying on an affair of her ownnothing serious just enough so that she couldnt beat him about the head and shoulders with tales of glistening untrammeled virtue he didnt find that likely he didnt really think his wife was the sort to do such things and he didnt really wish she were that sort just almost oat of tle darkness kuusaman dragons eggs slung under their bellies flew by heading east to pound the algarvian positions in front of the bratanu mountains aye kuusaman and lagoan dragons ruled the skies over jelgava the algarvians had a lot of heavy sticks on the ground but those didnt help them nearly so much as dragons of their own would have done painted sky blue and sea green the kuusaman dragons were hard to spot kuusamans had never believed in unnecessary display kuusamans often didnt believe even in necessary display algarvic peoples with their love for swagger and opulence had a different way of looking at things algarvian dragons were painted green red and white the colors of sibiu were red yellow and blue and those of lagoas red and gold algarvian soldiers had gone into the six years war in gorgeous gaudy impractical uniforms the slaughter in the early days of that fight though had forced pragmatism on them in a hurry before long the muted roar of eggs bursting in the distance came back to leinos ears in an abstract way he pitied thealgarvian soldiers who had to take such punishment without being able to give it back but as a practical mage he knew abstraction went only so far he much preferred dishing out misery to taking it when he said that aloud xavega nodded against the combined might of lagoas and kuusamo they are all but powerless to resist she replied the combined might of lagoas and kuusamo here in jelgava was two or three parts kuusaman to one part lagoan the kuusamans were also fighting and winning a considerable war against gyongyos across the islands of the bothnian ocean xavega didnt like to think didnt like to admit that the short swarthy slanteyed folk she looked down on both metaphorically and literally were a good deal more powerful than her own countrymen few lagoans did and because lagoas looked west and north across the strait of valmiera toward derlavai while the kuusamans concentrated on shipping and trade they didnt often have to leino smiled often was different from always but then his smile slipped the algarvians cannot match us in men or beasts no but in magecraft by the time he finished he looked thoroughly grim xavega scowled too aye they are murderers aye they are filthy but that is why we are here you and i the magecraft we learned can make their own wickedness come down on their heads not on those against whom they aim it indeed leino had to work to hold irony from his voice it wasnt that xavega hadnt told the truth it was just that as she had a way of doing she turned things so they looked best to her the sorcery she was talking about came from kuusamo not lagoas if fact unless leino was entirely wrong pekka had had a lot to do with devising it she hadnt said sobut then she hadnt been able to talk about what she was doing for quite some time the few hints leino had picked up all pointed in that direction before his thoughts could glide much further down that ley line a crystallomancer burst out of a nearby tent and came running toward him and xavega master mages master mages the fellow cried one of our dragonfliers reports that the algarvians are stirring at their special camp near the mountains are they leino breathed mezentios men called the camps where they kept kaunians before killing them by an innocuous name not least leino suspected so they wouldnt have to think about what they did names had power as any mage knew and the algarvians enemies had adopted this euphemism too not least so they wouldnt have to think about what the algarvians were doing either what is he saying demanded xavega whod stubbornly refused to learn any kuusaman there were days when leino found himself surprised shed ever learned classical kaunian he explained adding you would think they would have learned their lesson algarvians are arrogant xavega said by all the signs she gave shed never noticed her own arrogance she went on besides their murderous sorcery is the strongest weapon mezentios men have if they use it when no mages are in position to strike back at them they can work no small harm here i would say they judge the risk to be worth it i would say you are right leino answered i would also say we are going to teach them they have miscalculated the crystallomancer seemed to follow classical kaunian only haltingly he spoke to leino in the kuusaman that was their common birthspeech shall i tell the men at the front that they will havesorcerous protection aye you can tell them that leino answered also in kuusaman the crystallomancer saluted and dashed back to his tent leino fell back into classical kaunian this time at least we have some little warning that must have been a sharp dragonflier usually we have to start the counterspells when we feel the jolt as the algarvians start killing xavega nodded she put her arms around leino and gave him a long thorough kiss when at last they broke apart she murmured use my strength as your own when we give them what they deserve heart pounding leino nodded too on the cot and in matters magical xavega gave of herself without reserve everywhere else she was as spoiled a creature as had ever been born leino knew that he could hardly help knowing it but it didnt make any difference to what he would do now here he almost had to lead for the spells were in kuusaman no one had yet had the leisure to render them into classical kaunian or lagoan xavega had learned the rituals well enough to support him and she did that very well before the kaunians came we of kuusamo were here he murmured in his own tongue a ritual as old as organized magecraft in his land before the lagoans came we of kuusamo were here after the kaunians departed we of kuusamo were here we of kuusamo are here after the lagoans depart we of kuusamo shall be here hed used the traditional phrases whenever he incanted in jelgava even though they werent strictly true here as they were back in his homeland once theyd passed his lips he went through all the preliminary phases of the spell he would hurl at mezentios sorcerers xavega nodded approval good she said very good indeed as soon as they start killing as soon as they reveal their direction and distance we shall drop on them like a pair of constables seizing a band of robbers they are robbers by the powers above leino said and what they steal cannot be made good for who can give back a life once lost a few minutes later he sensed the disturbance in the worlds energy grid as the algarvians began killing kaunians he took savage pleasure in casting the rest of the spell and flinging it at the mages who had gone back to the most barbarous days of wizardry to try to support their kingdom in a losing war xavegas hand rested on his shoulder he felt her strength flowing into him flowing through him and flowing out of him against the algarvians and he felt the power mezentios men had unleashed now crumpled bent back turned against them this is easy triumph filled xavegas voice it must be because we were ready in advance i suppose so leino said when he could snatch a moment between cantrips it almost feels too easy xavega laughed and shook her head but suddenly as leino began a new charm he felt another upsurge of sorcerous energy from the west this one far stronger than the one before ive been outfoxed he thought as the ground shuddered beneath him xavega screamed the algarvians used one sacrifice to get us to show where we were then had more kaunians and more mages waiting to strike us when we revealed ourselves now how do we get out of this redpurple flames shot up all around them the crystallomancers tent caught fire xavega screamed again cracks in the ground yawned wide beneath her and leino leino screamed too as he felt himself falling the cracks slammed shut ilmarinens bones creaked as he got off the leyline caravan in the western jelgavan town of ludza carrying a carpetbag heavier than it might have been because it was full of papers and sorcerous tomes he descended to the platform the depot was battered but still standing which proved the algarvians hadnt turned and fought here as theyd done in a good many places hed seen on his journey across king donalitus realm a kuusaman mage about half ilmarinens age stood waiting on the platform welcome master he exclaimed hurrying forward to take the carpetbag its a great privilege to make your acquaintance sir im called paalo pleased to meet you ilmarinen answered you have a carriage waiting i certainly do sir paalo said and we may speak freely as we go my driver is cleared to hear secrets im so sorry for him ilmarinen murmured paalo gave him a puzzled look ilmarinen stifled a mental sigh another bright young man born without a funny bone he thought too many of them these days but he would have to deal with this one at least for a while i heard inskrunda was itthat something had gone wrong up here what can you tell me about it im afraid thats right sir paalo said it doesnt do to depend on the algarvians to keep trying the same thing over and over they caught a couple of our mageswell actually one of ours and a lagoanin as nasty a trap as youd never want to see started killing kaunians for a lure then killed a bunch more once wed begun the counterspell the second time aiming at our mages ilmarinen asked eraye paalo frowned did you hear that back in skrunda sir they werent supposed to know that much about it if somebody back there is asking questions where he isnt supposed to i want to know who well put him someplace where he can ask questions of the geese that fly by and of nobody else no no nonothing like that ilmarinen shook his head i had all that time to think while i was sailing up from kuusamo one of the things i was thinking about was if i were one of fornicating mezentios mages how could i get back at the nasty kuusamans and lagoans who were giving me such a hard time paalo stared i hope you wont be angry at me for saying so sir but you seem to have outthought the entire sorcerous high command of our army and that of the lagoans too he slung ilmarinens carpetbag in the carriage then turned to see if the master mage needed a hand getting in himself when he discovered ilmarinen didnt he asked how did you do that i suspect it wasnt very hard ilmarinen answered and paalos narrow slanted eyes got about as wide as they could ilmarinen went on no doubt all the army mages were so full of themselvesand so full of what their fancy spells could dothat they never bothered thinking about what the other bastards might do to them stupid buggers but i dont suppose it can be helped er paalo said again ilmarinen realized he might have sounded too harsh criticizing military mages to another military mage was almost bound to prove a waste of time perhaps to disguise what he was feeling paalo gave the driver minute instructions on how to get back to a place hed surely come from then sighing he went on i wish leino and xavega had foreseen such consequences as accurately as you did master ilmarinen they probably should have ilmarinen broke off leino thats right paalo nodded did you know him sir ive met him a few times ilmarinen shook his head in bemusement ive done a good deal of work with his wife though they hadthey havea little boy and what will pekka and her lagoon lover do when they find out about this i wish i were back there in the naantali district so i could see for myself a better piece of melodrama than most of the playwrights come up with by the powers above his wife paalo said are you sure sir ive been to their home ive met their boy he looks like his father ilmarinen replied i never saw them naked in bed together and screwing if thats what you mean but i have no doubt they were guilty of it why paalo turned as red as a goldenskinned kuusaman could i dont wish to speak ill of the dead but but youre going to ilmarinen said after a buildup like that my friend youll blab or ill turn you into a sparrow and me into a sparrowhawk talk instead of talking paalo suffered a coughing fit well sir its only that anyone who knew leino and xavega here in jelgava knew they they were lovers ilmarinen suggested paalo nodded gratefully so they were and so we all assumed leino had no ah impediments that would have kept him from screwing her ilmarinen supplied and got another grateful nod from paalo who struck him as a very straitlaced man xavega ilmarinen murmured xavega i saw her at a sorcerers colloquium or two i think badtempered woman if i recall but pretty enough to get away with it a lot of the time thats her paalo said drawn straight from life thats her ilmarinen hardly heard him and put together he added his hands shaping an hourglass in the air i wouldnt have thrown her out of bed even if id been married to two of my wives at the same time he eyed paalo whod gone from red to a color not far removed from chartreuse and patted him on the back there there my dear fellow ive upset you its nothing sir the other wizard said stiffly he was plainly lying through his teeth but ilmarinen rather admired him for it here after a moment gathering himself paalo added you arent quite what i expected in a master mage if you dont mind my saying so im a raffish old son of a whore is what i am ilmarinen said not without a certain pride what you expected was master siuntiobut even he had more juice in him than people who didnt know him would guess but juice or no juice plaster or no plaster hes dead now and youre bloody well stuck with me and if i dont match what you think a master mage should bei am a master mage so maybe youd do better revising your hypothesis er paalo said yet again he laughed a nervous laugh you arent what i expected not at all too bad ilmarinen leaned forward to tap the driver on the shoulder how much longer till we get where were going half an hour sir the fellow answered if the algarvians dont go and drop any eggs on our heads are they in the habit of doing that ilmarinen glanced at paalo your head still looks moderately well stuck on hed expected the younger mage to go er for the fourth time instead solemnly paalo said i do begin to wonder the more i sit by you that startled a laugh out of ilmarinen paalo went on no the algarvians havent got many dragons in the air here we rule the skies theyre trying to hold our beasts on sibiu away from trapani and the south and most of their dragons that arent doing that are fighting the unkerlanters ah the unkerlanters ilmarinen said swemmels paid the butchers bill for this war even if we islanders may come out of it looking better than he does im sorry for him id be even sorrier if he werent such a nasty miserable bastard in his own right an ally aye but a nasty miserable bastard all the same best thing that would happen would be for mezentios men to wreck unkerlant as badly as swemmels men wreck algarve paalo said then we wouldnt have to worry about either one of them for a generation that fit in quite well with ilmarinens view of the world but all he said was how likely is it the things we want most the things we need mostthose are the things were least likely to get what do we do then paalo asked his tone not far from despairing ilmarinen set a hand on his shoulder the best we can son the best we can he cocked his head to one side do i hear eggs bursting up ahead the first thing wed better do is wed better finish whipping the algarvians what they think is the best thing that could happen isnt what we want believe you me it isnt i know that paalo said every single kuusaman has known it since they used their filthy magic against yliharma and ever single kuusaman should have known it since they started using their filthy magic against the unkerlanters ilmarinen said killing people for the sake of their life energy is just as nasty aimed at the unkerlanters as it is when its aimed at us i suppose so the other mage said it doesnt hit home the same way though i guess it should but it doesnt since he was right ilmarinen didnt argue with him the carriage rolled past olive trees and almonds and the oranges and lemons the jelgavans used to flavor their wine and the vineyards in which they raised the grapes for that wine none of those crops would have grown in kuusamo oh a few cranks raised a few grapes on northfacing hills in the far far north of ilmarinens homeland and in warm years they got a few bottles of thoroughly indifferent wine from those grapes they were proud of themselves that didnt mean they werent cranks ilmarinen enjoyed the spicy aromatic scent of the citrus leaves even in wintertime birds hopped here and there through the trees searching for bugs that would have been plenty to tell the master mage he wasnt home any more pinkflowered oleanders added their sweet slightly cloying scent to the mix then the breeze shifted a little ilmarinens nose wrinkled so did paalos dead behemoths he explained the algarvians had a few around here we surrounded them and pounded them with dragons and thats what you smell theyre very good with the beasts our own behemoth crews go on and on about that theyve had plenty of practice fighting the unkerlanters i suppose but all the practice in the world wont help you if youre as outnumbered as they were and if you havent got any dragons of your own overhead good ilmarinen said nobody ever said the algarvians werent fine soldiers nobody ever said they werent brave soldiers that doesnt mean they dont need beating if anything it means they need beating more than ever because it makes them more dangerous than they would be otherwise he pointed ahead to a ragtag collection of tents is that where i go to work it is sir aye paalo said im sorry i wish it were finer dont worry ilmarinen said let the algarvians worry instead he hoped they would four when the knock on the door to fernaos chamber came pekka and he had just finished putting on their clothes in a low voice one that with luck wouldnt carry out into the hallway beyond pekka said its a good thing he didnt get here a few minutes ago i think its a very good thing sweetheart fernao replied as he headed for the door his voice was so full of sated male smugness pekka started to stick out her tongue at his back but she was feeling pretty well sated herself and so she didnt fernao opened the door aye what is it im sorry sir the crystallomancer in the hallway said i need to speak to mistress pekka i checked her chamber first and she wasnt there and well this is the next place i looked is she here aye im here pekka answered coming up to stand beside fernao that the two of them spent all the time they could together was no secret from the folk at the hostel in the naantali district if it still was a secret in the wider world it wouldnt stay one for long sooner or later word would get to leino pekka would have to deal with that eventually for now she just asked and whats gone wrong or what does somebody think has gone wrong mistress prince juhainen would speak to you the crystallomancer said oh pekka exclaimed she stood on tiptoe to kiss fernaono no secrets here not any morethen said ill come of course a call by crystal from any of the seven would have got her immediate complete attention but juhainens domain included kajaani and the surrounding districtshe was her prince or she his particular subject did he say what he wanted no mistress pekka the crystallomancer replied she turned and started down the corridor pekka hurried after her she looked back over her shoulder once fernao waved and blew her a kiss before shutting the door she smiled and went on after the crystallomancer i hope he wont be angry because hes had to wait she said when she and the crystallomancer reached the chamber that kept the hostel linked to the outside world no matter how beastly winter weather in the naantali district grew he shouldnt be the other woman replied hes been prince for a while now he knows how these things work juhainens uncle joroinen had preceded him as one of the seven and had died in the algarvian attack on yliharma three years before joroinen was one of the main reasons her project had gone forward juhainen backed her but not the way his uncle had his image looked out of the crystal at pekka your highness she murmured and went to one knee for a moment a kuusaman gesture of respect from a woman to a man that had a long and earthy history behind it how may i serve you sir prince juhainen was younger than she hed looked it too on first succeeding joroinen but didnt any more responsibility was having its way with him pekka knew that weight too but juhainen had more of it on his shoulders than she did he said mistress pekka i would give a great deal not to be the bearer of the news i have to give you what is it your highness alarm flashed through her had the seven somehow decided the project wasnt worth continuing after all that struck pekka as insane when magic she and her colleagues had created was used in jelgava every day and was one of the most important reasons the kuusaman and jelgavan armies had driven across the kingdom in less than half a year she thought first of the project that juhainens news might instead be personal never crossed her mind tiny and perfect in the sphere of glass in front of her juhainens image licked its lips he doesnt want to go on pekka realized and fear began to edge its way into her alongside astonishment the prince sighed and looked down at a leaf of paper on the table in front of him then with another sigh he said i regret more than i can tell you that in operations west of the town of ludza your husband leino fell victim to a sorcerous attack from the algarvians he and the mage with whom he was partnered both perished they were resisting one sorcerous assault from the enemy when another this one aimed specifically at them struck home for whatever they may be worth to you mistress pekka you have my deepest personal condolences and those of all the seven princes of kuusamo we knew the work your husband did before the war thanks to the behemoth armor he helped devise many crews and many footsoldiers who might have died still live pekka stared at him no she whispered not so much disagreement as disbelief shed hardly heard anything juhainen said after he told her leino was dead much more to herself than to the prince she said but what will uto do without his father what amends the seven of kuusamo can make we will juhainen promised your son shall not lack for anything material when the time comes for him to choose his course in life all doors will be open to him of this you have my solemn vow thank you pekka said almost at random she felt as if shed walked into a closed door in the dark stunned and shocked and hurt all at the same time she believed juhainen now where she hadnt a moment before disbelief was easier here for once she would have been happier not knowing the truth ilmarinen would not approve she thought dizzily she knew her wits werent working the way they were supposed to she knew but she couldnt do anything about it people in accidents often behaved so shed heard as much anyway she wished she werent experiencing it for herself is there anything i can do for you mistress pekka juhainen asked no pekka said and then remembered herself enough to add no thank you if ever there is you know you have only to ask the prince said thank you your highness pekka said prince juhainens image vanished from the crystal as his crystallomancer cut the etheric connection pekka got to her feet vaguely surprised her legs obeyed her will are you all right mistress pekka asked the crystallomancer whod brought her to this chamber no pekka answered and walked past her she would have walked through her if the crystallomancer hadnt scurried out of her way the next thing pekka knew she was standing in from of the door to her own room she went inside and barred the door behind her she hadnt run into anyone on the wayor if she had she didnt remember it she threw herself down on the bed and started to weep all the tears shed held back or been too numb to shed came flooding out fernao will wonder where i am wonder whats happened she thought that only brought on a fresh torrent of tearsthese tears of shame powers above if the knock on the door had come a few minutes earlier wed have been making love wouldnt that have been a perfect way to find out leino was dead it was only because you werent here she said aloud as if her husband stood beside her listening but leino didnt he wouldnt not ever again that finally started to strike home pekka wept harder than ever after a while she got up and splashed cold water on her face it did no good at all looking at herself in the mirror above the sink she saw how puffy and red her eyes were and how much she looked like someone whod just staggered out of a leyline caravan car after some horrible mishap even as she dried her face tears started streaming down her cheeks once more she threw herself down on the bed again and gave way to them she never knew how long the knocking on the door went on before she noticed it quite a while she suspected by the time she did realize it was there it had a slow patient rhythm to it that suggested whoever stood out there in the hallway would keep on till she gave heed another splash of cold water did even less than the first one had grimly pekka unbarred and opened the door anyhow it might be something important something she had to deal with dealing with anything but herself and her own pain right now would be a relief or she thought it might be fernao and it was the smile melted off his face when he saw her powers above he whispered what happened sweetheart dont call me that pekka snapped and he recoiled as if shed struck him what happened she repeated leino in jelgava the algarvians she tried to gather herself but had no great luck the tears came whether she wanted them or not oh fernao said softly oh no im so sorry are you she wondered or are you just as well pleased why shouldnt you be your rival is out of the way how convenient nothing shed ever seen from fernao nothing hed ever said made her believe he would think did think like that but she wasnt thinking very clearly herself right then sometimes she did think clearly enough to understand that fernao started to come into the room pekka stood in the doorway blocking his path he nodded jerkily then bowed almost as if he were an algarvian all right he said though she hadnt said anything aloud ill do anything you want me to do you know that tell me what it is and ill do it only dont shut me away please i dont want to have to think about that right now pekka said i dont want to have to think about anything right now but she couldnt help it what ran through her mind was oh powers aboveim going to have to let uto know his father isnt coming home from the war that was another jolt almost as bad as hearing the dreadful news from juhainen for now can you just leave me be all right he said but the look in his eyesso like a kuusamans eyes in shape set in an otherwise purely lagoan faceshowed shed hurt him whatever you want me to do or dont want me to do tell me you know ill do it or not do it thank you pekka said raggedly i dont know what the etiquette is for the wifes lover when the husband dies spoken in a different tone of voice that might have been a joke she meant it as a statement of fact no more fortunately fernao took it that way neither do i he admitted at least not when several words too late he broke off at least not when the lover has nothing to do with the husbands demise hed been about to say that or something like it lagoans werent quite so touchy or so much in the habit of taking other mens wives for lovers as algarvians but some of the romances pekka had read suggested they did have their rules for such situations she didnt want to think about that now either in the romances the wife was often glad when her husband met his end she wasnt glad she felt as if a leyline caravan had just appeared out of nowhere run her down and then vanished leino had been one of the anchors of her world now she was adrift lost at sea had fernao chosen that moment to try to embrace her in sympathy either real or something less than real she would have hit him maybe he sensed as much for he only nodded said ill be here when you need me and went down the hall the rubber tip of his cane tapping softly on the carpet at every stride pekka had never imagined she would have to compare a dead husband and a live lover she found she couldnt do it not now she dissolved in tears again tomorrowperhaps even later todayshe would start doing everything that needed doing for the time being grief had its way with her colonel sabrino had been at war more than five years in all that time he could count on the fingers of one hand the number of leaves hed got the leyline caravan glided to a stop trapani the conductor called as he came through the cars all out for trapani grabbing his duffel bag and slinging it over his shoulder sabrino left the caravan car no one waited for him on the platform no one here knew he was coming illsurprise gismonda he thought and hoped he wouldnt surprise his wife in the arms of another man that would prove embarrassing and complicated for all concerned one thinghe wouldnt surprise his mistress in the arms of another man that would have proved even more embarrassing and complicated but fronesia had left him for an officer of footsoldiers who shed thought would prove more generous absently sabrino wondered if he had the depot had seen its share of war planks stretched across sawhorses warned people away from a hole in the platform boards patched holes in the roof too and kept most of the cold rain off the debarking passengers and the people waiting for them the sight saddened sabrino without surprising him all the way back from eastern yanina hed seen wreckage some of it came from unkerlanter eggs more by what people said from those dropped by kuusaman and lagoan dragons now that the islanders were flying off the much closer islands of sibiu they could pound southern algarve almost at will our dragonfliers are as good as theirs sabrino thought bitterly a lot of our dragonfliers are better than any of theirs anyone who s stayed alive since the beginning has more experience than a kuusaman or a lagoon could hope to match but we havent got enough dragons and we havent got enough dragonfliers stretched too thin the words tolled like a mournful bell inside sabrinos mind algarvian dragons had to be divided among the westwhere king swemmels men swarmed forward yet againvalmiera jelgava and the defense of the south against the air pirates flying out of sibiu how was one kingdom supposed to do all those jobs at the same time it was impossible if we dont do all those jobs well lose the war that was another painfully obvious truth it had been obvious to soldiers since the battles of the durrwangen bulge perhaps since the fall of sulingen any civilian with eyes to see would surely have noted the same thing after kuusamo and lagoas gained their foothold on the mainland of derlavai in jelgava now armies came at algarve from the west and from the east on which front will we lose ground faster outside the depot cabs waited in neat ranks as in the old days sabrino waved to one the cabby waved back he hurried toward the cab the driver descended opened the door for him to get in and asked where to sabrino gave his address or rather half of it before stopping and staring the cabbys black uniform was the one he remembered from heavy shoes to highcrowned cap with shiny patentleather brim but youre a woman he blurted sure am the cabby agreed she was middleaged and dumpy but that wasnt why hed needed a moment to know her for what she was smiling at his confusion she went on you havent been home for a while have you colonel no sabrino said numbly plenty of women doing all kinds of things these days the driver told him not enough whole menor crippled men come to thatleft to do them and theyve got to get done hop in pal ill take you where youre going you want to tell me again where that is without choking this time still astonished he obeyed when he got into the passenger compartment she closed the door behind him then scrambled up to her seat the cab began to roll sure enough she could manage a horse streets were rougher than sabrino remembered that wasnt the cabs elderly springs it was poorly repaired holes in the roadway some of them hadnt been repaired at all jounces made his teeth click together everything seemed more sootstained than sabrino remembered too the reason for that wasnt hard to find either charred ruins were everywhere sometimes a house or a shop sometimes a block or two or three the air stank of stale smoke just breathing made sabrino want to cough there was the jewelers shop where sabrino had had a ringbooty hed taken in unkerlantrepaired for his mistress no there was the block where the shop had stood but only wreckage remained he hoped dosso had got out hed been doing business with the jeweler since just after the six years war most of the people on the street were women sabrino had seen that on earlier leaves it stood out even more strongly now even some of the constables were women the rest were graybeards who looked to have been summoned from retirement most of the men not in uniform limped or went on crutches or had a sleeve pinned up or wore a patch over one eye or had some other obvious reason for not being at the front everyone seemed to be wearing somber clothingsome the dark gray of mourning others shades of blue or brown hard to tell from it in the sad winter light womens kilts had got longer too sabrino let out a silent sigh the cab rattled to a stop here you go colonel the driver said sabrino got out the driver descended to hand him his bag he tipped her more than he would have if she were a man she curtsied and climbed up again to go look for her next fare sabrino went up the walk and used the brass knocker to knock on his own front door when a maidservant opened it she squeaked in surprise and dropped him a curtsy more polished than the one hed got from the cabby your excellency she exclaimed we had no idea i know clarinda sabrino answered its not always easy to send messages from the front but im here the unkerlanters havent managed to turn the lady my wife into a widow quite yet is gismonda at home clarinda nodded aye my lord count nobody goes out as much as we did beforehand let me go get her she hurried away calling lady gismonda lady gismonda your husbands home that brought servants from all over the mansion to clasp sabrinos hand and embrace him the last time hed had such a greeting he thought was when hed managed to escape the unkerlanters after they blazed down his dragon let me through gismonda said and the cooks and serving girls parted before her as if she were a firstrank mage casting a powerful spell sabrinos wife gave him a businesslike hug she was a few years younger than he shed been a beauty when they wed and her bones were still good she would have hated being called handsome but the word fit her after looking sabrino up and down she nodded in brisk approval you seem better than you did the last time they let you come home i was wounded then he pointed out you look very good my dearand you dont look as if you were about to go to a funeral gismondas tunic and kilt were of a bright green that set off her eyes and the auburn hair that these days got more than a little help from a dye jar her lip curled i dont much care for what people call fashion these days and so i ignore it some fools do cluck but the only place i care about hens is on my supper plate she turned to the head cook speaking of hens have we got a nice one you can do up for the counts supper tonight not a hen milady but a plump capon he replied gismonda looked a question to sabrino his stomach answered it by rumbling audibly as if hed replied with words gismonda nodded to the cook he went off to get to work gismonda asked sabrino and what would you like in the meanwhile he answered that without hesitation a hot bath a glass of wine and some clean clothes i think all that can probably be arranged gismonda said by the look she gave the servants they would answer to her if it werent sabrino was soaking in a steaming tubluxury beyond price in the wilds of unkerlant or yaninawhen the bathroom door opened it wasnt a servant it was his wife carrying a tray on which perched two goblets of white wine she gave sabrino one set the other on the edge of the tub and went out again returning a moment later with a stool upon which she perched by the tub sabrino held up his goblet in salute to my charming lady youre kind gismonda murmured as she drank their marriage like most from their generation and class had been arranged they never had fallen in love but they liked each other well enough gismonda sipped again then asked a sharp quick question can we win the war no sabrino gave the only answer he could see i didnt think so his wife said bleakly it will be even worse than it was after the six years war wont it much worse sabrino told her he hesitated then went on if you have a chance to get to the east it might be a good idea he didnt elaborate he didnt want to think about the unkerlanters coming so far but couldnt help it gismondas thoughtful nod told him she understood what he meant her eyes glinted since youre unfortunate enough to find yourself in trapani without a mistress would you like me to scrub your back for youor even your front if youre so inclined before he could answer bells started ringing all over the algarvian capital some nearer some farther whats that he asked enemy dragons gismonda replied the warning for them i mean the dowsers are skilled not that it helps much get dressedquicklyand come down to the cellar we can worry about other things later she sighed the capon will have to go out of the oven and into a rest crate we will get to eat it eventually the only clothes sabrino had in the bathroom were his uniform tunic and kilt and a heavy wool robe without hesitation he chose the robe even as he tied it shut eggs began falling on trapani hed delivered attacks and been under attack from the air but hed never imagined a pounding so large and sustained as this and it went on and on night after night after night gismonda did not have to hurry him down the stairs he marveled that any of trapani was left standing the cellar hadnt been made to hold everyone in the mansion it was cramped and crowded and stuffy even down here underground the thuds and roars of bursting eggs dug deep into sabrinos spirit everything shook when one came down close by if one happened to land on the roof would everyone be entombed here he wished he hadnt thought of that after a couple of hours he asked how long does this go on all night most nights clarinda answered some of them fly away but more come we knock some down but her voice trailed away all night long sabrino thought with something approaching horror every night we never could have done that not at the height of our strength the height of algarves strength seemed very far away now very far away indeed we are going to lose this war and then what will become of us the eggs kept falling they gave no answer or none sabrino wanted to hear for the first time since the middle of summer ealstan couldnt hear any eggs bursting the fighting had passed east from eoforwic algarvians no longer swaggered through the streets of forthwegs capital now unkerlanters stumped along those cratered rubblestrewn streets if theyd expected to be welcomed as liberators they were doomed to disappointment but they didnt seem to care one way or the other just another set of conquerors ealstan said one afternoon when he got back to the flat he shared with vanai and saxburh they look down their noses at us as much as the algarvians ever did powers above be praised that were safe and that this building is still standing so we have a roof over our heads his wife replied past that nothing else really matters well aye ealstan said reluctantly but if we rose up against swemmels men theyd squash us the same way the algarvians did thats humiliating is forthweg a kingdom or is it a road for its neighbors to run through any time they choose almost as soon as the question was out of his mouth he wished he hadnt asked it too many times in years gone by forthweg had proved to be nothing but a road but vanai surprised him by answering i dont know and do you know something else i dont care either i dont care at all if you want to know the truth the only thing i care about is the unkerlanters dont march through the streets yelling kaunians come forth and if i go outside and my sorcery slips or even if i go outside without my sorcerythey wont drag me off to a camp and cut my throat they dont care about kaunians one way or the other and you have no idea how good that feels to me ealstan stared maybe because vanai had looked like thelberge for so long hed let himself forgetor at least not think so much abouther kaunianity the kaunians in forthweg often found forthwegian patriotism bewildering or even laughable that was one reason one of many forthwegians and kaunians rubbed one another the wrong way and he couldnt blame vanai for thinking the way she did not after everything shed been through still a little stiffly he said when the war is finally over i want this to be our own kingdom again i know vanai shrugged she walked over and gave him a kiss i know you do darling but i just cant make myself care as long as nobody wants to kill me because ive got blond hair what difference does it make ealstan started to answer that before he could say anything vanai added nobody but a few kaunianhating forthwegians i mean whatever hed been about to say he didnt say it after some thought he did say a lot of those people went into plegmunds brigademy cursed cousin sidroc for instance i dont think theyll be coming home thats good vanai admitted but there are always more of those people they dont disappear i wish they did but they dont she spoke with a weary certainty that was very kaunian indeed the day was mild as even winter days in eoforwic often were they had the shutters open wide to let fresh air into the flat a couple of daggerlike shards of glass remained in the window frames but no more now maybe i can think about getting that fixed went through ealstans mind maybe in spite of everything this city will come back to life again now that the algarvians are gone motion down on the street drew his eye he went to the window for a better look through much of the summer and fall he wouldnt have dared do any such thingshowing himself would have been asking to get blazed a couple of unkerlanters recognizable by their rockgray tunics and cleanshaven faces were pasting broadsheets on stillstanding walls and fences i wonder what those say he remarked shall we go down and find out vanai replied we can do that now you know i can do that now you know to emphasize how strongly she felt about it she switched from the forthwegian she and ealstan usually used to classical kaunian why not ealstan replied in the same language vanai smiled though she was more fluent in forthwegian than he was in the tongue shed most often used back in oyngestun he pleased her whenever he used classical kaunian maybe it reminded her that not all forthwegians hated the kaunians who shared the kingdom with them ealstan scooped saxburh out of the cradle where shed been gnawing on a hard leather teething ring she smiled and gurgled at him her eyes were almost as dark as his but her face though still babyround promised to end up longer than a pureblooded forthwegians would have vanai threw on a cloak over her long tunic lets go she said and really did sound excited about being able to leave the flat whenever she wanted as usual the stairwell stank of boiled cabbage and stale piss ealstan was resigned to the reek these days though it had distressed him when he first came to eoforwic back in gromheort his family had been welltodo he hoped they were well and wondered when he would hear from them again not till the unkerlanters run the redheads out of gromheort he thought soon i hope vanai pointed to the front wall of a block of flats a couple of doors down theres a broadsheet she said lets go have a look ealstan said here in the street another stink filled the air that of dead meat unburied bodies the algarvians hadnt fought house by house in eoforwic not when it became plain the city would be surrounded theyd got out instead saving most of their men to give battle elsewhere with better odds but a good many of them had perished and some unkerlanters and almost surely more forthwegian bystanders than soldiers from both sides put together the broadsheets headline was bold and black the king will speak ealstan stared at those astonishing words vanai read the rest the king of forthweg will address his subjects before the royal palace at noon onthe date was three days hence all loyal forthwegians are urged to come forth and hear their sovereigns words king pendas back ealstans jaw fell in astonishment he grabbed vanai and kissed her king pendas back hurrah he felt like cutting capers he did cut a few in fact from vanais arms saxburh stared at him in astonishment he kissed the baby too king pendas back i never thought the unkerlanters would let him show his face in forthweg again im glad youre pleased by vanais tone the news didnt excite her nearly so much lets go hear him when he speaks ealstan exclaimed his wife looked as if that wasnt the thing she most wanted to do but she didnt say no she might not share his patriotism but shed learned better than to argue about it with him and so on the appointed day ealstan and vanai and saxburh with them went to the square in front of the palace ealstan wore his best tunic not that it was much better than the others vanai hadnt bothered putting on anything special blue and white ribbons and streamers and bannersforthwegs colorsdid their best to enliven the battered square and even more battered palace facade in front of the palace stood a new wooden platform with a speakers podium at the front unkerlanter soldiers stood guard around it more soldiers these probably of higher rank stood on it with a personage in fancy robes ealstan got up on tiptoe trying to see better is that king penda he said almost hopping in his excitement who else could that be but king penda he took saxburh from vanai and held her up over his head look saxburh thats the king i dont think she cares vanai said pointedly not now but she will when shes older ealstan said shes seen the king the king did not come to the podium at once instead one of the unkerlanter officers strode forward people of forthweg he called in accented but understandable forthwegian i am general leuvigild king swemmels commander for forthweg what does that mean ealstan wondered before he could say anything leuvigild went on people of forthweg i give you a king who has struggled side by side with us to free your kingdom from the algarvian invaders a man who has fought alongside unkerlanter soldiers rather than fleeing his kingdom for a life of ease and luxury safe in lagoas people of forthweg i give you king beornwulf i long may he reign in dead silence beornwulf came up to the podium a puppet ealstan thought bitterly nothing but an unkerlanter puppet back before the war hed heard of beornwulf a few times the man was an earl or count with estates in the west of forthweg the man is a whore naked in king swemmels bed and he prostitutes his kingdom along with himself people of forthweg i will make you the best king i can beornwulf said we are allied with unkerlant in the tremendous struggle against accursed algarve we shall follow our allys lead and in so doing regain our own freedom so long as we do that we shall stay great and free i expect all my subjects to recognize the importance of this alliance and to do nothing to jeopardize it as i shall do nothing to jeopardize it together unkerlant and forthweg will go forward to victory he stepped back more silence followed no curses no boos but no cheers or applause either quietly vanai said well it could be worse you know and she was right swemmel could simply have annexed forthweg maybe rule from a puppet would prove better than direct rule by a puppetmaster like the king of unkerlant maybe ealstan wondered if he dared hope for even that much people started filing out of the square they had to file past more unkerlanter soldiers men who hadnt been there when the square filled what are they doing vanai said alarm in her voice they cant be checking for kaunians they dont do that do they your spell is fine ealstan told her and squeezed her hand and you dyed your hair not so long ago youll get by not everyone got by the unkerlantersthere were a surprising lot of thempulled people out of the crowd and let others through they didnt listen to the cries of protest that started rising but nobody did more than shout the unkerlanters all had sticks and likely wouldnt hesitate to use them most people seemed to get through having no choice ealstan and vanai went forward an unkerlanter soldier looked ealstan up and down he paid vanai no attention whatever in what was probably his own language rather than forthwegian he asked how old are you ealstan got the drift forthwegian and unkerlanter were cousins twenty he said good the unkerlanter gestured with his stick you come here with us ice ran through ealstan what he said why for the army the unkerlanter answered now come or be sorry king beornwulf will have an army ealstan asked in surprise no no no the unkerlanter laughed king swemmels army plenty of algarvians to kill now come by the way he gestured with the stick this time hed use it if ealstan balked numbly ealstan went he didnt even get to kiss vanai goodbye colonel lurcanio had spent four happy useful years in priekule helping to administer the occupied capital of valmiera for king mezentio of algarve hed seen a great many other algarvians leave valmiera to fight in unkerlant a fate not worse than death but near enough equivalent to it after the islanders landed in jelgava hed seen other countrymen go north to fight there at last with the valmierans ever more restless under algarvian control there simply werent enough algarvians left to hold down the occupied kingdom any more and so mezentios men had withdrawn from most of it the bargain being that the valmieran irregulars wouldnt harass them so long as they were pulling back both sides had stuck to it fairly well and so ive become a real soldier again lurcanio thought a tent in the rugged upland forests of northwestern valmiera was a far cry from a mansion on the outskirts of priekule if he wanted his cot warmed he could put stones by the campfire and wrap them in flannel they were a far cry from marchioness krasta lurcanio sighed for pleasures now lost krasta hadnt a brain in her head but the rest of her body more than made up for that not for the first time lurcanio wondered if she was indeed carrying his child he had no time to dwell on the question instead of keeping priekule running smoothly for grand duke ivone he had command of a brigade of footsoldiers these days and they were about to strike as soon as the algarvians abandoned the northern coast of the strait of valmiera kuusamo and lagoas promptly started pouring men and behemoths and dragons across the arm of the sea separating their island from the derlavaian mainland algarvian dragons and leviathans did what they could to hinder that but what they could was less than their commanders had expectedless than theyd promised too as if anyone with sense would believe our promises nowadays lurcanio muttered too many of them had been broken and so kuusaman and lagoan soldiers rampaged west through southern valmiera a few brigades of valmierans with them they were heading straight for the border of the marquisate of rivaroli which had been algarvian before the six years war valmieran between the six years war and the derlavaian war and was now algarvian once more how long it would stay that way is partly up to me lurcanio thought he turned to his adjutant captain santerno are we ready as ready as we can be sir santerno answered he was a young man with perhaps half lurcanios fiftyfive years but he wore two wound badges and what he called a frozenmeat medal that showed hed fought in unkerlant through the first dreadful winter of the war there he had a scarred face and hard watchful eyes now we get to find out how good the islanders really are his tone said he didnt expect the lagoans and kuusamans to be very good after what hed seen in the west his attitude proclaimed nothing the islanders did was likely to impress him and his eyes measured lurcanio he didnt say you ve been sitting on your arse in priekule screwing blond women and living high on the hog but what kind of warrior do you make he didnt say it but he thought it very loudly what kind of warrior do i make lurcanio wondered after four years of being a military bureaucrat he was going to find out do you think we can slice south through them all the way to the sea he asked wed cursed well better wouldnt you say colonel santerno replied cut em off chew em up thatll buy us the time we need here maybe let us set things right against the unkerlanters he didnt sound convinced a moment later he explained why weve scraped a lot together to make this attack we might have done better to throw it all at swemmels bastards how would we stop the islanders then lurcanio asked powers below eat me if i know sir his adjutant said all i can tell you is we havent got the men in the west to keep the unkerlanters out of algarve the way things are i got to valmiera just a couple of weeks before we pulled back that was supposed to free up more men for the west but theyve been sucked up into jelgava or else theyre here in the woods seems like we cant stop everybody he rolled his eyes seems like we cant hardly stop anybody stretched too thin lurcanio thought sorrowfully safe and warm and cozy in priekule hed wondered about that hed sometimes even wondered about it lazy and sated in krastas bed but hed been only a military bureaucrat and so what was his opinion worth nothing as his superiors had pointed out several times when hed tried to give it tomorrow morning he said well see what we can do right santerno said and gave him that measuring stare once more what will you do colonel when you really have to fight they moved south out of the forest a little before dawn under clouds and mist the lagoans and kuusamans still hadnt got accustomed to fighting in valmiera they hadnt realized how big a force the algarvians had built up there in the rugged northwest of the kingdom and had only a thin screen of pickets warding the men moving west on what they reckoned more important business bursting eggs and trampling behemoths and dragons painted in green and red and white announced that theyd miscalculated forward lurcanio shouted all through the first day forward the algarvians stormed just as they had in the glorious early spring of the war when valmiera fell disgruntled lagoan and kuusaman captives went stumbling back toward the rear disbelief on their faces algarvian soldiers relieved them of whatever money and food they had on their persons keep moving lurcanio yelled to his men we have to drive them we cant slow down thats right colonel santerno said thats just right he paused maybe you havent done a whole lot of this stuff but you seem to know whats going on my thanks lurcanio said on the whole sincerely he didnt think santerno paid compliments for the sake of paying themnot to a man twice his age anyhow that first day the algarvians raced forward as hard and as fast as any of mezentios generals could have hoped a spear driven into the enemys flank lurcanio thought as he lay down in a barn to snatch a few hours sleep now we have to drive it home the roar of bursting eggs woke him before sunup the next morning the bursts came from the south algarvian eggtossers already up into new positions to pound the enemy you see sir santerno said sipping from a mug of tea hed got from a cook the islanders arent so much of a much maybe youre right lurcanio answered and went off to get some tea of his own things went well on the second day too though not quite so well as they had on the first algarvians slogged forward through snow that slowed both footsoldiers and behemoths weve got to keep going santerno said discontentedly the faster we move the better our chances but the kuusamans and lagoans no longer taken altogether by surprise as they had been when the attack opened fought back hard they also wrecked every bridge they could as they retreated making mezentios artificers spend precious hours improvising crossings and the enemy seemed to have endless herds of behemoths not the carefully hoarded beasts the algarvians had accumulated with so much labor and trouble they werent so good on the behemoths as the veterans who rode the algarvian animals but they could afford to spend their substance freely lurcanios countrymen couldnt on the third day the sun burned through the low clouds earlier than it had on the first two of the attack forward lurcanio shouted once more the algarvians had pushed about a third of the way down to the strait of valmiera fairly close to the distance their plan had prescribed for the first two days lurcanio was more pleased than not no plan he knew came through battle intact he was also weary unto death he felt every one of his years like another heavy stone on his shoulders i have had a soft war he thought as he splashed south through an icy stream a good thing too or id have fallen over dead a long time ago someone blazed at him from the trees beyond the stream as he came up onto the bank the beam boiled a puff of steam from the snow near his feet he threw himself down on his belly with a groan i wish i could just lie here and go to sleep not far away captain santerno sprawled behind a tree trunk lurcanio noted with a certain amount of relief that the hardfaced youngster looked about as haggard as he felt himself a couple of algarvian behemoths lumbered up out of the stream the eggtossers on their backs made short work of the enemy footsoldiers in the trees lurcanio heaved himself to his feet forward he yelled and then more quietly spoke to santerno who would have thought it we may really do this why not his adjutant answered these kuusamans and lagoans theyre not so tough if you havent fought in unkerlant you dont know what wars about lurcanio had heard that song before he began to think santerno was right though then toward the afternoon his brigade surrounded a town called adutiskis the road the algarvians really needed to use ran through the town the kuusamans holed up inside threw back the brigades first attack killing several behemoths lurcanio knew his countrymen couldnt afford to lose he sent in a message under flag of truce to the kuusaman commander i respectfully suggest you surrender your position i cannot answer for the conduct of my men if they overrun the town you have already fought bravely and further resistance is hopeless in short order the messenger returned bearing a written answer in classical kaunian it said powers below eat you lurcanio and santerno stared at that the hardbitten adjutant swept off his hat in salute and said the man has style aye lurcanio agreed he also has adutiskis and its a cork in the bottle he led another attack it failed mages brought up blonds to killmaybe kaunians from forthweg maybe valmierans scooped up at random lurcanio asked no questions winning overrode everything else but kuusaman wizards in the town threw the spell back on their heads we have to get through lurcanio raged theyre crimping the whole attack the fourth morning dawned even brighter and clearer than the third had and swarms of kuusaman and lagoan dragons flew up from the south eggs crashed down on the algarvians heads dragons flamed behemoths one after another till the stink of burnt meat filled lurcanios nostrils the kuusamans in adutiskis held against a third attack and then he had to turn men away from the town to try to contain an enemy thrust bent on relieving it by the slimmest of margins he did even more enemy dragons were in the air the next morning every so often one would get blazed out of the sky and smash down into the snow but two or three fresh beasts always seemed to take its place the algarvian advance stumbled to a halt did you ever see anything like this in unkerlant lurcanio asked santerno numbly the younger officer shook his head we have to fall back he said we cant stay out in the open like this well all get killed the algarvian commanders took three days longer to realize the same thing which gained them little ground and cost them men and beasts they could not spare adutiskis never did fall and the way into algarve lies open for the enemy lurcanio thought grimly leudast had no trouble figuring out when he crossed the border from yanina into algarve it wasnt so much that the buildings in the villages changed though they didthe algarvians were given to vertical lines enlivened with ornamental woodwork that struck the unkerlanter lieutenant as busy it wasnt even that redheads replaced small skinny swarthy yaninans more than anything else it was the roads in unkerlant cities had paved streets villages didnt often goodsized towns didnt roads between cities were invariably dirtwhich meant that in spring or fall they were invariably mud that mud had gone a long way toward slowing the algarvian advance on cottbus the first autumn of the war yanina hadnt seemed much different from unkerlant not as far as roads went oh there was one paved highway leading east from patras but leudast hadnt been on it very long everywhere else the rules he knew held good paved streets in cities dirt in villages and out in the countryside in algarve things were different every road was topped with cobbles or slates or concrete every single one so far as leudast could see powers above sir he said to captain drogden how much does it cost to pave over a whole cursed kingdom i dont know drogden answered a lot im sure of that aye leudast clicked his tongue between his teeth i always knew the redheads were richer than we are they have a lot more crystals than we do their soldiers eat better food and more of it they use supply caravans that put anything weve got to shame but seeing their kingdom he shook his head i didnt know they were that much richer than we are it doesnt matter drogden said it doesnt fornicating matter the whoresons arent in unkerlant any more trying to take away what little weve got now were hereand by the time were through with them they wont be so fornicating rich any more most of emll be too dead to be rich suits me sir leudast said suits me fine i just dont want to end up dead with em they pushed us back till they could see cottbus ive come this far i want to see trapani so do i drogden said bastards fight for every village like it was trapani too he spat they havent got enough men left to stop us though leudast nodded some of that last batch of captives we took look like they were too old to fight in the last war let alone this one some of em wont be ready to fight till the next one either drogden spat again little buggers like that are dangerous too its like a game to them not anything real you and me were afraid to die those kids they dont think they can theyll do crazy things on account of it theyre algarvians leudast said that means theyre all dangerous as far as im concerned something to thatsomething but not everything drogden answered the women now mezentios whoresons had fun with our girls when they came into unkerlant now its our turn redhaired pussys as good as any other kind i expect it would be leudast agreed drogden sounded as if he was speaking from experience no one among the unkerlanters commanders would say a word if their soldiers and officers raped their way through algarve leudast hadnt indulged himself yet he didnt know whether he would or not go without long enough and you didnt much care how you got it theyre all sluts anywayalgarvian women i mean drogden said they deserve itand theyre going to get it too a lot of em are running away from us as fast as they can go for fear of what well do to them leudast said thats fine i dont mind a bit drogden had a nasty chuckle when he chose to use it the more they clog their nice paved roads for their own soldiers the more trouble they end up in and when our dragons fly over dont they have fun dont they just now leudast spoke with the same savage enthusiasm as his regiment commander the redheads would do that to our peasants and townsfolk when they jumped on our back nice to let em know what it feels like funny he thought i dont mind seeing algarvians torn to pieces by sorcerous energy from our eggs or flamed into charcoal by our dragons i dont mind that at all except for the stink of the burnt meat so why am i squeamish about throwing a woman down and stabbing her between her legs with my lance before he could dwell on that eggs burst close enough to make him flatten out on the ground like a snake they do keep trying to hit back drogden said well theyll pay for it theyll pay for everything he was soon proved right the unkerlanters had many more eggtossers up near the fighting front than the algarvians did and soon pounded the redheads into silence again the push into western algarve went ontill the redheads made a stand in a town called ozieri instead of swarming into the town and fighting house to house as they would have done earlier in the war the unkerlanters swept around ita lesson they had learned from their algarvian foes once mezentios men inside ozieri were cut off from help the unkerlanters could pound them and their strongpoint to bits at leisure and at minimum expense that didnt bring out the algarvian defenders theyd learned their lessons in the long bitter war too their soldiers dug in among the ruins sooner or later they would make the unkerlanters pay the price for winkling them out sooner or later well throw secondline soldiers at them leudast thought losing those fellows wont matter so muchand well get rid of the algarvians sometimes the game had steps almost as formal as a dance but the algarvian civilians in ozieri didnt understand how the game was played theyd never expected to have to learn theyd left that lesson for the people of all the kingdoms bordering their own when eggs started bursting among the homes and shops theyd cherished for generations many of them didnt know enough to go down to their cellars and try to wait out the attack those people grabbed whatever they could and fled east with it in their arms or on their backs what they didnt realize was that it was too late for such flight by the time the eggs started falling heavily the unkerlanters had already surrounded ozieri civilians fleeing the place found themselves in just as much danger as soldiers would haveif anything in more because they couldnt blaze back and didnt know how to take cover leudast blazed an old man with a duffel bag slung over one bent shoulder he wasnt happy about doing it but he didnt hesitate for all he knew the old algarvian was one of the soldiers recently dragooned into the army and the canvas sack was full of those nasty little throwable eggs the redheads had got so much use from the past few months somebody blazed at him a moment later from the direction from which the old man had come he rolled behind a hedge wishing the algarvians hadnt manicured their landscapes so neatly a shriek from that same direction a moment later argued that some other unkerlanter had taken care of the redhead with the stick another shriek came from behind leudast this one was torn from a womans throat by the way it went on and by the laughs that accompanied it he didnt think shed been wounded by an egg or a stick sure enough when he went back to check he found three men holding her down and a fourth his tunic hiked up pumping away on top of her the soldier grunted shuddered and pulled out one of his pals took his place hello lieutenant said the fellow on her right leg you want a turn shes lively shes noisy is what she is leudast answered sorry sir said the fellow who had her arms she bites whenever you put a hand over her mouth we dont want to get rid of her till weve all had a go shut her up leudast said shes liable to bring redheads down on you and you arent exactly ready to fight that got the soldiers attention a rough gag didnt stop the womans screams but did muffle them the man who was riding her drove deep then sat back on his haunches with a satisfied smirk on his face you going to take her lieutenant asked the soldier who had her arms otherwise its my turn there she lay nakedor naked enoughand spreadeagled would it make any difference to her if five men had her or only four do i care leudast wondered shes only an algarvian aye ill do it he said and bent between her thighs it didnt take long he hadnt thought it would and what had her brothers or husbandmaybe even her son he thought she was close to fortydone in unkerlant nothing good he was sure of that he didnt feel particularly proud of himself afterwards not as if hed take a step toward overthrowing mezentio but he wasnt sorry either just one of those things he thought behemoths the shout from ahead came in unkerlanter so leudast supposed the algarvians east of ozieri had mustered a counterattack they kept striking back whenever they could even with the odds dreadfully against them here if they could fight their way into the town they might bring some soldiers out with them and that might help them make a stand somewhere else as always the algarvians fought bravely their footsoldiers knew how to use behemoths to the best advantage with skill and bravado they pushed the unkerlanters back about half a mile but skill and bravado went only so far against dragons and many more behemoths and many more men the counterattack faltered short of its goal sullenly the algarvians drew back leudast waited for captain drogden to order the regiment forward again that was drogdens way to hit the redheads hard when they werent ready for it but no orders came wheres the captain leudast asked an unkerlanter pointed over his shoulder last i saw him he was going off behind that fancy house there he had a redhead with him the soldiers hands shaped curves in the air leudast went after drogden without hesitation fun was one thing fun at the expense of the fight something else captain he called as he went around the house which was indeed a great deal fancier than any hed seen in his own village you there captain amidst the yellowish brown of dead grass rockgray stood out there lay drogden his tunic hiked up to his waistand a knife deep in his back there was no sign of the woman hed had with him or of his stick leudast scrambled away in a hurryshe might be lying in wait ready to blaze whoever came after drogden but no beam bit or charred grass near leudast still he shook his head in blank dismay drogden was a careful fellow he thought but this once he wasnt careful enough he shivered it could have been me skarnu found himself restless and discontented in priekule hed thought that when he came back after the algarvians abandoned his beloved city he would simply resume the life hed led before the derlavaian war called him into king gainibus service but going to one feast after another palled fast he didnt mind drinking a bit but getting drunk night after night seemed a lot less enjoyable a lot less amusing than it had in peacetime and of course hed gone to those feasts not least looking for some pretty girl or another with whom he might spend the rest of the night plenty of pretty girls still came to those affairs several all but threw themselves at him almost all women with reputations for having slept with one algarvian or another during the occupation maybe they think theyll look better by going to bed with me he thought or maybe they just want to make sure theyve taken care of both sides these days though skarnu wasnt looking for a pretty girl hed found one and one with a temper a good deal sharper than his own thank you my dear he told one noblewoman whose offer had left nothing to the imagination but its about even money whether merkela would blaze you or me first if i did that her laughter was like tinkling bells youre joking she said before skarnu could even shake his head she read his eyes youre not joking in the slightest how very barbaric of your friend my fiancée skarnu corrected her shes a widow the algarvians executed her husband she hasnt got much of a sense of humor about these things the noblewoman didnt lose her bright smile but she didnt hang around long either a mug of ale in her hand merkela came up to skarnu a moment later what was that all about she asked a certain hard suspicion in her voice about what youd expect he put his arm around her i know who im going home with tonight though and i know why youd better merkela said i know that too skarnu chuckled i told skirgaila youd come after heror maybe mewith a stick if she didnt leave well enough alone she didnt believe me then she did and turned green i ought to give her something to remember me by now merkela said with the same directness shed used while hunting redheads before she could advance on skirgaila viscount valnu came up the usual mocking smile on his bony handsome face ah the happy couple he said and contrived to make it sound almost like an insult hullo valnu skarnu said valnu didnt seem to mind the endless rounds of feasts but then hed been coming to them all through the algarvian occupation too aye hed been in the underground still skarnu was sure he hadnt let that keep him from having a good time his arrival distracted merkela she didnt know what to make of valnu but then a lot of people dont know what to make of valnu skarnu thought skirgaila meanwhile had practically painted herself to the chest of another nobleman who hadnt collaborated with the algarvians skarnu nodded to himself she wants to repair one sort of reputation sure enough and she doesnt care about the other sort with peasant bluntness merkela demanded are you really father to the child krastas carrying valnus blue blue eyes widened am i milady i dont know i havent looked inside there to tell that was bluntness of a sort merkela wasnt used to she flushed chuckling valnu went on could i be that father though without a doubt i could be he fluttered his eyelashes at skarnu and now ill have the poor girls outraged brother coming after me with a club youre impossible skarnu said at which valnu bowed in delight even merkela snorted at that with a sigh skarnu went on i hope you are all things considered id not have the family dragged through too much dirt youre no fun at all valnu said i know what your problem is though i know just the disease youve caught tell me skarnu said raising an eyebrow what sort of slander will you come up with if its vile enough ill haul you before the king its pretty vile all right valnu said you poor fellow youve caught responsibility its very dangerous unless you treat it promptly i came down with it myself for a while but i seem to have thrown it off i believe that skarnu said but he couldnt stay too annoyed with valnu no matter how much fun the viscount had had here in priekule during the occupation hed played a hard and dangerous game had the algarvians realized he was anything more than a vacuous goodtime boy he would have suffered the same nasty fate as had so many menand womenfrom the underground no sooner had that thought crossed skarnus mind than valnu said you know its possible youre being too hard on your poor sister and its possible were not too merkela snapped before skarnu could answer that cursed redhead was hard whenever he was alone with her wasnt he lurcanio no doubt he was valnu replied the bow he gave merkela was distinctly mocking and youre learning cattiness fast youll make a splendid noblewoman no doubt about it he grinned she spluttered he went on but i still mean what i said krasta held my life in the hollow of her hand she knew what i was knew without the tiniest fragment of doubt after the late unlamented count amatu met his untimely demise after dining at her mansion yet even if she did know neither lurcanio nor any of the other redheads learned of it from her more she helped make them believe i was harmless so i beg both of you do have such patience with her as you can he sounded unwontedly serious merkelas eyes blazed getting her to change her mind once shed made it up was always hard skarnu said we have a while to think about it her babys not due for another couple of months if it looks like you it will be the handsomestor loveliest dependingchild ever born valnu broke in if its a little sandyhaired bastard though merkelas voice was as cold as the winter winds that blew up from the land of the ice people even then valnu said theres a difference between going to bed with someone for love and doing it from expediency shall we say by his tone he was intimately acquainted with every inch of that debatable ground but he didnt persuade merkela i know how far i will go she said i know how far everybody else will go too she didnt quite turn her back on valnu but she might as well have and skarnu thought she was likely to be right in a newly freed valmiera where everyone was doing his best to pretend no one had ever collaborated with mezentios men bearing a halfalgarvian child would not be tolerated the only reason bauska had had as little trouble over brindza as shed had was that her bastard daughter seldom left the mansion a servant and her child could hope to remain obscure a marchioness skarnu doubted it a pity valnu murmured how much pity did the algarvians ever show us merkela said how much did they show anyone of kaunian blood did you ever meet any of the kaunians from forthweg who got away from them you wouldnt talk of pity if you had valnu sighed there is some truth in what you say milady some i have never denied it whether there is quite so much as you think merkela took a deep angry breath skarnu didnt want to see a quarrelno more likely a brawlerupt maybe that was the disease of responsibility as valnu had said whatever it was he had to move quicklyand delicately calming merkela when her temper was high had the same potential for disaster as trying to keep an egg from bursting after its first spell somehow failed mistakes could have spectacularly disastrous consequences here though he thought he had the answer he said shall we set our wedding day for about the time when krastas baby is due whatever happens then well upstage her that distracted merkela as hed hoped she nodded and said aye why not but she wasnt completely distracted for she added it will also help quiet the scandal if she does have a little redheaded bastard maybe some said skarnu whod hoped she wouldnt think of that merkelas frown was thoughtful now not angryor not so angry as far as krastas concerned we shouldnt muffle the scandal we should shout it as far as youre concerned though as far as the whole family is concerned skarnu broke in whoever that babys father is its first cousin to little gedominu you know his fiancée plainly hadnt thought of that neither had skarnu till this moment theyll have to live with it all their lives wont they merkela murmured skarnu nodded a bit later and more than a bit reluctantly so did she all right let it be as you say do invite me valnu cooed after all i may be an uncle merkela hadnt thought of that either skarnu said we wouldnt think of doing anything else well need someone to pinch the bridesmaidsand maybe the groomsmen too you flatter me outrageously valnu said and then pouring oil on the fire he asked and will you invite the aunt too skarnu wanted to hit him with something but merkela merely sounded matteroffact as she answered she wouldnt come anyhow im only a peasant i dont belong i could be a traitor so long as i had blue blood that wouldnt matter but a farm girl in the family is the best thing that ever happened to me skarnu slipped his arm around her waist valnu said nobles wouldnt be nobles if we didnt fret about such things it could be worse though it could be jelgava jelgavan nobles make ours look like shopkeepers the way they go on about the glory and purity of their blood with a certain venomous satisfaction merkela said it didnt keep their noblewomen from lying down for the redheads did it well no valnu wagged a finger at her youre almost as radical as an unkerknter arent you when swemmels nobles turned out not to like him he just went and killed most of them and the unkerlanters threw algarve back merkela replied what do you suppose that says your excellency she used the title with sardonic relish valnu for once had no comeback ready five when people spoke of walking on eggs they commonly meant the kind hens or ducks or geese laid these days fernao felt as if he were walking on the sort eggtossers flung and dragons dropped anything he said anything he did might lead to spectacular disaster with the woman he loved and even if i dont do anything i can be in trouble he thought if he left pekka alone she was liable to decide he was cold and standoffish if he pursued her she might decide he didnt care about anything but getting between her legs when word first came back that leino had died hed wondered if he really ought to be sorry after all her husband his own rival was gone now didnt that leave pekka all to him maybe it did on the other hand maybe it didnt he hadnt realized how guilty she would feel because shed been in his chamber because theyd just finished making love when she got summoned to learn of leinos death if shed been somewhere else if shed never touched him at all that wouldnt have changed a thing up in jelgava rationally logically anyone could see as much but how much had logic ever had to do with what went on in peoples hearts not much and fernao knew it in the cramped hostel he couldnt have avoided pekka even had he wanted to everyone gathered in the refectory he felt eyes on him whenever he went in there powers above be praised that ilmarinens in jelgava went through his mind onceactually rather more than once if anybody could be relied upon to start bursting the eggs under ones metaphorical feet umarinen was the man pekka didnt automatically come sit by him as she had before the algarvians killed leino but she didnt go out of her way to avoid him either which was some solace if not much one evening about a month after the news got back to the naantali district she did sit down next to him hello he said carefully how are you ive been better pekka answered to which he could only nod when a serving girl came up and asked her what she wanted she ordered a reindeer cutlet parsnips in a reindeermilk cheese sauce and a lingonberry tart the girl nodded and briskly walked away toward the kitchen as if the request were the most ordinary thing in the world fernao couldnt take it in stride to a lagoan especially to a lagoan from sophisticated setubal it seemed a cliché come to life he didnt smile the way he wanted to but he did say how very kuusaman so it is pekka answered so i am the implication was what are you going to do about it i know fernao said gently i like what you are i have for quite a while now you know pekka tossed her head like a unicorn bedeviled by gnats this isnt the best time you know she said im not going to push myself on you he said and paused while his serving girl set his supper before him mutton and peas and carrots a meal he could easily have eaten back in lagoas he sipped from the mug of ale that went with it then added i think we do need to talk though do you pekka said bleakly fernao nodded his ponytail brushed the back of his neck we ought to think about where were going or if were going anywhere pekka said or if were going anywhere fernao agreed doing his best to keep his voice steady we probably wont decide anything not so it stays decided but we should talk come back to my room with me after supper please the glance she turned on him was half alarm half rueful amusement every time you ask me to go to your room with you something dreadful happens i wouldnt call it that fernao said the first time hed asked her to his chamber it had been to put rumors to rest he hadnt intended to make love with her or he was sure she with him theyd surprised each other pekka had dismayed herself and spent months afterwards doing her best to pretend it hadnt happened or at most to make it into a onetime accident i know you wouldnt she said now that doesnt necessarily mean youre right it doesnt necessarily mean im wrong either fernao answered please he didnt want to sound as if he were begging that didnt necessarily mean he wasnt though before pekka said anything her supper arrived then she sent the serving girl back for a mug of ale like his only after shed drunk from it did she nod all right fernao youre right i suppose we should talk but i dont know how much there is for us to say to each other wed better find out then he said hoping neither his voice nor his face gave away the raw fear he felt pekka nodded as if she saw nothing wrong so perhaps they didnt fernao wanted to shovel food into his mouth to be able to leave the refectory as soon as he could pekka took her time she seemed to fernao to be deliberately dawdling but he doubted she was he was nervous enough to feel as if time were crawling on hands and kneesand that quite without sorcerous intervention but at last pekka set down her empty mug and got up lets go she said as if they were heading into battle fernao hoped it wouldnt be anything so grim but had to admit to himself that he wasnt sure he opened the door to his room stood aside to let her go in ahead of him then shut the door again and barred it pekka raised an eyebrow but didnt say anything she sat on the chambers one chair fernao limped over to the bed and eased himself down onto it he leaned his cane against the mattress his face must have shown the pain he always felt going from standing to sitting or the other way round for pekka asked hows your leg about the same as usual he answered the healers are a little surprised its done as well as it has but they dont expect it to get any better than this i can use it and it hurts he shrugged better than getting killed he almost said but thought better of that before the words passed his lips im glad its no worse pekka said you did look like it was bothering you she fidgeted something hed rarely seen her do this isnt easy for her either fernao reminded himself she took a deep breath go on then say your say thank you fernao found he needed a deep breath too i dont know what you would have donewhat we would have doneif your husband had lived pekka nodded shakily i dont either she said but things are different now you must see that i do fernao agreed but theres one thing that hasnt changed and you need to know it i still love you and ill still do anything i can for you and i still want us to stay together for as long as you can put up with me and leino is dead and that might make things easier before he died i never thought it might make things harder i do know that pekka said and then im not sure you understand everything that goes with it you want us to stay together aye how do you feel about raising up another mans son in truth fernao hadnt thought much about uto up till now a confirmed bachelor he had a way of thinking about children in the abstract when he thought about them at allwhich wasnt that often but uto was no abstraction not to pekka he was flesh of her flesh probably the most important thing in the world to her right now more important than i am fernao asked himself the answer formed in his mind almost as fast as the question hes much more important than you are and youd better remember it i dont know that much about children fernao said slowly but id do my best i dont know what else to tell you she studied him then nodded again this time in measured approval one of the things you might have told me was that you didnt want to have anything to do with my son thats what a lot of men tell women with children fernao shrugged more than a little uncomfortably he understood that point of view he would have taken it himself with a lot of women with pekka if he wanted to stay with her he had to take everything that was part of her and in musing tones he said if we had a baby i wonder what it would look like pekka blinked her voice very low she answered ive wondered the same thing a few times i didnt know you had sometimes a woman thinks a man only cares about getting her into bed not about what might happen afterwards sometimes that is all a man cares about remembering some of the things that had happened in his own past fernao didnt see how he could deny it but he went on sometimes but not always i see that pekka said thank you its a compliment i suppose it gives me more to think about i love you youd better think about that too fernao said i know i do think about it pekka answered i have to think about all the things it means i have to think about all the things it might not mean too youve helped clear up some of that good fernao said you dont say you love me he thought i can see why you dont but oh i wish you would what pekka did say was youre a brave manpowers above know thats true and youre a solid mage better than a solid mage in fact ive seen that working with you there are times i think i never should have gone to bed with you in the first place but you always made me happy when i did we aim to please fernao said with a crooked smile you aim well pekka said does all that add up to love it might i thought it did before before leino died and i didnt know what i was going to do but thats turned everything upside down i know fernao kept the smile on his face it wasnt easy i dont know what im going to do pekka smiled too ruefully usually the busier i am the happier i am when im doing things i havent got time to think and i dont much want to think right now that makes sense fernao agreed he heaved himself to his feet without using the cane that hurt but he managed he managed the couple of steps he needed to get over to the chair too getting down beside it hurt more than standing up had but he ignored the pain with the practice of a man whod known much worse but theres happy and then theres happy if you know what i mean to make sure she knew what he meant he kissed her it was he knew a gamble if pekka wasnt ready or if she thought he cared about nothing but bedding her he wouldnt do himself any good at first she just let the kiss happen without really responding to it but then with what sounded like a small surprised noise down deep in her throat she kissed him too when their lips separatedfernao didnt push the kiss as far as he might have as far as he wanted topekka said you dont make things easy do you i try not to fernao answered youve succeeded and id better go pekka rose then stooped to help fernao up and gave him his cane he wasnt embarrassed for the aid he needed it even as pekka unbarred the door and left fernao nodded to himself with more hope than hed known for some little while what sort of delegation hajjaj asked thinking hed misheard his ears werent all theyd once been and he was unhappily aware of it but qutuz repeated himself a delegation from the kaunian refugees from forthweg who have settled around najran your excellency three of them are out in the corridor will you receive them or shall i send them away ill talk with them the zuwayzi foreign minister said i have no idea how much ill be able to do for themi cant do much for zuwayzin these daysbut ill talk with them very well your excellency qutuz made an excellent secretary he gave no sign of his own approval or disapproval he got his masters instructions and acted on themin this case by going out into the corridor and bringing the kaunians back into the office with him good day gentlemen hajjaj said in classical kaunian when they came in he read the language of scholarship and sorcery as readily as zuwayzi but was less fluent speaking it good day your excellency the blonds chorused bowing low they all wore tunics and trousers for men with their pale easily sunburned skins nudity was not an option in zuwayza even during her relatively mild winter two of you i have met before hajjaj said nemunas vitols he nodded to each of them in turn nemunas was older than vitols and had a scarred left hand before forthweg fell to the algarvians theyd both been sergeants in king pendas armyunusually high rank for kaunianswhich made them leaders among the blonds whod fled across the bay of ajlun to keep from ending up in one of king mezentios special camps the third blond the one hajjaj didnt know bowed again and said i am called kaudavas your excellency i am glad to meet you hajjaj said as long as he stuck to stock phrases he was fine both nemunas and vitols stared at him its been a while since weve seen each other your excellency the older blond said thanks very much for recalling our names you are welcome hajjaj repliedanother stock phrase a good memory for names and faces came in handy for a diplomat when he went beyond stock phrases he had to think about what he said and speak slowly and you and your countrymen are welcome in my kingdom and all three of you are welcome here would you care for tea and wine and cakes all three kaunians from forthweg chuckled wed sooner just get down to business sir if you dont mind nemunas said hajjaj allowed himself a small smile the blonds had learned how some zuwayzi customs worked sure enough as you wish he said and waved to the pillows piled here and there on the carpeted floor sit down make yourselves comfortable and then please tell me what i can do for you his guests had got used to making do with pillows instead of chairs and couches too they all made nests for themselves nemunas who seemed to be their spokesman said sir you know weve been sailing east out of najran back to forthweg to hit the cursed redheads a lick or two officially i do not know this hajjaj replied had i known it officially he wondered if hed correctly used the subjunctive therezuwayzas former allies the algarvians you mentioned would not have been pleased with me kaudavas said we never did understand how anyone could ally with mezentios whoresons if you dont mind my saying so he was stamped from the same mold as his comrades if anything he was bigger and burlier than either of them burly enough to make hajjaj wonder if he had a little forthwegian blood considering what the algarvians did to you i know why you say that hajjaj replied still we had our reasons now weve had something to do with the unkerlanter navy men at najran vitols said maybe we can figure out what some of those reasons are ah hajjaj leaned forward dealing with unkerlanters is often less than enjoyable does this have to do with your reasons for coming to bishah to see me aye the kaunians said as one loudly and angrily enough to make qutuz look in to see that the foreign minister was all right hajjaj waved him back nemunas went on the thing of it is we want to keep right on sailing back to forthweg swemmels men havent driven the redheads out of all of it yet we can do some good there and besides we want revenge kaudavas added indeed hajjaj said rest assured i do understand this among the zuwayzin vengeance was a dish to be savored no other derlavaian folk thought of it in such artistic terms though the algarvians came close vitols said but the unkerlanter navy men wont let us go out they say theyll sink us if we try and they mean it curse em can you do something about that sir nemunas asked thats why we came here to find out if you could i see i do not know hajjaj made a sour face najran was a zuwayzi port not one that belonged to king swemmel for the zuwayzin not to be in full control of what happened there was galling but zuwayza these days kept only such sovereignty as unkerlant chose to yield to her hajjaj drummed his fingers on his knee let me ask a question are you loyal to this new king this king beornwulf the unkerlanters have named forthweg these days kept even less sovereignty than zuwayza did in almost perfect unison the kaunians from forthweg shrugged dont care about him one way or the other nemunas answered hes just a forthwegian vitols agreed this time hajjaj hid his smile the blonds might be a persecuted minority but they kept a haughty pride of their own he said let me ask it a different way would you swear loyalty to king beornwulf if that let you be loosed against the algarvians still in forthweg nemunas vitols and kaudavas looked at one another they all shrugged again more raggedly than before why not nemunas said at last when the wars finally over well be living under him if we go back to forthweg he cant be much worse than that vain fool of a penda kaudavas added his opinion of the former king of forthweg closely matched hajjajs the foreign minister also noted that some kaunian refugees looked to be thinking about staying in zuwayza after the six years war the kingdom had taken in some algarvian refugees the blonds might also fit in none of that though had anything to do with the business at hand i shall speak to minister ansovald for you hajjaj promised i do not know what he will say but i shall speak to him the blonds were effusive in their thanks they bowed themselves almost double as they left hajjajs office no matter how much gratitude they showed though they had no idea of the size of the favor hajjaj was doing for them qutuz did im sorry your excellency he said so am i hajjaj answered bleakly some things cant be helped though but he couldnt stay that calm however much he tried every time i talk to the unkerlanter barbarian i want to go take a bath right afterwards and he has the whip hand now powers below eat him ansovald didnt deign to grant him an audience for three days the unkerlanter minister no doubt thought he was humiliating and angering hajjaj hajjaj however was just as well pleased with delay here at last though he had to don an unkerlanterstyle tunic and travel over to the ministry he alighted from his carriage with a sigh the unkerlanter sentries looked through him as if he didnt exist by all the signs ansovald would also have loved to pretend hajjaj didnt exist he and the zuwayzi foreign minister had never got on well these days ansovalda tough beefy man with a permanent sour expressionnot only had the whip hand he enjoyed using it well what now he demanded in algarvian when hajjaj came before him i have a petition to present to you the zuwayzi foreign minister replied also in algarvian it was the only language they shared using it with the unkerlanter had an ironic tang that usually appealed to hajjaj today though he wondered at the omen go ahead ansovald rumbled and fiddled with a fingernail as if more interested in that than in anything hajjaj was likely to say no doubt he is hajjaj thought unhappily nevertheless he went on with the request the kaunians from forthweg had made ansovald did start to listen to him he gave the unkerlanter minister to zuwayza that much and when he finished ansovald wasted no time coming to a decision he looked hajjaj straight in the eye and said no hajjaj hadnt really expected anything else ansovald was here not least to thwart zuwayza but he asked why not your excellency surely you cannot believe these kaunians would prefer king mezentio to king swemmel why not loose them against the enemy you both hate i dont have to tell you a cursed thing ansovald answered hajjaj just inclined his head and waited ansovald glared at him at last patience won what angeror anger openly revealed at leastwouldnt have all right all right the unkerlanter minister said ill tell you why curse it thank you hajjaj said and wondered whether he was more pained to say those words or ansovald to hear them ansovald might have bitten into a lemon as he went on because these kaunians are a pack of cursed troublemakers thats why dont you want mezentios men to have trouble hajjaj asked theyve got trouble were giving it to them ansovalds glare settled on the zuwayzi foreign minister if we werent i wouldnt be here yattering with you would i hajjaj spread his hands yielding the point ansovald bulled ahead but that isnt the kind of troublemakers i meant aye theyd give the redheads a hard time as long as there are any redheads left in forthweg there wont be though not for very much longer and after thattroublemakers make trouble you know what i mean pretty soon theyd start giving us trouble just on account of we were there why let em youve got yourself some blonds and youre welcome to them my orders on this one come from cottbus and cottbus knows what its talking about hajjaj considered ansovalds words did have a certain ruthless logic behind themthe sort king swemmel came up with on one of his good days troublemakers were fond of making trouble and against whom didnt always matter hajjaj had told the blonds he would try and hed tried let it be as you say he murmured of course itll be as i say ansovald answered smugly he thrust a thick finger out at hajjaj now as long as youre herewhen are you going to give this tassi bitch back to iskakis good day your excellency hajjaj said with dignity and rose to leave you may have a good deal to say about what goes on in my kingdom but not powers above be praised in my household but as he walked away he hoped that wasnt more wishful thinking with nothing to do but lie on his back and eat and drink bembo should have been a happy man the constable had often aspired to such laziness as an ideal though a friendly woman or two had also played a part in his daydreams a broken leg most emphatically had not it got me back to tricarico he thought oraste was rightif id stayed in eoforwic if id stayed anywhere in fornicating forthweg id probably be dead now none of the news coming out of the west was good even if the local news sheets did try to make it as palatable as they could what oraste hadnt thought about was that even back in his own home town in northeastern algarve bembo still might get killed kuusaman and lagoan dragons flew over the bradano mountains every nightand sometimes during the dayto drop their eggs on tricarico bembo wondered how long it would be before enemy soldiers started coming over the mountains too however long it is i cant do anything about it he muttered his leg remained splinted it still hurt it also itched maddeningly under the boards and bandages where he couldnt scratch a nurse came down the neat row of cots in the ward the sanatorium was crowded not just with men wounded in combat but with all the civilians hurt by falling eggs bembo had hoped to be something of a hero when he got back to tricarico hardly anyone seemed to care or even to notice how are we today the nurse asked when she got to his cot im fine bembo whipped his head around as if to see if he were sharing the bed with other men he didnt know about dont see anyone else though he got a dutiful smile from the nurse she looked tired everyone in tricarico or at least in the sanatorium looked beat these days she set a hand on his forehead no fever she said and scribbled something on the leaf of paper in her clipboard thats a good sign how are you sweetheart bembo asked he felt good enough to notice she was a woman and not the homeliest one hed ever seen she was pretty in fact when she smiled which she did nowthis one had nothing of duty in it but her brightening had nothing to do with bembos charms if any i got a letter from my husband last night she answered hes in the west but hes still all right powers above be praised good bembo said more or less sincerely glad to hear it do you need to use the bedpan she asked well aye he said and she tended to it holding up the blanket on the cot as a minimal shield for his modesty she handled him with efficiency king swemmel might have envied as if his piece of meat were nothing but a piece of meat he sighed you heard stories about nurses if hed learned one thing as a constable it was that you heard all sorts of stories that werent true anything else she asked bembo shook his head she went on to the fellow in the next cot one of the stories you heard was how bad sanatorium food was that one unfortunately had turned out to be true if anything it had turned out to be an understatement what bembo got for supper was barley porridge and olives that had seen better days and wine well on the way to turning into vinegar he didnt get much either certainly not enough wine to make him happy the fellow in the cot next to his was a civilian whod got his leg broken here in tricarico at about the same time as bembo had over in eoforwic his name was tibiano by the way he talked bembo suspected hed seen the inside of a constabulary station or two in his time ill lay you three to two the fornicating islanders send dragons over again tonight he said now i wouldnt mind getting laid but not by you thanks bembo answered tibiano chuckled bembo went on i wont touch the bet either those whoresons come over just about every night isnt that the sad and sorry truth tibiano agreed who wouldve thunk it we started this war to kick everybody elses arse not to get ours kicked those other bastards deserve it what did we ever do to anybody having been in forthweg bembo knew just whator some of just what his kingdom had done he hadnt talked much about that since returning to tricarico for one thing he hadnt thought anybody would believe him for another he would just as soon have forgotten but he couldnt leave that unanswered there are some kaunians whod say weve done a thing or two to them and there would be a lot more if they were still alive blonds futter blonds tibiano said theyve always tried to keep us algarvians from being everything we ought to be theyre jealous thats what they are like i say they deserve it he spoke loudly and passionately as people do when sure theyre right several other men in the ward lifted their heads and agreed with him so did the young woman who was taking away their supper tins no one had a good word to say about any kaunians bembo didnt argue he didnt love the blonds either and the last thing he wanted was for anyone to say he did calling an algarvian a kaunianlover had always been good for starting a fight these days though calling him a kaunianlover was about the same as calling him a traitor night came early though not so early as it did farther south trapani endured hours more darkness each winter night than tricarico did and suffered because of it but what tricarico went through wasnt easy either bembo had just dropped into a fitful uncomfortable sleephe would have killed to be able to roll over onto his bellywhen alarm bells started clanging come on he shouted were all supposed to run down to the cellar curses and jeers answered him hardly any of the men in this ward could get out of their cots let alone run if an egg burst on the sanatorium then it did and that was all there was to it bembo cursed the bells hed heard them too often in eoforwic and the last time you heard them there you didnt get to a shelter or even a hole in the ground fast enough in the dark ward somebody asked where are all the fancy spells the news sheets keep promising up king mezentios arse somebody else answered bembo probably wasnt the only one trying to figure out whod said that but the dark could cover all sorts of treason at least for now the disgruntled algarvian had got away with speaking his mind eggs didnt start falling right away algarvian dowsers were good at what they did theyd probably picked up the enemy dragons motion as soon as the beasts came over the bradano mountains but how much good would that do without enough algarvian dragons to go up there and knock the kuusamans and lagoans out of the sky not much bembo thought dismally as soon as eggs did begin to drop beams from heavy sticks started probing up into the sky but the air pirates had plenty of tricks along with eggs they dropped fluttering strips of paper that drove dowsers mad how to detect the motion of dragons when all that other motion distracted them because they couldnt tell the men at the heavy sticks exactly where the enemy dragons were the beams from those sticks struck home only by luck and if an egg lands right on top of this stinking sanatorium thatll be luck too bembo thoughtbloody bad luck no one was supposed to try to drop eggs on buildings where healers worked but accidents mistakes misfortunes happened when an egg burst close enough to rattle the shutters over the windows someone in a ward down the hall started screaming his shrill cries went on and on then stopped very abruptly bembo didnt care to think about what had probably just gone on in that other ward eggs kept falling through most of the night bembo got a little fitful sleep but not much the same no doubt would be true for everybody in tricarico even people who werent hurt wouldnt be worth much in the morning could metalworkers make proper shells for eggs when they had to pry their eyelids open could mages cast the proper spells to contain the sorcerous energy in those eggs you didnt have to be swemmel of unkerlant to see how efficiency would go down one more night tibiano said when the sun crawled up over the mountains to the east aye one more night bembo agreed in tones as hollow as his wardmates he yawned till his jaw creaked a serving woman brought a cart full of trays into the room the yawn turned into a groan now we have to live through one more breakfast after breakfast a healer who looked even more exhausted than bembo felt came thought the ward he poked at bembos leg muttered a quick charm or two and nodded youll do he said before racing on to tibianos cot how many mens recoveries was he overseeing could he do any of them justice bembo was dozingif he couldnt sleep at night hed do it in the daytime when a nurse said youve got a visitor he opened his eyes he hadnt had many visitors since getting hurt and this one saffa he exclaimed hello bembo the sketch artist said i thought id come by and see how you were she didnt look good herselfnot the way bembo remembered her she was pale and sallow and seemed weary unto death i heard you had a baby bembo said only after hed spoken did he stop and think that might be part of why she looked so tired aye a little boy she answered my sister is taking care of him right now wouldnt give me a tumble he complained selfpity and selfaggrandizement were never far from the surface with him who is the papa anyway he was fighting down in the duchy of grelz last i heard from him saffa said a couple of months ago letters stopped coming that doesnt sound so good bembo said and then belatedly remembering himself im sorry so am i he was sweet for a moment saffa managed the nasty grin that had always provoked bemboone way or another she added unlike some people i could name thank you sweetheart i love you too bembo said if i could get up id give you a swat on that round fanny of yours did you come see me just so you could try and drive me crazy she shook her head coppery curls flew back and forth i came to see you because this stinking war has taken a bite out of both of us if the babys father were still around i wouldnt want anything to do with you bembo translated that without effort but it didnt mean she was wrong this stinking war has taken a bite out of the whole stinking world he hesitated when im back on my feet ill call on you all right all right saffa said ill tell you right now though i still may decide id sooner slap your face just so we understand each other bembo snorted some understanding but he was nodding saffa without vinegar wasnt saffa take care of yourself stay safe you too she said and then she was gone leaving bembo half wondering if hed dreamt her whole visit an egg flew in from the east and hit a house in the village garivalds company had just taken away from the algarvians chunks of the house flew out in all directions a spinning board knocked down an unkerlanter soldier standing only a couple of feet from garivald he started to get up then clapped a hand to the small of his back and let out a yip of pain the house fell in on itself and started to burn a forthwegian couple in the middle of the street started howling garivald presumed it was their house he couldnt make out much of what they were saying to a grelzer like him this eastforthwegian dialect made even less sense than the variety of the language people around eoforwic spoke not only were the sounds a little different a lot of the words sounded nothing at all like their unkerlanter equivalents he wondered if they were borrowed from algarvian another egg flew in this one burst farther away the crash that followed said somebodys home would never be the same shrieks rose immediately thereafter somebodys life would never be the same my life will never be the same either garivald thought powers below eat the algarvians its their fault curse them id sooner be back in zossen drinking my way through the winter and waiting for spring neither zossen nor the family hed had there existed any more he turned to lieutenant andelot sir we ought to get rid of that miserable eggtosser i know sergeant fariulf andelot answered but weve come so far so fast we cant sweep up everything as neatly as we want to on the scale of the war as a whole that tosser doesnt mean much no sir garivald agreed but its liable to take some nasty bites out of us he thought for a moment i could probably sneak my squad through the redheads lines and take it out things are all topsyturvythey wont have had the time to get proper trenches dug or anything like that what am i saying he wondered go after an eggtosser behind the enemys line have i lost all of my mind or do i really want to kill myself andelot also studied him with a certain curiosity we dont see volunteers as often as wed like he remarked aye go on sergeant choose the men youd like to have with you i think you can do it too he pointed southeastward most of the redheads in these parts are falling back on that town called gromheort theyll stand siege there unless i miss my guess and getting them out wont come easy or cheap with a shrug he went on nothing but algarve beyond though as i say pick your men sergeant lets get on with it the men garivald did pick looked imperfectly enamored of him he understood that he was giving them the chance to get killed but he had an argument they couldnt top im going along with you if i can do it you can cursed well do it with me behind his back somebody said youre too ugly for me to want to do it with you sergeant garivald laughed along with the rest of the soldiers who heard he couldnt help himself but he didnt stop picking men before they set out from the village though a couple of squadrons of dragons painted rockgray flew over the place out of the west hold up fariulf andelot said maybe theyll do our job for us they should have done it already garivald said even so he wasnt sorry to raise his hand none of the men hed chosen tried to talk him out of waiting he would have been astonished if anyone had that one algarvian tosser hadnt had many eggs to fling the distant thunder of the eggs the unkerlanter dragons dropped brought smiles to all the men in rockgray who heard it dont know whether theyll flatten that eggtosser or not a soldier said any which way though the redheads are catching it only silence followed the edge of the thunder no more eggs came down on the forthwegian village andelot beamed thats pretty efficient he said maybe well be able to get a decent nights sleep here not everybody would get a decent nights sleep andelot made sure he had plenty of sentries facing east had garivald been the algarvian commander he wouldnt have tried a night attack but the redheads were still dedicated counterpunchers hed seen that given even the slightest opening they would hit back and hit back hard crickets were chirping not far from the campfire by which garivald sat when andelot came up to him and asked got a moment fariulf aye sir garivald answered you couldnt tell a superior no he hadnt needed more than one scorching from a furious sergeant to learn that lesson forever and in truth he hadnt been doing anything more than marveling at hearing crickets in wintertime there wouldnt have been any singing down around zossen he scrambled to his feet what do you need sir walk with me andelot said and headed away from the fires and out into the darkness garivald grabbed his stick before following everything seemed quiet but you never could tell andelot only nodded if hed discovered who garivald was he wouldnt have wanted him armed so garivald reasoned at any rate his company commander nodded again once they were out of earshot of the rest of the unkerlanters sergeant you showed outstanding initiative there when you volunteered to go after the algarvian eggtosser im very pleased oh that garivald had already forgotten about it thank you sir its something we need more of andelot said its something the whole kingdom needs more of it would make us more efficient too many of us are happy doing nothing till someone gives them an order thats not so good i hadnt really thought about it sir garivald said truthfully if you didnt have to do something for yourself and if nobody was making you do it for anyone else why do it mezentios men curse them have initiative andelot said they get themselves going without officers without sergeants without anything they just see what needs doing and do it thats one of the things that makes them so much trouble we should be able to match them were beating them anyhow garivald said but we should do better andelot insisted the price were paying will cripple us for years and its something we should do for our own prides sake how does the song go he sang in a soft tenor do anything to beat them back dont hold off dont go slack something like that anyhow something like that garivald echoed raggedly he was glad the darkness hid his expression from andelot he was sure his jaw had dropped when the officer started to sing how not considering that andelot was singing one of his songs the company commander slapped him on the back so as i say sergeant thats why im so pleased anything you can do to encourage the men to show more initiative would also be very good why dont you just order them to garivalds voice trailed away he felt foolish oh cant very well do that can you no andelot chuckled initiative imposed from above isnt exactly the genuine article im afraid he headed back toward the fires so did garivald one of the nice things about being a sergeant was not having to go out and stand sentry in the middle of the night he woke the next morning before dawn with unkerlanter eggtossers thunderously pounding the algarvians farther east andelots whistle shrilled forward he shouted forward the unkerlanters went footsoldiers behemoths and dragons overhead all working together most efficiently garivald didnt worry or even stop to think that the algarvians had devised the scheme his countrymen were using it worked and worked well nothing else mattered to him artificers had laid bridges over the river that ran near gromheortnobody had bothered telling garivald its name andelot clapped his hands when he thudded across one of those bridges nothing between us and algarve now but a few miles of flat land he shouted garivald whooped that there might be some large number of redheads with sticks between him and their kingdom was true but hardly seemed to matter if king swemmels men had surged forward from the twegen and eoforwic to here in a few short weeks another surge would surely take them onto algarvian soil garivald whooped again when he saw unkerlanter behemoths on this side of the rivet footsoldiers were a lot safer when they had plenty of the big beasts along for company but then one of those behemoths crumpled as if it had charged headlong into a boulder a couple of the crewmen riding it were thrown clear its fall crushed the rest heavy stick someone close to the beast yelled blazed right through its armor maybe that was just an enemy emplacement nearby or maybe an alarmed shout rose enemy behemoths even before the first egg from the algarvian beasts tossers burst garivald was digging himself a hole in the muddy ground a footsoldier without a hole was like a turtle without a shell naked vulnerable and ever so likely to be crushed another unkerlanter behemoth went down this one from a wellaimed egg the algarvians knew what they were doing they generally did worse luck had there been more of them garivald didnt care to think about that beams from ordinary handheld sticks announced that algarvian footsoldiers were in the neighborhood too crystallomancer andelot bellowed powers below eat you wheres a crystallomancer no one answered he cursed loudly and foully the fornicating algarvians would have a crystallomancer handy before he could embroider on that theme unkerlanter dragons dove on the enemy behemoths crystallomancer or not someone back on the other side of the river knew what was going on under the cover of their aerial umbrella the men in rockgray moved forward again garivald ran past a couple of corpses in kilts and past a redhead down and moaning he blazed the algarvian to make sure the fellow wouldnt get up again then ran on but mezentios men hadnt given up a crash from behind garivald made him whirl there was the bridge on which hed crossed smashed by an egg a moment later another one went up a tall column of water rose into the air theyre using those stinking sorcerously guided eggs again somebody exclaimed they did this to us back by the twegen too and we managed fine then garivald said but that bridgehead had been well established this one was brand new could it stand against enemy counterattack hed find out vanai hadnt known peace hadnt known the absence of fear since algarvian footsoldiers and behemoths swept into swept past oyngestun now eoforwic was calm and quiet under the rule of king beornwulf and the more obvious and emphatic rule of the unkerlanters who propped him on his throne she could go out without sorcerous disguise if she wanted to some kaunians did she hadnt had the nerve to try it herself not after having had her nose rubbed in how little so many forthwegians loved the blonds who lived among them but lack of love was one thing the desire to kill her on sight was something else again for the first time in more than four years she didnt have to worry about that life could have been idyllic if the unkerlanters hadnt hijacked ealstan into their army fear for her husband swirled around her and choked her like nasty smoke its not fair she told saxburh the baby looked up at her out of big round eyeseyes that by now were almost as dark as ealstans saxburh smiled enormously showing a new front tooth now that it had come in she was happy she had no other worries vanai wished she could say the same herself not fair she whispered fiercely saxburh laughed vanai didnt in a wayin a couple of ways actuallythis was worse than worrying about her grandfather when major spinello set out to work him to death shed agonized over brivibas more from a sense of family duty than out of real affection and shed been able to do something to keep her grandfather safe even if letting spinello into her bed had been a nightmare of its own but all the love she had in the world that she didnt give to saxburh was aimed at ealstan she knew he was going into dreadful danger the unkerlanters had beaten back mezentios men more by throwing bodies at them than through clever strategy and one of the bodies was histhe only body shed ever cared about in that particular way if bedding an unkerlanter officer could have brought ealstan back to eoforwic she would have done it in a heartbeat and worried about everything else afterwards but she knew better the unkerlanters didnt care what happened to one conscripted forthwegian and for all their talk about efficiency she wouldnt have bet they could even find him once he went into the enormous manhungry monster that was their army so she had to live her life from day to day as best she could fortunately ealstan had managed to save up a good deal of silver she didnt have to rush about looking for workand who here who anywhere would take care of saxburh even if she found it one more worry though a smaller one to keep her awake at night the silver as she knew too well wouldnt last forever and what would she do when it ran out what she did after yet another night where she got less sleep than she wished she would have was take saxburh plop her into the little harness shed made so she could carry the baby and keep both hands free and go down to the market square to get enough barley and onions and olive oil and cheese and cheap wine to keep eating a while longer the market square was a more cheerful place than it had been for a long time people went about their business without constantly looking around to see where they would hide if eggs started falling or if dragons suddenly appeared overhead the algarvians had struck at eoforwic from the air a few times after losing the city but not latelyand their closest dragon farms had to be far away by now new broadsheets sprouted like mushrooms on fences and walls one showed a big cleanshaven man labeled unkerlant and a smaller bearded fellow called forthweg advancing side by side against a mangylooking dog with the face of king mezentio they both carried upraised clubs the legend under the drawing said no more bites another had a drawing of king beornwulf with the forthwegian crown on his head but wearing a uniform tunic of a cut somewhere between those of forthweg and unkerlant he had a stern expression on his face and a stick in his right hand a king who fights for his people this legend read vanai wondered what sort of king he would end up making and how much freedom from the unkerlanters hed be able to get she suspectedindeed she was all but certainshe and forthweg as a whole would find out if king penda didnt live out his life in exile if he tried coming back to his native land he wasnt likely to live long more food was in the market square and prices were lower than they had been for a couple of years vanai praised the powers above for that especially since everything had been so dear during the doomed forthwegian uprising against the redheads she even bought a bit of sausage for a treat and didnt ask what went into it saxburh fell asleep over in one corner of the square a band thumped away they had a bowl in front of them and every now and then some passerby would toss in a couple of coppers or even a small silver coin forthwegianstyle music didnt appeal to vanai the kaunians in forthweg had their own tunes much more rhythmically complex and to her ear much more interesting but the novelty of hearing any music in the market square drew her to listen for a while out here in her sorcerous disguise she wasnt just vanai she was also thelberge she thought of the forthwegian appearance she wore almost as if it were another person and thelberge she thought would have liked these musicians the drummer who also sang was particularly good he was so good in fact that she gave him a sharp look ethelhelm the prominent musician for whom ealstan had cast accounts for a while had also been a drummer and singer but shed seen ethelhelm play he had kaunian blood in him half a quarter she wasnt sure but enough to make him tall and rangy and give him a long face enough to get him in trouble with the algarvians too this fellow looked like any other forthwegian in his late twenties or early thirties she couldnt applaud when the song ended not with her hands full several people did though coins clinked in the bowl thank you kindly folks the drummer said it was plainly his band remember the more you give us the better we play his grin showed a broken front tooth he got a laugh and a few more coppers to go with it the band swung into a new tune and he was looking at her too shed got used to men looking at her both when she looked like herself and in her forthwegian disguise it was more often than not an annoyance rather than a compliment shed felt that way even before spinello did so much to sour her on the male half of the human race but the drummer wasnt looking at her as if imagining how she was made under her tunic he wore a slightly puzzled expression one that might have said havent i seen you somewhere vanai didnt think shed ever seen him before the song ended people clapped again vanai still couldnt but she did set down some groceries and drop a coin in the bowl one of the horn players lifted his instrument to his lips to start the next song but the drummer said wait a bit the trumpeter shrugged but lowered the horn once more the drummer nodded to vanai your names thelberge isnt it aye she said and then wished shed denied it too late for that though she countered as best she could i may know your name too he had to be ethelhelm in the same sort of sorcerous disguise she wore his voice was familiar even if that false face wasnt she had seen the disguise once before but hadnt noticed it till it suddenly wore off and he turned into ethelhelm on the street now he grinned again showing that tooth everybody knows guthfrith he said people have heard of me as far and wide as the west bank of the twegen river that got him another laugh from his little audience vanai smiled too the west bank of the twegen couldnt have been more than three miles away she said you play so well you could be famous all over forthweg thank you kindly he said but that sounds to me like more trouble than its worth as ethelhelm hed been famous all over forthweg before he disappeared the algarvians had squeezed him till his eyes poppedthat was what his kaunian blood had got him no doubt he spoke from bitter experience he went on im doing just fine the way i am with the redheads driven out of eoforwic he could have stopped being guthfrith and gone back to his true name or could he vanai wondered mezentios men hadnt just blackmailed him theyd started putting words in his mouth too when it was either obey or go to a special camp saying no wasnt easy still some people might reckon him a collaborator he pointed to saxburh asleep in the harness thatll be ealstans baby wont it thats right vanai answered hows he doing asked ethelhelm who was now guthfrithjust as in some ways vanai was or could become thelberge shed told the truth once without intending to she wouldnt make the same mistake twice ethelhelm didnt need to know ealstan was far away dragged off into the unkerlanter army hes fine vanai said firmly hes just fine powers above make it so powers above keep it so glad to hear it ethelhelm said and sounded as if he meant it but he and ealstan hadnt parted on the best of terms ealstan was one who thought hed gone too far down the ley line the algarvians had given him i cant trust this fellow vanai thought i dont dare a man said you going to gab all day buddy or can you play too right ethelhelms guthfrithsmile was meant to be engaging but looked a little tight he nodded to the other musicians they swung into a quickstep that had been popular since the reign of king plegmundnot the one though that was known as king plegmunds quickstep what with the algarviancreated plegmunds brigade king plegmunds quickstep seemed likely to go into eclipse for a while vanai thought it a good time for her to go into eclipse too she made her way out of the market square as she went she imagined she felt ethelhelms eyes on her back though she didnt turn around to see if he was really watching her one other thing she didnt do she didnt leave the square by the way out leading most directly to her block of flats that meant her arms were very tired by the time she got home but it also meant ethelhelm didnt find out in which direction she lived she wasnt sure that mattered she hoped it didnt but she didnt want to take chances either she ruffled saxburhs fine dark hair as she took her out of the harness no i dont want to take chances she said ive got more than just me to worry about saxburh whimpered shed emerged from her nap crabby sure enough she was wet changing her didnt take long changing her any one time didnt take long doing it half a dozen times a day and more but everythings going to be all right everything will be just fine vanai said if she said it often enough it might come true so this is algarve ceorl said as the men of plegmunds brigade trudged into a farming village he spat the city wind that blew at his back out of the west carried the spittle a long way i thought algarve was supposed to be rich this doesnt look so fornicating fancy to me it didnt look so fancy to sidroc either but he answered algarves just a place gromheorts right on our side of the border from it you can see it from there it doesnt look any different than forthweg youre a corporal now you must know everything ceorl said i know im a corporal by the powers above sidroc said ceorl made a face at him he ignored it i know this is a cursed miserable place too the part of algarve you can see from gromheort is a lot better country down here in the south the land was flat and damp sometimes marshy but some of the marshes froze in the winter unkerlanter behemoths had broken through a couple of places where the redheads hadnt thought they could go and the men of plegmunds brigade had other things to worry about too if those whoresons in this village start blazing at us on account of they think were swemmels buggers i say we treat em just like we did the yaninans who blazed sergeant werferth ceorl growled theyd already drawn a couple of blazes from panicky redheads the algarvians saw swarthy men in tunics and didnt stop to find out which swarthy men they were or whose side they were on so far the troopers of plegmunds brigade hadnt answered with massacre looks like theyre just running here sidroc said sure enough algarviansmostly women and children with a few old men fled the village on foot on horseback and in whatever carriages and wagons they could lay their hands on some of the redheads on foot carried bundles heavier than a soldiers pack others pulled light carts as if they were beasts of burden themselves still others took nothing at all with them abandoning homes without a backward glance and relying on luck to keep them fed so long as they could escape the unkerlanters were going to stand here lieutenant puliano said commanding the forthwegians with as much aplomb as if he were a marshal ill need two or three groups forwardthat house there that stand of trees and that tumbledown barn you know the drill let swemmels buggers come past you then hit em from the sides and from behind questions all right then one of the joys of being a corporal was that sidroc got told off to lead one of pulianos forward groups the one in the stand of trees dig in he told the squad he headed this would have been a lot better cover if we were here in the summertime what was that sudaku asked in algarvian the blond from the phalanx of valmiera was picking up forthwegian fast but still had only so much sidroc translated his words into algarvian sudaku nodded agreement with his shorthandled shovel ceorl dug like a mole he threw another shovelful of dirt on the mound in front of his deepening hole then said aint a futtering one of us going to be here in the summertime his algarvian was as rough and laced with obscenities as his forthwegian no we will have retreated by then sudaku said that aint what i meant you stupid fornicating kaunian ceorl said if your dick were biggermuch much biggeryou could bugger yourself sudaku replied they both spoke without heat sudaku went on digging so did ceorl who paused only to slice a thumb across his throat to show what he had meant a few eggs burst perhaps a quarter of a mile in front of the grove where sidroc and his double handful of men waited feeling for us sidroc muttered more than half to himself sure enough the bursts crept closer kicking up fountains of snow and dirt only a couple of eggs burst among the trees the rest marched into the village houses and shops crumbled into wreckage not all the algarvian civilians were likely to have got clear theyd be running around and screaming and getting in the way of the soldiers as far as sidroc was concerned that was about all civilians were good for but knocking a lot of buildings in the village to pieces wouldnt hurt the defense if anything it might help everybody in plegmunds brigade had had plenty of practice fighting in rubble heads up hissed somebody among the trees here they come sidrocs heart thuttered his mouth went dry hed been through too many battles skirmishes clashes fights it never got easier if anything it got harder every time at first he hadnt believed he could die he believed it now hed seen far too much to have any possible doubt some of the oncoming unkerlanters wore snow smocks over their rockgray tunics some didnt bother the men in white and those in unkerlanter rockgray were about equally hard to see winter hereabouts wasnt quite so harsh quite so snowy as it was farther west remember let em by like lieutenant puliano said sidroc reminded his men then we give it to em up the arse he studied the way swemmels soldiers loped forward then gave a soft grunt of satisfaction ceorl put that grunt into words they dont move like veteran troops they ought to be easy meat ayedepending on how many of em there are sidroc answered i see no behemoths sudaku remarked dont miss those fornicators sidroc said he saw none of the great armored beasts either that was another sign the unkerlanters moving on the village werent firstrate men enemy doctrine assigned help first to the soldiers most likely to succeed ahh the fools ceorl said as the enemy drew near the dicksucking virgins they arent even sending anybody in here to see if weve got any little surprises waiting his chuckle was pure evil theyll find out on toward the village trotted the unkerlanters wait sidroc said over and over just wait the men in and around the outlying house started blazing at swemmels soldiers first sidroc could hear the unkerlanters howls and curses and even make sense of a few of those oaths his men sat quietly in their holes waiting and watching they all expected the same thing and they got it the unkerlanters wheeled toward the house intent on flushing out their tormentors that that might expose their backs to another set of tormentors never seemed to cross their minds now sidroc shouted and started blazing one enemy soldier after another went down for a couple of minutes swemmels men couldnt even figure out where the beams wreaking such havoc among them were coming from sidroc laughed easy but then more unkerlanters came forward and they had some idea that danger lurked among the trees danger also lurked though by the tumbledown barn and that hadnt occurred to them the men from plegmunds brigade posted there worked the same kind of slaughter as sidrocs squad had a few minutes earlier with that the entire unkerlanter advance came unglued swemmels men had been hit from unexpected directions three times in a row when they could follow orders exactly as they got them they made fine soldiers having spent more than two years in the field against them sidroc knew exactly how good they could be but when they got surprised they sometimes panicked they did here they streamed back toward the west dragging some wounded men with them and leaving others along with the dead lying on the muddy snow sidroc let out a long sigh of relief well that wasnt so bad he said i dont think we got even a scratch here only one trouble sudaku said they will come back which means wed better move sidroc said they know where we are so theyll be sure to give this place a good pounding no sooner were the words out of his mouth than a messenger came up from lieutenant puliano ordering the squad to shift to a new position in and around another outlying house sidroc preened do i know whats what let me kiss your boots ceorl said and you can kiss my the suggestion was not one a common soldier usually made to a corporal if were both still alive tonight youre in trouble sidroc said ceorl gave him an obscene gesture too sidroc laughed and shook his head youre not worth punishing you son of a whore that would just take you away from the front and make you safer than i am i wont let you get away with it come on lets move theyd just started digging new holes when a storm of eggs fell on the grove theyd abandoned the house and barn where other squads had taken shelter also vanished in bursts of sorcerous energy sudaku spoke in his valmieranflavored algarvian now they think it will be easy it would be easyif they were fighting more unkerlanters sidroc said but the redheads are smarter than they are if the redheads are so cursed smart what are they doing with their backs to the wall here in their own kingdom and if youre so fornicating smart what are you doing here with them but in the short run on the small scale what hed said turned out to be the exact truth on came the unkerlanters once more plainly confident theyd put paid to the men whod tormented them on they cameand again got caught from the flank and rear and ignominiously fled before setting so much as a foot in the village they were supposed to take this is fun ceorl said they can keep the whoresons coming well kill em till everything turns blue a long pause followed wed better move again before they start pounding this place too sidroc thought before he could give the order though another runner from the village came up lieutenant puliano says to pull back the man said what why sidroc asked irately doesnt he think the blockheads in rockgray will fall for it again i sure do but he gives the orders and you sure dont the messenger replied since that was true sidroc had no choice but to obey when he and his menwho still hadnt lost anybody despite the slaughter theyd worked on the unkerlantersgot back into the algarvian village he burst out why are you bringing us back here we can hold em a long time aye we could hold em a long time here puliano didnt sound or look like a happy man but theyve broken through farther north and if we dont pull back a little ways theyll nip in behind us and cut us off oh sidroc said and then oh shit that was an unanswerable argument but it also had its drawbacks if the army does keep pulling back what is there left to fight for puliano just scowled by way of reply from which sidroc concluded that that had no real answer either he wished it did six drizzle on the island of obuda was as natural and unremarkable as snow in istvans home valley the sergeant stood to attention in his place in the captives camp as the kuusaman guards took the morning roll call and count he stood in the same place every day rain or shine the guards made sure they got the numbers right when anything went wrong with their count everything stoppedincluding the captives breakfaststill they straightened things out beside istvan corporal kun whispered this would go a lot smoother if the goateaters could count to twentyone without playing with themselves that made istvan laugh a guard pointed at him and shouted to be quiet in bad gyongyosian he nodded to show he was sorry then glared at kun it was just like his brief time in the village school somebody else talked out of turn and he got in trouble for it at last the slanteyes seemed satisfied istvan waited for one of them to call out to queue up for feeding the way they usually did instead though the kuusaman captain in charge of the guards said sergeant istvan corporal kun to stand out ice ran through istvan out of the corner of his eye he saw kun start but they had no choice the two of them stepped away from their comrades away from their countrymen istvan hadnt imagined how terribly lonely he could feel with so many eyes on him the captain nodded you two he said using the plural where he should have used the dual to come with me why sir istvan asked what have we done not know the kuusaman answered with a shrug you to come for interrogation he pronounced the word so badly istvan almost failed to understand it when he did he wished he hadnt gyongyosian interrogations were nasty brutal things the kuusamans were the enemy so he couldnt imagine they would play the game by gentler rules but it was their game not his under the sticks of the guards he could obey or he could die i should have let captain frigyes cut my throat after all he thought it would have been over in a hurry then and my life energy might have done something extra to the slanteyes now the stars are having their revenge on me one of the guards gestured with his stick numbly istvan started forward kun at his side kuns face was a frozen mask istvan tried to wear the same look if the kuusamans thought he was afraid it would only go worse for him and if they dont think im afraid theyre fools but he would do his best to act like a man from a warrior race as long as he could you ought to give us breakfast before you question us he told a guard as the fellow led him toward one of the gates in the stockade to shut up the guard answered outside the gate the kuusamans separated him from kun leading him towards one tent on the yellowbrown grass and kun to another istvan grimaced that made telling lies harder he ducked his way into the tent a couple of guards already stood in there the kuusamans didnt believe in taking chances one of the men whod led him out of the captives camp walked in behind him no the slanteyes didnt believe in taking chances at all a moment later he realized why the brightlooking kuusaman sitting in a folding chair waiting for him was a woman she wore spectacles amazingly like kuns it had barely occurred to him that the kuusamans had to have women among them as well as men or there wouldnt have been any more kuusamans after a while he wished there hadnt been hello you are sergeant istvan is it not so she said speaking better gyongyosian than any other slanteye hed ever heard she waited for him to nod then went on i am called lammi may the stars shine on our meeting may it be so istvan mumbled he felt confused out of his depth but hed be accursed if he would let a foreigner act more politely than he did sit down if you care to lammi said pointing to another folding chair warily istvan sat the kuusaman womanshe was he guessed somewhere around forty for she had a handful of silver threads among the midnight of her hair the first fine wrinkles around her eyeswent on you were taken before breakfast eh aye lady lammi istvan answered unconsciously giving her the title he would have given a domainholders wife back in his home valley she laughed i am no lady she said i am a forensic sorcererdo you know what that means forensic sounded as if it ought to be gyongyosianit wasnt the funny sort of noises kuusamans used for a languagebut it wasnt a word istvan had heard before he shrugged broad shoulders youre a mage thats enough to know all right she turned to one of the guards and spoke in her own language the man nodded he left the tent lammi returned to gyongyosian he is fetching you something to eat what istvan got must have come from the guards rations not the captives a big plate full of eggs and smoked salmon scrambled together with fried turnips swimming in butter off to the side he ate like a starving mountain ape kuusaman interrogations certainly didnt seem much like those his countrymen would have used while he shoveled food into his mouth lammi said what it means is after something has happened i investigate how and why it happened you can probably guess what i am here to investigate istvans stomach did a slow lurch as if he were aboard ship in a heavy sea probably he said and let it go at that the less he said the less lammi could use she gave him back a brisk nod behind the lenses of her spectacles her eyes were very sharp indeed it means one thing more sergeant if you lie i will know it you do not want that to happen please believe meyou do not another lurch istvan almost regretted the enormous breakfast he was demolishing almost but not quite hed eaten mushand thin mush at thatfor too long lammi waited for him to say something reluctantly he did i understand good the forensic mage waited till hed chased down the last bit of fried turnip and given his plate to the guard whod fetched it before beginning by asking you knew captain frigyes did you not he was my company commander istvan replied she had to have already learned that and you also knew borsos the dowser lammi asked aye istvan saidwhy not answer that i fetched and carried for him here on obuda as a matter of fact back when the war was young and i saw him again when i was fighting in unkerlant lammi nodded once more all right he never should have come to an ordinary captives camp but that was our error not yours she had a pad of paper in her lap and drummed her fingers on it tell me sergeant what do you think of what your countrymen did here it was brave they were warriors they died like warriors istvan answered lammi sat there looking at himlooking through himwith those sharp sharp eyes under that gaze he felt he had to go on and he did i thought they were stupid though they could not do you enough harm to make their deaths worthwhile ah lammi scribbled something in the notepad you are a man of more than a little sense i see is that why you did not offer your throat to the knife istvan felt the ice under his feet getting thin i was ill that night he said i was in the infirmary that night i couldnt have done anything about it even if id thought it was a good idea so you were you and corporal kun lammi said and how did the two of you manage to be so ah conveniently ill the ice crackled as if he might fall through and what was kun saying over in the other tent i had the shits istvan said maybe the raw word would keep her from digging further he should have known better he realized that even before her eyes blazed did you think i was bluffing she asked quietly an evasion is also a lie sergeant i will let you try again how did you come to have the shits she spoke the word as calmly as a soldier might have he supposed he should have guessed that too but he evaded even so it must have been something i ate lammi shook her head as if shed expected better of him he braced himself for whatever the guards would do to him he hoped it wouldnt be too bad the slanteyes really were softer than his own folk he saw lammi raise her left hand and start to twist itand then he suddenly stopped seeing everything went not black but no color at all he stopped hearing he stopped smelling and feeling and tasting as far as he could prove he stopped existing have i died he wondered if he had he knew none of the stars light or is it her wizardry thinking straight didnt come easy not when he was reduced to essential nothingness his mind began to drift whether he wanted it to or not how long before i go mad he wondered but even time had no meaning not when he couldnt gauge it after what might have been moments or years he found himself back in his body all senses intact by the way lammi eyed him it hadnt been long she said i can do worse than that do you want to see how much worse i can do i am your captive istvan tried to calm his pounding heart you will do as you do to his surprise she gave him a nod of obvious approval spoken like a warrior she said just as a gyongyosian might have she went on i have studied your people for many years i admire your courage but with war the way it is these days courage is not enough do you see that sergeant istvan shrugged its all i have left i know i am sorry lammi gestured the world disappeared for istvan once more he tried to get to his feet to spring at her but his body would not obey his will it was as if he had no body after some endless while his mind did drift free of the moorings of rationality and when he heard a voice speaking to him it might have been the voice of the stars themselves leading his spirit toward them he answered without the slightest hesitation the world returned there sat lammi looking at him with real sympathy in her dark narrow eyes realization smote it was you he exclaimed aye it was me i am sorry but i did what was needful for my kingdom she studied him so you and this kun knew ahead of time you knew and you did nothing to warn us i thought about it istvan said and the admission made lammi jerk in surprise i thought about it but no matter how stupid i thought the sacrifice was i might have been wrong and i could not bring myself to betray ekrekek arpad and gyongyos the stars would go dark for me forever lammi scribbled notes that will do for now i must compare your words to those of this other man this kun i shall have more to ask you about another time she spoke to the guards in kuusaman they took istvan back to the camp he wondered if the forensic mage would feed him so well the next time she asked him questions he hoped so marshal rathar lay in a warm soft algarvian bed in an algarvian house in the middle of an algarvian town he could have had a warm soft algarvian woman in the bed with him plenty of unkerlanter soldiers were avenging themselves indulging themselves with rape or other less brutal arrangements he understood that a lot of revenge was owed a lot would be taken but as marshal he found rape beneath his dignity and he hadnt seen a redheaded woman he really wanted either manganithat was the name of the town it lay not too far west of the scamandro river which was what the algarvians called this reach of the skamandros the scamandro flowed into the south raffali on the marshy ground between the south raffali and the north raffali lay trapani mezentios men had pushed almost as far as cottbus now king swemmels soldiers were getting close to the algarvian capital and we arent the only ones rathar thought discontentedly as he got out of the warm soft bed and went downstairs general vatran was already down there eating porridge and drinking tea as he peered at a map through spectacles that magnified his eyes be careful rathar said king mezentio is watching huh vatrans bushy white eyebrows rose what are you talking about sir rathar pointed to the far wall of the dining room where a reproduction of a portrait of mezentio hung at a distinctly cockeyed angle vatran eyed the image of the king of algarve then spat at it his spittle fell short and splatted on the floor rathar laughed saying may we get the chance to try that in person soon that would be good vatran agreed but it wont be quite so soon as wed like curse it the redheads have a pretty solid line set up on the east bank of the scamandro theyre good with river lines the buggers theyve had plenty of practice making them rathar said but weve smashed every one theyve made well smash this one too eventually eventually is right vatran said maybe its just as well they did slow us down for a while we could use a little time to let our supplies catch up with our soldiers marshal rathar grunted he knew how true that was no other army could have come so far so fast as the unkerlanters had for no other army was so good at living off the countryside but while unkerlanters could find more food than other forces and so needed to bring less with them they couldnt find eggs growing on trees or in fields they had indeed run short had the redheads had more themselves they could have put in a nasty counterattack but while they remained brave and highly professional they were far more desperately short of everythingmen behemoths dragons eggs cinnabarthan their foes and every mile king swemmels men advanced was a mile from which the algarvians could no longer draw any of those essentials but king swemmels men werent the only ones advancing in algarve these days worry in his voice rathar asked how far west have the islanders come just about all of the marquisate of rivaroli is in their hands sir vatran answered thats what the crystallomancers say the really bastardly part of it is the fornicating algarvians arent putting up much of a fight against them of course they arent whatever they have left theyre throwing it at us rathar understood why the redheads knew to the copper how much unkerlant owed them they were doing everything they could to keep unkerlant from paying but if they fight us like madmen and if they dont hardly fight kuusamo and lagoas at all vatran sounded worried too if the islanders take trapani and we dont king swemmel will boil both of us alive rathar would have argued about that if only he could since he couldnt he went back to the kitchen and got a bowl of porridge and some tea for himself too he brought them out to the dining room and ate while he like vatran studied the map his army had no bridgeheads over the scamandro a couple of crossings had been beaten back the redheads had learned too they knew how disastrous unkerlanter bridgeheads could be finishing his breakfast he walked out onto the sidewalk and looked northeast toward trapani mangani bustled with unkerlanter soldiers some of them were marching east toward the front their sergeants kept them moving in the profane way of sergeants all over derlavai others though just milled about some were walking wounded whod needed healing and werent quite ready to return to the fighting line yet some were probably evading orders to move east and some were queued up in front of a building with a chunk bitten out of its fancy facade a soldiers brothel rathar didnt know how the quartermasters had recruited the redheaded women in the brothel even the marshal of unkerlant was entitled to squeamishness about a few things a soldier came past rathar carrying something or other what have you got there rathar asked him the youngster stiffened to attention when he saw whod spoken to him he held up his prize its a lamp sir one of those sorcerous lamps the redheads use unkerlanters used them too in towns and cities by his accent though this soldier like so many of his countrymen came from a peasant village gently rathar asked what are you going to do with it well lord marshal sir im going to see if i cant take it on home with me the young man answered the light its got inside of it is an awful lot finer nor a torch nor a candle nor even an oil lantern rathar sighed a sorcerous lamp wouldnt work without a power point or a ley line close by those were dense in algarve much less so in unkerlant he started to tell the soldier as much but then checked himself what were the odds the fellow would live to go back to his village what were the odds the lamp would stay unbroken even if he did slim and slimmer no doubt about it rather reached out and clapped him on the shoulder good luck to you son thank you lord marshal beaming the soldier went on his way what will the world look like after this cursed war finally ends rathar wondered how can unkerlant take its proper place among the kingdoms of the world if so many of our people are so ignorant were like a dragon all strength and claws and fire and not a bit of brain shaking his head rathar watched a column of algarvian captives trudging gloomily off into the west some were too young to make good soldiers others too old the algarvians had all the brains in the world and if you dont believe it just ask them rathar thought one corner of his mouth quirking up in a wry smile brains werent enough all by themselves either mezentios men hadnt had quite the brawn they needed to do everything they wantedfor which the marshal gave the powers above fervent thanks almost no algarvian civilians showed themselves how many huddled in their houses and how many had fled rathar didnt know from everything hed seen the town held next to no unwounded men between the ages of fourteen and sixtyfive as for women if he were an algarvian woman he wouldnt have wanted unkerlanter soldiers to know he was around either he went back into the house he was using as a headquarters in the few minutes he was outside someone had taken down the picture of king mezentio and put up one of king swemmel rathar found his own sovereigns cold stare no more pleasant to work under than that of the king of algarve a crystallomancer came up to him and said sir the redheads have taken out a couple of important bridges with those steerable eggs of theirs those things are a stinking nuisance rathar felt like kicking someone whenever he thought of them for most of the past year mezentio had been bellowing that algarves superior sorcery would yet win the war most of the time those claims seemed nothing more than so much wind and air things like steerable eggs though made the marshal wonder what else mezentios mages might come up with and how dangerous it would prove for now he stuck to the business at hand all we can do is all we can do we need to concentrate heavy sticks around bridges and our dragons need to keep the algarvians away from them aye sir will you draft an order to that effect the crystallomancer asked pass it on orally for now ill assign it to some bright young officer as soon as i get the chance rathar replied there are other things going on right now you know the crystallomancer saluted and hurried away winter nights came early in southern algarve as they did in the south of unkerlant it was cold here too though southern unkerlant got colder rathar felt a certain gloomy pride in that unkerlants appalling fall and winter weather had played no small part in helping to hold the redheads out of cottbus the marshal had just gone up to bedagain without a redheaded girl to keep him companywhen the eastern horizon lit up the glare was so bright he wondered for a moment if the sun hadnt hurried round behind the world to rise again much sooner than it should have hed seen the night sky brightened by bursting eggs more times than he could count this wasnt like that that was a flicker a ripple of light along a whole great stretch of the horizon here all the light came from one place and it really did seem almost bright enough for a sunrise it lasted about five minutes then as abruptly as it had begun it winked out a sharp bellow of noise as of an egg bursting not far away rattled the window darkness and relative quiet returned for a moment someone dashed up the stairs and pounded on rathars door lord marshal its brigadier magneric up by the scamandro a crystallomancer said ill come rathar answered and did when he sat down before the crystal he asked the brigadier what in blazes was that just now in blazes is right sir magneric a solid officer sounded like a man shaken to the core that was a stick i guess youd call it an algarvian stick but it was to the heaviest stick a floating fortress carries as the floating fortress stick would be to a footsoldiers a superstick you might say it blazed down it blazed through every fornicating thing it could reach men behemoths fieldworksit went through them like a sword through a pat of lard it was a sword a sword of light how can you fight something like that lord marshal i dont know theres bound to be a way rathar sounded more confident than he felt then he said it stopped you know so it did sir something mustve gone wrong with it but when will it start up again and how bad will it be then i dont know rathar didnt relish admitting that but he wouldnt lie to brigadier magneric powers below eat the redheads i hope they ate a good many of them just now what i really hope is that we can beat them before they get all their fancy new magecraft working the way its supposed to what if theyd started trying to do something like this two years sooner he shivered then a new thought occurred to him a really horrible one if we ever fight another war after this will anyone at all be left alive by the time its done he had his doubts marchioness krasta got out of her pyjamas and stood naked in front of the mirror examining herself she shook her head in dismay shed always prided herself on her figure and the way men responded to it told her she had every reason to do so although she likely would have prided herself on it any which way simply because it was hers but now im built like a tuber she muttered just like a fornicating tuber she laughed though it wasnt exactly funny if not for fornicating she wouldnt have been built this way inside her belly the baby kicked she could see her skin stretch every so often a hard round protuberance would surface as it were that had to be the babys head she thought shed identified knees and elbows too looking at herself in the reflecting glass she saw something she hadnt noticed before it had to have happened in the night while she was sleepingnot that sleep came easy these days not with the baby pressing half her insides down onto the saw blade of her spine my navel she exclaimed in dismay shed always been vain about it it was small and round and neat as if someone with good taste and very nice fingers had poked one into the middle of her belly noit had been small and round and neat now now it stuck out as if it were the stem of the tuber she seemed to be turning into she poked it with her own finger while she held it it went back to the way it had been or something close to that but when she let go it popped right back out again she tried several times always with the same result bauska she shouted where in blazes are you bauska the maidservant came into the bedchamber at a run what is it milady the question had started while she was still out in the hallway when she saw krasta she let out a startled squeak milady krasta took her own nudity in stride bauska was only a servant after all how could one be embarrassed in front of ones social inferiors took you long enough to get here krasta grumbled not bothering to put an arm in front of her breasts or her bush what do you need of me milady bauska asked carefully your belly button krasta tried without any luck to poke hers back in again and make it stay once you had your little bastard did it go back to the way it was supposed to be oh bauska said aye milady it did and yours will too once you have yours and now if you will excuse me she strode out of the bedchamber by the time krasta realized shed got the glove she was already dressed she muttered something sulfurous under her breath bauska probably thought she wouldnt notice or that she would forget if she did the first had been a good bet but one the servant hadnt won the second was a miscalculation krasta had a long memory for slights she didnt indulge it on the instant it wasnt as if she wouldnt see bauska again some time soon going down to breakfast seemed more urgent now that she wasnt throwing up any more she ate like a hog not all the weight shed put on was directly connected to the baby skarnu and merkela were already sitting at the table good morning krastas brother said good morning she replied and sat down herself well away from the two of them that didnt keep merkela from sending her a look as hot and burning as a beam from a heavy stick krasta glared back cow she thought sow bitch hen amazing how many names from the farm fit the farm girl but she didnt say that merkela didnt just argue merkela was liable to come around the table and thump her nasty peasant slut breakfast proceeded in poisonous silence that was how breakfast usually proceeded when krasta and her brother and his wench sat down together at table the alternative was a screaming row and those came along every so often too the silence ended when skarnu and merkela rose after finishing ahead of krasta merkela said i dont care if that is valnus baby you were still an algarvians whore and everybody knows it even the way you talk stinks of manure krasta retorted imitating the country womans accent and well it mightits a wonder your eyes arent brown merkela started for her skarnu grabbed his fiancée enough the two of you he said too much in fact both women looked daggers at him he rolled his eyes sometimes i think the algarvians fighting unkerlant have it easier than i dothey dont get blazed at from two directions at once he managed to get merkela out of the dining room before she and krasta lobbed any more eggs at each other my mansion krasta thought furiously whats the world coming to when i cant even live at peace in my own mansion peace anywhere around krasta was contingent on people doing exactly as she said but that never occurred to her she went into priekule if she couldnt get peace and quiet at home she would go out and buy something that always made her feel better when the carriage stopped on the boulevard of horsemen to let her out she was as cheerful as anyone built like a tuber and resenting it could be some of the shops along the boulevard had new goods in them imports from lagoas and kuusamo krasta windowshopped avidly just seeing something new after the dreary sameness of the occupation was a tonic but a good many places remained closed on a couple of doors the scrawl of night and fog hadnt yet been painted over those shopkeepers would never come back from whatever the algarvians had done with them she was looking at new jackets and feeling very large indeed when someone said wasting money again are you sweetheart there stood viscount valnu his mocking grin wider than ever krasta drew herself upwhich with her bulging belly made her back ache im not wasting moneyim spending it she said with dignity theres a difference im sure there must be still grinning valnu came up leaned forward over that belly and kissed her on the cheek she was to her surprise thoroughly glad to get even that little throwaway kiss it was the first sign of affection shed had from anyone for quite a while tears stung her eyes she shook her head angry and embarrassed at showing such emotion its because youre pregnant she thought this wasnt the first time shed puddled up for no particular reason polite as a cat valnu affected not to see his voice still light and cheery he said and what have you been doing lately besides wastingexcuse me besides spendingmoney also like a cat he had claws not much krasta set a hand on her belly as a partial explanation for that but it was only a partial explanation as she knew she didnt tryit never would have occurred to her to tryto hide her bitterness i dont get invited out much anymore ah valnu nodded i am sorry about that my sweet i truly am ive done my best to get people to be reasonable but it doesnt seem to be a very reasonable time right now those tears came back to krastas dismay one of them ran down her face it certainly isnt she said just because you didnt pretend the algarvians had never come to priekule everyone who was so tiresomely virtuous during the occupationor can pretend he wasgets up on his high horse and acts like you did all sorts of dreadful things a woman with her hair just starting to grow back after a shaving walked down the other side of the street krasta did her best to convince herself she hadnt seen her i said as much to your brother and his lady friend not so long ago valnu said when was this krasta asked sharply he hadnt been by the mansion for some time where was this at some boring party or other he answered it was in fact one of the most boring parties ive ever had the bad luck to attend it was in fact one more party to which krasta hadnt been invited its not fair she wailed and really did burst into tears valnu put his arm around her there there my dear he said and kissed her again this time without a trace of the smiling malice that was usually as inseparable from him as his skin come onill buy you some ale or some brandy or whatever you like and youll feel better sniffling trying to keep from blubbering krasta doubted she would ever feel better but she let valnu lead her to a tavern a few doors down she didnt know anyone in there for which she was duly grateful she hadnt had much taste for spirits since she started carrying her child any more than shed had a taste for tea but shed been able to drink more tea lately and sure enough a brandy not only felt good going down but also put up a thin glass wall between her and some of her misery thank you she told valnu and her voice held none of the whine that so often filled it if hed shown any interest in taking her to bed just then she would have given herself to him without the slightest hesitation just from gratitude for his treating her like a human being but he didnt she looked down at her swollen front resentment returned who would want to go to bed with somebody built like a tuber you dont look happy enough yet valnu said and waved at the barmaid for another brandy for krasta and another mug of ale for himself i shouldnt krasta said but she did the glass wall got thicker that felt good she tried on a smile it fit her face surprisingly well and then when she was happier than shed been in longer than she could remember without some thought valnu threw a rock through that glass wall and effortlessly smashed it your brother threatened to send me an invitation to his wedding and he finally went and made good on the threat wedding krasta sat bolt upright even if it did hurt her back skarnu had said he would marry the peasant wench whod borne him a son but it hadnt seemed real to krasta now she couldnt avoid it when where she asked angrily he hasnt said a word to me about it at the mansion valnu answered and named the date thats when or just about when the baby will come she said in dudgeon very high indeed valnu shrugged even if it werent would you go maybe to annoy them krasta said but then she shook her head to see that nasty weed grafted on to my family tree no i wouldnt do it well then valnu said logically that made perfect sense logic though had nothing to do with anything here krasta burst into tears all over again a straining team of unicorns hauled a dead dragon down the street in front of the block of flats where talsu and his family were staying these days the dragon was painted in algarves all too familiar green red and white looking down at the great dead beast slowly sliding by talsu remarked first time weve seen those cursed colors in skrunda for a while may it be the last traku said from the next window over im just glad it came down in the middle of the market square and didnt smash any more buildings when it hit his father hawked but in the end didnt spit down on the dragon the jelgavans in the street showed less restraint small boysand some men and womenran out from the sidewalk to kick the dragon and pound on it with their fists some of them did spit not so much on the dragon as on algarve itself as the dragon went past talsu started to laugh will you look at that he said pointing will you just look at that behind the team of muscular unicorns dragging the dragon came a single donkey dragging the dead algarvian dragonflier people rushed forward to abuse his corpse too it already looked much the worse for wear talsus father said something incendiary about algarvians in general and the dragonflier in particular from the kitchen talsus mother spoke in reproving tones thats no way to talk dear im sorry laitsina traku said at once he turned to talsu and went on more quietly im sorry it didnt happen to all the fornicating buggers not just this one they bloody well deserve it he wasnt quite quiet enough traku laitsina said aye aye aye talsus father made a sour face and turned away from the window i may as well get back to work doesnt seem like im going to be allowed to do anything else around here i heard that too laitsina said indignantly if you cant say something without making the air around you smell like a latrine you really should find a better way to express yourself express myself trakus eyebrows pretty plainly said what he thought of his wifes opinion but he didnt go against it not out loud he didnt instead he sat down in front of a pair of trousers hed been working on all the pieces were cut out hed set thread along all the seams and done some small part of the sewing by hand now he muttered a charm taking advantage of the law of similarity the thread hed set out writhed as if it had suddenly come to life becoming similar to the identical thread hed already sewn by hand in the wink of an eye all the stitching on the trousers was done traku held them up and inspected them talsu nodded approval thats very nice work father not bad not bad traku looked pleased with himself he was never sorry to hear himself praised and then perhaps rashly talsu asked wasnt the spell you used the one you got from that algarvian officer its a lot easier on handwork than the ones we had before as a matter of fact it was traku paused another expressive expression on his face all right curse it the redheads are smart bastards i never said they werent it doesnt mean theyre any less bastards though no it doesnt talsu agreed traku went on with his methodical painstaking examination of the trousers at last he grudgingly nodded his satisfaction i suppose those will do having supposed he tossed the trousers at talsu they go to krogzmu the oliveoil dealer on the south side of town he paid twenty down and he still owes us twenty more dont let him keep the goods before you get the silverin coins of king donalitu mind you i wasnt born yesterday or even day before yesterday talsu neatly folded the trousers his father had thrown at him you dont have to treat me like i was three years old no eh traku chuckled since when talsu didnt dignify that with an answer after hed done such a nice job of folding them he stuck the trousers under his arm careless of the wrinkles he might causethough they were wool which didnt wrinkle easily he strode almost stormedout of the flat his father chuckled again just before he shut almost slammedthe door had that chuckle come a beat sooner he would have slammed it as things were he went downstairs and out onto the street with his nose in the air he went away from the dead dragon and dragonflier not after them he wouldnt have minded taking a kick at the algarvians corpse but he was set on getting the trousers to krogzmu getting the money and getting back to the flat as fast as he could illshow him i know what im doing he thought that something like that might have been what traku had in mind never occurred to him which was probably just as well good intentions got sidetracked as good intentions have a way of doing a column of kuusamans was tramping west through skrunda till they passed talsu like everybody else had to wait people took waiting no better than they usually did someone behind him in the crowd complained we might as well still be occupied by the algarvians nonsense somebody else said talsu thought he would tell the first speaker what a fool he was but he didnt instead he went on the algarvians never wasted our time with this nonsense thats right a woman said nothing but indignation in her voice my cat is getting hungrier every minute and here i am stuck in the road because of all these foreigners going by talsu rolled his eyes powers above he thought we dont deserve to be our own masters any more we really dont behemoths lumbered along the street their armor seemed different from any that talsu had seen on algarvian behemoths or on the few the jelgavans had put in the field but he couldnt put his finger on the difference the little swarthy soldiers on the behemoths reminded him more of the redheads than of his own folk they grinned and joked as they went forward that was obvious though he knew not a word of kuusaman they were men with their peckers up they felt like winners which went a long way toward making them into winners the jelgavan army had always gone into a fight looking over its shoulder wondering what might happen to it not what it could do to the foe at last the rear of the column went byfootsoldiers stepping carefully to avoid whatever the behemoths had left behind the jelgavans on both sides of the road whod had to wait surged forward and made their own traffic jam with a judicious elbow or two talsu got through it fairly fast he wished he could have elbowed the woman with the hungry cat but no such luck the kuusamans heading west to fight the redheads werent the only ones in town a short slanteyed fellow who looked to have drunk too much wine lurched down the street with his arm around the waist of a giggling girl who wore a barmaids lowcut tunic and tight trousers a few months before had she been giving the algarvians her favors talsu wouldnt have bet more than a copper against it in a way we are still occupied he thought oh the kuusamansand the lagoans farther southdidnt treat the people of jelgava the way the algarvians had but if they wanted somethingas that drunken trooper had wanted what the barmaid had to givethey were probably going to get it talsu sighed he didnt know what to do about that except to hope jelgava somehow could become strong enough to make foreigners take her seriously and how long will i have to wait for that he wondered can we ever do it while king donalitu sits on the throne he had his doubts a new broadsheet he passed only made those doubts worse concerning traitors its big print declared and it went on to define traitors as anyone whod had anything at all to do with the algarvians throughout the four years of occupation by what it said practically everyone in the kingdom was subject to arrest if his name happened to come to the notice of donalitus constabulary hell have to leave a few people free talsu thought otherwise who would build the dungeons hed need to hold the whole fornicating kingdom he laughed but on second thought it wasnt very funny captives could probably build as well as free men if enough guards stood over them with sticks ah good krogzmu said when talsu showed up with the trousers let me just try them on he disappeared when he came back he was beaming not only did he pay talsu the silver he owed without being asked he gave him a clay jar of olive oil to take home adding this is some of what i squeeze for my own family this is not what i sell talsus mouth watered thank you very much i know itll be good his own father did good tailoring for everyone but better than good for his own household good he might have insulted krogzmu is that all you can say good you wait here the oil dealer disappeared back into his house he returned a moment later with a chunk of bread and snatched the jar of oil out of talsus hands yanking out the stopper he poured some oil on the bread then thrust it at talsu there taste that and then you tell me if its just good you dont need to ask me twice talsu took a big bite it was either that or get olive oil smeared all over his face the next sound he made was wordless but appreciative the oil was everything he could have hoped it would be and then some sharp and fruity at the same time it made him think of men on tall ladders in the autumn plucking olives from greengrayleafed branches to fall on tarpaulins waiting below what do you say to that krogzmu demanded what do i say i say i wish youd given me more talsu told him krogzmu beamed that apparently satisfied him to talsus disappointment the praise didnt get him a second jar of that marvelous oil he headed home again he had to wait in the middle of town this time though the procession wasnt kuusaman soldiers heading west to fight king mezentios men it was hardfaced jelgavans in the uniform of king donalitus elite constabulary leading along a motley collection of captives the captives werent algarvians they were every bit as blond as the constables as blond as talsu was himself a chill ran through him maybe donalitu and his henchmen wouldnt have any trouble finding enough dungeons after all ealstan had imagined a great many ways he might return to gromheort he might have come after the war ended bringing vanai and saxburh to meet his mother and father and sister he might have come back to make sure elfryth and hestan and conberge were all right and then returned to eoforwic to bring his wife and little daughter to them he might even have come as part of a triumphant forthwegian army driving the algarvians before him coming to gromheort as part of a triumphant unkerlanter army that cared little if at all for anything forthwegian had never once crossed his mind nor had he thought the algarvians would do anything but pull out of gromheort once they faced overwhelming force that they might pull back into his home town and stand siege there no he hadnt thought of that not in his wildest nightmares but that was just what the redheads had done and theyd thrown back several unkerlanter efforts to break into gromheort by now mezentios men trapped inside the city couldnt retreat into algarve even if theyd wanted to the unkerlanter ring around gromheort was twenty miles thick maybe thirty the algarvians had only two choices they could fight till they ran out of everything or they could yield unkerlanter officers under flag of truce had already gone into gromheort twice demanding a surrender the algarvians had sent them away both times and so ealstan sprawled in a field somewhere between oyngestun and gromheort peering toward his home town gromheorts wall had been more a formality than a defense for several generations he knew that perfectly well but seeing so many chunks of the wall bitten away by bursting eggs still hurt what hurt worse was being unable to tell his comrades why it hurt for one thing they had trouble understanding him and he them forthwegian and unkerlanter were related languages but they were a long way from identical and for another they wouldnt have cared anyhow gromheort was nothing to them but one more foreign town they had to take whistles shrilled officers along the line shouted forward that word wasnt much different in unkerlanter from its forthwegian equivalent even if it had been ealstan would have been quick to figure out what it meant he didnt want to advance he wanted to go back to eoforwic to vanai and saxburh but one unkerlanter word he had learned was the one for efficiency in their own brutal way swemmels men did their best to practice what they preached hardfaced fellows with sticks in their hands waited not far behind the line any soldier who tried to retreat without orders got blazed on the spot soldiers who went forward had at least a chance of coming through alive the argument was crude but it was also logical up a sergeant screamed sergeants didnt get whistles but soldiers had to do as they said anyhow ealstan got up and trotted forward with the rest of the men in rockgray rockgray dragons swooped low overhead eggs slung under their bellies the eggs burst in front of and inside gromheort ealstan didnt know what to think about that it made him more likely to live and his kinsfolk more likely to die he wanted to give up thinking altogether behemoths that shout came in unkerlanter the word was nothing like its forthwegian equivalent which had been borrowed from algarvian ealstan had had to learn it in a hurry it meant either help is coming or were in trouble depending on who owned the behemoths being shouted about these behemoths had algarvians aboard them they were sallying from gromheort doing their best to hold the unkerlanters away from the town officers or no officers sergeants or no sergeants ealstan threw himself down on the muddy ground hed seen behemoths in the desperate fighting in and around eoforwic and had a hearty respect for what they could do most of the unkerlanters close by him dove for cover too anyone whod had more than the tiniest taste of war knew better than to stay on his feet when enemy behemoths were in the neighborhood somewhere not far away a crystallomancer shouted into his glassy sphere before long eggtossers started aiming at the algarvian beasts they did less than ealstan would have liked only a direct hit which took luck would put paid to the immense beasts in their chainmail coats but a barrage of bursting eggs did keep algarvian footsoldiers from going forward with the behemoths and that left the animals and their crews more vulnerable than they would have been otherwise ealstan swung his stick towards one of the redheads atop a behemoth a couple of hundred yards away he had to aim carefully behemoth crewmen wore armor too why not they relied on the animals to take them where they needed to go and didnt get down on the ground themselves unless something went wrong there ealstan muttered and let his finger slide into the sticks blazing hole the beam leaped forth the algarvian started to clutch at his face but crumpled with the motion half complete he never knew what hit him ealstan thought instead of celebrating he crawled toward a new hiding place if one of mezentios men had seen his beam staying where he was might get him killed more men fell from the algarvian behemoths the unkerlanter footsoldiers like ealstan had learned to pick off crewmen whenever they got the chance had algarvian footsoldiers gone forward with the beasts they could have kept swemmels soldiers too busy to let them snipe at the behemoth crews but eggs bursting all around had held back the unarmored footsoldiers sullenly the algarvian behemoths drew back toward gromheort ealstan waited for the order to pursue it didnt come the unkerlanters around him seemed content to stay where they were even if they could have gained some ground by showing initiative there were also times when the efficiency swemmels men talked so much about proved only talk night fell that didnt keep the unkerlanters from pounding gromheort with eggs or the algarvians in the town from answering back as best they could ealstan filled his mess tin with boiled barley and chunks of meat from a pot bubbling over a fire well shielded from sight by banks of dirtalgarvian snipers sometimes sneaked out after dark to pick off whomever they could spot and they were good at what they did poking one of the chunks with his spoon ealstan asked the cook what is this unicorn tonight the fellow answered not too bad not not too ealstan more or less agreed unicorn horse behemothhed eaten all sorts of things he never would have touched before the war behemoth was very tough and very gamy but when the choice lay between eating it and going hungry hard times had long since taught him that lesson he sat with his squadmates going through the stew and talking he couldnt always understand them nor they him but they and he kept repeating themselves and changing a word here a word there till they got it they didnt hold his being forthwegian against him a couple of them still seemed to think he was just an unkerlanter from a district where the dialect was very strange theyd already seen he knew enough on the battlefield not to be a danger to them as for his method of joining king swemmels army most of them had stories not a whole lot different oh aye said a fellow named curvenal who by his pimpled but almost beardless face couldnt have been much above sixteen the impressers came into my village they said i could go fight the algarvians or i could get blazed with that for a choice the algarvians might not blaze me so here i am me im from the far southwest another soldier said id never even heard of algarvians till the fornicating war started all i want to do is go home ealstan could have had something to say about unkerlants jumping on forthwegs back after the algarvians stormed into his kingdom he could have but he didnt what point to it none of these men had been in swemmels army then curvenal would have been about eleven years old and most of his new comrades were peasants he might be ignorant of their language but they were ignorant of much more how could one not have heard of algarvians not have met anythat certainly the far southwest of unkerlant was far indeed but not to know they existed that astonished ealstan hed never met any gyongyosians but he would have had no trouble finding gyongyos on a map under cover of darkness more unkerlanter soldiers came forward as soon as it got light dragons painted rockgray started harrying gromheort once more listening to the thud of bursting eggs ealstan wondered again how his family was faring he hoped they were well that was all he could do behemoths lumbered toward the city wall forward officers shouted forward ealstan went along with his squadmates along with the fresh troops the algarvians fought like canny veterans some of the new unkerlanter soldiers were very raw indeed too raw to know to take cover when the enemy started blazing at them they might as well have been grain before the reaper but they also took a toll on the redheads though it was a smaller toll the algarvians could afford less in the way of losses and seeing smoke rising all around gromheort ealstan realized swemmels soldiers were coming at the city from every side if they broke in anywhere they would be ahead of the game no such luck the algarvians in gromheort were trapped but they hadnt given upand they hadnt run out of food or supplies they threw back this attack as theyd thrown back the others they had courage and to spareor maybe they didnt dare let themselves fall into unkerlanter hands wont be anything left of that place before long curvenal said i used to live there ealstan said in forthwegian and then had to struggle to get meaning across in unkerlanter which formed past tenses differently is your family still there curvenal asked ealstan nodded i think so i hope so the young unkerlanter slapped him on the back thats hard thats cursed hard the redheads never got to my village so im one of the lucky ones but i know how many people have lost kin i hope your folks come through all right sympathy from one of swemmels men came as a surprise thanks ealstan said roughly so do i in ironic counterpoint more eggs burst on gromheort he hoped his mother and father and sister were down in cellars where no harm could come to them he also hoped they had enough to eat the algarvians would probably do their best to keep everything in the besieged town for themselves if any forthwegians got food he suspected his own family would his father had both money and connections and the algarvians took bribes ealstan had seen that for himself both in gromheort and in eoforwic but even the redheads wouldnt give civilians food if they had none to spare all i can do is try to break into the city when weve worn mezentios men down enough to have a decent chance of doing it ealstan thought if i desert and try to sneak in on my own the unkerlanters will blaze me if they catch me and the algarvians will if the unkerlanters dont and i couldnt do anything useful even if i did get in every bit of that made perfect logical sense the sort of sense that should have calmed a bookkeepers spirit somehow or other it did nothing whatever to ease ealstans mind hajjaj was glad bishahs rainy season never very long was drawing to a close that meant his roof wouldnt leak much longertill next rainy season zuwayzi roofers were among the most inept workmen in the whole kingdom they could get away with it too because they were so seldom tested frauds the lot of them he grumbled to his senior wife just after the latest set of bunglers packed up their tools and went down from the hills to bishah they certainly are kolthoum agreed theyd been together for half a century now it had been an arranged marriage not a love match leaders among zuwayzi clans wed for reasons far removed from romance but theyd grown very fond of each other hajjaj wondered if hed ever spoken the word love to her he didnt think so but he couldnt imagine what he would do without her as far as im concerned theyre just a pack of clumsy children playing with toysand not playing very well he went on odds are we wont find out what sort of work theyve done till the fall kolthoum said by then they can expect well either have forgotten all the promises theyve made or lost their bill or both they can expect it but theyll be disappointed hajjaj said they dont know how well you keep track of such things his senior wife graciously inclined her head at the compliment shed never been a great beauty and shed got fat as the years went by but she moved like a queen from roofers hajjaj went on to other complications speaking of toys he needed no more than that for kolthoum to understand exactly what he had in mind whats the latest trouble with tassi she asked and why wont iskakis dry up and blow away because king tsavellas of yanina chose exactly the right moment to change sides and suck up to unkerlant and we didnt hajjaj answered that means swemmels happier about the yaninans than he is about us and besides ansovald likes sticking pins in me to see if ill jump barbarian the last word was necessarily in algarvian zuwayzi didnt have a satisfactory equivalent why doesnt iskakis leave it alone though kolthoum asked fretfully its not as if he wants her for herself if she were a pretty boy instead of a pretty girl he might as things are she shook her head pride hajjaj said he has plenty of that yaninans are prickly folk a zuwayzi noble would want to get back a wife whod run off too aye so he would and something horrible would happen to her if he did too kolthoum said plenty of feuds have started that way tassi doesnt deserve to have anything like that happen to her she cant help it if her husband would sooner have had a boy i wish marquis balastro had taken her back to algarve with him when he had to flee zuwayza hajjaj said but hed quarreled with her by then that was what prompted her to come to me his senior wife gave him a sidelong glance you cant tell me youve been sorry and you know it since hajjaj knew perfectly well that he couldnt he didnt try what he did say was the latest is ansovald had the gall to tell me yanina might declare war on zuwayza if i dont hand tassi over yanina might kolthoum said hajjaj nodded but we dont border yanina she went on hajjaj nodded again she asked did he say unkerlant might declare war on us on account of this hajjaj shook his head well then she told him weve got nothing to worry about enjoy yourself with her and think of iskakis every time you do i wonder if she enjoys herself with me i have my doubts hajjaj said a thought he never would have aired to anyone in the world but kolthoum youve given her the pleasure of not having to live with iskakis anymore his senior wife replied the least she can do is give you some pleasure in exchange kolthoums brisk practicality made a sensible answer it did not however fill hajjaj with delight he had pride of his own a mans pride he wanted to think he pleased the pretty young woman who also pleased him what he wanted to think and what was true were liable to be two different things though i take it you told ansovald the yaninans were welcome to invade us whenever they chose kolthoum said actually no im afraid i lost my temper this time hajjaj said kolthoum waved for him to go on with mingled pride and shame he did i offered iskakis a camel he could use as he planned on using tassi did you his senior wifes eyebrows rose after a moments calculation one almost too short for hajjaj to notice but not quiteshe said well good for you unkerlant wont go to war against us because iskakis doesnt get his wife back king swemmels a madman but hes a shrewd sort of madman most of the time hajjaj said most of the time kolthoum agreed iskakis is making himself troublesome though hajjaj said i keep wondering if hell hire some bravos to do me an injury now kolthoums eyebrows flew upwards a yaninan hire zuwayzi bravos to do you an injury i should hope not by the powers above i should hope no one in this kingdom would take his silver for such a thing zuwayza wouldnt be a kingdom if not for you that was on the whole true nevertheless hajjaj answered men dont turn into bravos unless they love silver first and everything else afterwards and young men dont rememberand probably dont carehow we got to be a kingdom again it would be just another job as far as theyre concerned one that paid better than most disgraceful kolthoum said a hundred years ago our ancestors never would have thought of such treason against their own kind hajjaj shook his head im afraid youre wrong my dear i could say ask tewfik he would remember but hes not so old as that and i dont need to ask him because i already know unkerlant got hold of zuwayza and held us as long as she did by playing our princes off against one another these things have happened and they can happen again well they had better not not to you or whoever plays such games will answer to me kolthoum sounded as if she meant every word of that from some zuwayzi women it would have been an idle threat from kolthoum hajjaj would not have wanted his senior wife angry at him kolthoum arose from the nest of cushions shed made for herself and flounced away in considerable annoyance why arent i more upset at the idea hajjaj wondered maybe because iskakis is such a blunderer any assassins he hires would likely make a hash of the job anyone who would let a woman as entertaining as tassi leave him cant be very bright of course iskakis looked for entertainments of that sort elsewhere the more fool he hajjaj thought joints creaking he got to his feet and went into the library surrounded by books in zuwayzi in algarvian in classical kaunian he didnt have to think about mans inhumanity to man unless he pulled out a history in any of those languages he didnt a volume of love poetry from the days of the kaunian empire better suited his mood motion in the doorway made him look up there stood tassi since becoming part of his household shed insisted on adopting zuwayzi dress which is to say sandals and jewelry and outdoors a hat to hajjajs eyes she always looked much more naked than a woman of his own people maybe that was because he was used to the idea that people of her pale color were supposed to wear clothes or maybe her nipples and her bush stood out more than they did with darkskinned zuwayzin do i disturb you she asked in algarvian the only language they had in common aye he thought but that wasnt how she meant the question no of course not he said and closed the book of poems good she came into the library and sat down on the carpeted floor beside him do i hear rightly iskakis is being difficult again difficult still that didnt take long hajjaj thought kolthoum didnt spread his business around the household either servants going down the hall must have heard bits and pieces and all the powers above put together couldnt keep servants from gossiping as a matter of fact he is hajjaj replied he wouldnt lie to her not on matters touching her as well as him why not justshe snapped her fingerssend him away tell king tsavellas to pick a new minister then he will be gone and so will the trouble i cant do that he said tassi snapped her fingers again king shazli can and he will do as you say that did hold some truth hajjaj had hesitated to ask shazli to declare iskakis unwelcome in zuwayza he was a purist and did not feel personal problems had any place in the affairs of his kingdom if however iskakis had killing him in mind the yaninan minister was the one mixing personal affairs and diplomacy i may ask him hajjaj said at last good that is settled then tassi took such logical leaps as easily as naturally as she breathed and i will stay here does that please you staying here hajjaj asked she looked at him sidelong i hope it pleases you my staying here aye tassi looked very naked indeed he didnt think she let her legs fall open by accident just then giving him a glimpse of the sweet slit between them she used her naked flesh as a tool a weapon in ways that never would have occurred to a zuwayzi woman who took nudity for granted age gave hajjaj a certain advantage or at least a certain perspective on such things you didnt answer what i asked he remarked tassis lower lip pooched like an indignant childs though that pouting lip was the only childlike part of her her lisping throaty accent made even ordinary things she said sound provocative when she asked shall i show you i am pleased hajjaj didnt answer tassi got up and shut the door to the library some time later she said there are you pleased am i pleased hajjaj could scarcely deny he was pleased he wanted to roll over and go to sleep he wasnt so sure about tassi not in that same sense i hope you are he said oh aye she dipped her head as she often did instead of nodding her eyes sparkled and do you see i do not ask for precious stones they would be nice but i do not ask for them all i ask for is to stay here you can do that for me it is easy for you in fact with a laugh hajjaj patted her round smooth backside on the surface she spoke nothing but the truth below the surface hed never before heard anyone ask for jewels by not asking for them she might even get some and if she didnt how could she complain seven colonel lurcanio was not happy to find himself back in algarve but for a few brief leaves hed been away from his home kingdom for almost five years had the war gone better he would have remained in priekule too nothing would have pleased him more here he was though in southeastern algarve doing his best to hold back the kuusamans and lagoans whod swarmed through the marquisate of rivaroli and were pushing farther west every day his own brigade left a good deal to be desired it had lost far too many men and behemoths and eggtossers in the failed counterattack against the islanders in western valmiera lurcanio screamed to his superiors for replacements those superiors when they didnt scream back laughed in his face replacements a harried lieutenant general said we couldnt afford to give you what we gave you the last time how do you think were going to be able to make losses good now how do you think i can stop the enemy with what ive got left lurcanio retorted i cant remember the last time i saw an algarvian dragon overhead believe me colonel youre not the only one with troubles the lieutenant general replied make do the best you can his image in the crystal in front of lurcanio looked down at some papers on his desk there are several regiments of popular assault soldiers not far from your position feel free to commandeer them and add them to your force thank you for nothing sir lurcanio said ive already seen popular assault regiments the men who arent older than i am are too young to have hair on their ballssome of them havent even been circumcised yet they cant stand up to real soldiers they couldnt even if they had anything more than hunting sticks to blaze with he waited for the lieutenant general to call him insubordinate or to say the soldiers in question were better than he claimed back in trapani a lot of men still clung to illusions that had died at the front line but the officer only sighed and said do the best you can colonel i dont know what else to tell you except youre not the only one with troubles i understand that sir but the crystal flared and then went blank before he could get his protest well begun he said something sulfurous under his breath he surely wasnt the only one with troubles as best he could tell the whole kingdom of algarve was falling to pieces before his eyes things hadnt been this bleak even at the end of the six years war then algarve had asked for armistice while her armies still mostly stood on enemy soil now he imagined asking swemmel of unkerlant for an armistice swemmel didnt want one swemmel wanted every algarvian in the world dead the way things were going he was liable to get his wish too and the lagoans and kuusamans showed no sign of being in a dickering mood either of course they dont want to dicker with us lurcanio thought we came too close to beating them all this time they dont want us getting another chance any time soon they want to smash us flat instead had he been a kuusaman he supposed he would have felt the same way had he been an unkerlanter lurcanio shook his head some things were altogether too depressing to contemplate he strode out of the barn where his crystallomancer had set up shop it was raining outside a cold driving rain on the edge of turning into sleet lurcanio pulled his hat down low to keep the rain out of his face eggs were bursting in the neighborhood but not too many of them the rain slowed down the enemy too a sergeant came up to him a plump little man in civilian tunic and kilt at the underofficers heels sir allow me to present baron oberto who has the honor to be the mayor of the town of carsoli the sergeant said carsoli was the town just west of the brigades present position the one lurcanio was currently trying to hold he bowed to oberto good day your excellency he said and what can i do for you this afternoon by the expression on obertos face it wasnt a good day and was unlikely to become one colonel he said surprising lurcanio by correctly reading his rank badges i hope you will not find it necessary to fight inside my fair city when the time comes as we both know it must i beseech you to pull back through carsoli so that the islanders can occupy it without doing it too much harm lurcanio gave him a long measuring stare oberto nervously looked back so you think the war is lost do you lurcanio said at last obertos head bobbed up and down as if on a spring of course i do he said any fool can see as much any fool could have seen as much two years earlier when the unkerlanters drove the algarvians back from sulingen lurcanio bowed again then backhanded oberto across the face the mayor of carsoli cried out and staggered be thankful i dont order you blazed on the spot get out of my sight i have a war to fight whether youve noticed it or not youre a madman oberto said bringing a hand up to his cheek im a soldier lurcanio answered in his own mind he wasnt so sure the two were different but he would never have admitted that to the luckless cowardly mayor of carsoli admitting it to oberto might have meant admitting it to himself hand still pressed to his face oberto staggered away i wonder if i ought to draft an order of the day reminding the men they are still obliged to do their duty lurcanio thought if they give up what hope have we a moment later he grimaced and kicked at the muddy ground even if they dont give up what hope have we he had been thinking about pulling back through carsoli if enemy pressure grew too great now he resolved to fight in the place till not one brick remained atop another thats what you get oberto curse you you would have done better to keep your mouth shut but what algarvian could ever manage that in a perfectly foul temper he stormed off toward the farmhouse where he made what passed for his headquarters before he got there though another soldier called colonel lurcanio what is it he snarled er as the sergeant had done this fellow had a civilian in his wake no not one civilian but half a dozen or so these people need to speak with you sir oh they do do they lurcanio snapped what in blazes do they want and why do i need to say one fornicating word to them but then he got a good look at who came behind the soldier and his fiery temper cooled oh he said and oh again he nodded them aye ill talk to them the four men and two women who came up to lurcanio wore tunics and kilts in the algarvian style but they were blonds their hair soaked and falling down stringily over their faces you have to help us colonel the tallest man exclaimed his algarvian fluent enough but accented with the more guttural consonants and flat vowels of valmieran by the powers above you have to lurcanio had known him well enough back in priekule i have to eh and why is that smetnu for a refugee without a kingdom to give him orders really was a bit much smetnu had an answer for him though ill tell you why because i spent four yearsmore than four yearshelping you thats why didnt my news sheets sing king mezentios song all over valmiera and my broadsheets another man added and my plays said a third and our acting one of the women and the fourth man said together the other woman whose name was sigulda and who was either married or at least thoroughly attached to smetnu said if you dont help us theyll catch up with us and if they catch up with us she drew a thumb across her throat her nails were painted red as blood which added to the effect of the gesture and the valmierans were right that was all there was to it lurcanio bowed very well my friends i will do what i can but i can do perhaps less than you think you will have noticed algarve is falling deeper into ruin and disaster with each passing day they nodded their own kingdomthe algarvian version of valmiera theyd promoted and upheldhad already fallen into ruin and now that algarve was breaking under hammer blows from west and east few of mezentios subjects could spare them any time or aid or effort if anything they were an embarrassment a reminder of what might have been they were in spite of everything kaunians and somehow not quite welcome even to watch algarves death throes the destruction of a great kingdom was or at least should have been a private affair unlike most of his countrymen lurcanio did feel a certain obligation toward them hed worked with them for a long time baldu the playwright had done some splendid work during the occupation his dramas deserved to live unless the valmierans flung them all into the fire because hed written them under algarvian auspices and because some of his characters not all by any means had friendly things to say about the men whod occupied his kingdom bowing again lurcanio asked where would you go any place where they wont hang us or burn us or blaze us the actor made as if to tear his hair which struck lurcanio as overacting very good he said and where might that be pray tell silence fell over the valmieransa gloomy appalled silence not many places on the continent of derlavai would be safe for them after algarve finished losing the war because all her neighbors would be eager for revenge against anyone and everyone whod helped her siaulia lurcanio suggested and then shook his head no if we lose here what we hold on the tropical continent will be yielded to the victors thats how these things work i fear gyongyos baldu suggested can you get us there it wasnt an impossible notion gyongyos was losing the war too but mountains shielded its heartland and it was a long long way from the greatest strength of its enemies that same unfortunately didnt hold true for lurcanios own kingdom he saw one other problem i can probably make sure you reach a port but the ports in the south are mostly closed because of enemy dragons flying out of sibiu and in the north its a long long way to gyongyos not many of our shipsor those of the gongsget through the enemy prowls the sea lanes too you might have a better chance of reaching some island in the great northern sea no one would come looking for you there probably not for years the valmieran collaborators looked even less happy than before lurcanio didnt suppose he could blame them those distant islands were ratholes nothing else but then smetnu asked can you get us to ortah i dont know lurcanio said thoughtfully the neutral kingdom was much closer than gyongyos even so i dont know what things are like in the west of algarve right now if you try to get to ortah youre liable to run right into the unkerlanters arms you wouldnt like that its the best chance we have i think smetnu said the other valmierans nodded the newssheet man went on we have a better chance with the unkerlanters than with our own folk or the islanders he was probablyalmost certainlyright very well lurcanio said he went into the farmhouse and wrote out a leyline caravan pass for all six of them explaining who they were and how theyd served algarve they took it and made for carsolis caravan depot lurcanio hoped it would do some good his own honor at least in this small matter remained untarnished his kingdoms honor he resolutely refused to think about that somewhere not far from garivald a wounded man moaned garivald wasnt sure whether he was an unkerlanter or an algarvian whoever he was hed been moaning for quite a while garivald wished he would shut up and get on with the business of dying the noise he was making wore on everyones nerves dragons dropped eggs on the algarvian town ahead a place called bonorva it lay south and east of gromheort the plains of northern algarve werent much different from those of forthweg the algarvians themselves had fought just as hard in forthweg as they were here in their own kingdom indeed they were still fighting in forthweg gromheort stubbornly held out against everything king swemmels men could throw at it lieutenant andelot nodded to garivald well fariulf even with their fancy steerable eggs they werent able to throw us back not enough men not enough behemoths not enough anything looks that way sir garivald agreed with ingrained peasant pessimism he added we dont want it to rain right at harvest time though itd be a shame to get killed with the war about wonor any other time come to that andelot nodded we cant get slack though the redheads are still fighting its good were on their soilthey should know what they put us through powers below eat thembut these are their homes they wont want us to take them away any more than we wanted them to take away our homes in unkerlant he spoke like a man from cottbus odds were he hadnt lost his home to the algarvians he knew that would be bad but he didnt know how bad it was garivald had watched the invaders storm into storm past his home village hed lived under their boot hed watched them hang a couple of irregulars in the market square they might have hanged him there when they found he was putting together patriotic songs instead theyd hauled him off to herborn to boil him alive and the irregulars had rescued him before he got there better for everybody if this cursed war had never happened he said aye of course andelot replied but its a little too late to wish for that now wouldnt you say garivald only grunted andelot was right no doubt about it but garivald could still wish even if he knew what he wished for had no chance of coming true the next morning he trudged past a column of algarvian refugees unkerlanter dragons had caught on the road it wasnt pretty it must have happened only the day before the bodies didnt stink yet but the almost cheerful odor of burnt meat lingered in the air the dragonfliers had dropped eggs first then come back so their beasts could flame the redheads the eggs hadnt knocked overand he was sure some they had good riddance was all andelot said and when the civilians run from us they clog the roads that makes it harder for mezentios soldiers to get where they need to go aye garivald answered hed hated the algarvians ever since they broke into his kingdom hed killed his share of themmore than his share very likely he should have wanted all of them dead a substantial part of him did want all of them dead or thought it did but some of the scattered twisted charred corpses were very small he thought of syrivald and leuba his own son and daughter no doubt as dead as these algarvians thinking of them didnt make him want to see more redheads dead it just made him wish no more children had to die regardless of what color hair they had somewhere not far away a woman started screaming garivald had heard women scream on that particular note before so had the men in the squad he led some of them he was sure had made algarvian women scream on that note they grinned and nudged one another keep moving garivald called to them we havent got time to stop and have fun they nodded and tramped on but the grins stayed on their faces hed thought his countrymen would run the algarvians out of bonorva that afternoon so had andelot whod said well be sleeping on real beds tonight men they all got a rude surprise as they neared the outskirts of the city algarvian eggtossers greeted them with a heavier pounding than any in which garivald had been on the receiving end unkerlanter eggtossers quickly answered back they were more efficient now than they had been when garivald got dragooned into king swemmels army from what the handful of men whod been in the fight a good deal longer than he said they were much more efficient now than they had been in the early days of the war it didnt do them much good not here alarmed cries rang out behemoths algarvian behemoths hearing that was plenty to make garivald throw himself down on his belly in the middle of a muddy field sure enough a column of behemoths with redheads atop them came lumbering up out of the south footsoldiers in kilts loped along with the behemoths to keep the unkerlanters from getting close enough to have an easy time harming the beasts garivald looked around for unkerlanter behemoths to blunt the head of that column he didnt see very many an algarvian crew flung an egg that burst too close to him for comfort the blast of sorcerous energy picked him up and slammed him to the ground clods of dirt rained down on him orders were to stand your ground no matter what garivald looked around if he and his men stood their ground here no matter what they would all end up dead in short order lieutenant andelot had praised his initiative before he used it again this time to shout fall back some of the unkerlanters had begun to retreat even without orders the din of bursting eggs was loud off to the east too suggesting the algarvians had another force of behemoths on the move there king swemmels army had stormed across northeastern unkerlant and forthweg and into algarve mezentios men struck back when and as they could but garivald had never seen a counterattack like this before there was andelot trying to rally his men garivald shouted sir were going to have to give back a little ground theyve got too many men and too many behemoths for us to hold them off right now he waited to see if andelot would order him to try to hold at all hazards he wondered if the company commander might have to suffer an unfortunate accident so someone with real sense could take over and do his best to lead the men to safety but biting his lip andelot nodded aye sergeant youre right worse luck he snapped his fingers i know whats gone wrong curse it tell me garivald urged there are some little cinnabar mines south of bonorva andelot said you get quicksilver for dragonfire from cinnabar the algarvians havent got much left no wonder theyre fighting like madmen to hold on to what they do have garivald managed a haggard grin so much nicer to know why youre about to get killed isnt it though andelot replied lets see what we can do about making the algarvians do the dying instead what a company of footsoldiers could do on a battlefield swarming with behemoths was depressingly obvious not much more unkerlanter behemoths did come down from out of the north to challenge the algarvian beasts but not enough as if it were the early days of the war the redheads had the bit between their teeth a week later spring was in the air garivald was sure it would still be snowing down in the duchy of grelz but northern algarve was a long long way from home the wind blew warm from the sea birds started chirping in the trees fresh green grass sprang up a few flowers bloomed it would have been beautiful if so much of the countryside hadnt been wrecked by wars fiery rake and that rake had gone across the landscape first one way then the other by that time garivald counted himself lucky to be alive hed never seen such a sustained algarvian push before it had driven his countrymen and him back a good thirty miles from the outskirts of bonorva hed had to fight his way out of two encirclements and sneak past algarvian footsoldiers to escape a third a lot of unkerlanters hadnt made it theyre bastards arent they he said to lieutenant andelot as the two of them sprawled by the bank of a little stream they were both filthy and unshaven and desperately in need of sleep we knew that from the start andelot answered theyve pushed us back some aye but look at the price theyve paid and theyre just about stopped nowwere hardly lost any ground today when we start moving forward again what will they use to stop us i dont know garivald didnt care about such things im no officer i dont want to be an officer he thought let them worry about where the fornicating war is going i just want to stay alive till it finally gets there and stops so i can get off by all the signs andelot knew what he was talking about streams of unkerlanter soldiers and behemoths were moving up toward the front rockgray dragons swarmed overhead with few in algarvian colors in the air to hold them back the redheads had done everything they could to drive back the men of unkerlant and it hadnt been enough more dragons flew by all of them heading northeast to strike the enemy some had eggs slung under their bellies others carried only dragonfliers they protected the ones with the eggs fought off the handful of algarvian beasts that rose to oppose them and swooped low to flame soldiers and civilians on the ground theyll make mezentios men wish they were never born garivald said smugly but then as he watched the whole flight of unkerlanter dragons tumbled out of the sky it wasnt as if theyd been blazed down it was more as if theyd run headlong into an invisible wall some of the eggs they carried burst while they were still in the air others when they hit the ground what in blazes garivald exclaimed andelot took things more in stride curse them they made it work again he said garivalds questioning noise held no words andelot went on the redheads keep coming up with new sorceries powers below eat em this one congeals the air some sort of way dont ask me howim no mage i dont think our mages know how this spell works either come to that the one thing we do know is for every ten times the algarvians try it they bring it off once twice if theyre lucky thats too often garivald said i know andelot said but its only a toy it wont change the way the war turns out not even a coppers worth most of the time our dragons do get through garivald nodded looked at from the perspective of the war as a whole that did make perfect sense looked at from the perspective of the dragonfliers whod just run into the algarvian sorcery he tried not to think about that before long the regiment was moving forward again so he didnt have to ilmarinen stood in one of the passes that cut through the bratanu mountains the air was as clear as mountain air was said to be finding a cliche that turned out to be true always amused him looking westand looking downhe could see a long way into algarve there not too far away lay the town of tricarico with olive groves and almond orchards and rolling fields of wheat sweeping away till detail was lost even with this clear clear air beside ilmarinen stood grand general nortamo the commander of kuusaman soldiers in jelgava he was in fact the overall commander of the lagoans in jelgava too however little they cared to acknowledge it grand general was not a usual rank in the kuusaman army it had been created especially for this campaign to give nortamo rank to match that of the lagoan marshal who led king vitors men nortamo was tall by kuusaman standards he might have had a little lagoan blood in him that would have helped explain his baldness too most kuusaman men ilmarinen among them kept their hair nortamo hadnt he wore hats a lot up here in the chilly mountains nobody could smile at him because of it he was one of the blandest men ilmarinen had ever met how did you get your job wondered the sardonic mage who was a great many things but none of them bland by making sure you never offended anybody seems more trouble than its worth we took a little longer than we should have getting through the mountains nortamo said but now sorcerous sir we are going to finish driving the algarvians and i dont see how they can stand in our way he also had a nearly infallible gift for stating the obvious ilmarinen sighed is that what it takes to lead lots of men a good smile and no surprises powers above be praised all i ever wanted was to go off by myself and cast spells they probably wont stand in our way he remarked now theyll probably hide behind things and blaze at us eraye grand general nortamo said as befit a man with a gift for the obvious he also owned a remorselessly literal mind well weve got the men and the behemoths and the dragons to root em out if they do and weve got you wizardly types too eh he patted ilmarinen on the back ilmarinen had never been called a wizardly type in his entire life he hoped with all his heart never to be called such again either right he said tightly oblivious to any offense he might have caused nortamo went on and youll shield us from whatever funny sorceries mezentios men fling our way wont you i do hope so ilmarinen answered its my neck on the line too well do just fine nortamo spoke not so much in response to what he heard as to what he expected to hear a lot of people were like that now and again he had the disease worse than most hes brave ilmarinen reminded himself hes not particularly stupid the men like him they rush to do what he tells them they think its an honor he repeated that to himself several times it kept him from trying to strangle grand general nortamo murdering the commanding general would get him talked about however much satisfaction it might bring and some people probably wouldnt understand at all in lieu of throttling nortamo ilmarinen said as soon as i can ill want to talk with some captured algarvian mages the more i find out about what theyre up to the better the chance i have of stopping it that makes sense nortamo said though he didnt sound as if it had made enough sense to occur to him before ilmarinen mentioned it ill do my best to arrange it for you sorcerous sir ill do my best to forget about it and to make you nag was what that sounded like ilmarinens hands twitched could i strangle him before anyone noticed tempting tempting nortamo gave him a cheery little wave now if youll excuse me off he went unthrottled ilmarinen sighed flashes of light in front of and then inside tricarico showed where eggs were burstingand where ilmarinen presumed kuusaman soldiers either were going forward or would be soon hed never been in tricarico he wondered how many kuusamans had back in more cheerful days not many or he missed his guess the provincial town didnt look to have much to recommend it no ley line ran through this pass the road that did go through left a good deal to be desired it might have been better before the war in fact it surely had been better as ilmarinen jounced along in a buggy a secondrank mage gave him a happy wave and said good to see you sir were just about sure weve found all the eggs the algarvians planted by now thats nice ilmarinen answered if you turn out to be wrong ill write you a letter and let you know about it the other wizard laughed occasional craters in the surface of the road said some of the algarvian eggs had found kuusaman soldiers before they were found if one of them found him he probably wouldnt be interested in writing letters for a while at some point in the descent the driver paused to look back over his shoulder and remarked well were in algarve now ilmarinen would argue with anybody at any time for any reason and how precisely do you know that he demanded by way of reply the driver jerked a thumb off to the right ilmarinen turned to look an enormous dragon done in white green and red adorned a boulder it was partly defaced kuusaman soldiers had added several rude scrawls to it but it was unquestionably an algarvian dragon ilmarinen nodded youre right were in algarve a thin but steady stream of wounded soldiers came back from the fighting the ones who werent too badly hurt still had plenty of spirit well get em said a fellow with his hand wrapped in a bloody bandage they havent got hardly any behemoths left pretty cursed hard to win a war without em that made sense to ilmarinen what made sense though wasnt necessarily true by that afternoon the kuusamans were over the river both north and south of tricarico pushing hard to cut the city off and surround it and then just as the sun was setting on the broad algarvian plain the world suddenly seemed to hold its breath ilmarinen didnt know how else to put it hed felt the algarvians murderous magic so many time hed grown inured to it as had most other mages this this was something else what are they doing flashed through his mind when the sorcerous storm broke a heartbeat later came another perhaps even more urgent thought how are they doing it hed heard that the algarvians were pulling out all sorts of desperate spells but hadnt really encountered one till now their murderous magecraft had been bad this was worse that had used life energy in a straightforward way even if mezentios men had no business stealing it as theyd done this whoever the wizard essaying the spell was hed opened his spirit to the powers below he didnt just aim to kill his foes he aimed to torment them to horrify them to make death itself seem clean by comparison ilmarinen felt kuusaman sorcerers in the field try to throw up counterspells against the dark cantrip he felt them fail too and felt the extinguishment of some of them that was the only word he could find they didnt die at least not right away they would have been better off if they had he essayed no counterspells he had no idea whether that blackness could be countered in any conventional sense of the word he wasnt much interested in finding out either instead he hurled a bolt of sorcerous energy of the sort pekka had discovered straight at the algarvian attacking his countrymen the enemy mage hadnt expected that his spell was so vicious so dreadful he might have assumed other wizards would attack it not him a lot of wizards would have ilmarinen didnt think like most of his professional colleagues his own sorcerous stroke went home a lightning bolt piercing the darkness he felt the algarvian sorcerers outraged astonishment as the fellow died for a nasty moment ilmarinen feared that wouldnt be enough the spell once unleashed seemed to want to go on by itself it did crumble at last but only slowly and reluctantly then the day seemed to brighten though the sun was touching the western horizon weary shaken disgusted as he was ilmarinen stormed off to grand general nortamos headquarters which he found in a farmhouse on this side of the river from tricarico a sentry tried to block his progress he pushed past as if the man didnt exist nortamo was conferring with several of his officers ilmarinen ignored them too in a voice that brooked no contradiction he said i need to talk to those captive mages nortamo now nortamo looked at him he was not a fool he didnt argue very well sorcerous sir you have my authorization i will give it to you in writing if you like never mind we havent time to waste ilmarinen hurried off to the small captives camp where mages were housed and securely guarded by other mages he had several of the highestranking captives brought before him how could any of you do that he demanded in classical kaunian he spoke fluent algarvian but chose not to how one of the algarvians answered in the same tongue we are fighting to save our kingdom that is how what would you have us do roll over and die sooner than that ilmarinen shuddered aye by the powers above no the mage said no one will enslave us not while we still live to fight doing that you enslave yourselves ilmarinen answered better to be ruled by foreigners dont you think than by the powers below my wife and daughters are in the west the algarvian said i sent them word to flee i do not know whether they could if they did not and the unkerlanters have caught them they are raping their way through my kingdom you know and what did you do to them ilmarinen returned what did you do to the kaunians in forthweg this is a kaunian war the algarvian mage declared his comrades solemnly nodded everyone picks on algarve and so of course we have to fight back in any way we can the other wizards nodded again war is bad enough you made it worse ilmarinen said you made it much worse is it any wonder that every other kingdom has joined together to knock you down and make sure you can never do it again by all youve done you deserve it you almost killed me when you loosed your attack on yliharma too bad we failed old man the algarvian didnt lack for nervebut then lacking for nerve had never been an algarvian characteristic so long as we can fight back we will any way we can then you had better not complain about what happens to you afterwards ilmarinen said since he was on the side of the captors and not the captives he took advantage of having the last word and walked out as soon as bembo could get around with crutches and his splint the healers in tricarico threw him out of the sanatorium hed expected nothing else wounded people kept flooding into the place if the healers didnt need to keep an eye on him they did need the cot he was filling he had no flat of course not any more but finding a new one wasnt hard not when he had silver to spend and he did he hadnt used much of his salary in all the time hed been in forthweg and hed done pretty well for himself shaking down the locals he would have landed a place even sooner than he did if he hadnt insisted on living on the ground floor everybody wants those flats a landlord with none to let told him fast and easy to get to the cellar when the eggs start falling i cant go anywhere fast and easy bembo said using crutches made it harder for him to gesture while he talked and an algarvian who couldnt talk with his hands was hardly alive you think i want to go up and down stairs with these things the landlord shrugged sorry pal i cant give you what i aint got bembo went off in a huff he finally got a flat the next morning then he took a leyline caravan over to his old constabulary station to find out where saffa was staying these days that took some doing a lot of the constables there didnt remember him and didnt want to tell him anything he finally got what he needed from frontino the warder at the gaol read any spicy romances lately bembo asked him frontino reached into his desk ive got a good one right here matter of fact the romance called empress passion certainly looked good to bembo the cover showed a naked kaunian woman presumably the empress in question with her legs wrapped around an ancient algarvic warrior with an improbable set of muscles the kaunian emperor see is going to sacrifice a bunch of algarvian captives till this guyfrontino tapped the warriorhorns the empress into talking him out of it then the captives get free and the blood really spills im donewant to borrow it the empress she screws up a storm he held the book out to bembo almost to his own surprise bembo shook his head that whole business of sacrificing he looked around to make sure nobody but frontino could hear him everything they say about the kaunians in forthweg pack of lies the warder said enemy dragons have been dropping little broadsheets about it so it has to be a pack of lies stands to reason but bembo shook his head again its all true frontino everything everybody says is true and nobody says even a quarter of what all really went on i ought to know i was fornicating there remember frontino didnt believe him he could see as much he thought about arguing he thought about breaking one of his crutches over the warders head too to let in a little sense but that would have just landed him in the gaol muttering under his breath he made his slow hitching way out of the constabulary station and back to the leyline caravan stop the block of flats next to saffas and one across the street were only piles of wreckage bembo had to go up three flights of stairs to get to her flat he was puffing and sweating when he finally got there a baby wailed behind the door he knocked on when saffa opened it she looked harriedmaybe her brat had been crying for a while oh she said you he didnt quite know how to take that hello saffa im on my feet sort of hello bembo her smile still had some of the sour tang he remembered so did her words im glad to see yousort of will you go to supper with me tomorrow night he asked as if the whole derlavaian war including his broken leg had never happened no she said but she wasnt spitting in his eye as shed warned she might for she went on i havent got anyone to watch my son then but three nights from now my sister isnt working ill go then all right bembo said pick an eatery and well go there ive been away so long i dont know whats good these days or even whats standing hed got around by night in gromheort and eoforwic with no lights showing he expected he could manage in his own home town but he turned out to be wrong tricarico fell to the kuusamans two days later hed heard that the enemy was coming down out of the bradano mountains of course the news sheets couldnt very well deny that but they did their best to claim the slanteyes would never cross the river would never threaten the city bembo probably should have had more doubts than he did hed seen such optimistic twaddle in forthweg too but the assault on tricarico took him by surprise so did the feeble resistance his own countrymen put up inside the city that left him half relievedhe had after all been in the middle of a city convulsed by fightingand half ashamed why arent you giving them a battle he called to a squad of soldiers heading west plainly intending to leave tricarico why ill tell you why porky one of the men answered bembo squawked indignantly and with some reason hed lost much of the paunch hed once carried ignoring him the trooper went on were getting the blazes out on account of the slanteyes have already got men past this rotten place to north and south and we dont want to get stuck here thats why from a military point of view that made good enough sense out in the west fighting against the unkerlanters all too many garrisons had stayed in their towns too long and got cut off and destroyed gromheort where bembo was stationed before transferring to eoforwic was going through such a death agony now but even so what are we supposed to do best you can pal the soldier answered that and thank the powers above it aint the unkerlanters coming into town he trotted away dodging craters in the street and jumping over or kicking aside bits of rubble nobody had bothered to clear away had bembo had two good legs he would have kicked at rubble too as things were he made his own slow way down the street the trooper was right the kuusamans wouldnt rape or massacre everyone they saw just for the sport of it at least bembo hoped they wouldnt im going to find out he realized he was back in his flat with the shutters tightly drawn when the kuusamans did come into tricarico one of the windows in the flat had had glass in it when he rented the place the landlord had tried to charge him more because of it hed laughed in the mans face asking how long do you expect it to last and hed proved a good prophet for an egg bursting not far away soon shattered the pane into tinkling shards hed had a demon of a time cleaning up afterwards too trying to handle crutches and broom and dustpan was more an exercise in frustration than anything else but bembo couldnt stay in his flat forever or even very long he had to come out to look for something to eat hed never done much cooking for himself even back when hed been living in tricarico a constable with an eye for the main chance could get most of his meals from the eateries on his beat in forthweg hed done the same thing a lot of the time and eaten in barracks like a soldier when he hadnt and with crutches he would have been as awkward in the kitchen as he had been chasing slivers of glass around the floor of course he was pretty awkward in the kitchen without crutches too a few eggs were still bursting inside tricarico when he emerged from his block of flats at first he thought that meant the kuusamans hadnt yet come into the city after all but then he saw several of them setting up sandbags so they could cover all sides of an intersection they looked like runts he was several inches taller than the biggest of them and he wasnt exceptionally tall by algarvian standards but they had sticks and they had the same sort of urgent disciplined wariness hed seen in algarvian soldiers in forthweg any civilians who tried trifling with them would be very sorry very fast he was sure of that more eggs burst he realized his retreating countrymen were tossing them at his home town they didnt care what happened to the people who lived in tricarico as long as they killed or maimed a few kuusamans bembo turned toward the west and scowled see if i do anything for you any time soon he thought the you being either the departed soldiers or king mezentio himself even bembo wasnt quite sure which it amounted to the same thing either way you someone said sharply and for a moment bembo thought the word remained in his own mind not the world outside him but then the fellow whod spoken went on aye youthe chubby fellow with the crutches come here bembo turned there gesturing at him stood a skinny old kuusaman with a few little wisps of white hair sprouting from his chin he wore greenishgray kuusaman uniform with a prominent badge that had to be a mages emblem what do you want uh sir bembo asked cautiously i already told you what i wanted the kuusaman said in his almost unaccented algarvian i want you to come here i have some questions for you and i expect to get answers ill turn you into a leech if i dont lay behind his words im coming bembo said and made his slow way over to the mage refusing didnt cross his mind not because of the implied threat but simply because one did as this man said first and then wondered why afterwards if at all still bembo was not easily overawed and had his own full measure of algarvian cheekiness he asked a question of his own who are you oldtimer ilmarinen the mage answered now you know as much as you did before he eyed bembo bembo didnt like the way he did it it seemed as if ilmarinen were looking right into his soul and maybe the mage was for the next thing he said in tones of genuine curiosity was how could you uh how could i what sir bembo asked round up kaunians and send them off to what you knew was death and then go back to your bed and sleep at night the kuusaman mage answered how did you know that i mean i never but bembos denial faltered ilmarinen would know if he lied he was grimly certain of that and so instead of denying he evaded i saved some too by the powers above plenty of my pals didnt ilmarinen looked into him again grudgingly the mage nodded so you dida handful and usually for favors but you did and i cannot deny it a tiny weight in the other pan of the scales now answer what i asked beforewhat of all those you did not save bembo had spent years not thinking about that he didnt want to think about it now under ilmarinens eye though he had no choice at last he mumbled the people set over me told me what to do and i went and did it they were the ones who were supposed to know what was going on not me and what else could i have done ilmarinen started to spit into his face bembo was sure of it at the last instant the mage checked himself a tiny weight of truth there too he said and spat at bembos feet instead then turned and walked away hey you cant bembo broke off as a sense of just how narrow his escape had been flowed through him the last thing in all the world he wanted was for that terrible old kuusaman wizard to come back and look into his eyes again as soon as istvan walked into the barracks he knew he was in trouble all eyes swung his way somebody got up and closed the barracks door behind him well well somebody else said if it isnt the kuusamans little pet goat maaa maaa somebody else said shrilly several of his countrymen got off their cots and came toward him hands bunching into fists fear chilled him men occasionally got stomped or beaten to death here in the captives camp on obuda once in a while the kuusaman guards found out who did it and punished them more often than not though they didnt that sort of fate looked to be about to befall him he didnt turn and run that wasnt so much because he came from a warrior race as because he felt sure more gyongyosians were closing in behind him instead he drew himself up very straight i have kept my honor he said the stars shine on my spirit and they know i have kept my honor liar three men said together maaa maaa that hateful mocking goatbleat rang out again i am no liar istvan declared come on all of you i will fight you one at a time till i can fight no more i will say nothing to the guards about what happened by the stars i swear it or show yourselves goateating cowards and mob me all at once they hesitated he hadnt been sure he would get even that much then a burly man stepped out of the group and advanced on him saying my fists and feet are better than you deserve istvan didnt answer he just waited the other captive was bigger than he and looked to know what he was doing the fellow surged forward head down fists churning istvan blocked a blow with his arm struck a stomach hard as oak took a boot in the hip instead of in the crotch and also lashed out with his foot a buffet to the side of the head made him see stars that had nothing to do with the ones he reverenced he grabbed his foe and threw him to the floor the other captive tripped him on the way down but istvan was the one who got up he spat red on the floor whos next he said squinting a little because his left eye was half swollen shut another gyongyosian strode toward him he won that fight too and waved for a third challenger by then every part of him hurt he didnt think he would win the third fight and he didnt the other captive thumped his head against the floor once twice that was the last thing he remembered they could have killed him after he was out when he woke up again he rather wished they had theyd kicked him around some he could feel that but it was almost lost in the thudding nauseating pain in his head hed had his wits scrambled for him sure as sure he had trouble remembering where he was and even who he was he did remember how three other captives in the barracks had got pretty good sets of lumps of their own though that gave him a certain small satisfaction when he wasnt hoping his own head would fall off corporal kun walked into the barracks perhaps half an hour after istvan came to he took one look at istvan and realized what must have happened to him he had time for one horrified yelp before somebody said all right squealeryour turn now the captives fell on him and beat him bloody but he was still breathing when they stopped maybe istvan had won enough respect to keep them from wanting to kill his comrade any more at the roll call that evening the kuusaman guards stared at istvan what you to do one of them asked nothing he said stolidly where he had trouble recalling his name he did remember the oath hed sworn the guards eyed kun he didnt look quite so bad as istvanand somehow hed managed to keep his spectacles from shattering but he was no beauty neither were the men whod fought istvan one after the next the guards shook their heads and shrugged theyd seen such things before this time at least they werent carrying corpses from the captives camp a couple of days later istvan got summoned out of the camp for another interrogation with lammi the forensic sorcerer by then some of his bruises had turned truly spectacular colors his ribs looked like a sunset his face was no bargain either when he made his way into lammis tentducking through the flap hurt toothe mages jaw dropped by the stars she exclaimed in her good gyongyosian what happened to you no matter how well she spoke his language istvan didnt like to hear her use such oathswhat regard would the stars have for a foreigner like her he answered as hed answered the guard nothing lammi shook her head a little more nothing like that and they would lay you on a pyre nowtell me at once what happened to you nothing istvan repeated you are a stubborn man i have seen that she said but you know i have ways to get answers from you nothing happened istvan said as hed expected his command of his senses disappeared lammi might have miscalculated there taking away his senses took away his pain too the first relief hed had from it since the fights and shed robbed him often enough he was starting to get used to it he didnt mistake her voice for that of the stars any more presently she brought him back to himself you are a very stubborn man she said thank you he answered which made her blink she needed a moment to rally i think she said we would do well not to send you back to your barracks she picked up a crystal and spoke into it in kuusaman which istvan didnt understand whoever was on the other end of the etheric connection answered in the same language the crystal flared then went inert lammi looked back to istvan corporal kun it seems is also sporting bruises how did that happen i dont know he answered and waited to go back to the unworld of no sight no hearing no smell no taste no touch he looked forward to losing the sense of touch once more indeed he did lammi made an exasperated noise how can we find and punish the men who beat you if you will not tell us who they are what men istvan said the forensic sorcerer made another louder exasperated noise with a shrug istvan went on i told you nothing happened aye that is what you told me lammi agreed and i am telling you once more sergeant that had a little more of such nothing happened you would now be dead and we would not be having this discussion istvan shrugged again she was probablyno certainlyright she glowered at him we will be removing you from the captives camp for your own protection you do understand that with one more shrug istvan answered you are the captors i am the captive you can do as you like with me if you do too much and word gets back to gyongyos your own captives will suffer the kuusaman mage drummed her fingers on her notepad she muttered something in her own tongue then translated it into gyongyosian very difficult too istvan inclined his head as at another compliment that made lammi mutter again when she returned to gyongyosian once more she said very well sergeant if you will not discuss this you will not let us turn to something else then you are the captor istvan repeated i do wonder lammi murmured istvan understood the words but not everything behind them she gathered herself and went on you have a scar on your left hand sergeant istvan had been afraid in a physical sense of what the kuusamans might do to him now for the first time in the interrogation he knew real terror he had to force a oneword answer out through numb lips aye sergeant kun your comrade has an identical scar lammi continued does he istvan said shrugging yet again i hadnt noticed the world disappeared once more lammi he remembered knew when he lied after some endlessbut happily also painlesstime she allowed him to return to the sensible world i point out she said that one of the men who was slain in the unfortunate incident a certainshe checked her notesa certain szonyi aye had an identical scar duly noted on his identity documents he too was a comrade of yours he was istvan said he couldnt very well deny it saying anything else such as how much he missed his friendwould have just given lammi another handle on him she waited for something more when it didnt come she shrugged and said how do you explain these three identical scars sergeant we all got them at the same time in unkerlant istvan said again he said no more he fought against trembling his heart pounded in his chest he would sooner have gone through a dozen beatings than this lammi peered at him through her spectacles try as he would to hide it he feared she saw his agitation why she asked softly she can tell when i lie to istvan that was the most terrifying thought of all instead of lying he said nothing at all whatever she chose to do to him would be better than a truthful answer to that question why lammi asked once more istvan still did not answer the inside of the tent was coolthe island of obuda never got very warm especially not in late winterbut sweat ran down his face he could smell his own fear he didnt know if lammi could but she could hardly miss the sweat still softly she asked is it a scar of expiation i dont know what that word means istvan said she could tell when he gave her the truth too that didnt do him much good though she simplified a scar a wound to wash away a sin istvan still sat mute which looked to be answer enough by itself lammi asked what sort of sin one i never meant to commit istvan burst out the kuusaman mage just sat there waiting again he said no more again it didnt seem to matter lammi looked at him looked through him looked into his heart she knows by the stars she knows he thought and despair overwhelmed even terror a kuusaman a foreigner knew hed eaten goat she knew what it meant too she knew altogether too much about gyongyos and its ways she owns me he thought hopelessly if lammi did she didnt seem anxious to take possession we will find you other housing safer housing she said and spoke to the guards in kuusaman they led istvan out of the tent likely not by coincidence kun came out of the other interrogation tent at just the same time he walked toward istvan as istvan headed toward him the guards didnt interfere istvan looked at kuns battered face and at the devastated expression on it the same expression he wore himself the two men embraced and burst into tears no matter how bright the night sky might be istvan didnt think the stars would ever shine on him again very cautiously leudast stuck his head up from behind a shattered wall and peered across the scamandro he had reason for caution the algarvians had snipers on the east bank of the river and they were very alert a man who wasnt careful would have a beam go in one ear and out the other true eggs were bursting over there but that wouldnt make the redheads quit blazing leudast knew what sort of men he faced theyd driven through unkerlant to the outskirts of cottbus had the war gone just a little differently its a good thing there werent more of the whoresons he muttered whats that lieutenant asked captain dagaric whod taken over as regimental commander after captain drogden hadnt been careful enough while raping an algarvian woman dagaric had efficiency written all over him he was a good soldier in a coldblooded way nobody would love him but he wouldnt throw men away out of stupidity either given some of the things leudast had seen solid professionalism was nothing to sneeze at he repeated himself adding powers below eat em they will dagaric spoke with assurance we are going to hammer them flat when we cross the river that will be the last fight because we will take trapani once we get rolling may it be so sir leudast said this war we had to win it if we didnt theydve held us down forever i only wish we could get rid of every last one of the buggers dagaric said if we treated them the way they treated the kaunians up in forthweg we really wouldnt have to worry about algarve for a long time to come leudast nodded he didnt think even king swemmel would massacre all the redheads in the lands he was overrunning but you never could tell with swemmel any unkerlanter would have said the same and weve had to use our own people the way the algarvians used the kaunians from forthweg mezentios men deserve something extra to pay for that you bet they do captain dagaric said i expect theyll get it too a weird wailing laughing gobbling noise came out of the east leudast grabbed for his stick what in blazes is that does it go with some new algarvian magic dagaric pointed out to the scamandro where a big bird was swimming its back checked in black and white its beak a fishcatching spear no its just a loonand youre another one for letting the call spook you they must be birds of the south leudast said they dont live on any streams up near the village i come from more than half to himself he added i wonder if anythings left of the place these days then he spoke to the regimental commander again and i dont see how you can blame me for being jumpy about the fornicating redheads and their magecraft sir with all the weird new spells theyre throwing at us these days with a dismissive gesture dagaric said a drowning man thrashes his arms and flails whoreson still drowns though the algarvians send these stupid spells of theirs at us before they find out what the magic can do or even if it works at all no wonder most of it goes sour that made senseup to a point even the spells that maybe dont do everything theyre supposed to can still hurt us leudast said weve seen it theyd hurt us worse if the redheads really knew what they were doing dagaric said that made leudast blink like most unkerlanters he took it almost for granted that the algarvians were cleverer than his own folk theyd proved their wit in unkerlant too often for him to think anything else but dagaric stubbornly plowed ahead think how much trouble they could cause if all their fancy magic really worked it mostly doesnt though and ill tell you why a couplethree years ago the redheads figured they could lick us with what they already had and they didnt worry about anything else then when they started getting into trouble thats when they decided to make the fire under their mages hotter so they have all these spells that would do this that or the other thingif only they worked right but they cursed well dont and well have licked algarve before the redheads ever do get em right after leudast thought that over he slowly nodded the one thing mezentios men always foul up is they always think theyre smarter than they really are and they can do more than they can really do dagaric nodded too most emphatically youve got it lieutenant youve got it just right matter of fact and how fornicating smart does that make them if they were anywhere near as smart as they want everybody else to think they are would we be here halfway between the yaninan border and trapani would the stinking islanders be coming up the algarvians arse from the east no sir leudast said they made everybody hate em and they made everybody afraid of em and now theyve made everybody gang up on em too you look at it that way maybe they really arent so smart he heard the wonder in his own voice were winning the war were not only winning it weve got it almost won i cant quite see trapani from here but it wont be long he wondered what would happen then maybe swemmel would put everything he could into the war against gyongyos leudast shook his head marveling hed been fighting the gongs when the derlavaian war broke out maybe things would come full circle and hed fight them some more if unkerlant went after them now he thought his kingdom would smash them but what then suppose unkerlant didnt have an enemy left in the world suppose he got out of the army what would i do then ive been fighting for a long time i hardly know anything else any more go home i suppose thats the first thing i have to do see if anything is left of the village see if i have any kin left alive and then there was that girl back in grelz that alize if i can find her again that might turn into something i wonder how much different farming is down there i could find out he laughed at himself a couple of minutes thought and he had the rest of his life neatly laid out one thing the war had taught him was that plans mostly didnt work the way people thought they would ahead of time dagaric slapped him on the shoulder stopping his leyline caravan of thought things look pretty quiet up here for now the regimental commander said we can get back to our men aye sir leudast said they slipped away from the scamandros western bank as they went off the loon loosed its mad laughing call once more leudasts shiver had nothing to do with the chilly weather nobody hearing that cry for the first time would think it came from a birds throat that it presaged some nasty algarvian sorcery still struck him as much more likely sentries challenged them twice on the way back to the algarvian village in which the regiment was resting the men werent taking victory for granted which struck leudast as the best way to insure it another officer was heading up to the scamandro for a look of his own at the enemy another officer leudast stiffened to attention when he saw the big gold stars embroidered on the collar tabs of the oncoming mans cape only one soldier in all of unkerlant wore those stars dagaric might all at once have turned to rigidly upright stone too marshal rathar sir the two junior officers exclaimed together as you were gentlemen rathar said i always like to see officers doing their own reconnaissance thats what im doing myself as a matter of fact theres whats left of a wall by the riverbank sir leudast turned and pointed you have to be careful thoughthe redheads have snipers on the far bank thanks rathar started to go on then paused and gave him a quizzical look i know you dont i before leudast could speak rathar answered his own question aye i do youre the fellow who brought in raniero you and that other soldier thats right sir leudast said you made me a lieutenant and him a sergeant what happened to him do you know afraid i do sir leudast answered an algarvian sniper got him kiun never knew what happened there are worse ways to go youre right weve all seen too many of them marshal rathar grimaced so many good men gone thats the worst thing about this stinking war what will become of unkerlant once its finally over captain dagaric presumed to speak lord marshal sir whatever it is well be better off than these fornicating algarvians wed better be captain rathar was polite enough but didnt bother to ask dagarics name with a nod to leudast he went on good to see you again lieutenant stay safe he went on toward the scamandro thank you very much sir leudast called after him you too rathar didnt answer he just kept walking even so dagaric stared at leudast as if hed never seen him before in accusing tones he said you never told me the marshal knew you no sir leudast agreed why in blazes not the regimental commander burst out a connection like that leudast shrugged you wouldnt have believed me or if you did youdve thought i was bragging so i just kept my mouth shut for anybody raised in an unkerlanter peasant village keeping ones mouth shut almost always looked like a good idea no telling who might be listening a lieutenant in my regiment knows the marshal of unkerlant dagaric still sounded dazed disbelieving no sir you had it right the first time leudast answered he knows me some ive met him a couple of times thats all once up in zuwayza in the first fight there and then when kiun and i got lucky with raniero a little this side of herborn dagaric grunted i think youre too modest for your own good if the marshal of unkerlant knows you why are you only a lieutenant only a lieutenant leudast gaped that wasnt how he looked at itjust the opposite in fact sir youve got to rememberi come out of a peasant village i didnt expect to be anything but a common soldier after the impressers got uh after i joined king swemmels army i got to be a sergeant because i was lucky enough to stay alive when a lot of people didnt and i got to be an officer because i was the fellowwell one of the fellowswho nabbed the false king of grelz when he was trying to get away in my regiment dagaric muttered leudast stifled a sigh his superior hadnt paid any attention to him he didnt know why he was surprised superiors didnt have to listen to subordinates not having to listen was part of what made them what they were every so often an exception came along leudast tried to be one himself but knew he didnt always succeed he glanced east toward the riverbank rathar squatted there behind what was left of the stone fence just as he and dagaric had done a few minutes before the marshal showed both nerve and good sense in coming up to the front alone the algarvians had no idea he was there he got the look he wanted and then came away leudast sighed with relief he couldnt imagine the war without the marshal eight colonel sabrino led his wingwhat was left of itdown to a landing on a makeshift dragon farm outside the little town of pontremoli a few miles east of the scamandro some of the dragonhandlers on the ground knew what they were doing others were boys and old men from a popular assault regiment doing the best they could at jobs theyd never expected to have to handle once sabrinos dragon was chained to an iron spike driven deep into the muddy ground he climbed down and wearily made his way toward the tents that had sprouted to await the wings arrival captain orosios dragon had landed not far away orosio looked as worn as sabrino but managed a nod and a wave almost full circle sabrino said sir the squadron commander scratched his head in the five and a half years hed flown in sabrinos wing his hair had retreated a good deal at the temples sabrino wondered how much older he looked himself these days he felt about ninety he waved to the eastnot so very far to the east if we fall back any more well be flying out of the dragon farm near trapani the one we left when we went to war against forthweg oh orosio thought that over then nodded by the powers above youre right he looked around not fornicating many left who set out with us that day you me two or three othersthats it sixtyfour dragonfliers and all the rest dead or maimed he spat and how much longer dyou think well last as long as we do thats all sabrino answered with a shrug that tried for typical algarvian brio but didnt come up with much i have no fear any more and i have no hope either we do what we do as long as we can keep doing it and then he shrugged again after that what difference would it make anyhow not much orosio pointed to the road that led east out of pontremoli they dont think what were doing now makes much difference either algarvians poured east in a steady stream carrying whatever they could in earlier days in happier days sabrino had watched from the air as unkerlanters fled west before king mezentios men clogging the roads for king swemmels soldiers now the shoewhen the refugees had shoeswas on the other foot his dragonfliers had flamed refugee columns in unkerlant and dropped eggs on them now the men who flew dragons painted rockgray had their turn with sabrinos countrymen maybe some of them will get away sabrino said fighting to keep despair from overwhelming him altogether maybe theyll get to parts of the kingdom the lagoans and kuusamans are overrunning that should keep them alive the islanders dont kill for the sport of it anyhow how many dead kaunians he wondered how long would other kingdoms throw that in algarves face generations probably and who could blame them i tried to talk mezentio out of it sabrino thought as far as people in algarve go that gives me clean hands powers above help us all orosio said you think its lost then you think we have no chance no matter what king mezentio says aye i think that sabrino answered dont you reluctantly the squadron commander nodded all right then sabrino said what do we do next fight as hard as we can as long as we can orosio said what else is there nothing i can see sabrino told him not a single fornicating thing as orosio had he spat into the muck and im not doing it for king mezentio this for king mezentio he spat again if it werent for what mezentio did back in the first autumn of the war with unkerlant wed have a better chance nowand nobody would hate us quite so much had orosio taken that back to the ears of men who cared about such thingsto king mezentios equivalent of inspectors sabrino thought scornfully the wing commander would have found himself in trouble as if trying to keep up the fight against the unkerlanters werent trouble enough but sabrino knew his squadron commander well enough to be sure orosio would sooner be flamed out of the sky than betray him what orosio did say was well if its not for the king and its not for the kingdom why not just pack it in who says its not for the kingdom sabrino looked back toward that unending stream of algarvians fleeing eastward the longer we keep going the longer we hold back swemmels whoresons the more people will have the chance to get away thats worth doing curse it ah orosio didnt need long to think it over this time youre right sir weve got to do what we can however much that isor however little sabrino raised his voice to call to the chief dragonhandler sergeant a word with you if you please aye sir the fellow hurried up to him what can i do for you sir we were just going to feed the beasts thats what i wanted to ask you about sabrino said did that shipment of cinnabar you were talking about ever get down here from the north without it our dragons are only flaming half as far as the ones the unkerlanters fly oh that sorry sir no the sergeant shook his head i dont think we can expect any more either i heard today swemmels men have overrun the mines south of bonorva that was about the last cinnabar we had left sir and we had to try and parcel it out amongst all the dragons weve still got in the air the last of the cinnabar sabrino didnt know why it surprised him hed seen this day coming when the algarvians were driven out of the cinnabarrich austral continentafter their murderous magic went wrong there as foreign magic had a way of doing and wrecked their own armyand especially after they didnt swarm past sulingen and into the cinnabar mines of the mamming hills in southern unkerlant hed seen it coming and seen it coming and it was finally here orosio put the best face on things he could well sir our job just got a little harder thats all their job for most of the past two years had been impossible orosio surely knew that as well as sabrino did sabrino let out another weary sigh fishing without a net or a line thats what well be doing how many minnows can we grab out of the water with our bare hands fish sir the sergeant of dragonhandlers looked confused a solid capable man when doing what he knew how to do he wouldnt have known a metaphor had one strolled up wagging its tail sabrino almost envied him he wished he were more ignorant himself these days he ducked into his tent a meal of sorts waited there rye bread and a little crock of butter and a jug of spirits sabrino shook his head change the spirits to ale and his barbarous ancestors would have eaten like this in the days before they ever dreamt of challenging the might of the kaunian empire new barbarians at the gates now sabrino thought he wondered whether he meant the unkerlanters or his own people he shrugged a fine flamboyant algarvian shrug what difference did it make really he drank more of his supper than he ate and went to bed with wits whirling when he woke up the next morning his throbbing head seemed altogether in keeping with the general state of the world or the algarvian portion thereof his head would eventually improve he had his doubts about the algarvian portion of the world bread liberally smeared with butter did nothing to beat back his hangover they did grease his stomach so the slug of spirits he poured down after them didnt hurt so much when the spirits mounted to his head he felt human again in a melancholy way how any algarvian could feel anything but melancholy these days was beyond him the day was cool and cloudy with a threat of rain in the air sabrino wouldnt have wanted to face bright sunshine just then he started over to the crystallomancers tent to find out where along the tattered front his dozen or so dragons could do the most good before he got there someone called his name he turned he knew he stared he couldnt help it the smiling young fellow striding toward him might have come out of the early days the triumphant days of the war it wasnt so much that his uniform tunic and kilt were clean and new and well pressed though at this stage of things that seemed a minor prodigy to sabrino of itself but the strangers expression and bearing seemed to say the past two years and more had been nothing but a bad dream sabrino wished it were so unfortunately he knew better pleased to make your acquaintance colonel the younger man said holding out his arm as he and sabrino clasped wrists he went on i have the honor to be called almonte sir he wore a majors rank badges and prominent on his left breast a mages insigne pleased to make your acquaintance sabrino echoed though anything but sure he was pleased what can i do for you no colonel its what i can do for you almonte was excessively glib he put sabrino in mind of a commercial traveler peddling silver spoons that would show the brass beneath inside a month he had plenty of brass himself he continued how would you like to lick the unkerlanters all the way back to their own kingdom if i could lick them back half a mile id be tolerably pleased sabrino answered in algarves hour of desperation all sorts of maniacs were getting their chances for how could they make things worse what have you got in mind riding with you to smite the enemy from the air with a new particularly potent sorcery ive devised almonte answered have you tried it before sabrino asked if you have how did it go im still here almonte answered so are the unkerlanters sabrino said dryly almonte gave him a reproachful stare i am but one man colonel i do what i can for king mezentio and algarve i hope you can say the same if he thought he would make sabrino feel guilty he erred futter you major the wing commander said not bothering to raise his voice i fought on the ground in the six years war and ive been at the front in this one since the day it started i dont owe algarve any more than ive already given before i decide whether i want you on a dragon with me suppose you tell me just what your precious spell is and what you think it can do to the unkerlanters biting his lip in anger almonte plunged into his explanation he plainly didnt know how technical to be sometimes he talked down to sabrino others his words went over the dragonfliers head what he aimed to do was clear enough loose horror and destruction on swemmels men from the air how he proposed to go about it sabrino didnt hit him afterwards he wondered why his stomach lurching as if his dragon had dived without warning he said get out of my sight this instant or ill blaze you where you stand this makes killing kaunians clean by comparison desperate times take desperate measures the mage declared king mezentio had said the same thing just before the algarvian wizards started butchering blonds sabrino hadnt been able to stop him he was the king this fellow if you want to try that major id sooner see the unkerlanters smash us down sabrino said i shall return with orders from your superiors almonte snapped fine sabrino said you can go up on my dragon or on any dragon in this wing but theres no guarantee youll come down almonte stalked off he didnt come back sabrino hadnt thought he would in the blockhouse not far from the hostel in the naantali district pekka spun a globe globes and maps were more than just pictures of the world as even the sages of the kaunian empire had realized they were also in their own way applications of and invitations to the law of similarity pekka looked from one of her colleagues to another this is our last great test she said and they all nodded if everything goes as it should we can use this sorcery against any place in the world from here they all nodded raahe and alkio piilisand fernao pekka did her best to treat him the same way she treated the other theoretical sorcerers he didnt like that his eyes so like a kuusamans showed as much she hadnt been in his bedshe hadnt wanted to be in anyones bedsince learning of leinos death but for a couple of trips back to kajaani to see her son and her sister shed thrown herself into her sorcery using work as an anodyne where someone else might have used spirits he couldnt very well complain not here in front of everyone what he did say was the blockhouse seems empty today compared to so many of the things weve done no secondary sorcerers here for instancejust a crystallomancer we dont need secondary sorcerers not for this pekka waved at the bank of cages full of rats and rabbits well be sending the energy we release from the beasts so far away we can safely keep the cages here i want to send the energy to trapani she thought savagely i want to lash the capital of algarve with a whip of fire till nothing there still stands but what good would that do it wouldnt bring leino back to life nothing could do that a day at a time she was realizing the finality of death shall we begin raahe asked quietly she was holding alkios hand she and her husband were ten or fifteen years older than pekka but smiling like a couple of newlyweds aye pekka said one harsh word whom have i she wondered not leino not any more not ever i did have fernao i could have him again is he what i really want or was he just someone to keep me warm while leino was far away she didnt know she was afraid to find out im also too busy to find out she recited the kuusaman ritual words that preceded every spell save one cast in an emergency then she spun the globe again this time she purposely stopped it her fingernail tapped what looked like a fly speck in the eastern bothnian ocean becsehely she pronounced the gyongyosian name as best she could everyone is supposed to be off the island everyone had better be off the island fernao said anyone who stayed behind would be very sorry i begin pekka said and started incanting after so many runs through spells like this she cast another one with almost as much confidence and aplomb as if she were a practical mage herself no thats leino she thought and felt again the hole in her life that was leino but she couldnt dwell on it not now the spell came first she felt the sorcerous energy building inside the blockhouse the animals in the cages felt it too they scurried this way and that some tried to get out some tried to bury under the shavings and sawdust on the cage floors to hide from what was happening that wouldnt help them but they didnt know it wouldnt pekka chanted on the passes that went with the incantation were second nature to her now the other theoretical sorcerers stood by lending strength and standing ready to rush to her aid if in spite of everything she faltered that had happened before she missed master siuntiodead at the algarvians hands tooand master ilmarinen fernao had saved her before she didnt want to think about that and again she didnt have to the animals were growing frantic now the rats squeaking in fear and alarm pekka knew an abstract pity for them better you than so many kaunians or unkerlanters or even gyongyosians who are proud to volunteer their throats to the knife glowing blue lines of sorcerous energy stretched between cages of young beasts and their grandparents those lines grew brighter by the moment brighter and brighter and all at once they flashed intolerably brilliant pekkas eyes were closed against the glare by then but that flash pierced her to the quick even so when she opened her eyes afterwards greenpurple lines seemed printed across the world slowly slowly they faded corruptions ripe reek filled the blockhouse but only for a moment the older rats and rabbits in the cages aged so catastrophically fast they went past rotting to bare bones far quicker than the blink of an eye the younger ones by contrast were propelled backwards chronologically back to the days long before they were born had they ever truly existed then the mathematics there were indeterminate but for sawdust and shavings the cages that had held them were empty now divergent series pekka murmured sure enough that was how to get the greatest release of sorcerous energy we did everything as planned raahe said now we find out if our calculations were right thats the interesting part or so ilmarinen would say pekka replied she hoped the cantankerous old master mage was all right losing him on top of all the other disasters of war would have been almost too much to bear deliberately forcing the thought from her mind she turned to the crystallomancer make the etheric connection to the searaven aye mistress pekka the crystallomancer bent over her glassy sphere and murmured the charm that would link the blockhouse to the kuusaman cruiser gliding along a ley line a few miles off the beaches of becsehely her first attempt failed the crystal refused to flare with light she muttered something under her breath then spoke aloud it should have worked let me try again all right pekka said nervously the amount of energy theyd released if theyd miscalculated even by a little it might have come down on the searaven instead of the empty island at which theyd aimed but then the crystal did light up after a moment the flash faded and a naval officers face appeared in the globe here you are mistress pekka the crystallomancer said here is captain waino powers above be praised pekka murmured as she hurried over to stand before the crystal she raised her voice hello captain please describe what if anythingyou and your crew observed on becsehely if anything waino exclaimed mistress as far as that islands concerned its the end of the fornicating worldpardon my valmieran pekka smiled youre a naval man and you talk like what you are as you say mistress waino sounded like a man whod just been through an earthquake everything was normal as you please and then lightning slammed down out of a clear sky and things blew upit was as though every dragon in the world dropped a couple of eggs on becsehely at the same time as the lightning hit it but there werent any dragons behind pekka the other theoretical sorcerers cheered and applauded somebody gave her a glass of applejack she didnt sip from it but asked the officer what can you see of the island now not forn waino caught himself not much its still covered in smoke and dust and steams we will send men ashore for a further examination as things settle down very well captain thank you pekka nodded to the crystallomancer who broke the etheric connection after a pull at the apple brandynow shed earned itpekka said we can do this thing the other theoretical sorcerers cheered again they had glasses in their hands too trapani pekka thought again as they walked out to the sleighs to go back to the hostel gyorvar to teach ekrekek arpad a lesson hell never forget cottbus even if king swemmel ever needs the same kind of lesson she could feel the applejack but the knowledge of power felt still more intoxicating as she always did she rode with fernao the calendar said spring was here the landscape wouldnt listen to the calendar for another month maybe longer fresh snow had fallen the night before by the low gray clouds overhead more might come down any time a reindeerdrawn sleigh remained the best way to get around though blankets covered them and kept the driver from seeing what they did beneath fernao kept his hands to himself he hadnt tried pushing things after leino died he knew pekka well enough to understand that nothing would have been likelier to drive her away from him for good and shed stayed well apart from him on the trip out to the blockhouse now for the first time since that dreadful day she got the news she let her head rest on his shoulder maybe its the applejack she thought even if it isnt i can blame it on the applejack fernaos narrow eyes widened he put his arm around her she discovered she was glad to have it there she might not have been so glad had he tried to paw her but he didnt he didnt say anything either a kuusaman would have most lagoans she thought probably would he was wise to keep quiet when they got to the hostel they went upstairs together pekkas chamber was one floor higher than fernaos but she left the stairway with him he still didnt speak not till they stood inside his room then at last he said thank you i love you do i really love him pekka wondered do i love him in a way that might make my life whole again or at least not ripped to pieces do i love him in a way that would make me want him to help raise uto do i want to give uto a half brother or half sister by him i dont know not for sure but i think id better find out before she said our first times were accidents this wont be i mean it was she telling him or trying to convince herself she wasnt sure of that either fernao just nodded he said ive always meant it i know pekka answered and started to laugh men were supposed to be the ones who didnt want to get tied down women were supposed to look for loves that lasted she and fernao hadnt worked that way though maybe we will now she thought she stepped toward him at the same time as he was stepping toward her when they embraced the top of her head didnt come much past his shoulder that sometimes bothered her today it didnt seem to matter it mattered even less when they lay down together pekka wondered if she would if she could take any pleasure she wouldnt have worried if she hadnt sometimes having arms around her was enough but fernao took his time and paid what seemed like special attention to her the only thing that could have kept her from eventually arching her back and moaning was she couldnt imagine anything that could have certainly nothing did as she lay with her legs entwined with his she wondered how much that truly mattered well she thought lazy in the afterglow it cant hurt all around krasta the servants at the mansion bustled like so many scurrying ants getting the place ready for her brothers marriage to the horrible bloodthirsty peasant wench with whom hed unaccountably become infatuated that was how krasta looked at the match at any rate and nothing was going to make her change her mind hardly anything ever made her change her mind a wedding invitation wouldnt have done it she was sure of that it didnt matter though no invitation had been forthcoming skarnu and merkela expected her to stay in her bedchamber by herself while they celebrated they had their nerve as far as she was concerned worst of all was that they would probably get what they expected had she not been enormously pregnant she might well have done her best to interrupt to upstage the ceremony she so despised being about the size of a behemoth though did put a crimp in such plans all she wanted to do was have the baby and get it over with shed been feeling that way for most of the past month even bauska was pressed into the service of skarnu and merkela which infuriated krasta afresh her maidservant did show her a little sympathy when she had time to make an appearance saying oh aye milady before i finally had brindza i would have paid anything to get her the blazes out of there i should say so krasta exclaimed she rested her hands on her enormous belly her arms seemed too short to go round herself though of course they werent and she had something else on her mind too something bauska couldnt have dwelt upon and once this baby finally comes out everyone will see its a proper little blond not some nasty algarvians bastard bauskas mouth tightened she left even though krasta hadnt told her she could krasta snarled something vile under her breath to her way of thinking having a normal valmieranlooking baby would automatically wash her clean of all the times shed opened her legs for colonel lurcanio anyone would be able to look at the child and see at a glance that when it really mattered shed lain with one of her own countrymenand a nobleman to boot her womb had been tightening every so often for some weeks shed got used to it though she found it annoyingit squeezed on the baby which was uncomfortable to her and it evidently made the baby uncomfortable too for the little brat always did some extra thrashing and wiggling after things eased up krasta didnt like that either by now the baby was big enough to kick and poke hard and didnt care what tender parts of her it abused in the process three days before her brothers wedding the labor pains started in earnest they were rhythmic they were regular and they were much more irksome than any pangs shed known before she cursed before calling for bauska shed hoped the baby would wait till the middle of the marriage ceremony if shed started screaming for a midwife then that would have taken everybodys mind off the catastrophe befalling her family but no such luck when she became convinced these pains werent going away she shouted for bauska her maidservant took her own sweet time getting there when she did krasta demanded what was the name of that woman what woman milady bauska asked krasta had another pang then and clenched her teeth against it that told bauska everything she needed to know oh the midwife she said shes called kudirka shall i have her summoned no of course not krasta snapped i just wanted to know her name for no reason at all and then in case the maidservant was a fool or felt like pretending to be one she made herself perfectly clear aye fetch her this is going to be over and i am going to show everybody what the truth is bauska didnt answer that she went away which satisfied krasta well enough presently the carriage clattered down the walk and away from the mansion after what was about an hour and seemed much longer it came rattling back by then krastas labor pains had advanced to the point where she hardly noticed its return kudirka walked into the bedchamber without bothering to knock she was as broadshouldered as an unkerlanter and had a face like a frog but something in her manner got through even to krasta take off your trousers sweetie and lets find out whats going on in there the midwife said all right another pang seized krasta before she could kudirka waited till it was over then yanked the trousers off the marchioness herself she proceeded to feel krastas belly and then to probe her a good deal more intimately than any lover ever had krasta yelped dont you worry about a thing kudirka told her your hips are nice and wide you wont have any trouble at all a few hours of grunting then some pushing and then theres a baby in your arms easy as you please good krasta said it all sounded simple and straightforward it didnt turn out to be that way of course it turned out to be boring and painful and exhausting she discovered exactly why the process was called labor sweat plastered her hair to her forehead it seemed to go on forever and to hurt more and more as it continued at one point krasta started cursing every man shed ever lain with and cursing kudirka too the midwife took it in stride its a good sign honey she said it means youll be ready to do your pushing pretty soon theres more krasta groaned shed been going through this for an eternityit was getting dark outside and shed started in the morning kudirka only nodded then she went to the bedchamber and spoke to someone krasta paid little attention till merkela came in no matter how far gone she was that registered get out of here she squawked no the peasant woman answered i am going to see this baby before you have the chance to do anything with it or to it if its blond it is if its not i will know that too krasta cursed her as savagely as she knew how she had no inhibitions left none whatever merkela gave back as good as she got till kudirka nudged her even she respected the midwife and fell silent i have to shit krasta said i have to shit more than i ever had to shit in my whole life thats the baby kudirka said go ahead and push it out saying that was one thing doing it turned out to be something else again krasta felt as if she were trying to pass a boulder not a turd and then to her disgust she did pass a turd without any fuss merkela disposed of the sheet on which it lay it must come of growing up on a farm krasta thought she knows all about turds then she stopped thinking altogether stopped everything except struggling to force the baby out of her she hardly heard kudirkas encouragement the world everything but her labor seemed very far away she took a deep breath then let out an explosive noise somewhere between a grunt and a squeal thats it the midwife said do that twice more three times at the most and youll have yourself a baby krasta didnt know how many times she made that desperate effort she was beyond caring by then at last though just when she seemed certain to split in two everything suddenly got easier the babys head is out merkela said a couple of more pushes and its done kudirka added the head is the big part everything else will be easy for a miracle she was right she guided out the babys shoulders and torso and legs she and merkela tied off the umbilical cord merkela cut it with a pair of shears krasta hardly noticed that she was busy passing the afterbirth a disgusting bit of business no one had told her about and one that cost her the undersheet on her bed you have a boy merkela said she held the squalling baby in the crook of her arm with practiced ease not so long before her son by skarnu had been so tiny through a haze of exhaustion krasta said ill name him valnu for his father kudirka said nothing at all merkela laughed and laughed the wolfish quality in the peasant womans mirth made krasta shiver no matter how weary she was merkela held the baby under her nose so close her eyes almost crossed you were an algarvians whore i dont care who else you might have spread your legs for but you were an algarvians whore and by what comes out of your own twat you prove what went into it as newborns often are krastas baby son was born almost bald but the fine fuzz on his head was of a strawberry tinge no purely valmieran babys head would have had it was in fact nearly identical in color to the hair of bauskas bastard halfbreed daughter brindza laughing still merkela said if youre going to name it for its father you stinking slut you can call it lurcanio the weariness krasta knew then had nothing to do with the ordeal shed just been through shed spent so much time and effort trying to convince everyone including herself that the child she was carrying was indeed valnus shed mostlymade herself believe it shed made everyone else wonder and now to be betrayed by something as trivial as a few strands of hair on the babys oddly coneshaped head she presumed that would change even if the brats wretched hair color never did it all seemed most unfair as did anything that didnt go just the way she wished it would have i she began shut up merkelas voice was flat and hard and vicious the voice of a wildcat seeing prey it had long stalked at last helpless before it she gave the baby to kudirka then grabbed the scissors shed used to cut the cord ive waited too cursed long for this by the powers above but now you get whats coming to you she grabbed a shock of krastas hair and hacked it off not a fingers breadth from her scalp powers below eat you you cant krasta said merkela slapped her in the face only lurcanio had ever dared do that to her before shut up i told you merkela snapped she closed the shears and aimed them at one of krastas eyes what im doing is the least of what you deserve the least do you hear me you can take it or ill give you plenty more id love to do you hear me you dont know how much id love to the shears jerked closer krasta closed her eyes and flinched she couldnt help herself at any other time she would have fought regardless of whether she had a weapon of her own exhausted as shed never been exhausted sick in spirit as well she kept her eyes closed and let merkela do as she would at last though the hateful snipsnip of the shears made her exclaim futter you a valmieran futters me merkela retorted snipsnip i didnt have a stinking redhead leave silver on the dresser every time he stuck it in snipsnip it wasnt like that but krasta didnt say it what point merkela wouldnt have believed her and wouldnt have cared even if she had believed her at last it was over kudirka set the babythe halfalgarvian bastard just like bauskas on krastas breast it rooted and began to suck krasta didnt burst into tears she was too worn for that but one after another they trickled down her cheeks no one had ever formally released skarnu from his service in the valmieran army and unlike most of his countrymen hed never given up the fight against the algarvians and so when he proposed to merkela that he wed her while wearing a captains uniform she nodded thats how i first saw you you know coming toward the farmhouse with raunu at your side she said remembering what hed gone through during his kingdoms inglorious collapse almost five years before he answered i hope ill be cleaner at the ceremony than i was then merkela laughed laughter came easy for her now that shed finally proved right about krasta it was as if shed won a brandnew victory against the algarvians long after theyd left priekule and so in a way she had skarnu could have felt victorious about his own sister too he didnt all he felt was sad krasta had made the wrong choice and now she was paying for it hundreds thousands of women across valmiera and jelgava had paid as much a good many men whod collaborated with the redheads had paid or would pay far more tomorrow merkela murmured she laid a fond hand on skarnus arm it still hardly feels real it feels like something out of one of the fairy tales my grandmother would tell me when i was a little girl you had better get used to it milady skarnu said solemnly for its the truth that he was marrying at all still struck him as surprising that he was marrying a commoner would have seemed treason to his class before the war little gedominu who was toddling around the bedchamber they shared fell down the damage obviously was anywhere from minimal to imaginary but he wailed mama and started to cry anyway merkela scooped him up its all right she said after a moment or two in her arms it was all right too skarnu wished his own hurts were so easily fixed that thought had hardly crossed his mind when merkela flicked one of those hurts she ruffled gedominus fine golden hair and murmured you look the way youre supposed to thats more than anybody can say about your nasty little cousin skarnu sighed he wished krastas baby had looked like a proper valmieran that would have taken the taint of scandal off the whole family as things were he sighed and said its not the babys fault it certainly isnt merkela agreed its her fault she still didnt want to call krasta skarnus sister ever since theyd first learned krasta was keeping company with a redhead theyand merkela especiallyhad denied skarnu even had a sister that was harder now that they were living in the same house with krasta but merkela managed she went on she was going to name the baby valnu too bad she couldnt skarnu said sooner or later these things have to come to an end not yet by the powers above merkela declared when she had lurcanios bastard i told her she should name it for him skarnu sighed that doesnt help you know krastas going to be your sisterinlaw whether you like it or not he held up a hand you dont youve told me you dont need to tell me again just remember valnu put in a good word for her hed be dead if shed opened her mouth at the wrong time then there wouldnt have been any doubt who the babys father was she opened her mouth at plenty of the wrong times merkela said while skarnu was still spluttering over that his fiancée added if shed done it once more she wouldnt have had the little bastard in the first place that only made skarnu splutter again in the end he decided not to push the argument he wasnt going to change merkelas mind part of himnot half but close to itagreed with her anyhow what he most wanted now was to get through the wedding ceremony without any fresh scandal enlisting merkela in that effort was bound to be futile trying to enlist krasta in it was bound to be worse than futile skarnu had spent a lot of time away from home but not so much that he didnt know what to do in such cases he approached valmiru who nodded wisely you are holding the ceremony out of doors is it not so the butler said when skarnu agreed that he washe could hardly deny it not with the pavilion already up behind the mansion valmiru nodded again very well i shall make a point of allowing no physical disruption i cannot necessarily promise there will be no commotion from within the house however i understand that believe me valmiru ill be grateful for anything you can doand ill make it worth your while too skarnu said the butlers expression didnt change in any way skarnu could have defined but he contrived to look pleased nonetheless they were indoors skarnu looked up at the sky even so it had better not rain thats all ive got to say to his vast relief it didnt the wedding day dawned fine and mild it might have come from the end of springtime not the beginning the ceremony was set for noon guests started arriving a couple of hours early servants steered them around the mansion to the pavilion in back of it giving the temporary structure that name could not disguise its origins it was in fact an outsized tent borrowed from the valmieran army being an officer whod never been formally discharged had certain advantages when it came to laying ones hands on such things every now and then an alert listenerskarnu for instancemight have heard a newborn baby wailing inside the mansion most of the guests knew by then that the baby had hair of not quite the right color a couple of people clapped skarnu on the back in sympathy valnu gave him a comic shrug almost exaggerated enough to have come from an algarvian as if to say well it could have been mine at one point not long before the ceremony was to begin a listener would not have needed to be alert in the least to hear krasta trying to come outside and expressing her detailed opinions of the people who kept her from doing so she waxed eloquent in a vulgar way several people shrugged at skarnu now whitemustached old marstalu the duke of klaipeda conducted the ceremony as far as skarnu was concerned conducting a wedding was about what he was good for hed commanded the valmieran troops opposing algarve in the early days of the war and had had not a clue about beating back mezentios men his nephew had been a collaborator but that brush didnt tar him hes splendid looking merkela whispered as she and skarnu approached him skarnu thought she looked quite splendid herself in tunic and trousers of glowing green silk the color of fertility in valmiera since the days of the kaunian empire that it went well with his own darker green captains uniform was a happy coincidence marstalu looked like a kindly grandfather he spoke classical kaunian as if it were his birthspeech he had enough years on him to make that seem almost plausible his backward cast of mind during the fighting made it seem plausible too but skarnu did his best not to dwell on that skarnus own command of the old language left something to be desired merkela knew next to none but theyd rehearsed when the duke stopped and looked expectantly at them that meant hed just asked if they agreed to live together as man and wife aye skarnu said loudly merkela echoed the agreement in a softer voice it is accomplished duke marstalu boomed still in classical kaunian then the formal part of the ceremony concluded he grinned and switched to ordinary everyday valmieran kiss her boy before i beat you to it aye sir skarnu saluted ive never had an order i was gladder to obey he gathered merkela in all the guests cheered and whooped and clapped their hands people pelted the newlyweds with flowers and nutsmore symbols of fertility some of the nuts flew back and forth in among the crowd as if rival armies were tossing eggs at each other skarnu had seen that happen at other weddings too after the ceremony people ate and drank and danced and gossiped if any more squawks came from the mansion the noise the guests made drowned them out somebody slapped viscount valnus face skarnu was at the far end of the pavilion then and never did find out whether valnu had offended a man or a woman and then towards evening the guests began to drift away valnu said i had a splendid time getting slapped hadnt bothered him in the least he leered and added but not nearly so fine a time as the two of you are going to haveim sure of that he kissed merkela and then for good measure kissed skarnu too after that whistling and grinning he took his leave impossible man merkela said to which skarnu could only nod she glanced over to her new husband are you sure he was on our side during the occupation positive skarnu answered his new bride sighed servants had charge of little gedominu for the evening skarnu held the door to the bedchamber open for merkela after she went in he closed it and barred it behind them she smiled no ones going to bother us tonight and i wont try to get away youd better not skarnu took her in his arms it wasnt as if they hadnt made love before the son they werent watching proved that but the first time as man and wife still seemed special i love you skarnu told merkela just before pleasure overwhelmed him he wasnt sure she heard him she wasnt far from her own joy but then as their hearts both slowed she reached up to stroke his cheek and said you must in wondering tones some small part of her must have wondered if he would abandon her when he could it being a wedding night skarnu got other chances to prove how wrong that was he and merkela were both sodden with slumber when someone rapped on the bedchamber door much too early the next morning his first coherent words were some of the harsher ones hed picked up as a soldier but then valmirus voice came through the door your pardon my lord milady but king gainibu summons you to the palace at once a carriage awaits that put a different light on things well be down directly skarnu said he and merkela dressed as fast as they could dragged brushes through their hair and hurried out to the front of the mansion where a carriage did indeed wait half an hour later they were bowing before the king of valmiera congratulations to you both gainibu said he still looked like a man who sometimes had too much to drink but he didnt sound like a man whod done it lately like his kingdom he was recovering from the occupation he went on ive been thinking about what sort of present to give you and i believe ive found a good one youre too kind your majesty skarnu murmured merkela kept silent speaking to the king had seemed even stranger to her than marrying a noble gainibu said the estate formerly held by the late count enkuru and his son the late count simanu has been adjudged forfeit to the crown because of their treason and collaboration with the foe skarnu nodded that was the noble estate nearest pavilosta hed had a good deal to do with enkurus demise he and merkela had both had a great deal to do with killing simanu the king continued i have it in mind to raise that estate from a county to a marquisate and to confer it on the two of you that way i know it will stay in loyal hands what do you say to the notion skarnu glanced at merkela her eyes glowed with astonished delight she found words now we say thank you your majesty thank you from the bottom of our hearts with a chuckle gainibu remarked shes speaking for you already is she well im glad youre pleased this will also let you get away from krasta and from her unfortunately irregular offspring oh aye ive heard about that and may i make one suggestion he didnt wait for anyones approval before giving it take as many of your household staff as care to go merkela laughed out loud at that a little more reluctantly so did skarnu he didnt think his sister would be very happy he also didnt think king gainibu cared for as long as hed seen only their soldiers sidroc had been able to hold on to his admiration for the algarvians their fighting men knew what they were doing even with the odds against them as they certainly were now footsoldiers and behemoth crews and the men who served eggtossers and dragonfliers went about their jobs with a matteroffact competence hed never seen from his own people from the unkerlanters or from the yaninans not that that last was saying much now though plegmunds brigade was actually inside algarve fighting not to take the war to the unkerlanters but to hold them out of trapani sidroc and his comrades werent just dealing with algarvian soldiers any more they had to deal with algarvian civilians too and algarvian civilians to put it mildly left him unimpressed get your crap out of the road lady he shouted to a woman who seemed intent on taking everything she owned with her as she fled eastthis though she had only a tiny handcart in which to carry it all get it out of the way or well fornicating well kick it out of the way for you the woman in question was one of the plump middleaged sort who make a life out of running their townsand their neighbors affairs getting orders rather than giving them didnt sit well with her i dont know what the world is coming to she said when we have barbarians loose in the streets of our cities futter you lady sidroc said cheerfully you dont let us do what were supposed to be doing king swemmels boysll get in here you think were barbarians were on your side you stupid twat the unkerlanters take this place about twenty of emll line up and theyll all futter youif they dont decide youre too stinking ugly to waste cock on and bash in your stupid head instead his squadforthwegians and a couple of blonds from the phalanx of valmiera which had fallen on even harder times than plegmunds brigade laughed raucously the algarvian woman gaped as if she couldnt believe her ears i shall find a civilized man she said and flounced off she didnt have to flounce far before finding lieutenant puliano he cut her off as she started to spin her tale of woe shut up he said i heard corporal sidroc and i know bloody well hes right he waved go on through her stuff boys she doesnt need it and its just in the way sidroc kicked a brasswired bird cage as if it were a football on a pitch the door flew open as it rolled a couple of finches from siauliabrilliant little birds all scarlet and gold and greenflew out of it and away he hoped theyd do all right so far from home the war wasnt their fault keep moving the lieutenant called you see more junk in the road just go on through it ceorl did just that and seemed to take considerable pleasure in trampling the possessions the algarvians in the town had spent a lifetime gathering you ask me these whoresons dont deserve to win the war he said if they cant figure out what in blazes is important and what theyd better leave behind the powers below are welcome to em by all the signs the powers below were going to get their hands on a lot of algarvians regardless of whether they knew what to do with their goods and theyll probably get their hands on me too sidroc thought he shrugged hed stuck with the redheads this far he couldnt very well abandon them now he couldnt even strip off his uniform find civilian clothes and do his best to pretend hed never been in the army he looked about as unlike an algarvian as it was possible for anyone this side of a black zuwayzi to look he would have had a better chance pretending to be an unkerlanter some few algarvian soldiers at least were doing their best to slide out of the war maybe some of them got away with it not all of them did as the men of plegmunds brigade tramped out of the town they passed three redheaded corpses hanging from trees by the side of the road the placards tied round their necks warned this is what deserters get they deserve it lieutenant puliano said anybody who gives up on his kingdom when it needs him the most deserves everything that happens to him and more besides the forthwegians in algarvian service solemnly nodded unlike the redheads they couldnt even try to go home again the handful of blonds from valmiera also nodded they really couldnt go home again they were far worse traitors in the eyes of their countrymen than the men of plegmunds brigade were to theirs but sidroc had some gloomy thoughts of his own as he marched by the hanged deserters even mezentios men are starting to see theres no hope left for them if they can see it id have to be a cursed fool to miss it myself he knew he wasnt the brightest fellow around if hed ever had any doubts on that score spending years getting compared to his clever cousin ealstan would have cured them he laughed none too pleasantly if ealstan was so fornicating smart why did he fall in love with a kaunian girl i wonder if he ever found out he was getting that redheaded officers sloppy seconds he laughed again i hope so watch your step here boys puliano called you dont want to go off the road or youd end up arsedeep in mud this is swampy country it doesnt look too bad somebody said and indeed it didnt in fact it looked greener than most of the firmer ground farther west on dry land spring was just starting to make itself known here though the swamp plants or most of them had kept their color through the winter the road might almost have been passing through a meadow sudaku stepped up alongside sidroc in his valmieranflavored algarvian he said this swamp is a sign we grow near to trapani i passed through the capital and through this country on the way west to join the phalanx of valmiera getting near trapani eh sidroc said and the blonds head bobbed up and down sidroc grunted that doesnt sound so good no the kaunian said but by now what is left for us to do but die like heroes sidroc grunted again i didnt sign up to be a hero but what else are we fighting to the death for a cause surely lost sudaku persisted who knows come to that who cares sidroc said besides if we lose when we losewhos going to call us heroes winners are heroes they get the girls and they dont get their uniforms mussed in the stories were just the fellows who blaze at them and miss everyone is a hero in his own story the kaunian said the only trouble is our stories i fear will be ending soon before sidroc could answer thatnot that it needed much answering for it seemed pretty obviously truesomeone toward the rear of the weary shambling column of men let out a frightened shout dragons unkerlanter dragons looking back over his shoulder sidroc spied the great rockgray shapes bearing down on his comradesand on him he wasnt ready for his story to end quite yet into the mud he yelled and dove for the side of the road it was the only hope the soldiers had and they made the most of it they could like sidroc they floundered into the swamp as far as they could go some of them blazed others just tried to cover themselves in ooze the dragons roared fiercely as they belched out fire none of the flames came too close to sidroc but he felt the heat from them all the same what happened to the men whod stayed on the road wasnt pretty survivors gathered themselves and trudged on that was all they could do ceorl was as filthy as sidroc you son of a whore i thought theydve got rid of you a long time ago he said youre tougher than i gave you credit for thanks i suppose sidroc said up the road was a town called laterza it had taken as much damage as any other algarvian town not far from trapani standing in the middle of the main street though as if on a normal day was a captain wearing a mages emblem ah good he said when he saw what sorts of soldiers lieutenant puliano led a band of mercenaries and auxiliaries sidroc didnt like his tone or the sneer on his face ive been through too much for him to have any business looking at me like that he thought the mage went on you will furnish me all your kaunians at once sidroc didnt like the sound of that at all neither evidently did puliano who said oh i will will i and why is that because it will aid the war and because i your superior order it the captain replied so i can kill them sidroc translated in his own mind he wasnt the only one who made the same translation sudaku pushed his way forward the man from the phalanx of valmiera stuck his stick in the mages face do you want anything to do with me or my countrymen he asked coldly arrest this man the mage gabbled what for lieutenant puliano said with a smile seems like a pretty good question to me maybe youd better answer it do you want anything to do with me or mine sudaku repeated the mage had nerve whatever algarvians lacked that was rarely it he thought for a long time before finally shaking his head and even after he did he shook a fist at lieutenant puliano its because of people like you that our kingdoms in the state its in he said bitterly because of people like me puliano returned have you looked in a mirror any time lately whats that supposed to mean the mage demanded he really didnt know sidroc could see as much that was as alarming as anything else that had happened to him latelya pretty frightening thought when you got down to it sudaku said i think you had better disappear i think that if you do not disappear something bad will happen to you again even with a stick in his face the algarvian wizard seemed on the point of saying no if he had the blond from the phalanx of valmiera would have blazed his brains out sidroc was sure of that the mage evidently came to the same conclusion he turned on his heel and stalked away his stiff back radiated outrage poor fellow the kaunian said he is angry at me because i do not propose to let him kill me well too bad he turned to lieutenant puliano thank you sir for thinking i am worth more to algarve alive mages are a pack of cursed fools the redhead said if they were half as smart as they think they are theyd be twice as smart as they really are i know what a good soldiers worth i havent got any idea what that bastards worth and why should i waste time finding out he looked around at his ragtag followers come on boys lets get going wizards or no wizards weve still got a war to fight how much longer can we keep fighting sidroc wondered he had no idea but the stick in his hand still held charges the unkerlanters hadnt nailed him yet they wont have an easy time doing it either he told himself and marched deeper into algarve on toward trapani marshal rathar muttered something vile under his breath his army had just tried to throw another bridgehead across the scamandro and the algarvians had just crushed it cant be helped general vatran said philosophically we still havent built up enough men or supplies to do a proper job yet logically rathar knew that was true but logic had only so much to do with it he glanced over at the portrait of king swemmel on the wall his imagination had to be running away with him but he thought the king was glaring at him in particular it could have worked he said it was worth a try oh aye vatran nodded thats why we gave it a blaze but it wasnt a sure thing and it didnt pan out wont be long now before we can do it right i know but rathar still eyeing swemmels portrait had a bad feeling there would be some unpleasant conversations with the king before that happened he wondered if he could get away with telling the crystallomancers to tell swemmel he was indisposed probably not worse luck vatran shuffled through leaves of paper he pulled one out and handed it to rathar here lord marshal you said you wanted to see these i need to see them if thats what i think it is thats not the same thing as wanting to rathar took the paper and glanced through it sure enough it was what he thought it was he handed it back to vatran stinking werewolves vatran made a sour face trust the algarvians to come up with a name like that i dont care what you call them rathar said theyre a pack of cursed nuisances and no mistake he recognized the irony in his words while mezentios men occupied great stretches of unkerlant his own countrymen had made their lives miserable raiding their garrisons sabotaging ley lines and doing anything else they could to hurt the foe now with unkerlanter forces inside algarve the boot was on the other foot the redheads behind his lines were doing their best to disrupt his operations werewolves was a fancier more grandiose name than irregulars but they did the same job with a shrug vatran said when we catch em we hang em or we blaze em or we boil em that way they dont turn into anything worse than a nuisance a couple of years before algarvian generals had to have been saying the same thing about unkerlanter irregulars rathar had the same response they must have had once we win the war the trouble will go away mezentios men hadnt won the war if he didnt win it now he would deserve whatever swemmel chose to do to him vatran shuffled more papers theres still trouble with bandits back in the duchy of grelz too bandits of course was another name for irregulars and werewolves some of the grelzers whod aligned themselves with mezentio and against swemmel had been in grim earnest and kept up their fight against unkerlant even after the algarvians were driven east and out of their duchy but that problem had the same answer as the other one if we win here the bandits will quiet downand if they dont well root em out one at a time if we have to ayemakes sense vatran agreed now the next question and the one where losing the bridgehead really hurts rathar said how far west have the islanders come and how close to trapani have they got one of vatrans white eyebrows twitched theyre within about eighty miles sir he answered unhappily still moving forward pretty fast too curse them theyre our allies rathar said were not supposed to curse them were supposed to congratulate them he looked east congratulationscurse you vatran laughed though it really wasnt funny of course one reason theyre moving so fast is that the redheads have all their best soldiersall the best of whatever theyve got leftpointed at us that old old song rathar said were beating them anyhow the bastards and were beating them in spite of all the funny magic theyre throwing at us every time they try something new our mages have fresh hysterics vatran said theyve been doing that ever since the redheads started killing kaunians rathar replied sometimes they find an answer sometimes things just go wrong for the redheads and sometimes we have so many men and behemoths it doesnt matter anyway vatran let out a long heartfelt sigh ill be glad when its finally over and thats the truth he ran a hand through his curly white hair im too cursed old to go through what the algarvians have put us through not obvious itll be over even after we lick mezentio rathar said king swemmel hasnt said what hell do about gyongyos then maybe well all pack up and head westa long way west maybe vatran agreed but do you know what lord marshal even if we do i wont be nervous about it the way i have been ever since we started fighting the redheads even if the gongs should somehow lick usand i dont think they can do itit wouldnt be the end of the world if the algarvians had beaten us our kingdom was dead theydve ruled us like we were some barbarian principality up in siaulia and theyd never have let us back up on our feet again since rathar thought the older general was right he didnt argue with him the war with algarve was a war to the knife no doubt about it mezentios men might not have treated unkerlant and its people quite so harshly as they had the kaunians in forthweg but they wouldnt have made easy masters they hadnt made easy masters in the parts of unkerlant theyd held theyre arrogant whoresons and it cost them rathar thought if theyd pretended to come as liberators from swemmels hard rule half the kingdom would have gone over to them but they didnt think they needed to worry about what we thought they gave grelz an algarvian for a king they showed everybody they were even worse than swemmeland they paid for it and now well be the masters in big chunks of algarve and we wont be sweet to the redheads either someone hurried into the headquartersan unkerlanter major marshal rather he called ive got important news rathar looked up from the map table im here he said whats gone wrong now by the mans tone something had vatran looked up too sharply he picked up his mug of tea and started to sip from it here lord marshal the newcomer said ill have to show you he took a couple of steps toward the map tableand then stopped and yanked his short officers stick from his belt and swung it toward rathar the marshal of unkerlant had half a heartbeat to know what a fool hed been this is how general gurmun died flashed through his mind if the algarvians could sorcerously disguise one of their own to look like an unkerlanter up in forthweg why not on their own soil too but the beam never bit into his flesh vatran flung his heavy earthenware mug at the false majors face it caught him right in the teeth he howled and clutched at himself and his blaze went wild before his finger could find its way into the blazing hole again vatran and rathar were both grappling with him rathar wrenched the stick out of his hands the shouts and groans from the map chamber brought more soldiers rushing in they seized the major and after some fumbling tied him up hes gone mad sir a captaina veritable unkerlanter captainexclaimed no i dont think so rathar answered i think if we leave him alone for a few hours hell start looking like one of mezentios majors not like one of ours he switched to algarvian and addressed the wouldbe assassin isnt that right majoror whatever your real rank happens to be i dont know what youre talking about the fellow replied in unkerlanter holding no trace of any accent save that of cottbuscertainly no algarvian trill his mouth bled where the mug had caught himand where the two unkerlanter officers had hit him in the fight that followed aye tell us king mezentio didnt send you after the marshal general vatran jeered he didnt the man replied with a bloody grin king swemmel did if he aimed to produce consternation in the headquarters he succeeded horrified silence fell rathar himself broke it saying you lie if his majesty wants me dead he has no need to sneak in a murderer he could simply arrest me and his will would be done youd be too likely to rise against him and the men are too likely to follow you the fellow said all that had a certain ring of truth regardless of whether the failed assassin was what he claimed to be all the more reason then for marshal rather to speak in ringing tones you lie i am loyal and his majesty knows it he turned to his men take this lying wretch away do nothing to him for one day except keeping him under close guard when his looks change and show him for the algarvian he is let me know they dragged the false major out of the headquarters rathar hoped with all his heart the man would show himself to be an algarvian if he didnt the marshal didnt want to think about that being possessed of a disciplined mind he didnt instead he told vatran thank you and asked how were you so ready there vatran shrugged something about the way he looked something about the way he soundedit didnt feel quite right he just seemed eager to me rathar said maybe that was it vatran said rathar wondered if he was joking after a moment the marshal decided vatran wasnt after almost four grinding years of war against algarve how many unkerlanter officers had any eagerness left algarvians now algarvians went into everything with panache this fellow hadnt looked or sounded like one but hed seemed enough like one to make vatran at least wonderand that in turn had ended up saving rathars neck thank you the marshal said again youre welcome vatran replied he lowered his voice now we just have to hope the lousy bugger really is a redhead indeed rathar said and said no more could swemmel have been so daft as to choose this moment to try to be rid of him it didnt seem likely but the same held true for a lot of things swemmel did the crystallomancers call came long after midnight hes an algarvian reported the officer charged with guarding important captives powers above be praised rathar said and slept sound the rest of the night nine every now and then talsu began seeing men in jelgavan uniform in skrunda he didnt see many of them not compared to the swarms of kuusaman soldiers who kept going through his home town the ones he did see roused mixed feelings in him he was glad his kingdom showed signs of being able to defend itself again at least with the help of its allies he tried not to think of them as rescuers for the jelgavan soldiers he felt nothing but pity hed been one himself he knew what it was like for a while he hoped things might have changed since the disaster that led to jelgavas collapse four and a half years before after all king donalitu had spent most of that time in exile in lagoas the lagoans had a pretty good notion of what was what maybe donalitu had learned something in setubalthough the edicts hed issued since his return argued against it but the first jelgavan officer talsu saw strutting through the streets of skrunda smashed his hopes the major was young and slim and handsome not fat and homely like colonel dzirnavu talsus old regimental commander but the nobles badge on his chest and the way he shouted and screamed at the luckless men who had to follow him made memories talsu would sooner have forgotten come flooding back he didnt say anything about the fellow to his father never having gone into the army traku didnt know what it was like he idealized it in his mind too even after the way jelgava collapsed proved its army anything but ideal talsus father didnt want to hear criticism and complaints in whispersthe only sort of talk that gave even a hope of privacy in the crowded flattalsu spilled out his worries to gailisa when they both should have been asleep nothing has changed he said despair in his voice nothing the same arrogant idiots still have charge of us and if we ever have to do any fighting again powers above keep it from happening his wife broke in also whispering aye powers above keep it from happening indeed talsu agreed if we ever have to do any fighting again whoever we go up against will roll over us same as the algarvians did our men will want their officers dead and how can you fight like that instead of answering what was talsu was sure an unanswerable argument gailisa twisted in the narrow bed they shared to kiss him if she hoped to distract him she succeeded his arms went around her her breasts pressed against him through the thin fabric of their pyjama tunics a moment later she laughed very quietly he was pressing against her somewhere too he slid a hand under her tunic she sighed again softly as he caressed her his parents had the flats only bedroom to themselves his sister lay sleeping in her own cot only a few feet away if he and gailisa wanted to make love they had to do it stealthily ausra was good about staying asleepso good talsu wondered whether she sometimes knew what was going on and simply pretended not tobut he didnt want to bother her gailisa stroked him too he kissed her and reached under her trousers she rolled onto her back and let her legs slide open to make things easier for him then she slithered down the bed and unbuttoned his fly her mouth was warm and wet and sweet talsu set a hand on the back of her head half stroking her hair half urging her on if shed kept going till he exploded he wouldnt have minded at all but after a little while she turned her back on him still lying on his side he hiked her pyjama bottoms down just far enough she stuck out her backside and he went into her from behind ah she whispered he said her name as he began to move she pushed back against him the bed creaked but less from the sidetoside motion than it would have with him atop her and when gailisa shuddered with pleasure a few minutes later she put her face against the pillow so only a tiny sound escaped talsu tried to stay as quiet as he could too the joy that filled him though made him have trouble noticing how little or how much noise he made ausra didnt stir in the other bed either hed been quiet enough or she was more than polite enough at the moment talsu didnt much care which he leaned up on an elbow and kissed gailisa who twisted back toward him so their lips could meet they both set their clothes to rights talsu happily fell asleep a few minutes later thoughts of jelgavan soldiers and jelgavan officers never entered his mind he wished he could have gone on not thinking about them too but two days later a sharp knock on the door to the flat made both him and his father look up from their work sounds like business traku said hopefully that would be nice talsu said ill find out when he opened the door there stood the jelgavan major hed seen before the fellow was an inch or two shorter than talsu but contrived to looked down his nose at him just the same am i correct in being given to understand that this is a tailors establishment he asked in haughty tones thats right sir talsu answered regretfully he added wont you please come in good morning sir traku said when the major did stride into the flat he sounded friendlier than talsu had he could hardly have sounded less friendly than his son what can we do for you today i require a rain cloak the officer said i require it at once as i shall soon be going into algarve ill be happy to take care of you sir traku said there will be a small extra charge for a rush jobi have some other business ill have to put aside to take care of you right away you understand no the major said traku frowned i beg your pardon sir no the fellow repeated i will not pay extra not a coppers worth this is part of my uniform sir im sure you already have a uniformissue rain cloak just like every other officer talsu said if you want something with a little extra style or quality you do have to pay for it hed been through the army himself he knew what the rules were the jelgavan noble looked at him as if hed just found him in his peach who are you to tell me what i must do and must not do he demanded how dare you show such cheek your excellency even officers have regulations talsu said do you want my business or do you not the major said talsus father spoke reasonably sir if you want me to put your business in front of everybody elses youre going to have to pay for that because itll mean other peoples clothes wont get made as fast as theyd like it probably wouldnt mean that it would mean he and talsu would have to work extra long hours to get the other orders done on time keeping things simple though seemed best other people the noble snorted he plainly wasnt used to the idea of worrying about whether what he did bothered anyone else do these other people of yours have the high blood in their veins aye sir a couple of em do traku said stolidly and that to talsus amazement turned the major reasonable in the blink of an eye well thats different he said still sounding gruff but not as if he were about to accuse the two tailors of treason if it is a matter of inconveniencing folk of my own class he cared nothing about inconveniencing commoners bothering other nobles thoughthat mattered to him how large a fee did you have in mind traku named one twice as high as hed ever charged an algarvian for a rush job the jelgavan noble accepted it without a blink he didnt blink at the price traku set for the rain cape either maybe he had more money than he knew what to do with maybeand more likely talsu judgedhe just had no idea of what things were supposed to cost all he said on his departure was see that its ready on time my good men and then he swept out as if hed been the king honoring a couple of peasants with the glory of his presence after the door closed traku said something under his breath im sorry father talsu said i didnt catch that i said its no wonder some of our own people went off and fought on the algarvian side after king donalitu came back that overbred son of a whore and all the others like him dont make the redheads look like such a bad bargain ive had that same thought a time or twomore than a time or two myself talsu replied aye hes one overbred son of a whore but hes our overbred son of a whore if you know what i mean he wont haul us off by the hundreds to kill us for the sake of our life energy his father sighed youre right no doubt about it youre right but if thats the best we can say for himand it fornicating well isits pretty cold praise wouldnt you say of course it is talsu said but its no surprise or it shouldnt be one remember youve just had nobles for customers ive had them for commanders i know what theyre like he almost said i know whats wrong with them even if he didnt say it it was what he meant but the redheads have nobles too traku said these kuusamans have them they must but they dont act like their shit doesnt stink the way ours do why is that why are we stuck with a pack of bastards at the top i dont know talsu said he didnt know any jelgavans who did know either he grinned wryly because were lucky i guess his fathers fingers twisted in an evilaverting gesture that went back to the days of the kaunian empire thats the kind of luck i could do without thats the kind of luck the whole kingdom could do without oh aye talsu agreed but how do we change it he answered his own question we dont not as long as donalitus our king hes the worst of the lot he sighed they dont have hardly any nobles in unkerlant people say no but thats on account of king swemmel killed most of em traku said what the unkerlanters have instead is they have king swemmel is he a better bargain talsu didnt answer by everything hed heard swemmel was about as bad a bargain as anybody could make his father rammed the point home do you want to live in unkerlant powers above no talsu used that same ancient gesture but its getting so i hardly want to live here anymore either where then his father asked i dont know talsu hadnt been altogether serious after some thought though he said kuusamo maybe the slanteyes are looser than we are if you know what i mean i had some dealings with them when i was with the irregulars they dont make a big fuss about rank and blood they just do what needs doing i liked that how would you like a kuusaman winter traku asked with a sly smile talsu shivered at the mere idea i dont suppose i would not very much he bent over the tunic hed been working on when the major came in if he and his father were going to get the rain cape done along with everything else they could afford only so much chatter and what was kuusamo but moonshine anyhow this time the sleigh carrying fernao and pekka glided west not east every stride of the harnessed reindeer took fernao farther not only from the blockhouse but also from the hostel in the naantali district the hostel had deliberately been built a long way from a ley line that made getting to it difficult and leaving inconvenient as if picking the thoughtand some of the things behind itfrom his mind pekka leaned toward him and said this feels very strange fernao nodded for me too he said going to see kajaani will be interesting her laugh was nervous bringing you there will be interesting too seeing her home town wasnt what mattered though meeting her sister meeting her sonthose were what counted i wonder what theyll think of me he said he waited for pekka to say something like of course theyll think youre wonderful a lagoan woman would have pekka just answered thats why were doing this to find out i mean i know fernao said as a moderately resolute bachelor he hadnt gone through the ritual of meeting a womans family before and in his younger days he hadnt expected family to include a son again halfway thinking along with him pekka said uto will look up to you i think she smiled how can he help it when youre so tall but the smile slipped i dont know about elimaki im sorry it would be simpler if her husband hadnt run off with somebody else wouldnt it fernao said pekka nodded its too bad too i always liked olavin she said but these things do happen we ought to know fernao thought he kept that to himself he didnt want to remind pekka that shed been carrying on with him before her husband got killed and her thoughts hadnt gone in that direction for she added a oneword parenthesis men again fernao found it wiser to keep quiet the driver took them right up to the caravan depot at joensuu the little town closest to the hostel as far as fernao could see joensuu had no reason for existing except lying on a ley line when the leyline caravan glided into the depot he was briefly startled to note it was northbound then pekka said remember i warned you about this we have to go around three sides of a rectangle to get to kajaani he snapped his fingers in annoyance no happier than any other mage at forgetting something aye you did tell me that and it went clean out of my head he put his arm around her must be love from a lagoan that was an ordinary sort of compliment as fernao had seen though kuusamans were more restrained in how they praised one another pekka still seemed flustered as they climbed up into the caravan car they had to switch caravans twice once to a westbound line and then to the southbound one that would finally take them to kajaani fernao hoped his baggage made the switches too pekka was going home she would have more clothes there if his things didnt arrive hed wear what he had on his back till he could buy moreand he wasnt sure kuusaman shops would have many garments for a man of his inches what with the delays in changing caravans they traveled all through the night their seats reclined as was true in most caravan cars but still made only poor substitutes for real beds fernao dozed and woke dozed and woke the whole night long when he was awake he peered out the window at the snowcovered countryside the night was moonless but the southern lights glowed in shifting curtainlike patterns of green and yellow hed seen them brighter on the austral continent but the display here was far more impressive than it ever got up in setubal the sun was just coming up over the horizon when the leyline caravan topped the last forested rise north of kajaani and glided down toward the port city even with the bright sun of early spring on it the sea ahead looked cold maybe that was fernaos imagination working overtime and maybe it wasnt that sea led southwest to the land of the ice people pekka yawned and stretched shed had a better night than fernao seeing familiar landscape and then familiar buildings slide past the window she smiled oh good were here so we are what fernao saw didnt impress him kajaani to him looked like a kuusaman provincial town and nothing more he knew he was spoiled to him any city save setubal was likely to seem just a provincial town he asked can we see kajaani city college from here shaking her head pekka pointed across the car to the right its on the western edge of town if we get a chance ill take you over there having an illustrious lagoan theoretical sorcerer along with me will make professor heikki unhappy and i do what i can to keep her that way aye youve told me about some of your squabbles fernao said whats your chairmans specialty veterinary magic is that what you said thats right pekka said and shes nobody of any consequence there shed make a splendid clerk though thats why shes been chairman so long i suppose but she inflicts herself on people who do real work so nobody in the department can stand her kajaani the conductor called as the caravan nearing the depot slowed everybody out for kajaani on account of this is the end of the line end of the world fernao thought the leyline caravan eased to a halt the conductor opened the door at the front of the car pekka got to her feet so did fernao leaning on his cane to help himself up his leg and shoulder both complained hed known they would im lucky to have both legs he thought and then if this is luck pekka got down ahead of him she watched anxiously as he came down the little portable stairway she was he saw ready to catch him if he stumbled being somewhere close to twice her size he made sure he didnt and reached the ground safely someonea woman on the platformcalled pekkas name she turned elimaki she exclaimed a moment later she added uto mother the boy swarmed toward her he was fernao saw nine or ten with a good deal of pekka in his face when he sprang into her arms for a hug the top of his head came past her shoulder the woman who followed him also looked a good deal like pekka of course she does you idiot fernao thought shes her sister by the powers above elimaki was a couple of years younger and a little stockier she too hugged pekka but even as she did it she was eyeing fernao with curiosity both undisguised and he thought more than a little hostile im so glad to see both of you again pekka said kissing first uto and then elimaki she took a deep breath and i want you both to meet my friend fernao of lagoas uto held out his hand hello sir he said gravely sure enough he added i didnt think you would be so tall he was curiously studying fernao too not a lot of lagoans or other algarvic folk got down here fernao suspected he clasped utos hand not his wrist as he would have with one of his own countrymen im very pleased to meet you he said ive heard a lot about you from your mother pekka rolled her eyes even elimaki had trouble holding her face straight uto looked more innocent than he had any hope of being i dont do that so much anymore he said leaving that carefully unspecified you do too you scamp elimaki said she nodded to fernao and i have heard a lot about you i probably dont do that so much anymore either he answered deadpan pekkas sister gave him a sharp look then smiled youll have a carpetbag wont you she said looking back toward the caravans baggage car i do hope so fernao said id better find out why do you have that cane uto asked as he limped toward the baggage car because i got hurt in the war down in the land of the ice people he said the algarvians uto asked and fernao nodded the boys face worked they killed my father too those he called the algarvians a name nastier than any fernao had known at the same age then he burst into tears while pekka comforted him fernao reclaimed his carpetbag it was there which made him think kindly thoughts about the people who ran the kuusaman leyline caravans he carried it back to pekka and her son and her sister elimaki said to him i was thinking the two of you might want to stay at my house tonight not next door at pekkas i dont know fernao looked to pekka what do you want to do either way is all right with me aye lets do that pekka said at once and shot her sister a grateful glance i dont want to go into my old house right now it would tear me to pieces once she said it it made good senseindeed perfect senseto fernao with all those memories of past times with her dead husband there he would seem nothing but an interloper lets go then elimaki said they caught a local caravan going east through the city then walked up a hill past pines and firs to the street where elimakis house and pekkas stood side by side seeing fernao labor on the way up the hill pekka whispered to uto he took fernaos carpetbag from him and carried it with pride elimakis house struck fernao as enormous in setubal the biggest city in the world people were crowded too close together to let anyone but the very wealthy enjoy so much space an advantage to provincial towns i hadnt thought of youll want something to eat elimaki said and disappeared into the kitchen pekka followed her that left fernao alone with uto he didnt know what to say hed never had much to do with children if i want to stay with pekka though ill have to learn while he searched for words uto found some aunt eli says youre mothers friend her special friend as gravely as uto had on meeting him fernao nodded thats true does that mean youre my special friend too i dont know fernao said its not just up to me you know its up to you too pekkas son pondered that with the care his mother gave a new spell at last he nodded youre right i guess i have to think about it some more after another pause he said i know im not supposed to ask you much about what youre doing but youre helping mother find magic to beat the algarvians arent you fernao nodded again i cant tell you much about what im doing either but i can tell you that much thats just what im doing a fierce light kindled in utos eyes in that case i do want you to be my special friend im still too little to pay them back for father myself however fierce he sounded he started to cry again fernao held out his arms he didnt know whether the boy would come to him but uto did awkwardly he comforted him breakfasts ready elimaki called from the kitchen uto bounded away he still had tears on his cheeks but he was smiling again fernao followed more slowly as he came into the kitchen elimaki saw utos tears are you all right she asked im fine he answered carelessly and turned to his mother who was serving up plates of smoked salmon scrambled with eggs and cream i like your friend do you pekka said and uto gave an emphatic nod she tousled his hair im glad pekka looked toward her sister as if to say i told you so fernao pretended not to notice i like him too elimaki said and then tempered that by adding more than i expected to so fernao wasnt sure how much credit hed earned some anyhow by the relief in pekkas eyes perhaps even enough vanai these days was a better housekeeper than shed ever been at least when it came to keeping the floor of her flat clean she hadnt really sought such neatness shed had it forced on her saxburh crawled all over the flat she could go surprisinglysometimes alarminglyfast if she found anything she thought was interesting it was liable to end up in her mouth before vanai could take it away from her the cleaner the floor was the fewer the chances she had to eat anything disgusting or dangerous saxburh didnt appreciate her mothers vigilance as far as the baby was concerned everything she could reach was supposed to go into her mouth how could she tell what it was if she couldnt taste it she fussed and squawked when vanai took things away from her fuss all you like vanai told her after one rescue in the nick of time you cant eat a dead cockroach by the way the baby wailed she was liable to be stunted for life if she didnt get her fair share of dead bugs keeping such things out of her hands and more to the point out of her mouth was vanais secondbiggest worry it was the biggest one about which she could do anything ealstan was and remained somewhere far away to the east she wondered if shed even know if anythingpowers above forbid ithappened to him shed heard not a word since he got dragooned into king swemmels army if he didnt come back after the war ended that would tell her what she needed to knowor it might for the unkerlanters could simply have hauled him off to the other end of their vast kingdom how would i be able to find out one way or the other she wondered the answer there was painfully obvious i wouldnt she pushed the worry to the back of her mind as she did whenever she started fretting about what she couldnt help if only ealstan were here if ealstan were here he would find life in eoforwic easier than it had been at any time since he and vanai came to the forthwegian capital it had been weeks since algarvian dragons appeared overhead gromheort still held out but the rest of forthweg belonged to unkerlant these daysand nominally to king beornwulf as well beornwulf seemed to be doing what he could and perhaps what the unkerlanters would let him to be a good king broadsheets outlawing pricegouging in the marketplace went up alongside sheets singing the praises of swemmels soldiers vanai looked out her kitchen window a work crew was pasting up fresh broadsheets even now i wonder if i could put glass in the window again vanai thought it wouldnt get broken right away not any more she couldnt afford to look out the window for long she looked back toward saxburh instead it wasnt a dead cockroach this timejust a dust bunny vanai got it away from the baby when saxburh fussed vanai said come onlets go see what the new sheets say scooping her daughter off the floor she carried her down the stairs and out into the street a few other people were looking at the new broadsheets too but only a few thered been too many broadsheetsfrom king penda from the algarvians and now from the unkerlanters and their puppet kingfor anybody to get very excited over one more vanai wasnt very excited just curious and looking for an excuse to get out of the flat for a little while a forthwegian man reading one of the new broadsheets pasted to a fence turned away with a disgusted gesture another one said well heres something else that wont fly the first fellow said and what if it did doesnt hardly matter anymore does it i ask you is this a waste of time or what shaking his head he walked off vanai went up to a broadsheet oh she said softly when she saw its title the headline was concerning kaunians she still wore her sorcerous disguise and so still looked like a forthwegian herself back before the war eoforwic had a name as the place where forthwegians and kaunians got on better than they did anywhere else in the kingdom the reputation held some truth forthwegians and kaunians here had rioted together on learning that the algarvians were shipping blonds west to be murdered but plenty of forthwegians here despised kaunians too vanai had seen that along with the other and what would king beornwulf have to say on the subject she went up closer to the broadsheet so she could read the smaller print the new edict came straight to the point declaring all laws orders and regulations imposed by the algarvian occupiers of the kingdom of forthweg concerning persons of kaunian blood are henceforth and forevermore null and void persons of kaunian blood legally residing in the kingdom of forthweg are and shall remain citizens of the said kingdom with full rights and privileges appertaining thereto including the right to publish works in the kaunian language subject to the same limits of taste and decency as hold for works in the forthwegian language the status of persons of kaunian blood residing in the kingdom of forthweg shall be and shall remain precisely what it was before the obscene and vicious algarvian occupation which in law shall be judged never to have occurred issued this day by order of king beornwulf i of forthweg with the concurrence of his unkerlanter allies unkerlanters didnt care much one way or the other about kaunians only a handful of blonds lived in the far northeast of unkerlant not enough to make anyone in swemmels kingdom nervous about them that was one of the few good things kaunians from forthweg had to say about unkerlanters they werent algarvians vanai read aloud from the edict the obscene and vicious algarvian occupation which in law shall be judged never to have occurred she looked around at the wreckage and rubble of eoforwic and laughed bitterly and the wreckage of the citythe wreckage of the whole kingdomwasnt the worst of it people could rebuild ruined shops and houses and schools how to go about rebuilding the lives the redheads had stolen to say nothing of those theyd wrecked publishing in kaunian was legal again but would anyone bother maybe some scholars would people who wanted to be read by a wider audience an audience in kuusamo or jelgava or even algarve that had never learned forthwegian but how many writers now would turn their hands to romances or poetry or plays or new sheets in classical kaunian how many people were left alive to read them powers below eat king mezentio vanai whispered he hadnt killed off all the kaunians in forthweg but he was liable to have killed kaunianity here that black thought had crossed vanais mind before having it come back after she read an edict favoring her people made tears sting her eyes saxburh squirmed she wanted vanai to put her down and let her crawl around out here it was a mild spring day birds chirped a warm breeze blew down from the north vanai said no to her daughter anyway adding youre not going to get to eat any bugs out here she wished for a park with smoothly trimmed grass she would take saxburh there the closest park she knew might not have had its grass trimmed since before the derlavaian war the ground there was bound to be cratered by bursting eggs and every other park in and around eoforwic was sure to be in the same state so much rebuilding to do a woman came up and stood beside vanai to read the broadsheet she said i dont know why this new excuse for a king weve got even bothered with such a silly law how many of these people are left anyway not enough to waste anyones time over thats for sure what would she do if i told her i was a kaunian vanai wondered she didnt make the experiment all she said was you may be right and thought no i wont give up my sorcerous disguise any time soon i could make people hate my thelberge self for what she does but they dont hate her for what she is and then a really nasty notion struck here what if the other woman were a disguised kaunian herself and thinking vanai a real forthwegian spoke out against blonds because she reckoned that expected of her how would i know i wouldnt any more than she knows what i am she had no proof by the nature of things she wouldnt get any proof but the thought once lodged wouldnt go away if it were true it wouldnt be mezentio killing kaunianity nokaunianity would kill itself vanai went back to her flat saxburh liked going upstairs it felt different from walking on level ground vanai would have liked it better if she were carried instead of carrying too judged never to have occurred she said again when she got inside did that mean shed never had to go to bed with major spinello did it mean shed never had to wear this sorcerous disguise did it mean the redheads had never captured her and thrown her into the kaunian quarter here in eoforwic did it mean they hadnt killed tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands of blonds she wished it did wishing meant nothing or perhaps a little less dada saxburh said no im your mama vanai told her the baby said mama but less often vanai said your dada will be home soon powers above i hope he will dada saxburh said again vanai laughed it was either that or start to cry shed done too much crying over the course of this war so long as i dont have to do any more she went to the cupboard to see what she could make for supper barley peas turnips beans olives cheese olive oilnothing very exciting but enough to keep body and spirit together peasants in the countryside ate this kind of food their whole lives long city people praised peasants for their healthy dietand didnt try very hard to imitate it the way things were these days though having enough of any kind of food no matter how boring was worth celebrating in a few days shed have to go down to the market square to get more she wondered if guthfrith who had been ethelhelm would be there with his band shed seen the drummer and singer and songwriter several times she didnt stop to listen to his music anymore he made her nervous but he noticed her shed seen him follow her with his eyes more than once that was not the least of the reasons he made her nervous it wasnt the only one though he had a good notion that she was a kaunian with king beornwulf s edict it shouldnt have mattered it shouldnt have but it did kaunians in forthweg rarely assumed edicts concerning them meant everything they saidunless the edicts were threats with threats whoever happened to be lording it over forthweg was commonly sincere i have a weapon of my own vanai thought guthfrith was a fellow who played for coppers in the square ethelhelm despite kaunian blood had been famous all over forthweg but because of that kaunian blood ethelhelm had decided it was wiser to collaborate with the algarvians if he tried to tar her she could tar him she made a sour face she hated to have to think that way she hated to but she would if she had to keep her baby and herself safe shed do what needed doing and worry about everything else later like so many others across derlavai shed learned ruthlessness in the war marshal rathar looked up at the night sky thick gray clouds covered it he turned toward general vatranand accidentally bumped one of the bodyguards king swemmel had ordered him to use after the algarvians came altogether too close to assassinating him sorry he murmured its all right sir the bodyguard said just think of us as furniture they were large wellmuscled pieces of furniture peering around them rathar said everythings ready to go it had better be vatran answered weve spent as much time building up toward things here as we did in the north last summer we cant afford to have things go wrong rathar said once we get over the scamandro we storm straight for trapani its going to be ours by the powers above the islanders arent going to take it weve paid the biggest bills and we deserve the biggest prize that was what swemmel said and rathar here emphatically agreed with him vatran nodded too with what all weve got here sir i dont see any way the redheads can stop us or even slow us down much how much longer till the dance starts a quarter of an hour rathar replied we get past the high ground on the east side of the river and everything should go fine from there heres hoping vatran said if they dont pull out any funny sorcery that worried rathar too what did king mezentio have left here in algarves last extremity the mages who wore unkerlants rockgray had grown ever more appalled at the spells the redheads tried not many of those spells had worked as well as the algarvians wished but what the enemy attempted kept getting wilder and darker if we keep them busy enough fighting a regular war they cant spend too much time or energy getting strange on us the marshal said and hoped he was right at the appointed hour swarms of rockgray dragons flew low over the scamandro pulverizing the algarvians works on the eastern bank with eggs and with flame hundreds thousands of eggtossers flung more death across the river at dozens of points along the front artificers would be springing into action to bridge the scamandro let any one of those bridges stand and well whip the redheads rathar thought he expected a great many more than one would stand he expected most of them would in fact but one would do well enough any bridgehead on the eastern side of the scamandro would give his kingdom the opening it needed mages added something new to the attack sorcerous lamps that seemed to shine bright as the sun their glare reflected off the underside of the clouds and helped light the way for the dragons and the men aiming the eggtossersto say nothing of distracting the foe we want mezentios men knocked flat before we cross rathar said looks like were getting what we want too vatran answered even as far from the front as mangani was he had to raise his voice to be heard over the din of bursting eggs a crystallomancer came up to rathar saluting he said lord marshal resistance on the far side of the river is lighter than expected thats what the dragonfliers report weve finally beaten them down vatran said that would be good that would be very good rathar wasnt sure he believed it but in the opening minutes of an attack he was willing to be hopeful another crystallomancer hurried up and saluted sir we have a bridgehead over the scamandro and behemoths crossing in numbers to the east bank vatran and rathar both exclaimed in delight then and clasped hands the algarvians had thrown back all their efforts to force earlier bridgeheads lets see the whoresons throw this back rathar thought id like to see any army in the worldthrow back this attack more crystallomancers brought news of bridges crossing the river and behemoths and footsoldiers rushing across all of them said the same thing as the dragonfliers had resistance was less than expected maybe we have knocked them flat rathar thought if we have we walk into trapani instead of battering our way there that would be nice aloud he kept giving the same order over and over keep moving try to take the high ground east of the scamandro do everything you can to link up our crossings the crystallomancers hurried away to take his words to the officers in the front line dawn meant the sorcerers could douse the hideous lights theyd fashioned it also meant he got some news he would rather not have had on the far side of the scamandro the algarvians had started fighting back fiercely how can they vatran said when the crystallomancers reported that we should have squashed them flat as a bug i think i know what they did rathar said im not sure but i think so i think they pulled back from their frontline positions before we hit them they did that a few times back in unkerlant it would let them save a lot of their men and eggtossers and behemoths even if it did cost them land they cant afford to lose anything right now vatran said i know rathar nodded but if theyd lost the men they surely would have lost the land too this way they have a chance of counterattacking and driving us backor they think they do anyhow we have to keep throwing men and behemoths at them vatran said were doing that we havent been building up here for nothing rathar said but its going to be harder than we thought it would general vatran made a sour face what isnt with algarvians rathar had no answer for that the redheads had come horrifyingly close to conquering his kingdom now he was tantalizingly close to conquering theirs but they hadnt made any of the fights easy not a single one theyd failed not because they werent good soldiers but because there werent enough of them and because king mezentio hadnt thought he would need to bother conciliating the unkerlanters his men overran arrogance was an algarvian vice it wasnt one that mattered here though there still arent enough of them to stop us rathar thought wherever we penetrate send in reinforcements he commanded again crystallomancers relayed his words to the commanders at the front he hoped they wouldnt need the order it was standard doctrine in unkerlant he gave it anyhow in the heat of the moment who could guess whether these frontline commanders bothered to remember doctrine more dragons flew east to torment the algarvians with eggs and with fire crystallomancers reported only a handful of enemy beasts rising to challenge them there was no doubt whatsoever that the unkerlanters had at last forced the line of the scamandro how much more they would be able to do though remained an open question powers below eat the redheads vatran growled as the day wore on with no sign of a breakthrough they will rathar said were feeding them not fast enough vatran grumbled rathar wished he could have argued with his general unfortunately he agreed with him the algarvians had salvaged more than hed thought they could and they were righting not only with their usual cleverness but also with the desperate courage of men who had nothing left to lose they knew as well as rathar that only they lay between his army and trapani another night and day of hammering produced only a little progress and only a couple of lodgements on the high ground mezentios men were defending had everything gone according to plan rathars behemoths would have been lumbering toward trapani by then but the marshal of unkerlant wasnt the only one whod made plans for this moment and those of the algarvians looked to be working a little better than his how long can this go on vatran complained that evening i dont know rathar answered i still think were all right though we have made them fall back some and weve still got reinforcements pouring in from the west when they use up what theyve mustered against us its gone and gone for good but even he had trouble staying detached and optimistic when his men gained hardly any more ground on the third day of the attack than they had on the second and that evening vatran wasnt the one doing the complaining a crystallomancer came up to rathar and said sir king swemmel would speak to you at once rathar had more than expected such a call if anything he was a little surprised the king had waited this long im coming he said just for a moment he imagined ordering the crystallomancer to tell swemmel he couldnt come that he was too busy but no one had any business being too busy to talk to the king of unkerlant swemmels image stared out of the crystal at rathar not for the first time the marshal thought his sovereign looked like an algarvian he had a long pale face with a straight nose though his hair and eyes were dark like a proper unkerlanters those eyes often had a febrile glow to them and they positively blazed now we are not pleased marshal not pleased at all swemmel said without preamble we had hoped and believed the news from the front would be better than what we have heard id hoped so myself your majesty rathar replied for now the algarvians are fighting harder than i thought they could but when springs come to the icebound rivers in the south the ice does melt each year and the water does flow down to the narrow sea as the ice does the algarvians lines will break up the thaw is slow but it will come very pretty swemmel said we did not know we had a poet commanding our armies we want to be sure we do have a soldier commanding them stiffly rathar said your majesty the redheads thought i was doing well enough to make it worth their while to try to murder me if you think someone else can do better give me a stick and send me to the front line i will fight for you in whatever way suits you best we want mezentio marshal the king said give us mezentio as you gave us raniero by the time mezentio dies he will have spent long and long envying his cousin swemmel had boiled raniero alive after his soldiers recaptured most of the duchy of grelz rathar didnt know what he could do to mezentio that was worse but his sovereign had had a year and a half to think about it i dont know if i can give you mezentio your majesty he said he will have somewhat to say about that himself very likely but i can give you trapani and i will you should have done it already swemmel said peevishly the day will come your majesty rathar promised and i think it will come soon the algarvians have lost ground here and they cant afford to lose much more this is the last obstacle in front of us we are beating it down enemies everywhere king swemmel muttered rathar didnt think that was aimed at him had it been swemmel would have sacked him or worse the king gathered himself break the algarvians crush them beneath your heel beneath our heel that was the royal we again proud and imperious your majesty it will be a pleasure rathar said and we will do it its only a matter of time he hadnt finished before the crystal flared and swemmels image vanished hed told the king what he wanted to hear now he had to make it good he hadnt lied he didnt think it would take long garivald had hated the algarvians even before they overran his home village but ever since hed faced the redheads as an irregularand especially since king swemmels impressers hauled him into the army and hed fought mezentios men here in the northhed developed a sincere if grudging respect for them as soldiers however outnumbered they were they always fought cleverly they always fought hard and they always made unkerlant pay more than it should have for every inch of land it took alwaysuntil now a couple of redheaded soldiers came out of a house with hands high over their heads and with fearful expressions on their faces garivald had been fearful too as in any fight they might have killed him he knew that all too well but theyd given up instead more and more now algarvians were throwing down their sticks and throwing up their hands they knew or some of them knew they were beaten with a gesture from the business end of his stick garivald sent these redheads off to captivity he didnt even bother rifling their belt pouches for whatever silver they carried it was as if he were saying you fellows can go on ill catch some of your pals pretty soon and frisk them instead lieutenant andelot called well fariulf they really are starting to go to pieces now even a few weeks ago those whoresons would have made us pay the price of prying them out of there a few weeks before the unkerlanter army or the part of it with which garivald was most intimately concerned had been falling back from bonorva in the face of a fierce algarvian counterattack mezentios men couldnt sustain it though and having used up so many men and behemoths they hadnt been able to hold their ground against the unkerlanters afterwards i think youre right sir garivald answered by now he took his false name as much for granted as his real one he pointed toward the southeast the direction in which his regiment had been driving whats the name of the next town ahead i have to look andelot unfolded a map then checked himself no here sergeant you come see for yourself if youve got your letters you may as well use them all right garivald trotted over to the company commander whereabouts are we now andelot showed him with a grimynailed finger and were going this way right garivald asked the young lieutenant nodded frowning in concentration garivald studied the map then were headed toward torgavi he wondered if hed correctly pronounced the foreign name by the way andelot beamed he had thats good fariulf anybody would think youd been reading for years the lieutenant pointed to the blue line meandering past torgavi and whats the name of this river here garivald squinted at the map again the rivers name was written in very small characters its the albi sir he said confidently with a name that short he was sure he hadnt made a hash of it and he hadnt right again andelot said you do so well here why didnt you ever learn before theyd been over this ground before shrugging broad shoulders garivald answered how could i have sir our village had no school our firstman knew his letters but i dont think anybody else who lived there did i dont suppose any of the villages around ours were any different either andelot nodded im sure youre right sergeant but things like that arent good for the kingdom were less efficient than we ought to be just about all of these algarvians can read and write it makes them more flexible than we are able to do more things the same is true for the kuusamans and lagoans theyre our allies now but who knows how long that will last once mezentio gets whats coming to him we need to start thinking about such things garivald shrugged again the men from the great island in the distant east hardly seemed real to him of course it hadnt been so very long before that the algarvians had hardly seemed real to him either hed come to know them better than hed ever imagined he wouldand better than hed ever wanted to too would the same thing happen with the men of kuusamo and lagoas he hoped not once the fight ended all he wanted to do was find his way back to obilot hed lost one family in the war he hoped for the chance to start another up ahead somewhere near torgavi a few eggs burst less than a minute later several more came down these a lot closer to garivald and andelot garivald grimaced not all the buggers have quit he said no not yet lieutenant andelot agreed thats why were hereto take care of the ones too stubborn or too stupid to know theyre licked he blew a shrill blast on his whistle loud enough to make garivalds ears ring and shouted forward forward garivald echoed and then showing off what hed learned lets clear these bastards out of torgavi all along the line officers whistles squealed officers and underofficers yelled forward and forward the unkerlanters went trotting toward torgavi across wheatfields and through olive groves garivald wondered why anyone wanted to cultivate olives he didnt think much of the fruit and the oil had a nasty flavor he doubted olives would grow down in the duchy of grelz and didnt miss them a bit unkerlanter behemoths advanced with the footsoldiers using their eggtossers and heavy sticks to smash up the strongpoints the redheads were defending garivald took that cooperation for granted men whod been in the army longer didnt by what they said the algarvians had always been able to bring it off king swemmels men had had to learn how and a lot of the lessons had proved painful and expensive dragons pounded torgavis defenders too again some of the algarvians began coming out into the open and surrendering but some of them kept fighting too i dont want to die now garivald thought as he flopped down near a house on the outskirts of torgavi why dont they all just give up curse them that would make things easier on them and easier on me too with a rumbling roar a bridge across the albi tumbled into the river mezentios men must have wrecked it with eggs sure enough some of them kept fighting as if the war still hung in the balance fools garivald thought enough a column of behemoths lumbered into torgavi garivald waved as many men as he could forward the behemoths protected footsoldiers but the reverse also held true that too was cooperation some algarvian diehards in a house near the outskirts of the town blazed at the behemoths the behemoth crews lobbed three or four eggs at the house at such short range the house crumbled as if made of pasteboard no more blazes came from it thats the way garivald shouted one of the crewmen on the closest behemoth waved to him he waved back that other soldier undoubtedly wanted to make it through the war and then go home too after the unkerlanters dealt with the diehards the rest of the redheads in torgavi decided theyd had enough white flags and banners appeared in windows all over town kilted soldiers came out of the few strongholds they still held they might have feared going into captivity but they feared dying more with brusque gestures garivald and the other unkerlanters sent the captives to the rear somewhere not far away a woman started screaming garivald looked around for lieutenant andelot when he caught the company commanders eye andelot just shrugged garivald nodded the algarvians had outraged plenty of women in unkerlant hed seen that for himself in zossen rough justice said his countrymen could pay them back in the same coin the womans screams went on a moment later more screams started these rather shriller come on andelot called to the men within earshot lets get down to the river and see if we can find a way to cross powers below eat the algarvians for dropping the bridge in the water powers below eat the algarvians garivald needed no qualifiers for that now andelot was the one who nodded what remained of the bridge over the albi were a couple of stone piers in the river that had supported it and a lot of twisted ironwork on the far side of the stream perhaps a hundred yards away a couple of behemoths and a squad of footsoldiers approached the riverbank garivald started to dive for cover wait andelot said the one word held such quiet excitement it froze garivald where he stood andelot went on do you know fariulf i dont think those are algarvians at all who else would they be sir garivald shaded his eyes with the palm of his hand to see better he didnt think the soldiers on the far bank wore kilts they werent blazing at his comrades and him they were looking and pointing in much the same way as the unkerlanters were one of them trained a shiny brass spyglass on garivald and the other soldiers here garivald could see the fellow jump when he got a good look whoever he is he just figured out we arent redheads the fellow with the spyglass set it on the ground cupping his hands in front of his mouth he shouted unkerlant aye were from unkerlant lieutenant andelot shouted back who are you garivald couldnt make out all of the answer but one word was very clear kuusamo awe prickled through him his countrymen and those fellows on the other bank of the albi had fought their way across half of derlavai to meet here that same realization went through the rest of swemmels soldiers too by the powers above someone said softly weve cut algarve in half somebody else added most of the men began to cheer a couple began to weep on the other bank the kuusamans were cheering too weve got to get across andelot said he peered up and down the river so did garivald theres a rowboat he exclaimed at the same time as andelot started for it garivald hurried after his company commander if i ever have grandchildren i can tell them about this he thought another soldier had the same idea garivald tapped the three bronze triangles that showed he was a sergeant the other man bared his teeth in a disappointed grimace but fell back garivald was clumsy with the oars he didnt care and andelot didnt complain they would have paddled with their sticks had the boat not held oars on the other bank the kuusamans greeted them with open arms they gave the unkerlanters smoked salmon and wine garivald had something stronger than wine in his water bottle he gladly shared it the swarthy little slanteyed men smacked their lips and clapped him on the back none of them spoke unkerlanter and neither garivald nor andelot knew any of their tongue a kuusaman tried another language thats classical kaunian andelot said i know of it but i dont speak it he had some algarvian and did his best with that a couple of the kuusamans proved to know some of the enemys speech too what do they say sir garivald asked around a mouthful of salmon the stuff tasted amazingly good they say it wont be long now andelot answered garivald nodded vehemently to show how much he hoped they were right as he had for weeks now ealstan peered longingly toward gromheort the unkerlanter army of which he was a small but unwilling part hadnt pushed the attack against his home town so hard as it might have seeming content to let time and hunger do some of their work for them the redheads in there are going hungry he thought thats fine but my family is going hungry too he wondered if he had any family left alive all he could do was hope before long ill find out people said the unkerlanter army down in the south had finally launched its great attack on trapani he didnt know whether that was true or just one more rumor he suspected it held some truth though because the fight around gromheort was heating up again too dragons dropped eggs on the city and swooped down to rooftop height to flame any enemy soldiers they could catch away from cover eggtossers punished gromheort still more behemoths came forward assembling almost contemptuously outside the city to let the algarvians know what would be heading their way an unkerlanter officer went into gromheort under flag of truce to demand surrender one last time the algarvians sent him back he happened to walk past ealstans regiment shaking his head somebody called to him well have to squash the whoresons eh thats right the envoy answered ealstan followed unkerlanter fairly well these days the officer added we can do it too maybe he expected the soldiers to burst into cheers if he did he was disappointed theyd seen too much fighting to be eager for more before dawn the next morning more dragons swooped down on ealstans poor beleaguered city eggtossers pummeled gromheort anew he grimaced at the chaos and destruction ahead how could anyone algarvian soldier or forthwegian civilian have survived the pummeling the unkerlanters had given the place as soon as the sunrise painted the sky with pink whistles shrilled all around gromheort officers and sergeants shouted forward clutching his stick doing his best not to be afraid and not to let himself worry forward ealstan went watching behemoths going forward too was reassuring for one thing they fought vastly better than individual footsoldiers could for another they drew blazes from the enemy who knew how well they fought at least as well as ealstan did if the redheads were blazing at behemoths they werent blazing at him and redheads blazing there were regardless of whether ealstan thought the unkerlanter pounding should have killed them all it hadnt they plainly intended to make the attackers pay for every inch of the journey into gromheort perhaps fifty yards off to ealstans left a behemoths massive foot came down on an egg buried in the ground the egg burst an instant later so did all the smaller eggs the behemoth was carrying the blast of sorcerous energy knocked ealstan off his feet and left him half stunned his ears ringing when he looked over there he saw no sign the behemoth or its crew had ever existed except for a crater gouged in the earth forward the shout seemed to come from very far away now but ealstan knew what swemmels men would be yelling regardless of how well he heard them and again he went forward the algarvians might blaze him if he did the unkerlanters would surely blaze him if he didnt an algarviana filthy scrawny fellow in the rags of a tunic and kiltthrew up his hands and came out of his hole as ealstan and a couple of unkerlanters drew near i surrender he shouted in his own language ealstans formal algarvian was better than his formal unkerlanter in which he guessed at the meaning a lot of the time and sometimes guessed wrong keep your hands high and go to the rear he told the redhead if you are lucky no one will blaze you mezentios trooper knew how lucky he was not to have been blazed down on the spot babbling thanks he hurried off toward whatever captivity might hold for him you really speak some of their language an unkerlanter said admiringly its not just hands high and drop your stick with you he brought out the couple of phrases almost any unkerlanter soldier could say ealstan shrugged the algarvians made me learn it in school no no its good you know it the soldier in the rockgray tunic said maybe you can talk more of the whoresons into giving up he didnt want to get blazed either the more of mezentios men who surrendered the fewer who would fight to the end that made good sense to ealstan too he didnt need long to see that this push was going to be different before when the unkerlanters probed at gromheort theyd eased off on running into stiff resistance not now now the behemoths pounded algarvian strongpoints outside the shattered walls footsoldiers pushed forward between those strongpoints mezentios men were brave ealstan who hated them as much as any man in forthweg did had seen that for himself both during the dreadful fighting in eoforwic and in his involuntary stay in king swemmels army but courage wasnt going to do them any good not this time a starved cat forced to fight a mastiff might be brave too its bravery wouldnt do it any good the mastiff would kill it just the same as he ran toward a wrecked gate he wondered how many times hed come this way before he knew the one he remembered best walking back to gromheort after the first time hed made love with vanai hed been dazed by joy then he was dazed now too but that was because the buried egg and the load on the behemoths back had burst too close to him the oak grove where hed lain with her was smashed to kindling hed been through it redheads still fought using the rubble of the wall and the gateway for cover beams scorched tracks of black through the grass near ealstans feet behemoths started tossing eggs at the gate ealstan saw pieces of a soldier fly through the air a few more eggs bursting by the gateway meant far fewer blazes came back at the onrushing unkerlanters with a whoop ealstan scrambled over the gray stones of the wall and into gromheort home he yelled then a beam flicked past his ear so close he smelled lightning in the air so much for exultation he threw himself down behind another stone and blazed back nothing was going to come easy mezentios men had had weeks to fortify gromheort and theyd made the most of them theyd probably used the luckless civilians as laborers every street seemed to have a barricade across it every block behemoths broke into the city and started knocking down barricades with their eggtossers but redheads in the buildings on either side of the street dropped eggs on them from rooftops and upper stories ealstan had seen in eoforwic how expensive street fighting could be hed thoughthed hopedhe could simply head for the avenue of countess hereswith where his family lived things werent so simple the way mezentios men were fighting his home might as well have been on the far side of the moon he was running from one barricade towards another when he got blazed one second everything was fine next thing he knew his left leg didnt want to bear his weight any more he landed hard scraping both knees and one elbow at first those small injuries hurt more than his wound then they didnt and he let out a rawedged howl of pain he dragged himself into a doorway leaving a trail of blood behind him like a slugs trail of slime an unkerlanter soldier crouched by him and started bandaging the wound which was in the outside of his thigh not too bad the fellow said encouragingly easy for you to say ealstan answered its not your fornicating leg the unkerlanter laughed finished the job and ran deeper into the city to fight some more ealstan tried once to get up but couldnt manage with the leg limp and useless having no other choice then he lay where he was and watched the bandage turn red it didnt fill with blood too fast which he found moderately encouraging if it had he might have bled to death some unknown stretch of time went by the unkerlanters drove ever deeper into gromheort and the din of battle washed past him maybe he slept or passed out he was certainly surprised when an unkerlanter soldier started to drag him out of the doorway by his feet im not dead you stupid son of a whore he snarled he rather wished he were for the sudden jerk on his wounded leg made it hurt like fire oh sorry buddy the soldier said he called to a pal hey joswe come give me a hand ive got a live one here between the two of them they got ealstan upright and lugged him back toward an infirmary swemmels men had set up near the edge of town he almost wished theyd let him lie where he was the howls of pain coming out of the place sounded anything but encouraging but when they helped him inside he discovered a couple of unkerlanter healers were there working like men possessed along with a bearded forthwegian theyd probably impressed into their service ealstan didnt get a cot he counted himself lucky not to have to lie on another wounded man the place was packed and getting more so by the minute healers and forthwegian women with fresh bandagesalso no doubt pressed into dutyhad to walk carefully to keep from stepping on hands and feet after what seemed like forever a healer got to ealstan he stripped off the field dressing and muttered a charm over the wound to keep it from going bad a forthwegian healer would have used a spell in classical kaunian the unkerlanter spoke his own language he said youll do all right soldier shouted for one of the women to come give ealstan a fresh bandage and went on to the next hurt man the forthwegian woman who stooped beside ealstan was a couple of years older than he on the skinny side and looked weary unto death she plainly had practice putting on bandages maybe shed done it for the algarvians too thank you very much ealstan said in forthwegian he hadnt had many chances lately to use his own tongue youre welcome she replied one eyebrow rising in surprise then she took another longer look at him her eyes widened her mouth fell open ealstan she whispered he recognized her voice where he hadnt known her face conberge he said and reached up to embrace his sister they both burst into tears careless of the staring unkerlanters all around them ealstan asked are father and mother all right andhe felt absurdly pleased with rememberingyour husband she hadnt been married when he fled gromheort to his vast relief she nodded they all were this morning anyhow weve spent a lot of time in the wine cellar but most of the house is still standing well it was anyhow powers above be praised ealstan said and let more tears fall he added mother and father are grandparents vanai and i had a little girl end of last spring conberge set a hand on her own stomach they will be again come wintertime she added how did you turn into an unkerlanter soldier what will they do with you now that youre hurt they caught me and gave me a stick as for the otherhe shrugged well just have to find out ten sakarnu hadnt been back to pavilosta since not long before escaping from merkelas farm one jump ahead of the algarvians whenever hed gone into the village before hed played the role of a peasant no hed done more than play the role hed lived it he still had the calluses to prove it now though he and merkela and little gedominu wouldnt be living at the farm they would be moving into the castle where the traitor count enkuru and his son and successor the traitor count simanu had dwelt first though there was the matter of formally installing skarnu as the rightful overlord for the marquisate newly elevated by royal decree from a county he asked merkela are you sure you dont mind having raunu take over your farm she shook her head im just surprised he wanted it you city people dont usually have the first notion of what to do out in the country she hadnt had the first notion of what to do in the city but skarnu didnt press her about that instead he said well you gave raunuand mea good many lessons and i think this woman hes sweet on will teach him a good deal more his old sergeant had found a farm widow just as he had himself raunus lady friend was a few years older and a good deal more placid than merkela she seemed to suit him well a lot of widows to choose from skarnu thought too many to choose from too many men dead at the edge of pavilostas market square an enterprising taverner had set up a table with mugs of ale and a selection of news sheets from bigger towns the village couldnt support one itself he waved to skarnu calling i always knew you were more than what you seemed and skarnu dutifully waved back that wasnt easy hed been drinking ale at that table and idly going through a news sheet when he saw that his sister was keeping company with an algarvian and now ive got a bastard for a nephew he thought with a sigh and now it will be a long long time before anybody will be able to look at krasta without remembering that how long does disgrace last it had lasted long enough for most of her servants to have deserted her and come out to the countryside with skarnu and merkela that suited skarnu well he didnt know the servitors whod worked for his predecessors maybe they were all right maybe theyd collaborated as enthusiastically as enkuru and simanu had of course the servants from the mansion had had redheads there too and bauska had a little girl with hair the same color as that of krastas baby boy not many people in valmiera had completely clean hands these days i do he thought merkela does the only trouble is she doesnt want to yield even an inch to anyone who doesnt he sighed he could see years of trouble ahead for the kingdom from quarrels like that but today wasnt a day to dwell on troubles coming back to pavilosta feels good he said i should hope so merkela answered i dont see how you stood living in priekule for so long all what youre used to skarnu said but hed had a couple of years to get used to living in this part of southern valmiera the thought of spending a good many years here didnt horrify him as it would have before the war people from pavilosta the nearby village of adutiskis and the farms on the countryside in the area packed the market square a good many of them waved to skarnu as he and merkela made their way through the crowd toward the traditional seat of installation every so often he would spot someone he knew and wave back had he stayed in these parts as a peasant the locals would have reckoned him that fellow whos not from around here till the day he died they would probably say the same thing about him as a marquisbut they might not say it so loud a band struck up a thumping tune merkela drew herself straight with pride thats the counts air she said and then corrected herself no i mean the marquis air dont i she squeezed skarnus hand he leaned over and gave her a quick kiss see what you get for taking in strange men who come stumbling out of the woods i never thought it would come to this she said whether that meant marrying him or coming back to pavilosta in such style he didnt know and didnt ask the two of them had finally made their way up to the seat which was in fact two seats one facing one way one the other skarnu sat down in the seat facing west towards algarve that symbolized the feudal lords duty to defend the peasantry against invasion no doubt in years gone by it had been only one more formality in this ceremony but with the redheads only a few months gone from valmiera opposing them took on a new urgency and people hereabouts knew skarnu had been part of the underground he really had done what he could to fight mezentios men murmurs of approval and even a few cheers rang out as he took his seat a peasant from just outside of adutiskis sat in the other half of the ceremonial seat countsand now a marquiswere traditionally installed in pavilosta so the other village provided the second actor in the drama congratulations your excellency the fellow said in a low voice thanks skarnu said shall we get on with it right you are the peasant replied you do know how its supposed to go aye skarnu said a little impatiently for one thing weve rehearsed it a couple of times and for another i was here in the square when simanu powers below eat him made a hash of things the collaborator had sat in the westfacing seat but hed had plenty of algarvian officers and soldiers in the square to protect him from the folk whose overlord he was supposed to become that whoreson the peasant said he deserved every bit of what he got and more besides and now your excellency if youll excuse me he got to his feet and pushed through the crowd to the edge of the square two cows waited there for him one plump and sleek the other distinctly on the scrawny side he led them back to skarnu as another peasantor perhaps this same fellowhad led them back to simanu the new overlord was supposed to choose the scrawny cow showing that he reserved the best for the people living in his domain skarnu did simanu hadnthed picked the fat one skarnu bent his head and let the peasant give him a light box on the ear which meant he would attend to the concerns of those who lived under his lordship simanu secure in the knowledge that the algarvians backed him hadnt worried about anything else and had dealt the peasant a buffet that knocked him sprawling the riot started immediately thereafter he made the redheads hate him too skarnu thought they wanted peace and quiet in the valmieran countryside not trouble but he was their tool and they were stuck with him till his untimely demise hed blazed simanu himself which was not the way one noble usually acquired anothers domain loud cheers rang out when skarnu accepted the lean cow and the buffet this was the way the ceremony was supposed to go skarnu had lived as a farmer long enough to begin to understand how much people who worked the land for a living appreciated it when things went as they were supposed to go now he had to make a speech he didnt want to do that he would sooner have had another box on the ear but it was part of the ceremony too and so he couldnt escape it he stood up on that westfacing seat an expectant hush fell people of pavilosta people of adutiskis people of the countryside i am proud to become your marquis he said ive lived among you i know what sort of folk you are i know how you never believed the redheads would rule here forever and how you made their lives hard while they were here he got a nice round of applause and i know what a liar i am he thought aye plenty of the locals had opposed mezentios men but plenty hadnt several women in the crowd still had their hair shorter than most because theyd been shorn after the algarvians withdrew a good many men had done a good deal of business with the occupiers but he didnt want to dwell on that part of the past i fought the algarvians as you did he said whatever i can do to protect you from your enemies i will do now you may know that king gainibu appointed me to this place but i will also tell you that i will do whatever i can to protect you from the king should he ever act unjustly thats a nobles duty to his people and ill do everything i can to meet it more cheering this louder and more enthusiastic in the old days nobles really were a shield against royal powernot least because dukes and counts and such didnt care to give up any power of their own things werent so easy for the nobility nowadays kings were stronger than they had been but the pledge was worth making he made another pledge i wont be a scourge on your womenfolk however much i admire them and i admire them so much i married one of them he waved to merkela and kept waving till she finally waved back that got him a different sort of applause warmer and more sympathetic what went through his mind was ill take whatever i can get he hopped down from the high seat and gave the peasant whod boxed his ear one goldpiece and three of silver the amount was as traditional as everything else in the ceremony he wondered how it had first been set and how long ago no one seemed to know people came up to clasp his hand to congratulate himand to start asking him for judgments on their problems and quarrels time after time he said let me find out more before i answer you that seemed to satisfy most of the wouldbe petitioners but not all merkela said you did very well thanks skarnu answered now in another twenty years ill stand up there and make myself another speech till then no thanks but isnt that part of what being a marquis is about merkela asked even a son of a whore like enkuru would do it every so often my people he would call us as if he owned us but we liked to come into priekule to listen to him it gave us a break from what we did every day skarnu thought about that back in priekule nobles were common as dirt remembering some of the people in the capital skarnu knew the resemblance didnt end there and with king gainibu at the apex of the social hierarchy one count or marquis more or less didnt matter much here in the countryside things were different people here wont ever meet the king or even see him so whos at the top of the column then i am by the powers above im the one everybodys going to be looking at slowly he nodded youre right he told merkela im going to have to get out there and show myself even if i dont much want to do it it needs doing she said seriously all right skarnu said but that means youre going to have to get out and show yourself a lot too after all youre the main connection ive got to this part of the kingdom youre the one whos lived here all her life youll have to help me merkela had been smiling when she told skarnu hed need to face the people the smile slipped when he suggested she needed to do it too the shoe pinched differently on her foot even if she needed a moment to gather herself though she nodded too skarnu had expected that she would he put his arm around her of one thing he was abundantly certain she didnt run away from anything sabrinos mother had died while he was fighting in the six years war hed got compassionate leave to go home and see her laid on her pyre but he hadnt been there during her last illness his father had lived another fifteen years before passing away from a slow painful wasting disease he remembered going into the sickroom one day and realizing what he saw on the old mans face was death he looked at algarve now what he saw on his kingdoms face was death not far west of his wings dragon farm the last algarvian army holding the unkerlanter hordes back from trapani was breaking up that it was breaking up didnt surprise him if anything the surprise lay in how long it had held together and how badly it had hurt swemmels soldiers his wing with a paper strength of sixtyfour dragons had eight ready to fly right now theyd flown and flown and flown theyd done everything they could despite exhaustion despite being without cinnabar every algarvian in uniform had done everything he could the kingdom was dying anyhow not enough algarvians remained in uniform to matter maybe we ought to stand aside surrender let the unkerlanters and the cursed islanders finish overrunning us sabrino told captain orosio as they ate black bread and drank spirits in a miserable little tent that some penpushing idiot back in trapani had surely recorded on a map as the headquarters of a fullstrength wing everything would be done then and the kingdom wouldnt get trampled like a naked man trying to stand up to a herd of behemoths orosio looked up from his mug colonel youd better be careful what you say and who you say it to he answered even nowmaybe especially now you cant talk about giving up theyll grab you for treason and blaze you sabrinos laugh held all the bitterness in the world and much difference that would make to me or to algarve i dont think itll happen anyhow mezentio was going to raise us to the powers above instead hes dropped us down to the powers below and he wont quit till theyve eaten every fornicating one of us he took a swig the spirits held out if nothing else did wont be long now you cant talk that way sir orosio sounded worried it really is treason go ahead and report me then youll make yourself a hero a hero of algarve sabrino said the kingll pin the medal on you himself and give you your very own wing you too can command eight dragons you poor sorry sod thats half as many as a squadron is supposed to have but whos counting sir i think youd better go to bed orosio said stiffly he would never report sabrino but the wing commander realized hed pushed further than even his longtime comrade could go with a sigh orosio asked whats left for us now what sabrino waved his hand nothing no sir the younger man sounded very sure we have to go on till we cant go on any more no point to quitting now is there weve come too far for that youre right sabrino said with a sigh orosio looked relieved but the two of them didnt mean the same thing even if they said the same words orosio would go on fighting because fighting was all he had left sabrino would go on because he had nothing whatsoever left maybe we arent so different after all he thought and drained his mug off to the west the sound of bursting eggs was a continuous low rumble and it had been getting closer it might have been an approaching thunderstorm its a storm all right it will blow away the whole kingdom but when sabrino cocked his head the other way he heard bursting eggs off to the east too unkerlanter dragons tormenting trapani before long hed be in the air again doing his best to knock some of them out of the sky and i will and it wont change a sir orosio hesitated then went on that mage who wanted to fly with you maybe you should have let him that filthy bastard no even without the spirits hed poured down sabrinos voice would have held no doubts he wouldnt have thrown back swemmels army and you know it as well as i do hed have just given all our enemies one more reason to hate us and punish us dont you think theyve got enough already i dont know sir orosio yawned enormously i dont know anything except im bloody tired lets both go to sleep then sabrino said and see how long till somebody kicks us out of bed it wasnt nearly long enough sometime in the middle of the night a crystallomancer shook sabrino awake and said im sorry sir but theyre screaming for dragonfliers up at the front when arent they sabrino answered around a yawn he climbed out of his cot and yawned again his head hurt but not too bad all right well do what we can popular assault men and a few real dragonhandlers were loading eggs under the bellies of the wings surviving beasts as sabrino and the handful of dragonfliers he still led strode out toward their mounts northwest the crystallomancer told him thats where the most trouble is sabrino shook his head the most trouble is everywhere but if they want us to fly northwest tonight northwest we shall fly he didnt like flying by night either telling where he was going and what he was supposed to be doing was much harder then no one had asked his opinion if some officer thought things were desperate enough to need dragons in the darkness well with the war in its present state the poor whoreson was all too likely to be right as the dragonfliers scrambled aboard their mounts sabrino said try not to get killed gentlemen algarve will need you again later if they wanted to think he meant algarve will need you to fly more missions that was all right with him if they wanted to think he meant algarve will still need you after the war is over and lost that was all right too and closer to the truth he whacked his dragon with the goad the beast screamed with fury as it flung itself into the air it liked flying at night no better than he but it obeyed as dragons went it was a tractable mountnot that dragons went very far in that direction a bright moon nearly full spilled pale buttery light over the landscape fires and bursting eggs and the flashes from blazing sticks of all weights added more for night flying this was pretty easy work sabrino had no trouble finding the fighting front for that matter he could have found it with his eyes closed just from the din of bursting eggs every time he took his forlorn little wing into the air the front lay farther east unkerlanter armies were lapping around the defenders despite all the algarvians could do to hold them back before long trapani would be caught in a ring of iron a ring of fire i hope my wife had the sense to flee the wing commander thought the city is going to fall and it wont be pretty the collapse of the kaunian empire more than a thousand years before came to mind then though algarvic folk had been doing the sacking soon they would be on the receiving end i dont see anything we can do to stop that maybe we can still push the day back a bit the image of a harriedlooking algarvian crystallomancer down on the ground appeared in the crystal sabrino carried powers above be praised the fellow said theyve bridged the stream in front of us and theyre pouring men and behemoths across can your wing take it out we can try sabrino answered thinking again of symbols on maps you should know though that my wing consists of eight dragons no more eight dragons eight the crystallomancer made a horrible face that isnt what i was given to understand i dont care what you were given to understand sabrino said harshly everything weve been given to understand about this whole fornicating war is a pack of lies now wheres this unkerlanter bridge the crystallomancer told him he soon discovered he could have found it without help the unkerlanters had torches at both ends and along the bridge itself to guide their men and beasts to and across it arrogant bastards sabrino thought they dont even believe were still in the game time to show them theyve made a mistake he ordered his dragon down in an attack run as perfect as any hed ever made he released the eggs it carried at exactly the right moment they both burst in the center of the bridge sending unkerlanter soldiers and behemoths splashing into the stream one after another the men in his wing followed him down by the time they were done not much remained of the bridge nice job boys sabrino said into his crystal now lets go home and go back to bed hed just turned toward the dragon farm from which hed come when the unkerlanter dragons struck his wing there were only a couple of squadrons of thembut that meant they outnumbered his comrades and him three or four to one and their dragons were fresh not worn out and were full of cinnabar they flamed twice as far as the algarvian beasts could for all that sabrinos men were wise in the ways of dragonflying and quickly took out a couple of the enemy beastsone with flame from behind the other by a canny blaze that killed the unkerlanter dragonflier and let the dragon fly wild sabrino thought they might yet break free and win their way back to the dragon farm once more he saw the dragon that got him and his own mount as nothing but a blur in the moonlight and then a tongue of flame licking toward him an instant later he screamed but his shriek was lost drowned in the great bellow of agony from his dragon wind beat in his face as the dragon lurched toward the ground but he hardly noticed his left leg felt on fire when he looked down he saw his left leg was on fire so was the dragon he beat at the flames with his fist the dragon could still fly though after a fashionthe unkerlanter beast had flamed at long range not wanting to close had its dragonflier come closer he would be dead now and so would his mount things were bad enough as they were sabrino wanted to pass out but the torment in his leg wouldnt let him he pounded the dragon with the goad steering it back toward the southeast it didnt make it all the way to the dragon farm it came down in the middle of a field of beets the shock of the landing made sabrino scream again the stench of the dragons burnt flesh and of his own filled his nostrils he loosened the harness and fell to the ground if the dragon crushed him or flamed him in its own agonies everything would be over and he wouldnt have minded at all but it rampaged away leaving him lying there and hoping for death before it found him algarvian soldiers did theyd come to deal with the wounded dragon but they took sabrino back to a healers tent the healer took one look at what was left of his leg and said im sorry colonel but that will have to come off oh please sabrino groaned the healer blinked in surprise then nodded a couple of stalwart helpers lifted sabrino and set him down in what looked like an oversized rest crate his awareness of the world was interrupted when it returned so did pain the healer gave sabrino a bottle of thick sweet nasty stuff he drained it dry after what seemed forever but couldnt have been above a quarter of an hour the pain retreated the healer said youll live i think with a cane and a peg you may even walk again but for you colonel the war is over under the drug that hardly seemed to matter under the drug nothing much seemed to matter maybe i should have started taking this stuff whatever it is a long time ago he thought vaguely he smiled at the healer so what he said up till the derlavaian war broke out ilmarinen hadnt known many unkerlanters the vast kingdom had its share of talented mages but they published less often than their colleagues farther easteither that or they published in their own language rather than in classical kaunian and unkerlanter in ilmarinens biased opinion was a language fit only for unkerlanters mages from unkerlant didnt come to colloquia as often as their counterparts in the kingdoms of eastern derlavai maybe they were afraid of revealing secrets maybe king swemmel feared they would and didnt let them out now ilmarinen had all the chances he wanted to see unkerlanters up close a regular ferry service ran across the albi river which separated kuusaman occupiers of algarve on the east bank from swemmels soldiers on the west ilmarinen found the idea of a ferry interesting too in kuusamo where the rivers froze up in wintertime they were used less often than here in the mild north of derlavai ilmarinen of course found almost everything interesting whenever he got the chance he stuck his mages badge in the pocket of his tunic and crossed over to the west side of the albi to learn what he could about the unkerlanters the ferry a stout rowboat had a crew half kuusaman half unkerlanter when a man from one land needed to talk to one from the other he was more likely to use algarvian than any other tongue for the master mage that was one more irony to savor on the west bank of the albi the unkerlanters looked less than delighted about having visitors from the east but the kuusamans were their allies so they couldnt very well point sticks at them and keep them out ilmarinen wondered what swemmels men made of him without his mages badge what was he a colonel with too many years on him and too much curiosity for his own good as far as he was concerned there was no such thing as too much curiosity for his own good he walked here and there peered at this and that and asked questions whenever he found someone who would admit to speaking a civilized languagewhich didnt happen very often a lot of unkerlanters seemed to go out of their way to deny knowing anything for a while that not only perplexed ilmarinen but also annoyed him but he had a mind quick to see patterns if swemmel was apt to make someone disappear for saying or doing the wrong thing what could be safer than saying and doing nothing but swemmels people couldnt very well have beaten the algarvians by doing nothing it was a puzzlement ilmarinen loved being puzzled he did find a young lieutenant named andelot who spoke some algarvian and didnt seem afraid to speak it to him the fellow said aye is true we have not so much initiative is a word initiative its a word sure enough ilmarinen answered how in blazes did you win without it he had a good many shortcomings of his own lack of initiative had never been one of them too much initiative that was a different story by doing what our commanders order us to do andelot replied this is most efficient way we find when he spoke algarvian he seemed stuck in the present indicative but what happens when your commanders make a mistake ilmarinen asked obeying without question struck him as inhuman he had a certain amount of troubleperhaps more than a certain amountobeying at all what happens when a lieutenant like you or a sergeant say needs to fix a mistake how do you do that when you have no initiative we have some we have less than algarvians maybe but we have some i admit if we have more we do better lieutenant andelot turned and called in algarvian to another older man who came over and saluted returning to a language ilmarinen could follow andelot said here is sergeant fariulf i am sorry but he speaks algarvian not he has initiative he shows over and over well good for him ilmarinen said at first glance fariulf was just another peasant in uniform one badly in need of a shave and a bath first glances though showed only so much ask him how he decides to use it then andelot spoke again in unkerlanter fariulf replied in the same tongue his eyes were guarded as they flicked first to his superior officer then to ilmarinen andelot said he says if i do it not who does when i need to do i do ilmarinen hardly heard the answer he was staring at fariulf sometimes not alwaysa mage could feel power ilmarinen felt it here it wasnt sorcerous power or not exactly sorcerous power but it radiated out from the man like heat from a fire finding such in an unkerlanter peasant was the last thing ilmarinen had expected he was so startled he almost remarked on it a second look at fariulf convinced him that wouldnt be a good idea the sergeant would have hidden that power if he could ilmarinen sensed as much whatever was inside fariulfif that was even the mans true name which ilmarinen suddenly doubtedhe didnt want anyone else to know it was there andelot didnt know ilmarinen was sure of that the lieutenant had said something lost in his own thoughts ilmarinen had no idea what it was im sorry he said i say how you give better answer about initiative andelot repeated i doubt you could but ilmarinen was still eyeing the sergeant and fariulf or whatever his real name was was eyeing him too something like shock showed itself in the unkerlanters eyes he knew ilmarinen knew what he was or some of what he was anyhow that alarmed him little by little ilmarinen realized the fellow might be dangerous if he stayed frightened this was after all the unkerlanter side of the river if i have an accident how hard would anyone try to find out whether it was really accidental not very unless i miss my guess picking his words with care the kuusaman mage said i believe the more initiative a man shows the more he does for himself the better off hes likely to be and the better off the world is likely to be andelot translated for fariulf ilmarinen smiled and nodded he hadnt even been lying now would the unkerlanter see as much andelot said maybe that so in your kingdom believe me sir not always so in unkerlant ilmarinen did believe him in unkerlant from everything hed heard everything hed seen a man who stuck his neck out was asking the axe to come down the mage wanted to talk more with sergeant fariulf to see if he could learn just what sort of power burned behind the stocky mans eyes he would have to be careful he saw as much andelot plainly had no idea what a wonder he had for an underofficer but fariulfan unkerlanter sure enoughwas wary about giving up whatever secrets he possessed he spoke in his own language andelot translated colonel he asks if you done with him if he can go back to duties what ilmarinen felt like doing was kidnapping fariulf and dragging him over to the eastern bank of the albi so he could wring knowledge from him like a man wringing water from a towel he reluctantly recognized he couldnt do that and fariulf alerted now would yield him very little ilmarinen gave up something he didnt like to do im done with him aye tell him thanks and tell him good luck the sergeant got to his feet and took off his power his secrets went with him ilmarinen could feel them leaving he sighed andelot asked is anything else with me colonel i too have duties get out of my hair old man that was what he meant even if he was too polite to say so no nothing else lieutenant ilmarinen answered except for your sergeant you havent got anything very interesting i thank you for your time and for your translating as ilmarinen returned and started back toward the ferry another officer came by this one ilmarinen saw wore a chest badge along with the rank badges on his collar tabs ilmarinen figured out what the badge meant as soon as the fellow looked at him he felt himself recognized for what he was just as hed recognized fariulf for something out of the ordinary the newcomer spoke rapidly in unkerlanter andelot exclaimed in surprise then returned to algarvian this mage saysaysyou too are mage is so he couldnt even lie the other wizard would know he was doing it aye im a mage he replied so what more backandforth in unkerlanter after a bit andelot said this other mage says you are no ordinary mage he says you are strong mage mighty mage is so powers below eat you ilmarinen thought at the unkerlanter wizard it wasnt so much because the fellow was right but because by being right hed made sure ilmarinen couldnt casually visit this side of the river any more getting escorted to things he was supposed to see didnt strike him as much fun is so andelot persisted aye its so ilmarinen said with a sigh you are spy the young lieutenant askeda very unkerlanter question im an ally ilmarinen answered spies are enemies how can i possibly be a spy how can you be spy andelot echoed easy the other mage who didnt speak algarvian had a good deal to say in unkerlanter andelot didnt sound very happy about hearing any of it when swemmels sorcerer finished the lieutenant said you go back to your side of river now you stay on your side of river now you not welcome on this side of river now and is that how one ally treats another ilmarinen demanded doing his best to show more indignation than he felt do you show us all your secrets andelot returned because unkerlanters had to keep so many secrets so inspectors and impressers wouldnt drag them away and do something dreadful to them they were convinced everyone had secrets and guarded them and tried to spy out other peoples plenty of your officers on our bank of the albi too ilmarinen said and odds are theyre spies or some of them are he thought that is that bank of river this is this bank of river andelot said as if that made all the difference in the world maybe to him it did he pointed east toward the riverbank you have to go now ilmarinen went protesting all the while to go quietly would have been out of character for him andelot and the mage walked with him he wondered what the unkerlanters didnt want him to see he wondered if there really was something he shouldnt see curse swemmels whoresons he thought when you start dealing with them you have to start thinking like them lieutenant and wizard stood watching till he boarded the ferry till it began to move till it reached the other side of the river what dont they want me to see is anything at all there can i find out he was planning ways and means when he realized hed given himself a new challenge spring in skrunda was an enjoyable time most years warm without being too hot with just enough rain to keep things green and growing talsu enjoyed this spring even more than the past few not only were the algarvian occupiers gone from jelgava but the news sheets shouted of the triumphs of allied armies deep inside algarve itself a few jelgavan regiments were in the fight too by the way the news sheets trumpeted what they did they might have been whipping king mezentios men all by themselves some peoplepeople who hadnt seen action themselvesdoubtless believed the news sheets talsu knew better he knew what sorts of armies the kuusamans and lagoans had he had a pretty fair notion of what sort of army the unkerlanters had in amongst all those fighters a few regiments of jelgavans would have been like a fingernail nice to have but hardly essential to the body as a whole when he remarked on that to his father traku said well weve got to start somewhere i expect i suppose so talsu admitted but do we have to cackle so much about it he made a noise that might have come from a chicken after it laid an egg traku laughed and then tossed him a pair of linen trousers herethese are ready to go to mindaugu for summer wear hes got himself too much silver to sweat in wool ill take them talsu said ill be glad to in facthis house is near the grocery where gailisas working dont dawdle away the whole day there his father said i would like to get a little more work out of you foosh talsu said his father laughed talsu grabbed the trousers and headed across town with them when he got to mindaugus the wealthy wine merchant took them ducked away to try them on and came out beaming he gave talsu his silver talsu looked the coins over as hed got into the habit of doing wait a bit this ones got mainardos ugly mug on it mindaugu made a sour face i thought id made a clean sweep of those he suddenly looked hopeful the silvers still good you know talsu just clicked his tongue between his teeth he had right on his side and he knew it muttering mindaugu replaced mainardos coin with one that had king donalitus image talsu stuck it and the others in his pocket and headed off to the grocery store i wont spend too much time there he thought but a fellow is entitled to see his wife every once in a while isnt he hed been married for more than a year but still felt like a man on his honeymoon as he left the wine merchants a couple of utterly ordinary middleaged men in clothes even more ordinary a tailors son he noticed such things whod been leaning against a wall stepped out into the middle of the sidewalkand into his path you talsu son of traku one of them asked his voice mildly friendly thats right talsu answered only afterwards did he wonder what would have happened had he lied as things were he just said do i know you you know us well enough replied the man who hadnt asked his name he reached into a trouser pocket and pulled out a short stick such as a constable might use you know us well enough to come along quietly dont you ice ran through talsu when he first saw the stick he thought the men were a couple of robbers he would have given up the silver hed just gotit wasnt worth his life but they knew his name and they wanted him not his money that could only make them king donalitus men as he bleated but i havent done anything he thought he would rather have dealt with robbers quietly i said that was the fellow with the stick charge is treason against the kingdom of jelgava added the other one the one whod asked his name come along they said again this time together the one who didnt have his stick out took talsus arm the other one fell in behind them so he could blaze talsu at the first sign of anything untoward numbly talsu went where they took him if hed done anything else something dreadful would have happened to him he was sure of that donalitus men had no reputation for restraint they didnt lead him in the direction of the constabulary station which surprised him enough to make him ask where are we going he added i really havent done anything not that he thought it would do him any good and it didnt shut up one of them said youll find out where the other told him he did too when they marched him into the leyline caravan depot he wondered how they would keep things quiet and discreet in an ordinary caravan car but being servitors of the king they didnt have to worry about ordinary cars they had a special laid on just for themand him he would gladly have done without the honor what about my family he howled as the carwhich had bars across the windows and sorcerous locks on the doorrolled out of skrunda heading southeast cant pin anything on em yet one of the men whod seized him said that wasnt what talsu meant nor anything close to it but he didnt try to make himself any clearer hed caught the unmistakable regret in the fellows voice the other man said you want to confess now and make it easy on everybody everybody but me talsu thought of course they didnt care about him he said how can i confess when i havent done anything happens all the time the fellow answered talsu believed that hed spent time in a dungeon before how can you arrest me for treason when the cursed redheads arrested me for treason he demanded happens all the time donalitus bully boy said again some people have treason in their blood while talsu was still spluttering over that he went on turn out your pockets everything thats in em you leave anything at all behind youll be sorryyou can bet your arse on that he shoved a tray at talsu having no choice talsu obeyed king donalitus men examined everything with great care especially the coins he set on the tray talsu let out a silent sigh of relief that hed got mindaugu to take back the silverpiece with mainardos algarvian visage on it these whoresons could have made a treason case from it without any other evidence what difference does it make though he thought bitterly they can make a treason case from no evidence at all late in the afternoon the leyline caravan car glided to a halt come on one of talsus captors said the other one murmured the charm that opened the door the dungeon lay right by the ley line out in the middle of nowhere talsu hadnt expected anything else these whoresons wouldnt want to walk very far once they got out of the car guards searched talsu as soon as he got into the dungeon they found nothing the fellows whod seized him had got it all but they had their jobs too and did them then they threw him in a cramped little cell that held nothing but a bucket and a straw pallet he sighed it wasnt as if he hadnt been through this before i have to be ready for the first interrogation he thought they ii let me get hungry firsthe was hungry alreadyand theyll probably wake me up so ill be all muzzy but i have to be ready theyll want to break me right then and there if i break im theirs i cant give in he made himself as comfortable as he could and waited a cart rattled down the corridors suppers talsu thought he knew the sound of that cart it didnt stop at his cell he sighed disappointed but not surprised after darkness fell he stretched out on the musty pallet his growling belly kept him awake for a while but not for too long his dreams were nasty and confused the door flew open with a crash a bright light blazed into his eyes two guards grabbed him and hauled him to his feet come on you one of them shouted talsu went had he not gone the guards would have beaten him and then dragged him where they wanted him to go they mightthey probably would beat him later he was willing to put off the evil moment as long as he could but when they took him into the interrogation chamber he let out a cry of horror and dismay even before they slammed him down onto a hard backless stool the jelgavan major on the other side of the desk greeted him with a smile hello talsu son of traku he said you remember me i see talsu shuddered im not likely to forget you he said the jelgavan major had interrogated him during his last stretch in the dungeons then hed been asking questions for king mainardo and the algarvians now he served donalitu as he had before the redheads invaded then hed been a mere captain bitterly talsu remarked i see you got promoted im good at what i do the interrogator said placidly he wagged a finger at talsu didnt i tell you i would still be here still doing my job under whoever happened to be ruling the kingdom you served the algarvians with all your heart talsu said if thats not treason what in blazes do you call it following orders the major replied i am a useful man and known to be loyal to the king neither of those applies to you his tone sharpened you are charged with associating with kugu the silversmith a known algarvian agent and collaborator during the late occupation what have you got to say for yourself you idiot talsu howled too outraged to remember where he was i went to kugu trying to join the underground against the fornicating algarvians you know thats true you have tohes the son of a whore who betrayed me to the redheads im not referring to that association the interrogator told him im referring to the association you continued to have with him after you were released from your last period of confinement thats plainly treason against king donalitu are you out of your mind talsu said i had to associate with kugu then if i didnt you people would have thrown me back into a cell hed also arranged for the silversmiths untimely demise but he didnt even bother bringing that up he couldnt prove it as hed done it by stealth and sorcery that is no excuse the interrogator said you also provided the occupying authorities with the names of certain people you believed to be loyal to king donalitu arrests were made as a result of your actions punishments were inflicted i will have you know this is a very serious charge occupying authorities talsu started to get up to throttle the fellow the guards slammed him down onto the stool again they didnt try to keep him from talking what occupying authorities you were the bastard who tormented meand tormented my wife tootill i gave you names i did get into the underground and i fought the algarvians while you were probably still torturing people for them subject does not deny the charges the major murmured jotting a note on the pad in front of him talsu howled again a wordless cry of fury the interrogator gestured to the bully boys they went to work on talsu before long he had plenty more reasons to howl over the years bembo had grown used to giving orders it wasnt just that hed been a constable in occupied forthweg hed been a constable long before that here in tricarico people jumped when he told them to jump they did him favors to stay on his good side hed had no trouble getting all sorts of bribes and other sweeteners that was over now and his broken leg had nothing to do with it the leg was healing as well as it could though it looked thin as a twig under the splints that protected it but algarvians didnt give orders in tricarico anymore the city belonged to the kuusamans now and they made who was in charge very plain bembo and saffa sat at a table in a sidewalk cafe drinking wine he would have turned up his nose at before the war and eating olives and salted almonds saffas nosemuch cuter than bemboswrinkled whats that stink she asked taking everything into account tricarico had been lucky during the war devastation had mostly left it alone and when the town fell it fell fast having been in eoforwic bembo knew things didnt have to be that way the grinding fight there had also left him intimately acquainted with the stench in question thats dead bodies he answered and surprised even himself with how casually the words came out oh saffa grimaced thats right those three in the town square id forgotten naughty bembo waggled a forefinger at her the kuusamans dont want you to forget they dont want any of us to forget thats why they hanged those three stupid bastards right in the middle of the square four days ago and its why they havent taken em down too stupid bastards the constabulary sketch artist let out an indignant squawk they were patriots heroes martyrs they were cursed fools bembo said if you arent in the army and you blaze at the people whove taken your town and they catch you this is one of the things thatre liable to happen he remembered some of the things that had happened in eoforwic compared to those hanging was a mercy saffa didnt know about things like that and didnt know how lucky she was not to but the kuusamans are the enemy she protested thats why we have an armyor had an army bembo answered civilians who try to fight against soldiers are what you call freeblazers if the soldiers catch em theyre what you call fair game they were brave saffa said they were bloody dumb bembo told her they didnt do themselves any good and they didnt do algarve any good either we dont have any soldiers in the field anywhere within a hundred miles of here not any more we dont he threw his hands in the air in a gesture of extravagant despair powers below eat everything weve lost saffa stared at him the truth there was obvious the little slanteyed soldiers in the streets made it so maybe she somehow hadnt realized everything it meant though till he all but shouted in her face she bit her lip blinked a couple of times and quietly began to cry dont do that bembo exclaimed he fumbled for a handkerchief didnt find one and gave her a cafe napkin instead come on sweetheart please dont do that he had a soft spot for weeping women most algarvian men did i cant help it she said dabbing her eyes i dont think salamone is ever coming home not from fighting the horrible unkerlanters her tears came faster harder bembo muttered something more or less polite salamone was the fellow whod fathered her son she still hadnt let bembo into her bed or come into his he wondered why he bothered with her he wasnt usually so patient with women maybe it was because hed known her before things got bad and she was a line back to those better days he took a pull at his wine to disguise a snort that was an alarming thing to think about somebody all over prickles like saffa she gave him a look holding a good deal of her old vinegar i know what youre thinking you hope those savages have him for supper and without any salt too no such thing bembo said with an indignation all the louder for being less than sincere but then he followed it with the truth i wouldnt wish getting caught by the unkerlanters on anybody at all saffa eyed him then slowly nodded you may even mean that i do bembo exclaimed remember darling i was in eoforwic when all the unkerlanters in the world came rolling east across forthweg straight at me being who he was of course he saw the battles of the summer before so disastrous for algarve in that light he ate an almond then went on and the cursed forthwegians rose up and stabbed us in the back too fat lot of good it did themnow theyve got swemmel sitting on em instead of us and may they have joy of that its all a mess saffa said which summed things up as well as any four words bembo might have found that it is he said dolefully and then when a plump woman with a pitted complexion almost stumbled over his splinted legwhich had to stick out from the table a bithis gloom turned to spleen watch it lady she glared at him if you were any kind of a man youd have let yourself get killed before all this happened her wave encompassed the whole of tricarico and by extension the whole of algarve she might have held bembo personally responsible for the lost war he wouldnt have taken that from saffa and he certainly wasnt about to take it from a stranger he didnt find attractive if i had anything to do with you i certainly would have let myself get killed before i came home he said and bit his thumb at her a fine algarvian insult the plump woman screeched like a wounded trumpet she drew back a foot to kick bembos bad leg he grabbed a crutch by the wrong end and got ready to swing it like a club algarvians were normally the most chivalrous of men but he wasnt about to let anybody do that leg any more harm saffa snatched up the bowl of olives and made as if to throw it at the woman the olives glistened with oil they would have ruined the plump womans kilt and frock bembo wondered if she didnt find that a more dangerous threat than his makeshift bludgeon mumbling curses under her breath she stalked off with her nose in the air thanks bembo told saffa youre welcome she said that stupid sow had no business coming down on you so you did everything for the kingdom you could what did she do sit around and eat cakes the whole war long by the look of her everything i could do for the kingdom bembo wondered he really had fought and he really had kept order in foreign towns and you sent powers above only know how many kaunians off on their last rides had that helped algarve or hurt it hurt it probably for such things made all her neighbors more certain they couldnt afford to lose but his superiors had ordered it and so hed done it he wished he hadnt had that thought he saw in his minds eye that horrible old kuusaman mage whod looked through him as if the ocean of his soul were no more than ankledeep what that fellow thought of him no better not to imagine what that fellow thought of him and the kuusaman had given him the benefit of the doubt too bembo shivered even though the day was warm almost hot he gulped down the rest of his wine and waved for more before it got there saffas eyes narrowed with anger oh thats too much she said that really is too much bembo wondered what hed done now but her rage wasnt aimed at him she pointed he twisted in his chair up the street came a couple of jelgavan officers in tunics and trousers looking around at tricarico as if theyd conquered it themselves those stinking kaunians have their nerve saffa said savagely they shouldnt show their faces here its not like they beat us no it isnt bembo agreed even so his voice trailed off as far as he could see algarvians were going to have a hard time saying anything bad about kaunian folk even if it was true maybe especially if it was true for generations to come he saw no way to say that to saffa precisely because she didnt know all the things he did shes the lucky one he thought again she stared at the trousered blonds looking daggers into their backs till they went round a corner then she turned back to bembo and said your flat is only a couple of blocks from here isnt it thats right he answered lets go back there she said well see what happens she cocked her head to one side laughing at his flabbergasted expression dont get your hopes up too far you dont move very fast i have plenty of time to change my mind he knew that was true but couldnt hurry on his crutches no matter how much he wanted to he spent most of the time on the way trying to remember how messy the flat was if saffa laughed at him for being a slob she might not want to do anything but laugh she raised an eyebrow at the state of the front room when he opened the door but said only i expected worse and she did go into the bedchamber with him and he being hampered by the splint she rode him as if he were a racing unicorn but that was a race they both could winand by the way she threw back her head and cried out at the end they both did then she sprawled down onto him her breasts soft and firm against his chest ask you something he said running his hand along the sweet curves of her back down toward her bottom one of saffas eyebrows quirked upward the smile she smiled down at him was lopsided too it cant be that one and i didnt know you knew any other questions his hand paused on her backside and pinched not too hard she squeaked bembo said i didnt even need to ask that one you asked me instead remember well maybe i did she said and bent down to kiss the end of his nose hed wondered if she would bite instead but she didnt all right bembo whats your other question i was just wondering why he answered not that im not not happy you didhe kissed her this timebut how come youd been telling me no for so long id kind of got used to it maybe thats why you hadnt been pestering me so much lately saffa said but it was a serious question and after a small pause she gave it a serious answer weve really lost theres nothing we can do about it seeing those cursed jelgavans walking along like they owned the town gave me a kick in the teeth salamone isnt coming home ive got to start over somewhere and im it bembo said it might have been a serious answer but it was a long way from flattering but saffa nodded and youre it this time her smile held fewer barbs better than i thought youd be too thanksi suppose he said she laughed he hadnt slipped out of her and felt himself growing hard once more he began to move slowly and carefully shall we try again then so soon saffa sounded surprised why not bembo answered grandly the only reason why of course was that hed been so very long without he didnt have to tell her that though and she didnt seem displeased after a while she seemed very pleased indeed bembo knew he was colonel lurcanio sat beneath an oak tree just coming into full leaf and contemplated the death and ruination of his kingdom and its army he didnt think the unkerlanters were in trapani yet but he didnt know how much longer his countrymen could hold them away from the capital the last few reports coming by crystal from algarves greatest city had held a note of frantic desperation under their defiance the past couple of days no reports at all had come from trapani enemy mages were blocking the emanations that didnt strike him as a good omen it wouldnt have mattered he muttered even if king mezentio had personally appealed to him to come to the capitals rescue he couldnt have obeyed his sovereign a goodsized algarvian army remained in the field here in the southeastern part of the kingdom but it was cut off from the rest of algarve by the lagoans and kuusamans having bypassed it the islanders seemed content to leave it alone so long as it didnt make a nuisance of itself captain santerno came up to lurcanio the combat veteran didnt bother saluting lurcanio didnt bother reproving him without preamble the captain said sir how in blazes are we going to get out of this mess thats a good question captain lurcanio replied as best i can see theres no way if you want to tell me im wrong id be delighted to hear the whys and wherefores believe me santerno cursed with soldierly fluency when he ran out of curseswhich took a whilehe said i dont see any way either i was hoping you did me lurcanio said what do i know after all i spent the war shuffling papers in priekule and laying valmieran women santerno hadnt thrown his previous duty in his face but his scorn for lurcanio because of it had never been far from the surface now the captain had the grace to cough and shuffle his feet and show a certain amount of embarrassment turned out you knew what you were doing in the field after all sir he said i stopped doubting it after the way you led the brigade down toward the sea this past winter during our last big attack in valmiera we might have gone farther if those kuusamans holed up in that one town hadnt cramped the whole attack lurcanio sighed but it probably wouldnt have made any difference in the long run maybe not santerno drew himself up with a certain melancholy pride we scared the buggers out of a years growth though i suppose we did lurcanio replied and how many men and behemoths and dragons did we throw away doing it we could have used them against the unkerlanters instead dont you think and got more with them his adjutant shrugged i dont give orders like that sir i just follow the ones i get we all just followed the ones we got captain lurcanio waved as if to show this last bypassed army trapped in its pocket and look what we got for following them before santerno could answer that a soldier came up to lurcanio and said sir theres an enemy soldier coming up under flag of truce is there lurcanio heaved himself to his feet however much his weary bones protested ill see him the soldier nodded and trotted off to bring back the foe hes going to ask for our surrender santerno said probably lurcanio agreed i cant give it to him of course i would if i could he thought but kept that to himself aloud he went on all i can do is pass him along to general prusione and i expect i will but his resolve wavered when he saw the fellow who came in under the white flag not that the major in the greenish brown tunic and trousers was ugly but he was unquestionably a valmieran do you speak classical kaunian colonel he asked in that tongue i regret to tell you i have no algarvian i know valmieran major lurcanio replied in that language what can i do for you this afternoon my name is vizgantu colonel the valmieran said plainly relieved to be able to use his own speech please take me to your commander i have been sent to request the surrender of the algarvian army in this pocket further resistance on your part plainly being hopeless why spill more blood to no purpose lurcanio took a deep breath major vizgantu i am going to send you back to your own superiors instead i mean no personal offense to you sir but having a valmieran demand our surrender is an insult nothing less we may have lost this war but we did not lose it to your kingdom i spent more than four very pleasant years in priekule i should have a child there now as a matter of fact captain santerno laughed out loud major vizgantu turned red doing his best to choke back rage he said you are in a poor position to tell the armies opposing you what to do colonel by the powers above i hope you pay for your insolence my whole kingdom is paying lurcanio thought what algarve had made her neighbors pay never entered his mindthat was their worry not his he turned to the soldier whod brought the valmieran to him you may take this gentleman to the front once more his flag of truce will be honored as he returns to his own side of course you bastard vizgantu snarled my bastard as i told you is back in priekule lurcanio answered calmly unless its valnus bastard he shrugged he would gladly claim paternity here just to watch the valmieran steam he wondered how many times krasta had been unfaithful to him and with whom another shrug as many as she thought she could get away with or i miss my guess it wasnt as if hed spent all his nights in her bed off went the valmieran still furious and not trying very hard to hide it any more santerno came over and slapped lurcanio on the shoulder well done your excellency well done your occupation duty turned out to be good for something after all you put that fellow in his place as neatly as you please and now we find out how much well pay for my pleasure lurcanio replied if the islanders are annoyed enough theyll plague us with their eggtossers for the rest of the day and the lagoans and kuusamans did exactly that the eggtossers the algarvians had left did their best to reply huddling in a hole in the ground lurcanio was glumly certain their best would not be good enough the next morning major vizgantu returned white flag and all a different soldier brought him to lurcanio saying sir this cursed kaunian says he is ordered to report to you if youre still alive i think i may qualify lurcanio answered which made the soldier chuckle lurcanio bowed to the valmieran and a good day to you major we meet again so we do vizgantu said coldly he took from his pocket a folded leaf of paper which he held out to lurcanio this is for you thank you so much lurcanio unfolded the paper it was written in classical kaunian to colonel lurcanio of the algarvian army greetings he read major vizgantu is my chosen representative in requesting a surrender of the algarvian forces currently surrounded in this area if you do not permit him to proceed to your commander no other representative will be proffered and no other request for surrender will be made the fate of your army will be left in that case to the chances of the battlefield the choice sir is yours your humble servant marshal araujo commanding allied armies in southern algarve have you read this lurcanio asked the valmieran a slight smirk was all the answer he needed he let out a long sigh the enemy commander had had his revenge and had taken more than hed expected was araujo bluffing lurcanio studied the note again he didnt think so and he knew the army of which he was a part had no hope of stopping any serious push the lagoans and kuusamansaye and the valmieranschose to make what is your answer colonel vizgantu demanded lurcanio contemplated his choice give up his pride or give up any hope for the soldiers in the pocket with him he knew more than a few of his countrymen who would have sacrificed the army for the sake of pride had he been younger he might have done the same himself as things were he thought of salvaging what he could by insulting the valmieran again by saying that if marshal araujo a distinguished soldier chose to use a man who was anything but as his emissary that had to be respected but he himself deplored it he thought of it then shook his head it would have come out as childish petulance no more all he said was i shall send you forward major thank you vizgantu said you might have done this yesterday and saved everyone a good deal of difficulty so i might have but i did not lurcanio replied and i doubt everything was perfectly smooth in valmiera almost five years ago when you folk found yourselves on the other end of victory vizgantu gave back a proverb in classical kaunian the last victory counts for more than all the others before it since lurcanio knew that to be true he didnt try to argue it he just sent the valmieran major deeper into the pocket the algarvians still held if the algarvian commander chose to surrender that was or at least might have been his privilege and if he chose to fight on if he chooses to fight on hes a madman lurcanio thought that of course had little to do with anything if the algarvian commander chose to fight on his men would keep fighting for as long as they could lurcanio didnt know what good it would do but he hadnt known what good further fighting would do for quite a while he didnt want to die at this stage of the warhis goal was to be blazed by an outraged husband at the age of but he knew he would go forward if ordered or hold in place as long as he could the order didnt come instead that afternoon a runner announced general prusione will yield up this army at sunrise tomorrow its over then lurcanio said dully and the runner nodded he looked not far from tears it wasnt quite over of course around trapani and here and there in the north the algarvians still fought on surrendering to unkerlant was different from yielding to lagoas and kuusamodifferent and much more frightening the algarvians had plenty of reason to worry about how their enemy in the west would treat them once they gave up and even about whether king swemmel would let them give up but that wasnt lurcanios concern he took a certain pride in knowing hed made a tolerably good combat soldier it hadnt mattered though however well hed fought algarve still lay prostrate when the sun rose he led his men out of their holes lagoan soldiers relieved them of their weapons and whatever small valuables they had lurcanio strode into captivity with his head up eleven newssheet vendors in eoforwic shouted that gromheort had fallen vanai cared very little about that the vendors also shouted about the hard fighting forthwegs unkerlanter allies had done vanai cared very little about that either but she did fear hard fighting in gromheort would have taken a toll on the civilians there she hoped ealstans family had come through as well as possible newssheet vendors said never a word about oyngestun vanai would have been astonished if they had her home village a few miles west of gromheort wasnt important enough to talk about unless you lived there she didnt worry about her own family her grandfather was all shed had left and brivibas was dead vanai wasnt particularly sorry either tamulis the apothecary was the only person in the village she cared about even a little hed been kind to her after her grandfather took up with major spinello and even after shed had to take up with spinello herself but tamulis was as much a kaunian as she was which meant the odds hed come through werent good saxburh pulled herself upright with the help of the sofa in the flat and cruised from one end to the other holding on as soon as she let go she fell down she laughed it hadnt hurt her a bit of course she didnt have very far to fall she looked over at vanai mama she said in an imperious tone that couldnt mean anything but pick me up im your mama vanai agreed and did pick her up saxburh called her mama much more often than dada these days she said a couple of other words toohat most often after a cheap linen cap she loved to jam down onto her headand a lot of things that sounded as if they ought to be words but werent she was getting close to her first birthday vanai found that preposterously unlikely but knew it was true saxburh tried to eat her nose that was the babys way of giving kisses vanai gave her a kiss too which made her squeal and giggleand a moment later screw up her face and grunt vanai sniffed aye what she thought had happened had happened youre a stinker she said and set about cleaning up the mess saxburh didnt like that so well and being more mobile than before she kept doing her best to escape vanai had to hold her with one hand and wipe her bottom and put a fresh rag on her with the other battle won she kissed saxburh again and asked how would you like to go down to the market square with me it wasnt really a question for saxburh had no choice vanai scooped her up and stuffed her in her harness she also scooped up some silver grimacing as she did so the money wouldnt last a whole lot longer and she didnt know what she would do when it looked like running out whatever i have to do she thought and made another sour face whatever i have to do reminded her of something else she renewed the spell that let her look like a forthwegian she did that whenever she went outside these days she couldnt see the effect of the magic on herself and didnt want it wearing out where other people could see her it was again legal to be a kaunian but that didnt mean it was easy she chanted a thirdperson version of the disguising spell over saxburh too with her daughter she could see it work thanks to ealstan saxburh already had dark hair and eyes but her skin was too fair and her face too long for her to look quite like a fullblooded forthwegian a little sorcery though mended that for hours at a time vanai clicked her tongue between her teeth as she carried the baby down to the street i am going to teach you kaunian she said softly if i have to teach you when to speak it and when not to ill do that too maybe kaunianity wouldnt be extinguished in forthweg maybe it would just go into hiding considering what the algarvians had tried to do to her people that would be something of a triumph little by little eoforwic showed signs of coming back to life a postman nodded to vanai as she lugged saxburh toward the market square good morning he said and tipped his hat she nodded back no one had sent her or ealstan anything for a long time but shed started checking the brass box in the lobby to her block of flats again these days the idea of finding something there wasnt an absurdity maybe ealstan will post me a letter the way he did when i was still living in oyngestun she thought if he had sent her any they hadnt got to her she wondered whether unkerlanter soldiers were even allowed to write letters for that matter she wondered how many unkerlanters even knew how to write her opinion of forthwegs western neighbors was no higher than the view forthwegians had of their more numerous cousins guthfriths band thumped and blared away in a corner of the market square vanai stayed away from that corner of the square and hoped guthfrith who when not sorcerously disguised himself was also the much more famous ethelhelmhadnt noted her arrival she bought black olives and raisins and smoked almonds she fed raisins to saxburh as they went back to the block of flats only when she was halfway there did she realize shed taken no pains to keep ethelhelm from seeing which way she went she shrugged she didnt think hed given her any special notice she hoped not he made her nervous when she looked back over her shoulder she saw no one following her she cocked her head to one side and listened the band was still playing which meant ethelhelm was still where he belonged vanai sighed with relief and went on she let saxburh walk beside her for a few paces holding her hand the baby seemed to think she was a very large person indeed after that and didnt want to go back into her harness again in the lobby of the block of flats vanai tried the mailbox to her astonishment it held an envelope with an image of king beornwulf in one cornera rather smeary image plainly turned out in a hurry to avoid having to use frankings from algarve or from king pendas day the envelope was addressed to her as thelberge and to saxburh its your father she exclaimed to saxburh who else would know the babys name but that wasnt ealstans script which she knew as well as her own with her daughter and the food on her hands opening the envelope was impractical down here she thrust it into her handbag and raced up the stairs to her flat faster than shed ever gone before she took the baby out of the harness and set her on the floor as always after going to and from the market square saxburh was glad to escape and crawl around vanai tore the envelope open and had to be careful not to tear the letter inside it too she unfolded the leaf of paper and began to read to her surprise the letter inside was in accurate classical kaunian not forthwegian to my daughterinlaw and granddaughter greetings vanai read i hope that this finds both of you well and that it reaches you safely now that gromheort and eoforwic are once more under the same administration i have some hope that this may be so and send it in that hope she smiled that was an opening as formal as any in the surviving letters from the glory days of the kaunian empire but the smile fell from her face as she read on i must tell you that ealstan was wounded in the leg during the final unkerlanter attack on gromheort he discovered we had come through the siege by one of those coincidences that would embarrass a writer of romances he was nursed at a station for the wounded by his sister conberge the wound is healing it threatens neither life nor the limb though he may have something of a limp even after the healing is complete i am doing everything i can to have him formally released from unkerlanter service not only has he shed his blood for king swemmel but he is unlikely to be on his feet before the war against algarve ends if i were dealing with the redheaded barbarians the matter would be easy with those from the west it is less so but i hope i can manage it he sends you his love as should not surprise you writing letters home is actively discouraged among the unkerlanter soldiery but i shall do my best to smuggle out a note if he manages to produce one in the meantime let me say that i very much look forward to meeting both you and your daughter and that both of you will be welcome in this house in whatever guise you wear your fatherinlaw hestan that should have ended it that was enough and more than enough but ealstans father also wrote you should know that my brother hengist yet lives and that he and i are as completely estranged as two men can be when last i heard hengists son sidroc survived too since he remains in plegmunds brigade perhaps this state of affairs will not continue indefinitely vanai looked over at saxburh whod just pulled herself up and fallen down again her own tears blurred the little girl in her sight your father is still alive vanai said that he was wounded was less than shed hoped but ever so much better than it could have been hell be all right or pretty much all right he may even get out of the unkerlanter army before too long powers above make it so saxburh paid no attention when ealstan came home his daughter would have to get to know him all over again vanai slowly nodded that was all right saxburh would have the chance to do it having the chance was all that really mattered hell be all right vanai said again she went through the letter for a second time then nodded once more reading hestans words she saw or thought she saw a good deal about how ealstan had come to be the way he was she was always glad to be reminded not all forthwegians despised the kaunians who dwelt in their kingdom beside them ealstan is going to be all right even that much sang within her she began to think about what things would be like once the war finally ended and forthweg started pulling itself together i wont have to stay in this miserable flat the rest of my life saxburh and i could go to gromheort i could find out if the thelberge face i wear really does look like conberge the way ealstansbeen saying it does i could meet other people who care whether i live or die after everything shed been through that thought struck her as strange then she shook her head the algarvians had cared whether she lived or died too the trouble was theyd wanted her dead hestan and his wifeelfryth that was her namewouldnt presumably conberge wouldnt either the same might even hold true for her husband whose name vanai couldnt have remembered had her life depended on it she went over and picked up saxburh and gave her a big loud smacking kiss saxburh thought that was the funniest thing in the world vanai carried the baby to the window she needed all the sunshine she could find a moment later she pulled back again if that wasnt guthfrith coming up the street but it was and she didnt want him seeing her up here why arent you playing music she thought angrily if he walked into this block of flats her anger was going to turn to fear to her relief he walked past instead but under the relief unease remained she went looking for a leaf of paper with which to answer hestan before too long civilian leyline caravans would again be running between eoforwic and gromheort maybe she would do well to go east just as soon as she could ahead of leudast trapani burned he could see the capital of algarve now see the tall buildings that marked the heart of the great city some of them were plainly shorter than they had been before dragons started dropping eggs on them if they all fell over leudast didnt care he just wanted to be there at the end of the fight whenifthat finally came the unkerlanters had fought their way into the suburbs of trapani theyd surrounded the city but the last couple of rings of defenses still lay ahead so did whatever nasty magecraft the redheads had left a storm of eggs fell on the algarvian positions in front of leudasts men a couple of behemoths lumbered toward them and flung more eggs at whatever the tossers behind the lines hadnt flattened leudast blew a blast from his officers whistle forward he yelled not all the algarvians were dead however much he wished they would have been they knew everything there was to know about taking shelter as soon as the unkerlanters broke cover to rush toward them they popped up and started blazing men in rockgray tunics fell some hit some diving for cover hands high leudast shouted in algarvian sticks down an algarvian emerged from behind a wall he did have his hands high leudast gestured with the business end of his stick the redhead hurried away leudast doubted he was more than fifteen years old king mezentio was scraping the bottom of the barrel of course so was king swemmel some of the men leudast led had no more years on them than the new captive had the algarvians been strong enough to keep the war going another couple of years neither they nor the unkerlanters would have had any men at all left alive seeing that the first redhead who surrendered didnt get killed out of hand more of mezentios menor rather mezentios boyscame out of hiding with their hands above their heads leudast and his countrymen sent them off to the rear too but then beams from closer to the center of trapani knocked down several of the kilted soldiers who were trying to get out of the fight leudast dove for cover again but the diehards up there seemed more interested in blazing algarvians who yielded than the unkerlanters who made them give up in swemmel such men would have served as behindthelines inspectors whose job was to get rid of any man seeking to retreat without orders leudast had always despised themdespised them and feared them too he wasnt sorry to see the other side also had them if nothing else it proved his kingdom wasnt the only one where such whoresons grew behemoths tossed eggs at the buildings and piles of rubble from which the diehards were blazing as the unkerlanter footsoldiers rushed toward the strongpoints the surviving redheads popped out of their holes and blazed away at them shouting algarve and mezentio the fight didnt last long not all that many algarvians were stubborn enough to fight so fiercely for a cause now hopeless and swemmels men were there in large numbers but the algarvians who did fight refused to take a step back dying in place instead and they made the unkerlanters pay full price pay more than full pricefor digging them out more algarvian soldiers did give up once the knot of diehards was gone fear of them had kept others fighting but mezentios soldiers had turned a park and a few nearby houses into a strongpoint they had some eggtossers there and a behemoth mounting a heavy stick that took advantage of the rubble to blaze from cover again and again knocking over several unkerlanter beasts might as well be sulingen leudast thought hed been through the blockbyblock fighting there perhaps the worst of the whole war a moment later he wished the comparison hadnt occurred to him hed been wounded in sulingen too he didnt want that to happen again hed picked up another wound later on in the duchy of grelz as far as he was concerned two pale puckered scars for the sake of his kingdom were quite enough clearing the redheads from their little redoubt took all day not till dragons swooped down from above and killed that behemoth did the job get done things were easier in that regard here than in sulingen the algarvians had hardly any dragons left now back then leudast had spent plenty of time cowering in holes in the ground as algarvian beasts flamed and dropped eggs from above not that holes in the ground were any too pleasant now leudast dragged a dead algarvian out of a good one in the middle of the park and settled down for the night hed just gone to sleep when he had to come out of the hole and fight again using darkness as their cloak mezentios men made a ferocious counterattack and almost drove the unkerlanters from the ground theyd taken more dragons and behemoths finally threw the redheads back these buggers dont know how to quit do they sir asked a young soldier named noyt his voice broke in the middle of the question he didnt need to scrape a razor across his cheeks to keep them smooth hed been a little boy when the war started theyre like snakes leudast agreed theyll fight you till you cut the head offand if you pick up the head a couple of hours later itll twist around and bite you even though its dead he rolled himself in his blanket and fell asleepand woke again in short order when a mosquito bit him on the end of the nose the algarvians might not have many dragons left in the air but trapani lay in the middle of a marsh plenty of things with wings came forth to attack the unkerlanters when morning came leudast woke again this time with the feeling something was badly wrong somewhere even though he couldnt put his finger on what he was an officer these days and entitled to sniff around and try to find out hed done the same thing as a sergeant and as a common soldier too but fewer people could squelch him now he walked up to captain dagaric and asked whats going on sir something is sure as sure and i dont think its anything good you think so too eh the regimental commander answered i hadnt noticed anything myself but i saw a couple of mages putting their heads together and muttering a few minutes ago that doesnt sound good leudast said what are the fornicating algarvians going to throw at us now who knows dagaric said with weary cynicism well have to find out the hard way i expect thats what were for after all huh leudast said ive had to find out too cursed many things the hard way once in a while id like to know ahead of time he went off in search of the mages his superior had seen and found them under an oak whose trunk was badly scarred with beams as dagaric had said they were talking in low voices and both looked worried leudast stood around waiting for them to notice him he waited more ostentatiously with each passing minute at last one of the sorcerers said you want something lieutenant i want to know what the redheads are brewing up leudast answered theyve got something ready to pop sure as blazes both wizards wore captains rank badges but he didnt waste much military courtesy on them they were only mages after all not real officers they looked at each other one of them asked have you wizardly talent not that i know of leudast said just a bad feeling in the air very bad the mage agreed something is coming and we dont know what all we can do is wait and see can we send dragons to drop eggs on the heads of the whoresons cooking up whatever it is leudast asked if theyre trying not to get smashed into strawberry jam they cant very well cast spells the wizards brightened do you know lieutenant that isnt the worst idea anyone has ever had said the one who did the talking you boys are the ones to take care of it leudast said hiding a smile youre the ones who deal with crystals and such the mages might outrank him but he could see what needed doing they sometimes put him in mind of bright children they could come up with all sorts of clever schemes but a good many of those had nothing to do with the real world whistles shrilled again leudast trotted away from the mages without a backwards glance if the attack was heating up again he needed to be with his men as they pushed on toward the heart of trapani but as he moved forward he suddenly discovered that he wasnt going forward at all his feet were moving up and down but each new step left him in the same place as had the one before it cries of alarm said he wasnt the only unkerlanter soldier thus afflicted he didnt know how the algarvian mages were doing this but they plainly were a glance told him the behemoths were similarly frozen in place unkerlanter soldiers started falling as hidden redheads blazed them they could still run away from the heart of trapani some of them did leudast discovered he could move sideways and more important that he could duck get down he called to the men closest to danger get into cover you can do it some people wouldnt have figured it out for themselves but would manage to do it once told they could scuttling behind a boulder leudast wondered if the entire unkerlanter assault on trapani all the way around the algarvian capital had been frozen in its tracks he wouldnt have been surprised algarvian mages didnt think small they never had not since they started killing kauniansand very likely not before then either algarvians were flamboyant folk eggs kept on bursting deeper inside trapani they cant stop everything leudast exclaimed hed had the right of it while talking with his own wizards it was up to the fellows who served the eggtossers now if they killed or wounded or at least distracted the sorcerers who made the spell work the attack could resume again if not leudast looked up a couple of dragons painted unkerlanter rockgray hovered like oversized kestrels unable to go forward no matter how powerfully they beat their great wings even as he watched a beam from an algarvian heavy stick tumbled one of them from the sky he waited every now and then blazing from behind that boulder maybe the eggs the unkerlanters hurtled into trapani finally did what they were supposed to maybe mezentios mages could hold their spell for only so long maybethough he wouldnt have bet much on ittheir unkerlanter counterparts at last beat down their wizardry whatever the reason shouts of urra rang out when swemmels soldiers discovered they could go forward again why are we cheering leudast wondered as he ran towards a house from which a couple of diehards were blazing now weve got another chance to get killed one of the diehards showed himself at a windowonly for a moment but long enough for leudasts beam to cut him down urra leudast yelled king swemmel revenge maybe that one word said everything that needed saying aye we might get killed but well do a lot of killing first before long trapani was going to fall he intended to be one of those who helped bring it down urra he cried again and ran on not a lot of mail came to the hostel in the naantali district as far as most of the world was concerned that hostel didnt exist pekka and the other mages who labored there might as well have dropped off the face of the earth even relatives who knew the sorcerers were working somewhere didnt usually know where and relied on the post office to get letters where they needed to go one envelope that got to pekka did not at first look as if it had come to the right place the printed design on the corner that showed postage fees had been paid was not kuusaman after a bit of puzzling she figured out the letter was from jelgava i dont know anyone in jelgava she thought i certainly dont know anyone in jelgava who knows im here even the script challenged her printed jelgavan used the same characters as kuusaman but the two kingdoms handwritings were quite different her name wasnt on the envelope a chill ran through her when she realized leinos was she turned the envelope over there on the back in red was a stamp in her own language military postdeceased forward to next of kin pekkas lips skinned back from her teeth that explained how shed got the letterexplained it in more detail than shed wanted she opened the envelope the letter inside was in jelgavan too she had only a few words of the language and could make out next to nothing of what it said she found fernao in the refectory at suppertime he was demolishing a plate of corned venison and red cabbage do you read jelgavan she asked sitting down beside him pointing to his supper she added that looks good it is he said and then asked why do you need me to read jelgavan i can probably make sense of itits as close to valmieran as sibian is to algarvian maybe closer and i dont have much trouble with valmieran here i got this today pekka gave him the letter i knew you were good with languages can you tell me what it says a serving girl came up pekka ordered the venison and cabbage for herself too let me see fernao started to read then looked up sharply this is to your husband i know pekka had destroyed the envelope with that hateful rubber stamp it got sent to me what does it say she wondered not for the first time if leino had had a jelgavan lover she could hardly be angry at him now if he had it would go some way toward salving her own conscience even so she started when fernao said its from a woman he continued shes writing about her husband was the fellow angry at leino pekka didnt care to come right out and ask that instead she said what does she say about him says he helped your husband when he was with the irregulars but now hes disappeared and shes afraid hes been thrown into a dungeon fernao replied she asks if leino can do anything to get him out a jelgavan dungeon pekka winced jelgavan dungeons had an evil reputation leino she remembered had met king donalitu aboard the habakkuk met him and despised him helping anyone whod fallen foul of his men seemed worth doing she asked who is this fellow his name is talsu hes from a town called skrundawhereabouts in jelgava that is powers above only know i know i dont not without a book of maps fernao said his wifes called gailisa that name meant nothing to pekka talsu on the other hand aye leino said something about him in a letter he helped our men slip through the algarvian lines in front of this skrunda place you probably ought to see what you can do for him then fernao said pekka smiled and nodded glad he was thinking along with her leino had done a lot of that if fernao could tooand if she could with himthat struck her as promising fernaos next question was thoroughly practical do you think you can do anything by myself no why should any jelgavan want to listen to me but ive got connections and what good are they if i dont use them listening to herself pekka had to laugh she sounded very much like a woman of the world not a theoretical sorcerer from a town that looked southwest toward the land of the ice people shed seen fernao smile a couple of amused and tolerant smiles in kajaani though hed done his best to hide them he nodded vigorously now good for you at least half the time knowing people counts for more than knowing things does pekkas supper arrived then she ate quickly for she wanted to get to the crystallomancers chamber as soon as she could when she walked in she said put me through to prince juhainen if hes not too busy to talk aye mistress pekka said a crystallomancer the same woman whod summoned her to this chamber to hear juhainen tell her leino was dead pekka tried not to think of that now the crystallomancer went about her business with unhurried precision after a couple of minutes she looked up from the crystal in which the princes image had appeared go ahead hello your highness pekka said i have a favor to ask of you if youd be so kind that depends mistress pekka juhainen answered one of the things ive learned the past couple of years is not to make promises till i know what im promising im sure thats wise pekka said and went on to explain what talsus wife had asked of her a jelgavan dungeon eh prince juhainens mouth twisted as if hed just smelled something nasty i dont believe i would wish my worst enemy into a jelgavan dungeon and you say this talsu fellow actually helped our men thats right your highness pekka nodded and theyve flung him into one of these miserable places anyhow juhainen said pekka nodded again the prince scowled that is not good he declared which from a kuusaman carried more weight than screamed curses from an excitable algarvian he continued thank you for bringing it to my notice i shall see what i can do will the jelgavans heed you sir pekka asked if gratitude means anything they will juhainen answered but his smile was wry as often as not gratitude means nothing at all between kingdoms truth to tell mistress pekka i dont know what will happen i dont know whether anything will happen but i do mean to find out he turned and nodded to someone to his own crystallomancer for the sphere in front of pekka flared and then to the eye became once more nothing but glass the crystallomancer on duty at the hostel said not a word of course shed heard everything that passed between pekka and juhainen but the secrecy inherent in her craft kept her silent as it should have done when pekka went upstairs she went to fernaos room not to her own well the lagoan mage asked pretty well pekka told him prince juhainen says hell see what he can do good fernao said if donalitu and his flunkies will listen to anybody theyll listen to one of the seven princes of kuusamo his smile though had the same wry edge as juhainens had of course theyre jelgavans theres no guarantee they will listen to anybody ordinary jelgavans arent bad theyre justpeople pekka said i was up on the beaches of the north there once on on holiday the holiday had been her honeymoon with leino she felt an odd constraintor maybe it wasnt so oddabout talking too much with fernao about her life with her husband their nobles though fernaos chuckle held little mirth most hidebound people in the world bar none they make valmieran nobles look like levelers and thats not easy i hope prince juhainen can do something for that poor fellow pekka said how terrible to help his kingdom and end up in a dungeon anyhow donalitu and his bully boys root out treason wherever they think they see it fernao replied my guess is they root it out whether its really there or not sooner or later theyll end up breeding real treason that way whether it would have sprung up without them or not that makes more sense than what donalitus doing pekka said leino wrote that some jelgavans were fighting on king mezentios side in spite of what mezentios men were doing to kaunians now that i hear what happened to this talsu that makes a little more sense to me donalitu is a bad bargain and nobody could possibly make him better fernao said the only thing i would give him is that hes better than mezentio he sighed im not altogether sure id give king swemmel even that much hes a son of a whore no doubt about itbut hes a son of a whore whos on our side any war that puts us on the same side as the unkerlanters pekka shook her head but the algarvians really have done worse so they have fernao didnt sound any happier about it than pekka had worse than the unkerlantersif thats not bad i dont know what is he changed the subject are we going to go ahead with the demonstration out in the bothnian ocean we certainly are pekka said also relieved to talk about something else that needs doing wouldnt you say if it works certainly if it doesnt fernao shrugged well its certainly worth trying the same as getting this whatshisname talsu pekka said talsu the lagoan mage echoed getting him out of the dungeon the demonstrations a little more important though i should hope so pekka exclaimed if the demonstration does what we want it to it might even end this war the very words tasted strange to her the derlavaian war had gone on for almost six years though kuusamo had been in the fight for only a little more than half that time long enough for death and devastation and disaster to seem normal and everything else an aberration it had cost pekka as much as shed feared in her worst nightmares and a couple of times all but cost her life when the war is over fernao didnt sound as if he really believed in the possibility either may it be soon thats alland may we never have another one powers above make that so pekka said another war starting from the beginning with everything weve learned during this one with whatever else we learn afterwards too i dont think thered be anything left of the world once we got through youre probably right fernao said and do you know what else if were stupid enough to fight another war after everything weve seen these past few years we dont deserve to live the whole human race i mean i dont know that id go quite so far but then pekka thought about it for a little while deliberately inflict these horrors again with the example of the derlavaian war still green in memory she sighed on the other hand i dont know that i wouldnt either hajjaj stepped into the crystallomancers chamber down the hall from the foreign ministry offices in the royal palace the crystallomancer on duty sprang to his feet and bowed good day your excellency he said good day kawar hajjaj replied the crystallomancer beamed hajjaj had long since learned how important knowing and recalling the names of underlings could be he went on what is the latest word from the south that depends on whose emanations youre listening to your excellency kawar said i wouldnt have expected anything else the zuwayzi foreign minister said give me both sides if youd be so kind and i expect ill be able to sort them out for myself bowing kawar said just as you require sir so shall it be by what the unkerlanters say trapani is surrounded cut off from the outside world and sure to fall in the next few days fighting in the rest of algarve is dying down as the redheads realize resistance is suicide and useless suicide at that and the algarvian response to this is your excellency by what the algarvians put out over the ether they still think theyve got the war as good as wonalthough none of their reports comes from inside trapani anymore kawar answered they say their capital will stay algarvian they say gromheort and the marquisate of rivaroli will be algarvian again and they say their secret sorceries will smash swemmels savages thats what they say sir by that kawar no doubt meant he didnt believe a word of it hajjaj understood such skepticism he didnt believe a word of it either the algarvians claims reminded him of the last ravings of a man about to die of fever they had no connection to reality that he could find he sighed mezentios men had been zuwayzas cobelligerents against unkerlantthough the redheads with some reason would have taken that the other way round none of those reflections was anything a crystallomancer needed to hear hajjaj said thank you kawar it sounds as though things will be over there before too long kawar nodded with another word of thanks hajjaj left the crystallomancers chamber what might happen after the fighting finally stopped worried him a good deal king swemmel had given zuwayza relatively lenient terms for getting out of the derlavaian warhed been shrewd enough not to provoke hajjajs kingdom to desperate resistance while the bigger battle with algarve still blazed but would he keep the terms of the peace hed made after he didnt have to worry about algarve anymore swemmel was not notorious for keeping promises that raised the next interesting question if swemmel tried to take a firmer grip on zuwayza what shouldwhat couldthe zuwayzin do about it not much was the answer that immediately occurred to hajjaj he didnt think king shazli would like it he didnt like it himself but liking it and being able to do anything about it were liable to be two different things when he walked back to his own offices his secretary greeted him with and the latest is about what youd expect qutuz hajjaj replied the death throes of algarve except the algarvians refuse to admit theyre any such thing qutuz grunted what will it take do you suppose the very last of them dead and their last house knocked flat it may take something not far from that hajjaj said sourly no one would ever claim the algarvians are not a stubborn folk no one would ever claim theyre not a stupid folk for fighting on when all it does is get more of them killed qutuz said theres some truth in that i shouldnt wonder the zuwayzi foreign minister admitted but i think rather more of it comes from a bad conscience they know what theyve done in this war they know what all their neighbors and especially the unkerlanters might to do them once they surrender compared to that dying in battle may not look so bad hmm qutuz bowed i daresay youre right your excellency if swemmel wanted to stick his hooks in me i might think hard about taking a long walk off the roof of a tall building even so hajjaj said aye even so he sat down on the carpet behind his low desk and got to work reestablishing ties to kingdoms that had been algarves foesand to kingdoms the algarvians had occupied for yearsproduced a flood of paperwork king beornwulf of forthweg had just formally accepted the envoy king shazli had sent to him and had named a certain earl trumwine as forthwegian minister to zuwayza hajjaj had never heard of trumwine and didnt know anyone who had what would he be like the zuwayzi foreign minister shrugged thinking he cant be worse than ansovald king swemmels minister to zuwayzi set a standard for irksomeness by which all envoys from other kingdoms were judged after writing a brief letter of welcome for trumwineill see soon enough how big a hypocrite i amhajjaj tended to a couple of other matters even more trivial he was just sanding a memorandum dry when qutuz came in from his outer office and said excuse me your excellency but an officer from the army high command is here hed like to speak with you for a moment from the army high command hajjaj said in surprise since zuwayza yielded to the unkerlanters the army high command hadnt had a great deal to do hajjaj nodded send him in by all means the officer was a generation younger than hajjaj he had a colonels emblem on his hat and also painted on the bare skin of his upper arms good day your excellency he said my name is mundhir pleased to make your acquaintance colonel hajjaj said would you care for tea and wine and cakes if youre generous enough to give me the choice sir ill decline mundhir said with a slightly sardonic smile hajjaj smiled too the ritual of tea and wine and cakes could easily chew up half an hour or an hour with small talk mundhir wanted to get straight to business he continued if youd be so kind as to accompany me back to headquarters general ikhshid would be most grateful would he hajjaj murmured and colonel mundhir nodded hajjaj clicked his tongue between his teeth i know what that means ikhshids got something he doesnt want to talk about on a crystal do you know what it is mundhir shook his head no your excellency im sorry but general ikhshid didnt tell me ill come then hajjajs joints clicked and crackled as he got to his feet mundhir looked capable and reliable if ikhshid didnt want to tell such a man what was going on it had to be important colonel mundhir escorted hajjaj through the palace to army headquarters the foreign minister could have found his way without help but didnt begrudge it the sentries outside the headquarters stiffened to attention as he came up not having any military rank he nodded back at them ikhshid was a round whitehaired fellowa man of nearly hajjajs age normally goodnatured he greeted hajjaj with the rise of a snowy eyebrow before going off to study in colder more southerly lands hajjaj would have thought of it as a salty eyebrow and said good to see you your excellency we have a bit of a problem and wed like your views on it before we try to straighten it out we as in zuwayza we as in the army or have you assumed the royal we like king swemmel hajjaj asked we as in zuwayza ikhshid answered ignoring the raillery that was unlike him hajjaj decided the problem had to be more serious than hed first thought ikhshid gestured toward the doorway to his own office we can talk in there if you like hajjaj didnt say no once theyd gone inside ikhshid shut the door behind them and barred it melodramatic hajjaj remarked again ikhshid didnt rise to the bait he hadnt so much as offered tea and wine and cakes either the zuwayzi foreign minister took that as another sign something important had happened he said youd better tell me without preamble ikhshid did we had a sailboat come ashore not too far from najran but far enough so the unkerlanters at the port dont know anything about iti hope because its a sailboat mages wouldnt have spotted it when it crossed a ley line or three marquis balastro is aboard the fornicating thing and so are a dozen or so other algarvians with fancy ranks and their wivesor maybe girlfriendsand brats theyre all screaming for asylum at the top of their lungs what do we do about em oh dear hajjaj said in lieu of something stronger and more pungent do we get rid of em on the sly ikhshid asked do we hand em over to swemmels men to show what good boys we are or do we let em stay the first thing youd better do is get them away from najran hajjaj replied if the kaunians settled there find out theyve landed we wont have to worry about this set of exiles for long mm youre right about that general ikhshid agreed but you still havent answered my question what do we do with em or to em i dont know hajjaj said distractedly by the powers above i really dont if ansovald finds out theyre in the kingdom hell spit rivets and so will king swemmel from their point of view it would be hard to blame them i understand ikhshid said thats why i called you here he suddenly looked worried or should i have gone straight to the king instead ill talk things over with him hajjaj promised we wont do anything final till he approves it i should hope not ikhshid said but what do you think we ought to do i dont like handing over fugitives it goes against every clan tradition i dont like killing them either hajjaj said neither do i but i also dont like getting caught with them here ikhshid said and were liable to you know it as well as i do they dont speak our language they arent brown they are circumcised theyve got red hair and they wrap themselves in cloth all the time details details hajjaj said dryly and startled a laugh out of the army commander the zuwayzi foreign minister went on my recommendation is to take them to some inland villageharran sayand do our best to keep word of them from blowing back here to bishah if we can stash them off to one side for a while things may calm down before theyre discovered if ikhshid freighted the little word with a great weight of meaning general if you have a better idea i should be delighted to hear it hajjaj said i dont ikhshid replied at once i just wondered if you had the nerve to try and get away with that well be in a ton of trouble if the unkerlanters find out about it he wasnt joking if anything he was understating what might happen even so hajjaj answered were still a free kingdomafter a fashion let me take this to the king as i said hell have the final decision shazli seldom overruled him this once he might good luck ikhshid said thanks i fear ill need it hajjaj hoped he could talk shazli around no matter what the circumstances he had trouble with the idea of giving anyone over to the unkerlanters krasta adjusted the wig on her head as far as she was concerned the hair in the wig wasnt nearly so fine or so golden as her own the miserable thing was also cursedly hot but she wore it from the moment she got up in the morning till she went to bed it hid the shame of the shearing merkela had given her and let her go out into priekule without reminding the world shed bedded an algarvian during the occupation being able to hold her head up counted for more than comfort her sonher sandyhaired son her bastard son the proof of exactly what shed been doingstarted yowling in the room next to her bedchamber shed hired a wet nurse and a governess to look after the little brat whom shed named gainibu in the hope that the king of valmiera would hear of it and understand it as an apology of sorts as a matter of fact thus far shed hired two governesses and three wet nurses for some reason they had trouble getting along with her after a little while the racket stopped krasta didnt go in to check on the baby she supposed the wet nurse was giving him her breast but she was doing her best to pretend even to herself that shed never had him his wails didnt make that easy but shed always been good at deceiving herself she had money in her pockets she had a new driver one who didnt drink she could escape the mansion escape the baby she didnt want to acknowledge go into priekule and come back with things what they were hardly mattered while she was buying them she didnt have to think about anything else but just as she left the bedchamber and headed for the stairs the butler the new butlercame up them toward her she was offended that so many of her servants had chosen to go south with skarnu and his peasant slut of a new wife but shed never dwelt on why they might have decided to leave her service milady viscount valnu is here to see you the new butler said i certainly am valnu himself agreed from the hallway below come down here sweetheart so i can see you krasta hurried past the butler valnu seemed to be the only person in all of priekule who didnt blame her for the way shed lived during the occupation of course hed slept with a lot more algarvian officers than she had she was sure of that but hed done it in the line of duty so to speak and he didnt run the risk of proving it to the world nine months after the fact he swept her into his arms and gave her a kiss how have you been he asked tired krasta answered up in his bedroom little gainibu started to cry again krasta could hardly ignore him then however much she wanted to she jerked a thumb at the stairway down which the noise was wafting thats why ah too bad valnu said with sympathy that at least sounded sincere have you got anything to drink darling im dry as the zuwayzi desert it was early in the day but that worried krasta no more than it did valnu come along with me she purred well find something that suits youand me too something turned out to be apricot brandy valnu knocked back a shot of it so did krasta the sweet warmth in her mouth and in her belly felt good valnu poured his glass full again then raised a questioning eyebrow at her she nodded eagerly he poured for her too what shall we drink to he asked that first time we were just drinking to drinking thats good enough for me krasta said she let more brandy slide down her throat this time she gave herself a refill and a moment later valnu as well curse me if i know why i dont stay drunk all the time then i wouldnt have to think about things cheer up my dear valnu told her however bad it looks it could be worse how krasta demanded as far as she could see nothing could be worse than her being unhappy but valnu answered well you could be an algarvian for instance say somebody inside trapani the fighting there cant last much longer or so the news sheets say and the unkerlanters dont like redheads at all that no doubt was true but it was also far away krastas concerns were much more immediate she glared at him powers below eat you why couldnt you have had stronger seed she snarled then id have a proper blond baby and people wouldnt want to spit at me all the time her hand started to go to the wig but she pulled it down she didnt want to draw that to anyones notice i could ask you something like why didnt you give me more chances valnu answered dear lurcanio had a lot more than i did you werent living here krasta said and you couldnt send me off and do horrible things to me if i didnt do what you wanted she didnt mention that at the time shed enjoyed quite a few of the things lurcanio had done and had had her do that was only one more inconvenient fact to be forgotten you shouldnt complain too much my love valnu patted her hand after all you didnt have the unfortunate accident you could have now he pointed up toward the nursery you had a different sort of unfortunate accident unfortunate i should say so krasta drank her third brandy as quickly as the first two that miserable little bastard ruins everythingeverything i tell you and the servants you can get nowadays its scandalous few of the newcomers were as deferential as the ones whod been at the mansion for a long time like those in charge of gainibu a couple had quit already but their replacements seemed no better i am sorry valnu said im afraid i dont know what i can do about any of that at least youve tried to do something krasta said and when you come to visit i know youre not coming to laugh at me or to curse me i wouldnt do that valnu sounded unusually seriousmaybe it was the brandy talking you could have betrayed me to the algarvians whenever you chose except you didnt choose no of course not krasta shook her head how could i do that to someone i know socially valnu laughed sprang to his feet and bowed you are a true noblewoman milady krasta would have taken that as a pretty compliment but he went on and you show youre every bit as useless as most of the members of our class myself included whenever i get the chance to be useless anyhow im not either useless dont you dare say i am krasta snapped youre as mean to me as that horrible bitch my brother married tears stung her eyes she still cried much more easily than she had before getting pregnant i didnt say you were anything im not valnu answered every kingdom needs a few truly useless people to show the rest how to enjoy life look at the unkerlanters efficiency efficiency efficiency every bloody minute of the day and night would you want to live like that i should hope not the idea of doing anything as the unkerlanters did it was deeply repugnant to krasta well there you are valnu sounded as if everything made perfect sense he raised his glass heres to uselessness he drank so did krasta though shed bristled when he called her useless only moments before she eyed him then said i can never be sure when youre making fun of me and when youre not good valnu told her i dont want to be too obvious if i were i would lose my precious air of mystery the pose he struck looked more absurd than mysterious krasta laughed she couldnt help herself she could feel the apricot brandy too it helped build a wall between her and the unpleasant world all around she giggled and said if it were any other time id seduce you right now but she shook her head the baby had come out through there and she didnt want anything else going in for a while yet if you were really bound and determined to there are plenty of things we might try that havent got anything to do with that valnu remarked just speaking theoretically of course of course krasta echoed youd know all about those wouldnt you that such words might wound never occurred to her if they did valnu didnt show it instead he bared his teeth in a grin of sorts how many times have i told you my dearvariety is the life of spice krasta sent him an owlish stare and poured herself more brandy you came over here to have your way with me didnt you i came over to say hello valnu gave her one of his bright bony smiles and waved hello the smile got wider anything else would be a bonus you know i didnt intend to go to bed with you back ten months ago now either we didnt go to bed krasta giggled again i ought to know the rug rubbed my backside raw now i was speaking metaphorically valnu said in lofty tones how is that different from theoretically krasta asked its different thats how valnus words slurred ever so slightly the brandy was working in him too when krasta got to her feet the room swirled around her come on she told valnu as loftily as if she were ordering one of her servants about valnu didnt get up right away had krasta had a little less to drink or drunk it a little more slowly she would have realized he was thinking it over and she would have got angry as things were she just stood there swaying a little waiting for him to do as she said and he did too all he said when he rose was well why not the butler blinked when krasta and valnu went past him on the stairway he didnt know krasta very well none of the new servants did she thought that was funny too valnu proved to know some very pleasant alternatives after krasta bucked against his tongue after her breathing and her pulse slowed toward normal she ran her hands through his hair and said you didnt learn that from any algarvian officers my sweet doing anything over and over without change no matter how enjoyable grows boring in the end valnu said she wasnt in the mood to argue here lie on your side she said and slid down just before she started she made as if to push him out of bed he looked surprised for a moment then laughed no doubt remembering the carriage ride on the dark streets of priekule as she did youd better not do that now he said mockfierce what should i do then krasta asked before valnu could answer she did it he seemed at least as appreciative as she had when their positions were more or less reversed she gulped and choked a little at the end she almost asked him how she compared to some of those algarvian officers but kept quiet instead it wasnt that she lacked the brass much more that she worried he might tell her the unvarnished truth well valnu said brightly maybe i ought to come over and say hello more often if youre sure you wouldnt be bored krasta said oh not for a while anyhow he replied she glared valnu laughed and said you deserved that krasta shook her head as far as she was concerned she never deserved anything but the very best will we be ready for the demonstration fernao asked pekka after all its only a week away everything went fine the last time we tried it she answered the only difference is this time a few more people will be watching why are you so worried about it i always want everything to go as well as it can the lagoan mage said you know thats true pekka nodded if she hadnt he would have been highly affronted he went on besides the war is almost over the faster we can make all the pieces end the better for everybody im not so sure about that pekka said grimly if we could use trapani for the demonstration i wouldnt mind a bit and you know thats true fernao nodded he knew it very well but he said the unkerlanters seem to be doing a pretty fair job of taking care of trapani all by themselves theyre already in the city fighting their way toward the palace i know but i wish i had the revenge myself not at second hand pekka said you sound more like a lagoan than a kuusaman fernao remarked his people like other algarvic folk took vengeance seriously kuusamans usually didnt they claimed they were too civilized for such things but i can see how getting your husband killed would make you change your mind fernao didnt say that the less he said about leino he was convinced the better off things between pekka and him would be do i pekka said well by the powers above ive earned the right her thoughts must have been going down the same ley line as his i know he said when she brought her past out into the open he couldnt very well ignore it and that past had helped shape what she was now had it been different she would have been different too perhaps so different that he wouldnt have loved her that thought by itself was plenty to make him nervous she turned the subject at least to some degree saying uto likes you im glad fernao meant it which surprised him more than a little he went on i like him too which was also true hell be quite something when he grows up so he will unless somebody strangles him sometime between now and then pekka said id be lying if i said i hadnt been tempted a couple of times myself uto will be how should i put it a long time learning discipline thats what hell be fernao could hardly disagree but since the talk had swung to pekkas family he asked what about your sister she didnt say more than a few words to me while we were in kajaani you know why elimaki was wary of you too she wouldnt have been or not so muchfernao could have done without that little bit of honesty from pekka however characteristic of her it wasif olavin hadnt started cavorting with his secretary or clerk or whoever she is if we hadnt done anything till after leino got killed elimaki would have been easier in her mind but i think it will turn out all right in the end do you fernao wasnt so sure but pekka nodded i really do she didnt like the idea of what wed been up to but she liked you better than she thought she would she told me so when we were down there and she hasnt said anything different in her letters since and elimaki has always been one to speak her mind im not surprised not when shes your sister fernao thought he didnt say that not when he wasnt quite sure how pekka would take it what he did say was what are we going to do when the war is done i want to go back to kajaani city college pekka said if i can keep dear professor heikki out of my hair its a good place to do research she cocked her head to one side and studied him and i thought you might be interested in coming down to kajaani too oh i am he said hastilyand truthfully he didnt want her getting the wrong idea about that but he went on not what i meant not exactly weve spent so much time working on this new sorcery well be out of our kingdoms service and ahead of everybody else in the world put those together and they likely add up to a goodsized pile of silver ah now pekka nodded i see some might be nice i suppose but i think id sooner do what i want to do than do what someone else wants me to no matter how much money i might make theoretical sorcerers can use money just as much as anybody else can fernao said i know she answered the questions are how much do i need and how much do i care to change to get it by the way she spoke the answers to those questions were not very much and not very much respectively to some degree fernao felt the same waybut only to some degree he said if i can do work id enjoy anyhow i wouldnt mind being paid well for it neither would i pekka admitted if if somebody wants to push me in directions id sooner not go though thats a different story and when you start trying to turn magecraft into money that sort of thing happens a lot of the time she sent him a challenging glance or will you tell me im wrong if he tried to tell her she was wrong she would have some sharp things to tell him he could see that and he didnt think she was wrong it was a question of of degree he thought we would have to be carefulno doubt about that he said but sorcery and business do mix or they can otherwise the world wouldnt have changed the way it has the past hundred and fifty years a lot of the people who were in the right place at the right time were mages and if you want to know what i think when theres a choice between having money and not having it having it is better with everything else equal aye pekka agreed but things arent always equal not when it comes to money and you dont always have money sometimes money ends up having you i dont want that to happen to me fernao knew more than a few people who would do anything for money he didnt care to go down that ley line either he said you of all people wouldnt have to worry i dont think for which i thank you pekka said seriously some of the things weve done here shouldnt be turned into charms anyone could buy if you want to know what i think which ones do you have in mind fernao asked for starters the ones that could let old people borrow years from their young descendantsor maybe once the techniques are improved from anybody young pekka answered can you imagine the chaos can you imagine the crimes fernao hadnt tried to imagine such things now he did and cringed that could be very bad he said i cant argue with you youve got a twistier mind than i do to come up with such an idea i didnt pekka said ilmarinen did after one of our early experiments that was before you joined us he saw just how things might work why am i not surprised fernao said but nobodys talked much about that kind of possibility since ive been here i dont think anybody wants to talk about it pekka said the more people who know about it the more people who think about it the likelier it is to happen and to happen soon soon fernao tasted the word and found he didnt care for its flavor we arent ready to do anything like that no and we wont be not for years and yearsif we ever are pekka said but whether were ready for it and whether it happens are two different questions dont you see and thats probably the biggest reason why im not very interested in getting rich quick fernaos laugh was at least half rueful he said well one thing you make it easier for me to support you in the style to which youve been accustomed you dont need to worry about supporting menot with silver anyhow pekka said ive always been able to do that its the other things we need to worry about getting along with each other bringing up uto the best we can seeing about a child or two of our own too fernao added aye and that too pekka agreed fernao fought down bemusement for his whole life his interest in children had been theoretical at best at worst hed had one lady friend whod thought he made her pregnant he hadnt an illness had thrown her monthly courses out of kilter what hed felt then was alarm bordering on panic now now he smiled as pekka went on ive spent some time wondering what our children would look like havent you now that you mention it aye fernao answered adding if we have a little girl i hope shes lucky enough to look like you that flustered pekka hed seen that a lot of his compliments did partly he supposed it was because she was so stubbornly independent the rest came from a fundamental difference between his folk and hers among lagoans as with algarvians flowery compliments were part of the small change of conversation nobody took them too seriously kuusamans were more literalminded they rarely said things unless they meant themand they assumed everyone else behaved the same way his pleasantries gained a weight a force here that they wouldnt have had back in setubal youre sweet pekka said at last and fernao was confident she meant it he was also very glad she meant it what i am he said is happy i love you you know i do know that she agreed i love you too and she sighed and let it rest there when fernao didnt ask her to go on she looked relieved he didnt ask her because he already had a good notion of what she wasnt saying something like and now its all right with leino still living shed been torn fernao knew that he could hardly help knowing it if leino had lived she would have chosen him he thought he was familiar he was a kuusaman and he was the father of her son and that counted for a lot with her pekka looked at him and turned his thoughts away from such reflections which was just as well otherwise he would have come back to remembering that he owed his happiness to another mans death and to the despised algarvians he hated himself whenever such ideas scurried over the ley lines of his mind but he could hardly drive them away once for all they held too much truth and so kept coming back well do the best we can she said i dont know what else we can do if we work hard it should be good enough i hope so fernao said i think so too he knew little more about getting along with one special person for years and years than he did about raising a child but pekka knew both those things well as long as ive got a good teacher fernao thought i can learn anything twelve all the regular news sheets in trapani were dead but the algarvians still turned out something they called the armored wolf printed on small leaves of cheap soursmelling paper it kept right on screaming shrill defiance at all of king mezentios enemies and declaring that victory lay just around the corner crouched behind a barricade only a couple of hundred yards in front of the royal palace with unkerlanter eggs bursting all around him sidroc was certain the only thing lying around the next corner was a swarm of unkerlanter footsoldiers and behemoths he folded his copy of the armored wolf and stuffed it into his belt pouch ceorl asked why are you wasting time with that horrible rag seeing it once is bad enough nobodyd want to look at it twice im not going to look at it twice sidroc said im almost out of arsewipes though and itll do well enough for that ah all right ceorls big head bobbed up and down youre not as dumb as i thought you were when you came into the brigade if you were youdve been dead a long time ago sidroc shrugged and spat dumb doesnt matteryoure still breathing for instance ceorls fingers twisted in an obscene gesture laughing sidroc gave it back he went on youre still here and im still here and sergeant werferth who made a better soldier than both of us put together what happened to him he stopped a beam in yanina thats what bad futtering luck nothing else to it before ceorl could answer smoke on the breeze set him coughing whole great stretches of trapani burned with no one doing much to try to put out the fires the algarvians couldnt and the unkerlanters didnt care slowly the smoke cleared ceorls face was as black with soot as his beard sidroc doubted his own was any cleaner ceorl said not fornicating likely were going to end up any different no sidroc agreed this stretch around the palace is about whats left maybe a few other little patches but they dont do anybody any good everything else swemmels buggers have got it and they want mezentio ceorl said they want that whoreson bad being a corporal sidroc couldshouldhave reproved him instead he nodded the unkerlanters did want mezentio their dragons dropped leaflets promising not just safety but enormous rewards for any algarvians who gave them the king sidroc supposed the same applied to the men of plegmunds brigade he didnt care it wasnt that he didnt trust the unkerlanters though he didnt but after spending the past two and a half years battling them he didnt want to have anything to do with them except over the business end of a stick a couple of men in rockgray tunics darted out from a doorway and dashed toward rubble in front of the barricade using the business end of his stick sidroc blazed one of them the other made it and started blazing back sidroc scuttled along the barricade to find a new place from which to blaze at the foe stay anywhere very long and you asked for a snipers beam through the head behind him an algarvian declared i will deal with these cursed savages that was interesting enough to make sidroc turn his head who in blazes are you he asked the redhead standing therestanding there sidroc noted with no regard whatsoever for his own safety considering what was going on all aroundconsidering that trapani was not to put too fine a point on it fallingthat took even algarvian arrogance a bit far i am major almonte the fellow replied with his left hand he brushed the mages badge he wore on his left breast i have the power to hurl the unkerlanters back in dismay oh you do do you sidroc grunted almonte nodded he believed what he was saying sidroc didnt not for a minute if youre such hot stuff pal what are swemmels buggers doing within blaze of the royal palace here its not my fault almonte said my superiors would not listen to me would not let me show the full reach of my genius from not far away ceorl said another fornicating crackpot sidroc laughed almonte might be an algarvian and an officer by courtesy but what difference did that make here and now the redhead glared at both forthwegians you are nothing but mercenaries he said you have no business criticizing me talk is cheap pal sidroc said futter yourself almonte said crisply by the powers above i will show youi will show the worldwhat i can do he scrambled over the barricade and faced the unkerlanters without the least shred of cover when they didnt blaze almonte down in the first instant sidroc knew he had somemore than a littlepower beams flew toward him but none bit it was as if they were beneath the redheads notice he raised both hands above his head and began a spell it was sidroc noted not in algarvian but in classical kaunian hed learned enough in school to recognize the language he snickered hearing it now of all times and in the heart of trapani of all places was pretty funny but then the laughter curdled in his mouth the hair on his arms and at the back of his neck tried to prickle up in fear almontes magecraft seemed to draw darkness from beneath the flagstones on which he stood and cast it at the unkerlanters sidroc briefly heard them cry out in alarm before that darknessdid he really see it or sense it with something older and even more primitive than sightwashed over them then they fell silent sidroc was somehow certain none of them would ever cry out again major almonte did in pride and triumph sidroc leaned over and threw up ceorl looked green too id sooner lose than use a magic like that he muttered sidroc nodded almonte shook his fist at the sudden silence in front of the palace die swine he cried if the stinking dragonfliers had let me take my spells aloft id have done more and worse to you but even now he resumed the incantation that cold dark deadly silence spread farther unkerlanter lives went out liked snuffed candle flames swemmels men might not have known exactly what was happening to them but they knew something was and they knew whence the trouble came they hurled eggs at almonte from tossers beyond the reach of his sorcery sidroc threw himself flat eggs bursting all around almonte burst too close to him the algarvian mage had had a spell for turning aside beams when sidroc lifted his head again he discovered almonte had owned no such warding against bursts of sorcerous energy and the metal from egg shells they flung about the mage was down and screaming and bleeding he looked more like a piece of butchery than a man sidroc could have blazed him to put him out of his misery what with the sort of magic almonte had been using he was more than glad to let him suffer theyll come after us as soon as they realize he cant do anything to them anymore he warned ceorl i know the ruffian said come the unkerlanters did behind a fresh barrage of eggs urra they shouted more in relief sidroc thought than anything else urra swemmel urra despite good blazing from the barricades and from the palace itself they gained lodgments here and there and began blazing down the algarvians and the men from plegmunds brigade and the phalanx of valmiera who still stood against them fall back sidroc yelled well be cut off if we dont hed done enough in this fighthed done enough in his whole term of service in plegmunds brigadethat no one could accuse him of cowardice he ran back toward the royal palace his menthose still on their feetwith him as he ran he hoped the redheads inside wouldnt take the soldiers of plegmunds brigade for unkerlanters and blaze them down that would have been the ultimate indignity in the end though how much did it matter he didnt think he would last very long any which way he made it into the palace unblazed and took up a new position at a window that had offered a magnificent view but was really too long too open to give good cover to his right knelt ceorl and a blond valmieran from the phalanx to his left a redhead from the popular assault who couldnt have been above fifteen and an older algarvian a bald fellow with a beaky nose the old man could handle a stick theres another one down he said stretching an unkerlanter lifeless in front of the palace but it wont last it cant last powers below eat them all sidroc shuddered major almonte he thought had dealt much too intimately with the powers below well hold on a while longer he said and then took another look at the man crouching there beside him his voice rose to a startled squeak your uh majesty king mezentio nodded briskly i will ask the same favor of you corporal that ive asked of a good many men already when you see this place falling have the courtesy to blaze me down i do not care to fall into swemmels hands alive uh aye sir sidroc nodded he wouldnt have wanted the king of unkerlant to get his hands on him either meanwhile mezentio blazed again he nodded but then grimaced i should have won algarve should have won this kingdom proved itself weak it doesnt deserve to live and who led it to where it is sidroc thought but he didnt see how he could say such a thing to the king of algarve even as he cast about for ways that wouldnt sound too blunt the moment passed a great racket of bursting eggs and crumpling masonry and shouting men arose from the rear of the palace a redhead dashed up to mezentio crying your majesty your majesty the whoresons are inside we have some barricades in the corridors but powers above only know how long theyll hold crashes and more screams said one of them had just gone down all over mezentio said his voice soft and sad we came so close but its all over we werent strong enough we all deserve to go into the fire he bowed to sidroc will you do the honors as sidroc numbly nodded the king spoke to the messenger know that this man slays me at my request let him be rewarded for it and in no way punished do you understand aye your majesty tears ran down the redheads face mezentio bowed to sidroc again do what needs doing try to blaze true to make it as quick as you can he closed his eyes and waited sidroc did it hed done it for wounded comrades more than once before seeing king mezentio slump over dead raised no special horror in him it was as if he had nothing at all left inside ceorl set a hand on his shoulder powers above the ruffian whispered fresh shouts came from the back of the palace these much closer sidroc got to his feet come on he said savagely theres still some fighting left as he and the men he led ran forward panicstricken algarvians ran back toward them cowards he shouted and ran on with nothing left inside him what did he have to lose a beam took him in the side as he came round a corner he went down but kept blazing another beam bit this one deep he tasted blood in his mouth as his stick slipped from fingers that would not hold it he was still moving a little when an unkerlanter lieutenant paused saw he wasnt quite dead and put a beam through his temple before charging on though he got better food and better lodging in his new quarters outside the main captives camp on obuda sergeant istvan missed the company of his fellow gyongyosians when he grumbled about that to lammi the kuusaman forensic mage raised a thin black eyebrow but they beat you she said and they would do it again if they had the chance istvans broad shoulders went up and down in a shrug i know but theyre my own folk even so you kuusamanshe shrugged againi dont think the stars shine on you one of his own people would have been furious at such an insult lammi only shrugged in her turn which proved how foreign and alien she was she knew gyongyosian customs well but they didnt bind her that made her more alarming to him not less she said i am willing to take my chances on it few if any gyongyosians would have been so willing lammi didnt talk about the scar on istvans left hand or about what it meant had his fellow captives known what it meant they would have done worse to him than they would have for mere suspected treason what could make treason mere goateating could and istvan knew it all too well his captors let him see kun now and then each of them was wary with the other for each knew the other had however unwillingly confessed to the abomination theyd both committed kun seemed more content away from his countrymen than istvan did theyre a pack of fools most of them he said loftily oh and youre not istvan said not that kind anyhow the former mages apprentice replied i got sick of men from mountain valleys long before those louts set on me im a man from a mountain valley istvan reminded him his big hands balling into fists proves my point wouldnt you say kun grinned at istvans flabbergasted expression and you my dear fellow you put up with me far better than most istvan thought about that for a little while he said weve been through too much together if the two of us dont put up with each other no one ever will kun grimaced and if that isnt a judgment on both of us stars go dark if i know what would be a couple of days after that lammi summoned both of them that surprised istvan theyd never been questioned together nor were they this time the kuusaman mage spoke briskly how would the two of you like to be free to return to your own land dont play with us istvan said roughly that isnt going to happen and you know it were here till the war is over and who knows for how long after that but lammi shook her head not necessarily and i ask no treason of you by the stars i do not all i ask is that you go on board ship go back to the waters off becsehely watch a certain something and then when you are released tell your own superiors exactly what you saw she held up a hand to forestall questions you would not be the only men doing thisfar from it why us kun asked because you are in a certain amount of difficulty here lammi answered and because you have shown more than a certain amount of wit we feel confident you would tell those set above you the truth why shouldnt we just keep quiet istvan asked and whats off becsehely they both knew the miserable little island east of obuda better than they wanted to theyd been captured there lammi said you will see what is off and on becsehely and you will i think find good reason for telling the truth as you see it of course if you would rather stay here on obuda ill go istvan said kun hesitated but only briefly lammi smiled i thought that might prove persuasive pack whatever gear you have the leyline cruiser will be here tomorrow at first light istvan had a duffel bag ready in good time no captive had much in the way of belongings kuns duffel was heavier but kun cared more about books than istvan ever had a carriage took both of them to the harbor which had been repaired since captain frigyes bloodthirsty magic did its work the cruiser was long and sleek and deadly somehow more dangerouslooking than a gyongyosian ship when they boarded the vessel a kuusaman military clerk checked their names off a list a fellow in greenish kuusaman naval uniform escorted them to a cabin you two stay here the kuusaman said in gyongyosian like most of his countrymen who spoke the language he used the plural rather than the dual the cabin was big enough to boast two cots side by side istvan and kun wouldnt even have to quarrel over who got the top bunk istvan said if this is what the slanteyes do for captives they must live mighty soft themselves they do kun said theyre richer than we are theyve had modern magecraft longer than we have and they do more with it than we do but we are the warrior race kun said with pride in his countrymen still diminished only a little from what hed felt when summoned into ekrekek arpads service kun sighed i suppose id waste my time asking you how much good thats done us or whos winning the war and so i wont by not asking in that particular way of course he put the question all the more effectively istvan chewed on it for some little while he liked the flavors of none of the answers he found to keep from showing how little he liked them he peered out the porthole to his surprise obuda was already receding in the distance were moving he exclaimed well what if we are kun seemed determined to stay contrary stars above this is a leyline ship did you expect to hear sails flutter and the wind howl in the rigging use your head before you use your mouth oh go bugger a goat istvan said coming from a valley far back in the mountains he knew little about ships leyline or otherwise the only times hed been aboard them were on journeys across the bothnian ocean during the war hed never been in a twoman cabin then but down in the hold with a lot of other soldiers most of whom were just as ignorant of the sea and its ways as he was he did remember the meal gong either the kuusamans had the same signal or theyd got a gong so they could use something with which their gyongyosian passengers were familiar armed kuusamans directed istvan and kun and the other gyongyosians who emerged from cabins along the corridor to the iron chamber where they would eat a large sign on the wall declared we do not serve goat aboard this ship you may eat freely with no fear of pollution istvan hoped the slanteyes were telling the truth if they werent the scar on his hand throbbed hed already learned more about ritual pollution and the way it ate at a man than hed ever wanted to know perhaps three dozen gyongyosians queued up to take trays and utensils and bowls of the stew a couple of boredlooking kuusaman cooks served up the food was better than hed got in the captives camp but not so good as the guards rations hed eaten since being extracted from among the rest of the captured gyongyosians the cooks gave each man one mug of ale and as much tea as he wanted most of the other captives aboard the leyline cruiser were officers istvan saw one man in a brigadiers uniform a couple of colonels and a lot of majors and captains one of those captains turned to him and asked well sergeant why did they pick you for this charade i have no real idea sir istvan answered cautiously maybe because i fought on becsehely with a laugh the officer said well that makes some sense i dont know why they chose me ill tell you that my guess is the slanteyes drew my name out of a hat or a pot or whatever they use for such things corporal kun asked sir do you have any idea what theyre going to show us when we get there not the slightest clue the captain shook his head i speak some kuusaman and ive asked but the slanteyes wont say they havent talked out of turn where i could hear em either worse luck stars above be dark for them forever theyre keeping their mouths shut tight the leyline cruiser stopped at another island east of obuda and picked up four men from a captives camp there istvan wondered just how many gyongyosian captives the kuusamans held too many was the first answer that occurred to him when the cruiser stopped a couple of miles off the beaches of becsehely the kuusamans summoned all their gyongyosian passengers to the deck the island looked as flat and unlovely as istvan remembered it it also looked extraordinarily battered as if it had been fought over only the other day not some months before a kuusaman officer spoke in istvans language watch what we do here when we give you back to your own people tell the truth about it back on obuda lammi had said almost exactly the same thing by the looks on the faces of the men who hadnt come from obuda theyd heard the speech before too kun raised an eyebrow and murmured the same old song but then the kuusaman added a new verse remember this could be gyorvar or any other place we choose as if his words were a cue a lash of fire fell on becsehely from a clear blue sky it wasnt lightning it was flame as if from a dragon a mile long but there was no dragon nothing at all in the sky over becsehely but air the lash fell again and again and again even across a broad stretch of sea it was too brilliant to look at directly istvan had to squint and hold a hand up to his face to protect his eyes even across that stretch of sea he could feel the heat too and where the flame slid off the battered land and into the bothnian ocean great clouds of steam rose up stars preserve us muttered the captain with whom hed spoken at supper that could be gyorvar despite the heat coming from the tormented island a chill seized istvan and wouldnt let him go as if for variety the flames eased and bursts of sorcerous energy as if from great eggs pounded becsehely istvan marveled that the island didnt sink beneath the sea at last as abruptly as it had begun the magecraft ended shimmering waves of heat still rose from becsehely we will set you free now the gyongyosianspeaking officer said tell your people the truth tell them what could happen to them if they go on with the war tell them it has gone on too long it will end soon the leyline cruiser glided east away from becsehely and toward the few islands in the bothnian ocean gyongyos still held down in the bowels of the ship a crystallomancer would istvan supposed try to arrange a truce to hand over the captives i might go back to kunhegyes to my own valley he thought then he looked down at the scar on his hand as long as i bear this do i want to go home at all marshal rathar had always liked to have his headquarters as far forward as he could with his army battering its way into the very heart of trapani hed set up shop in a large house in the northern suburbs of the city just out of reach of the last few algarvian eggtossers he and general vatran pored over a map of the city looted from a book dealers stabbing pins with rockgray heads into one landmark after another they cant hold on much longer vatran said theyve already held out longer than they had any business doing rathar said he knew how many of his brigades the redheads had bled white if they had to do much more fighting after this they would have a hard time of it but this wasthis had to bethe end no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than a crystallomancer rushed into the dining hall that was doing duty as a map room marshal rathar he shouted marshal rathar aye that is my name rathar agreed mildly vatran snorted but the crystallomancer was too full of himself too full of his news to pay any attention to a feeble joke marshal rathar sir an algarvian generals come out from what the redheads hold of the palace sir and he wants to yield up the soldiers the redheads still have fighting he leaped in the air with glee oh by the powers above general vatran whispered back in the village where hed grown up rathar had thought no moment in his life could surpass lying down with a womanactually shed been a girl a couple of summers younger than hefor the first time now all these years later he discovered hed been wrong it may be over he murmured and that sounded sweeter than i love you had back then aye sir the crystallomancer said and then shall i have the redhead brought here sir and hes asking for a truce while you dicker shall i say we grant him that fussing over details spoiled some of the glory but it needed doing aye have him brought here rathar replied and aye he can have a truce till he returns to his own lines the marshals right hand folded into a fist that shouldnt take long he hasnt got much to bargain with send out the necessary orders saluting the crystallomancer hurried away general vatran straightened up over the map table he too saluted congratulations sir thank you rathar felt as if hed gulped a bottle of spirits half numb half exalted over the next quarter of an hour he listened to the eggtossers falling silent one battery at a time quiet seemed eerie unnatural he hadnt heard much of it not these past four years somewhere not far away a cuckoo began to sing maybe it had been singing before but he hadnt been able to hear it then there was a small commotion outside his headquarters when the algarvian general got there rathars sentries tried to remove the redheads sword before allowing him into the marshals presence the officer proved to speak good unkerknter and hesitated not at all about making his view clear are you uncivilized uncultured you do not take the weapon of a brave foe who is still negotiating his armys surrender let him keep the blade for now rathar called the sentries brought the algarvian into the map room the fellow wore a grimy wrinkled uniform and looked as if he hadnt slept for a couple of days he came to attention and gave rathar a salute returning it rathar named himself and introduced general vatran i am general oldrade the algarvian replied i have the honor to command my kingdoms forces in and around trapani i must tell you marshal that we can no longer offer resistance against your armies he looked about to burst into tears has king mezentio sent you forth with this word rathar asked you must understand general that my sovereign will require mezentios personal surrender king swemmel has left me no discretion whatsoever in this matter oldrade shrugged i cannot give you what i do not have sir after defending the royal palace to his last breath his majesty perished yesterday i have seen the kings body with my own eyes and know this to be true lucky bastard vatran muttered oldrade didnt react so perhaps vatran had been quiet enough to keep him from hearing rathar was inclined to agree with his general compared to what swemmel had wanted to do to mezentio dying in battle was the quick easy way out you understand general that we shall have to be fully satisfied on this point swemmel wasnt going to be fully satisfied no matter what hed wanted his sport with his vengeance on mezentio you may examine the kings body oldrade said my understanding is that mainardo having abdicated as king of jelgava now succeeds his older brother as king of algarve general oldrade answered king mainardo is now arranging the surrender of algarvian forces in the northeast to the kuusaman army swemmel wont get his hands on mainardo was what that meant the kuusamans were unlikely to boil the new king of algarve alive or give him any of the other interesting and lingering ends he might deserve too bad rathar thought but he didnt see what he or unkerlant could do about it maybe the jelgavans will take care of it for us they have almost as many reasons to hate mainardo as we dowe didto hate mezentio what terms are you prepared to give us marshal oldrade asked assuming that what you say about mezentio is true will will grant your soldiers lives rathar said we offer no more than that oldrade drew himself up the picture of affronted dignity this is meanspirited in the extreme he said indignantly too bad rathar said if you like i will send you back to your lines and we can take up the fight again see how many of your men come away with their lives then you are a hard cruel man oldrade said and your king say what you like about me rathar broke in you insult king swemmel at your peril now thendo you accept these terms or not for the sake of my men i must accept them tears ran down oldrades face rage humiliation sorrow rathar couldnt say all he knew was no unkerlanter would have thus bared himself before a foe vatran turned away embarrassed to look at the algarvian i will have a secretary write out the terms in unkerlanter and algarvian rathar said oldrade still weeping nodded the marshal of unkerlant went on i will also send out men with flags of truce and mages to magnify voices letting everyone know the fighting here is over when you pass back into your own lines you do the same oldrade nodded again rathar guessed the battle wouldnt end at once but would sputter out over several days people would die for no reason whatever he shrugged hoping he was wrong but knowing he wouldnt be able to stop such things you have given us harsh terms oldrade said i hope that as tempers cool you will be more generous in your triumph the algarvian general was three or four inches taller than rathar the marshal had to tilt his head back to look down his nose at oldrade and he did what sort of terms would you have offered if you had taken cottbus he asked general oldrade flushed and did not answer he didnt have to they both knew the truth there vatran said we ought to send a mage to check mezentios body make sure its not somebody else wearing a sorcerous disguise a good point rathar said i will have the secretary put that in the surrender document you are the conquerors oldrade didnt try to hide his bitterness you may do as you please thats right rathar said and called his secretary he told the young lieutenant what he wanted the secretary was fluent in both his own language and algarvian which rathar also spoke and read he skimmed through both texts then passed them to oldrade after reading them the redhead nodded he pulled a pen from a tunic pocket rathar pushed a bottle of ink toward him the pen scratched across both instruments of surrender oldrade said would you please have your mages make copies for me to take back to what is left of my command of course general in small matters rathar could afford courtesy with the fall of trapani this war is as near over as makes no difference may we never fight another one may it be so oldrade agreed with a sigh he unbuckled his sword and held it out to rathar now it is yours sir the negotiations being complete i accept it in the name of my king rathar said go now and make the surrender known to your men your escort will take you back through the lines general oldrade bowed spun on his heel and left the headquarters congratulations lord marshal vatran said again weve done it rathar returned the generals salute so we have he said and now to let his majesty know weve done it he went off to the crystallomancers room arranging an etheric connection back to cottbus didnt take long he hadnt thought it would the crystallomancers had to have been waiting for this moment as soon as king swemmels image appeared in the crystal before the marshal he said your majesty the algarvians in trapani have yielded the surrender to spare their lives but nothing more the enemys capital is yours and what of the enemys king swemmel demanded we want mezentio he is said to have died in the fighting your majesty rathar answered i am sending a sorcerer to make sure the corpse is his king swemmel snorted contemptuously mark our wordshe turned coward at the end he dared not face what we would have done to him for all that he did to our kingdom rathar thought his sovereign likely to be right in mezentios place he wouldnt have cared to endure swemmels wrath either the king went on who now claims the throne of algarve if mezentio is truly dead his brother mainardo your majesty rathar said he is said to have yielded himself up to the kuusamans in the northeast they will not kill him as he deserves no swemmel sounded worried almost frightened his eyes flicked back and forth back and forth as if watching demons only he could see no they will leave him alive leave him on what they call the throne of algarve the stinking whoresons they will use him for a cats paw a stalking horse against us they want algarve beaten as much as we do your majesty rathar said algarve is beaten the king said now they want us crushed as well they think they can loose their sorceries in the middle of the bothnian ocean without our knowing it but they are wrongwrong we tell you swemmels voice rose to something close to a scream rathar knew nothing about sorceries in the middle of the bothnian ocean he wondered if swemmel did or if the king were only imagining them weve won here he said king swemmel nodded but with none of the joy rathar had hoped hed show and rathars own joy in turn died before being fully born he wondered if he would ever find a way to forgive swemmel for that gyorvar the capital of gyongyos lay where four rivers came together near the coast to form a single stream a ley line went up that stream from the sea to gyorvar so the cruiser csikos after skirting the balaton islands could take the men it had received from its kuusaman counterpart straight to the city home kun murmured as the tall buildings came into sight it wasnt home to istvan so many houses and shops and enormous structures whose use he didnt know all jammed together were as alien to him as the forests of western unkerlant or the low flat expanse of becsehelybecsehely as it had been when hed served there not the scarred and burnt and ruined place the island had become my own people istvan said as close as he could come to agreeing with the former mages apprentice behind the lenses of his spectacles kuns eyes gleamed youre going to see more of your own people than you want to for a while unless i miss my guess huh istvan said i never would have imagined as soon as the csikos tied up at a quay swarms of men in clean uniforms with the badges of eyes and ears of the ekrekek swarmed aboard istvan sergeant one of them shouted reading from a list here istvan waved his hand you come with me the fellow said and checked off his name petofi captain here the officer waved as istvan had he was tall and gaunt with a nasty scar on his left cheek that stopped just short of his eye good you two are mine the eye and ear of the ekrekek checked off petofis name too come along with me both of you weve got carriages waiting to take you to interrogation headquarters istvan wasnt sure he liked the sound of that in fact he was sure he didnt like the sound of it but he was only a sergeant what could he do but obey captain petofi had some ideas on that score one moment he said dryly a long time ago i learned never to go anywhere with a stranger i am not a stranger the eye and ear tapped his badge to show what he meant captain petofi just stood where he was with a grimace ekrekek arpads man said you may call me balazs if it makes you happy after what we have seen it will take a good deal more than that to make us happy balazs petofi said is it not so sergeant uh aye sir it is istvan stammered a little surprised the scarred officer had bothered speaking to him well part of my job is finding out about all that balazs said easily now that you know who i am you come along with me and well see what you think you know captain petofi bristled anew at that istvan didnt rise to it he was watching another eye and ear leading kun away now he was alone all the comrades with whom hed gone through so much stripped away he was back among his countrymen true but how could the smooth slick smug balazs or the dour petofi understand what had happened to him these past six years petofi might some hed seen war and hed been a kuusaman captive too but he was an officer and no doubt a nobleman and thus a breed apart from a man whod come out of a village in a mountain valley come along come along balazs repeated it seemed to be his favorite phrase istvan and petofi followed him down the gangplank and over to one from among the swarm of carriages waiting at the base of the pier the eye and ear held the door open for the two returning captives when he shut it it clicked as if locking there were no handles on the inside and the windows were too small to crawl through balazs got up with the driver the carriage began to move petofis face twisted into what istvan belatedly recognized as a wry smile the officers scar made his expressions hard to read here we are captives again petofi said the fools think they will sit on what we know as a duck sits on an egg and the egg will never hatchor burst a billy goats cock up their arses couldnt make them pay heed to what needs doing aye sir istvan answered but hed only half heard the captain the carriages windows might be small but they let him see more of gyorvar than he ever had before individual houses looked familiar gray stone buildings mostly of two stories all vertical lines with steep slate roofs to help keep snow from sticking but hed never seen so manynever seen a tenth so manyall together and there were so many buildings that though done in the same style dwarfed those houses how many households could inhabit a building eight stories high and half a block wide how did they keep from feuding with one another from things kun had said he knew clan ties were looser here in the city than they were back in his valley but he had no feel for what that meant he also couldnt imagine why gyorvar needed so many shops and so many different kinds of shops they sold more things than readily came to mind captain petofis chuckle brought him back to himself your first time in gyorvar sergeant the officer asked ive been through before sir istvan answered but this is the first chance ive ever had to look around a little its not like my home valley come from up in the mountains do you petofi said and istvan nodded petofi smiled his twisted smile i was just a little boy when my father moved the family hereekrekek arpads father had summoned him to the city id lived in the mountains myself till then its a different world sure as sure aye sir it certainly is istvan agreed after an hour or so though they came to a part of the world that looked thoroughly familiar a barracks was a barracks here or on obuda a barracks was a barracks in fact whether gyongyosians or accursed foreigners like kuusamans ran it so istvan had discovered at any rate the carriage stopped balazs jumped down and opened the door that couldnt be opened from the inside come with me the eye and ear said again that hall right there and well find out what you know istvan felt a certain amount of relief on discovering the hall didnt contain a torture chamber interrogation among gyongyosians could be a serious business indeed balazs even gave petofi and him food and ale coriander and pepper and caraway in the sausage reminded istvan he was back in his own kingdom though the pork wasnt nearly so rich with fat as it would have been back in kunhegyes now balazs said once the two returned captives had refreshed themselves tell me what the starsdenying slanteyes claim to have shown you fire and destruction sent from afar istvan answered even so captain petofi agreed sorcery we cannot hope to match they chose a worthless island and made it more worthless still but they can do the same to gyorvar and i see no way we could stop them my spirit aches to say it but i do not see how we can hope to win the war against them they told you they would visit this horror on our starsbeloved capital did they balazs inquired they did petofi said but they hardly needed to a blind man can see that if they did it to becsehely out in the middle of the bothnian ocean they can do it wherever they choose balazs smile was far smoother than that of the wounded captain how do you know this he asked again did they tell you did they perhaps make a point of telling you how else could it have been istvan said there was just the island and us watching what happened to it he shuddered at the memory of the fire and of the clouds of steam rising from the tormented sea they could have had mages in the bowels of the very ship you rode casting these fearsome spells the eye and ear said or for that matter what they said was destruction could have been nothing but illusion either of those is easier to believe than that they really have these powers they claim he doesnt believe because he doesnt want to believe and because he didnt see with his own eyes istvan thought he said sir anybody whos fought the slanteyesor whos been in one of their captives campsknows theyre stronger mages than we are by the stars they really did this thing so speaks a sergeant from back in the ilszung mountains balazs said do you claim to know everything of what is possible and what is not when it comes to sorcery no sir istvan answered all i claim is i know what happened right in front of my own eyes if you dont believe meif none of you people believe the captives the kuusamans set freeour land will be sorry on account of it you should know sergeant balazs said his voice growing cold that the laws against treasonous talk and defeatism have been tightened up lately as they should have been you would be wise to have a care in what you say captain petofi spoke up and you wretch you would be wise to listen to the underofficer he spoke with a warriors courage telling nothing but the truth and you mock him and scorn him and answer him with threats by the stars with goatheads like you set over us its no wonder were losing the war like most gyongyosian men balazs let his shaggy tawny beard grow high on his cheeks it didnt grow high enough to hide his flush of anger though you have no business talking to me that way captain i tell you what ekrekek arpad has told the land we shall win this fight against the starsdetested savages of kuusamo if the ekrekek of gyongyos says a thing is so how can a couple of ragged captives say otherwise istvan gulped if arpad said something was so then it was bound to be so everything hed ever learned proclaimed the truth of that the stars spoke to arpad and arpad spoke to gyongyos so it had ever been so it would ever be but petofi said if ekrekek arpad had been on that kuusaman cruiser he would have known the truth the same as we did and if were winning the war how did the slanteyes ravage an island that used to belong to us i give you one last warning captain the ekrekeks eye and ear said we have places where we send defeatists to keep them out of the way so their cowardice cant infect the true warriors of gyongyos petofi bowed by all means send me to one of those places the company and the wit are bound to be better there than here youll get your wish balazs promised he rounded on istvan what about you sergeant i trust you have better sense that could only mean say what i want you to say and things will go easy for you istvan gulped again i just got out of a captives camp he thought with something not far from despair petofi eyed him without saying a word sell yourself wretch his eyes seemed to say sighing istvan said how can you ask me to lie when the stars looking down on me know i tell the truth another fool eh balazs scribbled a note on a leaf of paper in front of him well i already told youwe have places for fools ilmarinen was not a hunter he had no qualms about eating game or meat he just saw no sport in killing beasts men were supposed to be smarter than animals so where was the contest the way men had behaved during the derlavaian war did make him wonder about his assumption but hed still never heard of a deer or a wolf picking up a stick and blazing back at a hunter still and all though one hunting phrase hed heard stuck in his mind in at the death with trapani fallen he wanted to be in at the death of algarve if that meant leaving torgavi he wasnt altogether sorry to go he hadnt had much fun there anyhow not since the unkerlanters figured out he was a mage and ordered him to stay on his own kingdoms side of the albi he went instead to scansano where mainardo once king of jelgava and now king of algarve headed what passed for his kingdoms government these days kuusaman and lagoan soldiersand a few jelgavanspatrolled the streets of scansano these days mainardo had ordered the algarvian soldiers fighting in the northeast of his kingdom to lay down their sticks even before his brother king mezentio died in the fall of trapani all that was left now was for mainardo to order all the algarvians still fighting to do the same mainardo reigned not from a palace not even from the local counts mansion but from a hostel as if to underscore how temporary his power was likely to prove ilmarinen managed to arrange a room in the very same hostel for himself how did you do that a kuusaman newssheet writer asked him at a tavern across the street they told me they were full up it wasnt hard the mage answered i bribed them that really worked the writers narrow eyes widened i know they say algarvians are like that but i didnt believe it believe it ilmarinen said its true he laughed at the look on the newssheet writers face kuusamans were straightforward in their dealings with one another when they said aye or nay they commonly meant it offer one of ilmarinens countrymen a little money on the side to change his mind about something and he was much more likely to shout for a constable algarvians werent like that they used bribes the same way mechanics used grease will the surrender come today the writer asked thats what everybody is saying anyhow ill tell you how youll know ilmarinen answered the writer leaned toward him he said when theres a leyline caravan from out of the west then youll know its really over out of the west now the young newssheet writer looked confused ilmarinen wondered how the fellow was allowed to run around without a nursemaid as gently as he could he spelled things out mainardo has to surrender to the unkerlanters too you know oh aye the writer thought do you suppose theyll send marshal whatshisname to the ceremony marshal rathar ilmarinen said holding on to his patience with both hands the newssheet scribbler gave him a bright nod the name meant hardly more to him than that of some halfforgotten kaunian emperor unkerlant might have beenmuch of unkerlant wason the other side of the world as far as most kuusamans were concerned he does have business here ilmarinen pointed out i suppose so the writer sounded magnanimous in agreeing to that much with further magnanimity he said they did do some of the fighting too some ilmarinen choked on his wine he had a notion of what swemmels kingdom had paid first to halt the algarvians short of cottbus and then to drive them backa small notion a foreigners notion a notion he was sure was ludicrously inadequate unkerlant had beaten the algarvians aye how many yearshow many generationswould she take to recover from her triumph son they did more of it than the lagoans and us put together three times as much easily the writer stared at him youre joking ilmarinens patience dropped and broke and youre an idiot he snapped do they really let you run loose without diapers how do you keep from making messes on the floor who do you think you are the newssheet writer said indignantly someone who knows what hes talking about ilmarinen answered obviously something youve never had to worry about he finished his wine and stalked out as hed predicted marshal rathars leyline caravan came in the next morning the caravan had had to pass through a few regions where the algarvians were still supposed to be fighting it wasnt scratched that to ilmarinen was a telling sign that the war at least here in the east of derlavai had almost come to an end when rathar descended from the caravan car ilmarinen contrived to be in the first rank of those waiting to greet him he would he thought have used sorcery if hed had to but it hadnt proved necessary his colonels emblems his mages badge and a few judicious elbows did the trick rathar turned out to be younger than hed expected and also to his surprise the marshal of unkerlant paused and pointed to him you are the mage ilmarinen is it not so rathar asked in algarvian classical kaunian wasnt widely taught in his kingdom and he must have known ilmarinen wouldnt speak his language thats right ilmarinen answered in the same language as officers and dignitaries stared at him what can i do for you sir what does kuusamo do in the bothnian ocean rathar asked fight the gongs ilmarinen answered fish things like that what anyone else does in an ocean rathar shook his head he looked like a dissatisfied bear that is not what i meant what magic does kuusamo do in the bothnian ocean none that anyones told me about ilmarinen said which had the virtue of being technically true he had some ideas about the sorts of things his colleagues back in the naantali district of kuusamo might be doing but he couldnt prove them he hadnt heard much from those colleagues since leaving to fightwhich made sense for if captured he couldnt tell what he didnt know i do not believe you the unkerlanter marshal said ilmarinen shrugged so did rathar his shoulders were twice as wide as ilmarinens one of the junior officers accompanying him a man with bodyguard written all over him tapped rathar on the shoulder rathar nodded impatiently flanked by his entourage he walked on the surrender ceremony took place that afternoon in the hostels dining room the only chamber big enough to hold even a respectable fraction of all the people who wanted to be there king mainardo sat behind a table at one end of the room a couple of algarvian officers stood at his right and left hands both of them looking extraordinarily glum grand general nortamo of kuusamo marshal araujo of lagoas and marshal rathar of unkerlant faced him their entourages crowded behind them ilmarinen stood among nortamos followers and had to go up on tiptoe to see over some of them along with the soldiers of the three kingdoms that had done the bulk of the work in beating algarve were smaller contingents from valmiera and jelgava and sibiu and rathar had a man in forthwegian uniform in his party ilmarinen looked to see if he also had a yaninan in tow he didnt nortamo spoke in algarvian the derlavaian war has gone on too long and cost too much the allied kingdoms have prepared the instrument of surrender i hold for algarve having caused so much torment for all surrounding kingdoms having lost her own king in the fight algarve now acknowledges defeat and accepts responsibility for the consequences of her own dark deeds he walked over to mainardo and set the surrender document in front of him may i speak before i sign this paper the new king of algarve asked say what you will nortamo replied you must know though that it will not change the terms which are no less than your complete and unconditional surrender oh aye i know that mainardo answered mezentio had been a fiery leader his younger brother only seemed tired with a nod mainardo said i cannot help but recognize that we are beaten it is a truth it is plain to all but i say to you all that our courage our sacrifice our suffering shall not be in vain you may defeat us but we shall rise again one day he inked a pen signed the surrender and handed it back to the kuusaman commander nortamo also signed it he gave it to marshal araujo after the lagoan leader affixed his signature he ceremoniously carried it to the table at which marshal rathar was sitting i thank you rathar said on behalf of my sovereign i too have a word to say algarve did its best to murder unkerlant it is not sorry it fought this war it is only sorry it lost in that ilmarinen judged he was absolutely right rathar continued we intend to make algarve sorry for a long long time he wrote his name then called up the forthwegian officer with him to add another signature that done he passed the document on to the minor kingdoms of the eastnot that valmiera would have reckoned itself such before the war began at last everyone had signed the surrender nortamo spoke to the algarvian officers you gentlemen will be so kind as to give up your swords you are now war captives looking daggers at him the officers obeyed king mainardo said what of me for the moment you are king of however much of algarve we decide to let you rule the kuusaman commander replied you would be wise to hope you continue in this role even if you reckon it less than exalted king donalitu has already submitted a request for your extradition to jelgava ilmarinen happened to know that donalitu had demandedloudly demandedmainardos extradition to jelgava as far as ilmarinen could tell donalitu had never in all his days done anything so demeaning as submitting a request marshal rathar said king swemmel also has a claim on your person you to represent king mezentio and receive punishment for all algarve did to unkerlant now theres an interesting choice ilmarinen thought if i had to go to either donalitu or swemmel whom would i pick the kuusaman mage shook his head choices like that made suicide look downright attractive mainardo might have had more complaints or protests if he did hearing he was sought as a guestin a manner of speakingby both jelgava and unkerlant shut him up in a hurry marshal araujo of lagoas held up the instrument of surrender and said let us all on both sides praise the powers above the war in the east of derlavai is over ilmarinen would have praised the powers above more if theyd never let the derlavaian war start in the first place but no one had asked his opinion there and he had to admit that a finished war was better than one still going on well a halffinished war anyhow he thought and looked east in the direction of gyongyos then he looked west the gongs were closer in that direction even if it wasnt the one by which kuusamo got at them talsu was amazed at how readily he adjusted to a new round of life as a captive bad food and not enough of it occasional beatings interrogations that went nowhereindeed that seemed pointlesshed been through them all before he didnt enjoy any of them but they didnt come as a shock this time the way they had during his first stretch of time in a dungeon the questions were somewhat different the answers the interrogatorsincluding his old unfriend the majorwanted from him werent the same either all the principles behind them remained identical he had just been out in the yardthe most precious hour of a captives day when he was reminded that fresh air and sunshine and birds and trees still existedand was then as usual marched back to his cell the gloom and the stink and the cold hard stone all around were doubly hard to bear after blue sky and bright sun and the scent of something growing talsu lay down on his pallet something was growing in the straw too mildew as a tailors son would he knew the musty odor only too well he also knew better than to complain if he did he would sleep on stone with a squeal of hinges the door flew open alarm blazed through him whenever guards came in when they werent supposed to trouble was on the way hed learned that lesson when hed been locked away at algarvian orders having king donalitu in charge hadnt changed things a bit come with us one of the guards growled two others pointed sticks at talsu to make sure he wouldnt suddenly leap on them and pound them all into the ground being thought more dangerous than he really was had seemed flattering the first time it happened now it just struck him as absurd if he didnt get up they would beat him and drag him he knew that as he rose he couldnt help asking what is it this time sometimes they gave him a hint about which way the questioning would go sometimesbut not today shut up one of them told him come along a second added you stinking son of a whore the third one said had they let him bathe he wouldnt have stunk he didnt say anything of the sort they seemed in an evil temper even for guards in a dungeon he hoped that didnt mean another beating was coming the bruises from his last one were only just starting to go from purple to yellow they frogmarched him down the corridor up a flight of stairs and into an interrogation chamber there waiting for him sat the major whod been a captain when in algarvian service the major was a professional he did his job without mercy but also without malice talsu had seen as much that made the look of fury on his face all the more frightening you stinking son of a whore he said and talsus testicles tried to crawl up into his belly whatever was coming for whatever reason it was coming would be very bad he didnt know why but he did know that why often didnt matter they had him they could do as they pleased with him sir do we really have to do this a guard asked and all hope within talsu died if it worried the guards it would be dreadful indeed aye we do powers below eat him the major replied he yanked open a desk drawer and pulled out the clothes talsu had been wearing when he was arrested and the contents of his pockets glaring at talsu he demanded are these goods yours is this everything you had in your possession when you were taken into the custody of king donalitus security personnel i think so talsu answered now thoroughly confused he dared ask whats going on ill tell you what the interrogator snarled you must have kissed some kuusamans arse because the miserable slanteyes want you out of here and so youre going out of hereway out of here get into your clothes youll be their problem from now on and theyre fornicating well welcome to you things were happening too fast for talsu to follow he wondered if they were going to kill him and give his body to the kuusamans then he decided they wouldnt do thatthe major wouldnt have been so angry about disposing of his corpse he dressed in a hurry the only kuusamans with whom hed had much to do were the mage near skrunda and the soldiers hed led past his home town how could one of them have heard hed been tossed in a dungeon how would one of them have had the clout to get him out he had no idea he didnt much care either sign this the major shoved a leaf of paper at him what is it talsu asked as he picked up a pen he looked at the paper a certificate of good treatment are you out of your mind why should i sign it its a bloody lie why should you sign it the major looked at him because we wont turn you loose if you dont thats why he folded his arms across his chest and waited talsu started to bend over the certificate then stopped weighing the odds he wouldnt have been here if the kuusamans hadnt leaned on king donalitus government that was plain but since they had who owned the power here talsu straightened up and set down the pen futter you he said evenly behind him the guards growled he tensed and started to shrink in on himself fearing hed misjudged and earned another beating but the major of interrogators just gave him a sour stare were well rid of you he declared and the kuusamans are welcome to you what did that mean before talsu could even ask the major gestured to the guards they grabbed talsu and hustled him out of the interrogation chamber he went out through the exercise yardblinking at the bright sun as he always did when he first saw itand out through the gate he blinked again this time at not having walls around him was this where it was a leyline caravan glided up a couple of nondescript men men who looked amazingly like the fellows whod arrested him got down from a caravan car one of them jerked a thumb at talsu this the bastard he asked its him all right a guard agreed the fellows from the caravan car and the guards signed some papers then the guards gave talsu a shove he climbed up into the caravan car so did his new keepers the leyline caravan slid off toward the southeast where are we going talsu asked balvi one of the men said shut up the other one added he would have had no trouble working in a dungeon balvi talsu exclaimed hed never been to the capital of jelgava before his days in the army hed never been far from skrunda the mountains hed seen and fought in then hadnt endeared him to the idea of travel neither had his couple of trips to king donalitus dungeons why balvi shut up this time both keepers spoke together in casual conversational tones more frightening than fierce menace would have been one of them went on youd be amazed how much we can make you hurt without leaving a mark on you thats true the other one agreed talsu was willing to believe them he sat quietly in the compartmentsave for one brief trip to ease himself during which both keepers went with himtill the leyline caravan glided into the depot at balvi late that afternoon a carriage waited for them there talsu craned his neck for glimpses of the capitals famous buildings even the royal palace was worth seeing no matter what he thought of king donalitu once inside the carriage talsu risked a question where are we going kuusaman ministry answered one of the men with him youre their worry now the other one said and good riddance to you what do you mean talsu said you sound like youre throwing me out of the kingdom thats just what were doing a keeper said if the slanteyes want you so bad theyre welcome to you as far as jelgava is concerned talsu was still chewing on that when the carriage stopped in front of a larger more impressive building than any skrunda boasted the kuusaman banner sky blue and sea green flew in front of it and atop it out the other keeper said talsu got out so did his shepherds a couple of kuusamans took charge of them just inside the ministry they spoke classical kaunianspoke it better than talsu or his keepers though it was the grandfather of jelgavan but unrelated to the islanders tongue that left talsu obscurely embarrassed the keepers signed several leaves of paper talsu began to feel as if he were no more than a sack of lentils passed from one dealer to another with a last glower king donalitus men left the ministry one of the kuusamans told talsu come with me i shall take you to minister tukiainen i thank you talsu said in his halting classical kaunian but may i not wash myself first middle voice he thought he was increasingly conscious that he hadnt had the chance to bathe any time lately after putting their heads together and talking in their own language the kuusamans both nodded let it be as you say one of them replied but you would do wellplease believe me when i say thisto bathe quickly a quick bath didnt get rid of all the grime clinging to talsu but did leave him smelling less like something just off the midden the kuusamans escorted him to minister tukiainens office he almost didnt notice the minister though for gailisa was sitting in the office they flew into each others arms what are you doing here he asked her it is her doing that you are both here minister tukiainen spoke good jelgavan by speaking he reminded talsu of his existence he went on she wrote a letter that brought your plight to the notice of the seven princes we requested your release and so here you are thank you sir reluctantly untangling himself from gailisa talsu bowed he asked uh sir why am i here why didnt they just let me go back to skrunda because your government has decided you and your wife are both troublemakers tukiainen answered you are not welcome in jelgava anymore king donalitu has said that since kuusamo is interested in you you should be kuusamos responsibility and sohe smiledwe shall take care of that as soon as may be we shall send you to yliharma and help you set up in business there you are a tailor your wife tells me a skilled tailor should do well in kuusamo things were moving too fast for talsu that morning hed been in the dungeon with no particular hope of ever getting out again now he was not only out of the dungeon but also evidently on his way out of his own kingdom he tried to make himself sorry or angry or anything of the sort he couldnt all he felt was joy thank you sir he said and bowed again i feel likelike im escaping and so you are master tukiainen said to us this whole kingdom is like a dungeon in my opinion you are well out of it ill have to learn kuusaman talsu said that at the moment was the least of his worries thirteen leudast marveled that he could walk through the streets of trapani without being ready to dive into a hole at any moment the algarvians formal surrender in the city hadnt quite ended the fighting diehards and soldiers who hadnt got the word kept blazing at the unkerlanters for several days more even king mainardos announcement of a general algarvian surrender hadnt quite done the job by now though all the redheads had either laid down their sticks or were lying down themselveslying down and not about to get up again a skinny algarvian woman came out of a battered house sleeping with me she called in bad unkerlanter and twitched her hips in case leudast hadnt been able to understand her he shook his head and walked on he hadnt turned the corner before she called the same invitation to another unkerlanter soldier leudast got propositioned a couple of times a day some of his countrymen said it proved all algarvian women were whores leudast didnt know whether it proved they were whores or just that they were hungry everybodyeverybody algarvian anyhowin trapani was hungry these days leudast couldnt see that the unkerlanter authorities were working very hard to keep the redheads fed he lost no sleep over it when mezentios men held big stretches of unkerlant they hadnt done much to keep the peasants and townsfolk there fed either let em get a taste of empty he thought let em get more than a taste by the powers above he had to stop then a column of captives came shambling by glum hollowcheeked men in filthy tattered algarvian uniforms the stubble on their faces almost but not quite grown out into beards most of them were redheads but he spotted a knot of men who looked like unkerlanters though they wore tan tunics and kilts like the algarvians their dark beards were thick and full who are those whoresons he called to a guard traitors from the duchy of grelz he was a lieutenant nowadays because hed captured the algarvian calling himself king of grelz some of the men from the duchy in the southeast of unkerlant kept fighting against king swemmel even after that but the guard shook his head no sir he answered these bastards are forthwegians the outfit that called itself plegmunds brigade and see theyve got a couple of valmieran swine with em the algarvians picked up garbage all over the place he laughed at his own wit plegmunds brigade eh leudast nodded aye i ran up against them a time or two he hadnt cared for the experience the forthwegians had been tough and nasty one of them a fellow who looked as if hed been a robber before joining plegmunds brigade must have understood him for he spoke in his own language too futtering bad we didnt get you too having come from northeastern unkerlant not far from the forthwegian border leudast followed forthwegian better than most of his countrymen would have he also heard another captive say powers below eat you shut up ceorl you want to make it worse than it is already where are these men going leudast asked the guard sir i dont know for certain but i think theyre off for the mamming hills the fellow replied ah leudast said and said no more ceorls comrade had been wasting his time worrying if these captives were bound for the mamming hills it was already about as bad as it could be he didnt need to fret about making it worse more captives cleared debris from a broad square in front of the royal palace leudast scowled at the burnt and shattered wreckage of king mezentios residence hed been in on some of the fighting there and the algarvians had battled room by room corridor by corridor and then when his own side had finally cleared them out theyd found mezentio already dead if that wasnt a cheat what was capturing mezentios cousin raniero had made leudast an officer what would capturing mezentio himself have gained some lucky unkerlanter colonels rank a duchy anything this side of the sky itself seemed possible but mezentio curse him had taken the easy way out what would king swemmel have done to him had he fallen alive into unkerlanter hands mezentio hadnt wanted to find out leudast didnt think he would have wanted to find out either not in mezentios shoes he remembered how bravely raniero had gone into the boiling waterand how hed shrieked afterwards for as long as he still kept life in him and mezentio without a doubt would have ended up envying raniero his easy fate several unkerlanters came out of the palace along with one algarvian who towered half a head over them the group walked toward leudast without even noticing he was there all the unkerlanters were officers of age and rank exalted enough to make a young lieutenant seem no more important than any other chunk of rubble littering the ground one of the officersa brigadierwas speaking to the redhead you had better understand you will keep the job as long as you do as his majesty commands disobey and all you will be is very very sorry im not likely to make a mistake about that am i the algarvian spoke fluent almost unaccented unkerlanter his wave encompassed the whole of the capital the whole of the kingdom considering the example i have before me i would have to be a madman to step out of line this does not always stop algarvians the brigadier replied we have seen as much i hope i am plain if you are not pliable you are dead slowly i told you once i understand replied the redheadednoble leudast supposed he had to be you had better thats all the brigadier said he and the other officers swept past leudast i wont stare after them leudast thought they might notice me and i dont want to be noticed now what sort of job did they have in mind for the algarvian by the way they were talking it might almost have been king but with mainardo algarve already had a king of course if swemmel decided not to recognize mezentios brother and raised up a candidate of his own who would who could stop him hed already done that in forthweg why not here too the only drawback leudast could see was that any redhead was likely to betray unkerlant the instant he thought he could get away with it that wasnt his worry if the candidate looked like giving trouble he expected king swemmel would spot it before it got bad enough to be dangerous swemmel looked for trouble the way fussy old women looked for weeds in their garden plotsand when he found it he yanked it up by the roots not far beyond the royal palace stood a building so solidly made it had come through the fierce fighting in trapani almost undamaged men were carrying sackssacks obviously heavy for their sizeout the front door and loading them into wagons what looked like a regiments worth of guards surrounded the wagons whats going on here leudast asked one of the guards sir this is the treasury of the kingdom of algarve the man answered his eyes were hard and alert warning that leudast would do well not to seem too interested despite that warning look leudast couldnt help letting out a low whistle oh he said and its about to become part of the treasury of the kingdom of unkerlant you might say something like that sir the guard replied good leudast said the fornicating redheads cost us plenty only fair they should pay us back i just wish gold and silver could really pay for all the lives they robbed us of aye sir something of the guards humanity showed through the hard mask of his face i lost a brother last year and my home village isnt far from durrwangen so powers above only know if any of my kin are left alive i hope so leudast answered it was all he could say some of the biggest and most important battles of the war had been fought around the southern city of durrwangen a couple of summers before leudast had been there on the eastern side of the bulge the algarvians were trying to pinch off he still marveled that hed come through in one piece so do i the guards stick twitched just a little leudast took the hint anyone who spent too long watching the plundering of the algarvian treasury might be suspected of wanting some of the plunder for himself as a matter of fact leudast did want some of the plunder for himself but not enough to get blazed for it he left in a hurry when he got back to his regiments encampment in a park not too far from the palace it was boiling like an anthill stirred by a stick whats going on he asked a soldier from his company orders sir the man replied that told leudast less than he wanted to know what kind of orders he demanded but the soldier had already hurried off in a way leudast got the answer to his question the orders were of the urgent kind oh there you are leudast captain dagaric said ive been looking for you im here sir leudast answered saluting what in blazes is going on were moving out of trapani thats what the regimental commander told him moving out by tonight as a matter of fact powers above leudast exclaimed moving out where his first automatic glance was toward the east are we going to start the war up again and take on the kuusamans and lagoans no no no dagaric shook his head were not going east were going west were going a long way west as a matter of fact a long long way west about as far west as we can go leudast asked dagaric nodded thats right weve got some unfinished business with the gongs you know whats so funny nothing sir or not really funny anyhowbut strange all the same leudast said back a million years ago or thats what it seems like nowback before the big derlavaian war started anywayi was fighting in the elsung mountains in one of those little noaccount skirmishes that dont matter at all unless you happen to get killed in them ive been through all this and now im going back he wondered how many other unkerlanters whod fought in the halfhearted border war against gyongyos were left alive today not manyhe was sure of that once more he counted himself lucky only to have been wounded twice well now the cursed gongs will get another chance he thought and wished he hadnt more than his regiment was leaving trapani much more than his regiment once his men got to the leyline caravan depot they had a long wait before they filed onto the cars that would take them across most of the length of derlavai why did we have to hurry so much if were just standing around here somebody grumbled thats the way the army works leudast said and believe me standing around is a lot better than getting blazed at besides itll take us ten days maybe more to get where were going you might as well get used to doing nothing he remembered his last passage out to the borders of gyongyos as far and away the longest most boring journey hed ever made with nothing to do but watch endless miles of flat countryside slip past but battle once he got to the uttermost west hadnt been boring however much he wished it were he didnt expect it would be this time either as he finally filed aboard the leyline caravan car he hoped against hope he would prove wrong ceorl had known for a long time that he would get it in the neck if he hadnt signed up for plegmunds brigade a forthwegian magistrate would have given it to him the second time they caught you for robbery with violence they didnt bother locking you up they just got rid of you the judge had been in what passed for a kindly mood for him hed been willing to let the unkerlanters do the job instead of taking care of it himself with a signature and so ceorl had gone to fight in the south for a whileall the way up through the battles in the durrwangen bulgehed hoped hed managed to cheat the judge because algarve had still had a chance to win the war after that he shook his head after that it had been almost two years of hard grinding retreat hed started out somewhere between durrwangen and sulingen and ended up one of the last holdouts in the ruins of king mezentios palace in trapani even then the unkerlanters hadnt been able to kill him along with the other survivors from plegmunds brigade the blonds from the phalanx of valmiera sprinkled in among them and the algarvians whod been stubborn enough to stick it out to the very end hed come forth with his hands high sure enough but also with his head high he turned to sudaku aye sudaku was a stinking kaunian but hed fought as well as anybody else this past year in algarviansudaku had picked up some forthwegian but not a lotceorl said the one thing i didnt figure on was that swemmels whoresonsd go right on having chances to do us in even after we surrendered powers below eat me if i know why not sudaku replied did you think they would pat us on the bottom and tell us to go home and to be good little boys from here on out not likely ah futter you ceorl spoke altogether without malice he cursed as automatically as he breathed and thought no more of one than of the other he was a brick of a man stocky even by forthwegian standards with bushy eyebrows a big hooked nose and a smile that usually looked like a sneer the unkerlanters are going to futter us all sudaku said they can take their time about it now but theyre going to do it he was right of course ceorl knew it if hed been on top of the world he would have paid back everybody whod ever done him dirt he had a long list but his list he had to admit paled beside the one king swemmel must have been keeping all these years what swemmels list amounted to was the whole kingdom of algarve and anybody who ever helped it in any way that was a list worth having a list worth admiring and swemmel was getting his moneys worth from it too once upon a time this captives camp outside of trapani had been a barracks complex holding perhaps a brigades worth of men six or eight times that many soldiersor rather exsoldierswere crammed into it now they got just enough food to keep them from starving in a hurry it was as if the unkerlanters wanted to savor their suffering pretty soon sudaku said a plague will start and they will need to bring in a leyline caravan to carry out the corpses by carloads youre a cheery bastard arent you ceorl answered i almost hope a plague does start the stinking unkerlantersd catch it too and itd fornicating well serve em right with a shrug the man from the phalanx of valmiera said you should want to live if you get out of this place if you go back to your own kingdom you can hope to do what you did before the war i am not so lucky for a valmieran who has fought for algarve there is nothing left oh my arse ceorl said you ever get back to your own kingdom pick a new name and pick a new town and start telling lies like a fornicating madman tell em about how the redheads powers below eat em did you all kinds of dirt your people would buy it most people are nothing but a pack of fornicating fools sudaku laughed out loud maybe you are right it might be worth a try what a reason to live to spend the rest of my life telling lies ceorl poked him in the chest with a forefinger listen pal after this war folksll be telling lies for the next fifty years anybody who ever had anything to do with the redheads is going to say no no not me i tried to kick those bastards right in the nuts and all the algarvians who were the meanest whoresons theyll go no i didnt have any idea what was going on that was those other fornicators and theyre already dead you think im kidding just wait and see no i do not think you are kidding the blond said it will happen maybe i could do that if i ever got back to valmiera but i do not think i am going to he was likely right for himself but ceorl had some hope of escaping but for his beard he looked like an unkerlanter and he could make a stab at the language of king swemmels soldiers if he could murder a guard and get into the fellows uniform tunic he might sneak out of the captives camp and if he could do that anything might happen he was still contemplating ways and means two days later when the unkerlanters emptied out the captives camp by marching half the men in itincluding the survivors of plegmunds brigadeout of the place and through the streets of trapani who are those whoresons an unkerlanter lieutenant asked a guard as the captives trudged along traitors from the duchy of grelz no sir the guard answered these bastards are forthwegians the outfit that called itself plegmunds brigade and see theyve got a couple of valmieran swine with em the algarvians picked up garbage all over the place ceorl followed his words well enough plegmunds brigade eh the officer nodded aye i ran up against them a time or two too futtering bad we didnt get you too ceorl muttered powers below eat you shut up ceorl another forthwegian captive said as they went on their way you want to make it worse than it is already how ceorl asked as they shambled on the other fellow had no answer for him they stopped by the ruins of the central leyline caravan depot the queue of captives snaked toward the platforms ceorl thought of a way in which things might be worse and spoke to the other men from plegmunds brigade in forthwegian we better stick together whatever happens otherwise the fornicating redheadsre liable to come down on us hard on account of were odd men out his eyes flicked toward sudaku you catch that he asked the blond from the phalanx of valmiera also in his own language bet your arse i did the kaunian replied in the same tongue hed been with the men of plegmunds brigade long enough to have learned to curse in forthwegian and had picked up other bits and pieces as well ceorl slapped him on the back the ruffian despised blonds on general principles but didnt dislike the handful beside whom hed fought to his surprise the caravan car to which the unkerlanter guards steered his lot of captives was one made for carrying passengers hed expected to go aboard one that had borne freight or perhaps animals to be able to sit down in an actual compartment and watch the landscape go by that didnt sound so bad it also wasnt what happened a compartment was made to hold four people the unkerlanters shoehorned a couple of dozen into that space you fit one of them shouted in bad algarvian you make selfs fit you no do we do men squeezed onto the seats onto the floor and up onto the baggage racks above the barred windows ceorl saw at once that those racks offered more room to stretch out than anywhere else in the compartment he swarmed up onto one an algarvian had the same idea at almost the same time ceorls elbow got him in the pit of the stomach he dropped back into the seething crowd below ceorl hauled sudaku out of the crowd and up onto the rack with him thanks the blond said in algarvian why did you do that before ceorl could answer the redhead hed elbowed and a pal rose again like a couple of spouting leviathans and tried to haul him down ceorls boot got one of them in the face oh no you dont you son of a whore he said meanwhile sudaku had driven off the other algarvian thats why ceorl said everybodys got to have somebody to watch his back for him ah the kaunian nodded i see it we are like too many wolves in too small a cage i dont know anything about wolves ceorl said all i know about is gaols but i know them good either you eat meat or you are meat powers below eat all those other bastards nobodys going to eat me he leaned down from the baggage rack to kick an algarvian who was wrestling with a man from plegmunds brigade for a space on one of the seats the algarvian crumpled the forthwegian shoved him aside and waved to ceorl ceorl grinned back hed had plenty of practice at this kind of dirty fighting it was different from soldiering here everyone except a few chums was an enemy have to remind the chums who they are he thought by the time things in the compartment sorted themselves out he had a good line on who was strong and who was weak the weak the friendless and the stupid were jammed into the space on the floor between the seats some of them were nothing more than footrests for the stronger captives yells from the compartment down the corridor said the unkerlanters were filling it the same way once the car was full a door slammed the leyline caravan still didnt move plenty of other cars remained to be filled up in his aerie ceorl was comfortable enough he didnt want to think about what the poor whoresons folded in on themselves down below were going through he didnt want to and so he didnt they hadnt had the brains or the ballocks to take care of themselves nobody else would do it for them after what seemed like forever the leyline caravan glided out of the depot from where he was ceorl couldnt see a great deal but he did know they were heading west he shrugged hed already got the upper hand on things and expected hed be able to keep it no matter where he ended up rations were hard bread and salted fish that set up a raging thirst in whoever ate them he got a goodsized chunk of bread and one of the biggest fish he also got first pull at the cup from the water bucket the unkerlanters grudgingly allowed their captives when he and his comrades were herded into the compartment he hadnt expected to stay there for three days one man died on the trip no one noticed till he wouldnt take his piece of bread even after the captives shoved his corpse out into the corridor the compartment seemed just as crowded as it had before on the morning of the third day the leyline caravan finally stopped out the guards shouted in unkerlanter and algarvian out a lot of the captives had trouble moving not ceorl whose fettle was about as fine as it could be he sprang down from the caravan car and looked around not far away stood ramshackle wooden barracks low rolling hills dotted the countryside the air smelled of wood smoke and something else something with a harsh mineral tang to it where in blazes are we he said these are the mamming hills a guard pointed to a black hole cinnabar mine well work you till you die you whoreson he threw back his head and laughed it wont take long count sabrino lay on his cot hed been on his feetno on his foota few times by now but moving around while upright still left him not only exhausted but in more pain than hed known when dragonfire set his leg alight the healers talked about fitting him with a jointed artificial leg one day but he didnt take that seriouslynot yet the only thing he took seriously these days was the decoction of poppy juice that pushed aside the worst of the pain he knew hed started craving the drug for its own sake as well as for the relief it brought one of these days ill worry about that too he thought if the pain ever goes away i expect ill find a way to wean myself from the decoction what he hadnt expected was that the missing leg still hurt even though it wasnt there anymore the healers told him such things were normal that most people who lost limbs kept a sort of phantom memory and perception of what theyd once had he didnt argue with them he was hardly in a position to do so but that phantom presence struck him as the strangest thing about being mutilated or so it did till the afternoon when a healer came up to him and said you have a visitor count sabrino a visitor sabrino said in surprise no one had come to see him since he was injured he could think of only a couple of people who might is it captain orosio or my wife perhaps he didnt know if either of them was alive if they arent they wont come he thought and laughed under his breath uh no your excellency the healer replied no and no respectively the fellow coughed a couple of times as if to say sabrino was very wrong indeed well who in blazes is it then the colonel of dragonfliers demanded as he got more used to the decoction of poppy juice more of his own temper pierced the haze it gave his wits instead of answering straight out the healer said ill bring in the gentleman excuse me your excellency he hurried away when he came back he had with him a whitehaired unkerlanter officer with a chestful of medals your excellency i have the honor to present to you general vatran general count sabrino you speak unkerlanter vatran asked in algarvian sabrino shook his head sorry but no he started at the unkerlanter what are you doing here youre marshal rathars righthand man that is why i am here vatran went on in algarvian he wasnt fluent but he could make himself understood catching the healers eye he jerked a thumb at the door you get lost that got through sure enough the healer fled what do you want with me sabrino asked he still had trouble believing he wasnt imagining this vatran walked over and shut the door the healer had just used that bit of melodrama done he came back to sabrinos bedside and said how you like to be king of algarve im sorry sabrino burst out laughing you know im hurt you know im taking a pretty strong decoction for the pain vatran nodded curtly sabrino went on it does some strange things sometimes i thought you just asked me if i wanted to be king of algarve i do say that general vatran replied you want to be king of algarve you be king of algarve so say king swemmel but algarve already has a king sabrino said king mainardo hed almost said mezentio but remembered hearing mezentio was dead in his own guttural language vatran said something pungent about mainardo sabrino followed part of it he didnt speak unkerlanter not really but years in the west had taught him something about swearing in that language vatran was plainly a master of the art in algarvian the general continued powers below eat mainardo he is trouble king swemmel want a man he can trust for king we ask one redhead already but he play games with us no games here he drew a thumb across his throat to show exactly what he meant he meant the invitation sabrino wasnt so drugged that he didnt understand that slowly with as much caution as the poppy juice left in him he asked why does king swemmel think i am the right man for this job you are algarvian you are noble general vatran ticked off points on his fingertips as if he were trying to sell sabrino a jug of olive oil you are brave fighter so men respect you and we know you quarrel with king mezentio ah sabrino said now things grew clearer and so you think i would make a proper traitor with the drug in him he couldnt be very cautious vatran shook his head not a traitor how can algarve hurt us now no matter who is king other bastard he not see that he made the throatcutting gesture again and he had a point or a sort of a point sabrino wagged a forefinger at him if you didnt care who was king why would you mind having mainardo keep the crown mainardo is mezentios brother vatran went back to counting on his fingers and he is puppet of lagoas and kuusamo this not good not for unkerlant he had a certain brutal honesty to him even when he played the game of intrigue algarvians were suaver smoother and much good that did us sabrino thought you would want me to be a puppet of unkerlants eh why of course general vatran answered i tell you about this other bastardhe stupid you think we let your kingdom get big and strong so you kick us in the balls again you crazy brutal honesty indeed went through sabrinos mind he shook his head to my way of thinking i would have to be a traitor to do the job as you want it done the unkerlanter shook his head again no no no you can ward your subjects can shield them this much i think king swemmel let you have can shield them from unkerlanter soldiers was what he had to mean even so sabrino said i thank you sirand i mean that for you offer me an honor i never dreamt would come my way even so i must decline why when general vatran frowned his bushy white eyebrows came down and together so that they formed a bar over his eyes his majesty not be happy you are right man for job algarvian noble you dont like mezentio i think you misunderstand something sabrino said shall i be very plain with the decoction of poppy juice in him he could hardly be anything else say on vatran rumbled ominously you know i disagreed with king mezentio sabrino said and the unkerlanter officers big heavyfeatured head went up and down and because of that you think i would be able to work well with your king general vatran nodded once more aye it is so but sabrino shook his head no it is not so and sir i will tell you why it is not so he wagged that forefinger at vatran again it is not so because i wanted my kingdom to beat yours every bit as much as king mezentio did believe me i wanted to march through cottbus in triumph every bit as much as mezentio did he glanced down at the asymmetrical shape under the sheet on the cot but we didnt march through cottbus and i wont be doing any marching now why you quarrel with your king then vatran demanded his voice held a certain amount of respectful wonder sabrino thought he understood that from everything hed heard quarreling with swemmel was something an unkerlanter did at most once why purely over means not over the end sabrino said by vatrans new frown he saw the unkerlanter didnt follow that he spelled it out i didnt think killing kaunians was a good idea i never thought it was a good idea i thought it would make all our enemies hate us and fear us and fight us harder than ever you right vatran said and much good that did me sabrino thought i never imagined you unkerlanters would slaughter your own to strike back at us none of the eastern kingdoms would have done such a thing you knew this fight was to the death too aloud he said i suppose i was i thought we would have beaten you without doing any such thing maybe i was right about that and maybe i was wrong but that was my quarrel with my king the long and the short of it mezentio didnt dispose of me for arguing with him the way swemmel would have but he never forgave me either vatran grunted this why you a colonel when war starts and you still a colonel when war stops i wonder some on that make more sense now aye thats why sabrino agreed and so you see you cannot rely on me to make a puppet king of algarve either i am no mans puppet not even my own sovereigns you brave to say this vatran observed you maybe stupid to say this too you likely stupid to say this why will swemmel blaze me for it sabrino asked dont know vatran replied wouldnt be surprised sabrino shrugged well if he does he does ive been through too much to worry about it let him do what he will do this is your last word vatran asked sabrino nodded the unkerlanter general sighed all right i take it away with me you are brave man you are also fool there for the first time he almost tempted sabrino to change his mind if being a fool qualified a man for the kingship he reckoned himself the best qualified sovereign algarve had ever had after general vatran left the healer came back into sabrinos chamber curiousnosyas any algarvian he asked what did the barbarian want he wanted to proclaim me king of algarve sabrino answered he waited to see what the healer would make of that for a moment the fellow just gaped not sure how to take it then he started to laugh well i asked for that didnt i he said all right your majesty ill be careful around you from now on im not anyones majesty sabrino said i turned him down that only made the healer laugh harder i can see why you would have a chap like you you have to hold out for a really good position eh no wonder mezentio got so testy sabrino thought he ruled a whole kingdom full of people like this i suppose i was just another little nuisance to him till vatrans offer hed never tried to imagine what the world looked like from the perspective of a king powers above why would anybody want the job still laughing the healer said why didnt you ask him if you could be king of unkerlant instead theres a place that could really use a civilized man running things i dont want to be king of unkerlant sabrino wondered if an unkerlanter mage was somehow listening to every word he said given some of the things hed heard about king swemmel he wouldnt have been surprised he didnt want that mage hearing anything untoward i dont want to be king at all not any place well all right the healer plucked at his mustachios which hed managed to keep perfectly waxed throughout algarves collapse conquest and occupation if it were me though id grab anything i could get he plucked some more maybe we ought to switch you to a decoction thats not quite so potent he thinks i imagined the whole thing sabrino realized i suppose youre going to tell me i made up the unkerlanter general too he said with a shrug the healer answered who knows whats real these days sabrino laughed but it wasnt as if the fellow didnt have a point another letter vanai said to saxburh as she fished it out of the brass letterbox in the lobby of her block of flats the envelope bore no return address and was addressed to her as thelberge her heart leaped when she recognized the script and its from your father mama saxburh said she didnt say dada so much these days had ealstan been here had she had someone to say it to that would have been different vanai was sure of it she picked up her daughter and the jug of olive oil shed bought come on lets go upstairs and well find out what he says she longed for the days when saxburh would be able to walk up those stairs by herself the baby wasnt a lightweight any more she wasnt so much of a baby any more either shed started taking her first few toddling steps without holding on to anything and her first birthday was only a few days away of course she didnt care anything about the letter hat she said as soon as she got back to the flat she found her special little hat and jammed it down onto her head hat thats a hat vanai agreed she almost tore ealstans letter in her eagerness to get it out of the envelope hello sweetheart ealstan wrote that youre seeing this proves im not an unkerlanter soldier any more they kept me long enough to use me up then decided they didnt want me with a hole in my leg i would like you and saxburh to come back here to gromheort to live i wouldnt have said that before everything that happened eoforwic used to be the easiest place in the kingdom for your people and for mixed couples to get along now now i dont know how easy it will be anywhere i wish i didnt have to say something like that but im afraid its true vanai feared it was true too as he usually did ealstan made hard solid sense that was one of the things that had interested her in him from the beginning now that shed seen a letter from his father she had a better notion of how he came by it i dont know how your money is holding out he wrote a bookkeepers son and a bookkeeper himself he thought of such things if you need more let me know if you dont buy passage on the first leyline caravan car you can and come east dont wait to write us which caravan youii be on you know where we live take a cab from the depot this old town went through a lot in the siege but the rubble is out of the streets and you can get from there to here all my kin here cant wait to meet you and see you and find out what you look likeboth waysand to see our little girl conberge is going to have a baby too so saxburh will have a cousin to grow up with and i miss you more than i can tell you and i cant wait to hug you and kiss you and do whatever else i can talk you into with all the love there isyour husband ealstan pack up everything she could carry wait not a minute vanai started to shake her head then paused shed done that before when she came here to eoforwic with ealstan how glad shed been to get out of oyngestun too and how likely it was that getting out of oyngestun had saved her life no algarvians lurked these days waiting to throw her into a special camp but shed spent too much of her time here in eoforwic in hiding she had no friends here and she didnt really want to make any shed been through too much things might be better in gromheort they could hardly be worse ealstan was right before the derlavaian war the capital had been the best place in forthweg for kaunians mixed couples and halfbreeds nowadays vanai doubted any place in the kingdom would be very good i can go on looking like thelberge when i show my face outside the house she thought inside inside i dont think it will matter now that ive seen hestans letter i really dont think it will she glanced over to saxburh who was standing by herself in the middle of the floor and looking enormously proud and you will learn kaunian too along with forthwegian come here vanai called come hereyou can do it saxburh toddled about halfway to her then fell down and crawled the rest of the way good girl vanai said scooping her up how would you like to go to gromheort and meet your grandfather and grandmother saxburh didnt say no no wasnt a word shed discovered yet from things vanai had heard that would change when her daughter turned two or so vanai checked her dwindling store of silver she didnt know what caravan fares were like these days but unless theyd gone altogether madwhich most prices hadntshe still had plenty to get to gromheort she took the money she packed a couple of tunics for herself and clothes and cloths for the baby she made sure she had a length of golden yarn and one of black so she could renew their sorcerous disguises and she packed some food for herself and her daughter though she was glad saxburh was still nursing that made travel much more convenient the silver went into her handbag everything else filled a duffel bag she put saxburh back into the harness that let her carry the baby without using her hands then went downstairs when the first of the month came the landlord would come knocking on the door for the rent and hed get a surprise till then who would knowwho would carewhether she was there or not she headed for the street corner to get a cab to the caravan depot she knew she might be there for a while and hoped saxburh wouldnt decide to fuss hello thelberge someone said pausing on the corner along with her you look like youre going somewhere oh hello guthfrith vanai said the drummer and singer was about the last person she wanted to see as she was he was wearing a purely forthwegian sorcerous disguise that made her ask or should i call you ethelhelm she wanted him to remember she knew who and what he was he grimaced ethelhelms dead hes never coming back to life too many people uh dont understand what happened during the war dont understand how you got too friendly with the redheads you mean vanai thought ethelhelm had started out as a bold foe of the algarvians but his kaunian blood let them put pressure on him that they couldnt use against an ordinary forthwegian and hed buckled under it cozying up to them to help keep the comforts hed earned as a leading musician in forthweg he went on i dont suppose im the only one these days whos going by more than one name i dont know what youre talking about vanai answered though she did perfectly well oh i doubt that he saidin classical kaunian vanai made herself shrug sorryi never learned that language what did you say she didnt want to give him any kind of hold on her spinello had taught her what men did with such things she didnt know what ethelhelm wanted from her and she didnt care to find out she looked down the street for a cab but didnt see one where were they when you needed them hat saxburh saidin forthwegian vanai hadnt taught her any kaunian yet for fear she would blurt it out at the wrong time this vanai thought would have been exactly the wrong time ethelhelm took no notice of what the baby said though he just nodded to vanai and said why are you worrying its not illegal to be kaunian anymore if you dont leave me alone im going to shout for a constable vanai said i dont want anything to do with you you wouldnt have shouted for a constable when they had red hair ethelhelm said i know what you are you dont know anything at all vanai told him and i know what you are too somebody who sucked up to the algarvians when it looked like a good idea now you cant even wear your own face because too many people know what you did the face ethelhelm was wearing turned red you stinking kaunian bitch he exclaimed i ought to you ought to dry up and blow away vanai saw a cab and waved frantically she let out a sigh of relief when the hackman waved back and steered his carriage through the traffic toward her eyeing ethelhelm she added and if you try bothering me anymore ill put a curse on you the likes of which nobodys seen since the days of the kaunian empire if you dont think i can youre wrong she set down the duffel bag slung her handbag to the crook of her elbow and pointed at him with both index fingers at once that was a bluff nothing else but so was her threat even the most ordinary modern mage could counter any ancient curse shed studied the subject she knew as much forthwegians who hadnt studied it reckoned the kaunians of imperial days very wise and very dangerous here despite his mixed blood ethelhelm counted as a forthwegian he went from red to pale in a heartbeat his own fingers twisted in a sign to turn aside sorcerynot an effective sign if the knowledge vanais grandfather had drilled into her was true powers below eat you he said his right hand folded into a fist ill kick him right in the crotch vanai thought thats where itll do the most good a wagon in front of the cab had stopped for no apparent reason she glared at it get out of the way you miserable whoreson ethelhelm drew back his fist before he could swing someone with a loud voice said you dont want to do that pal thank you constable vanai said fervently this mans been bothering me and he wont go away oh i think he will the constable spun his truncheon on its leather loop either that or hell get his face mashed we dont put up with hitting people on the streets he stepped toward ethelhelm which ways it gonna be buddy im leaving ethelhelm said and he did thank you vanai said again shed never been so grateful to any forthwegian except ealstan in her life part of the job lady the constable said is that cab stopping for you aye it is she answered and turned toward the driver the central leyline caravan depot please sure thing he climbed down to hold the door open for her climb on incareful of your baby here let me have that bag he closed the door behind her the constable walked off would he have helped me like that if hed known im a kaunian vanai wondered as the cab started to move she shrugged no way to know though she had her doubts one thing she could do now in the nearprivacy of the cab renew the spells that kept her and saxburh looking like forthwegians with luck and a decent caravan schedule she wouldnt have to do it again till they got to gromheort supper soon elfryth told ealstan as if he couldnt have figured it out himself from the savory smell of chicken stewing with onions and mushrooms his mother smiled at him it feels good having one of our babies back in the house with us for a while babies ealstan said just because im toddling around he could walk but was glad to have a cane in each hand to help bear his weight then he smiled too i wonder if my daughters toddling yet shes what about a year old elfryth asked ealstan nodded his mother sighed i wish i could see her i hope vanai paid attention to your letter youre not the only one ealstans tone of voice made his mother laugh his ears got hot i mean i know what you meant elfryth said if anything goes to show youre not a baby any more that does that and your beard i was already wearing a beard when i uh left ealstan said ran away because i was afraid id killed sidroc was what hed meant there he grimaced i wish i had killed him then he wouldnt have killed leofsig and leofsig was worth a hundred of him a thousand thoughts like those were probably going through his mothers mind too shed been there when he and sidroc fought shed been there when sidroc smashed leofsig with a diningroom chair too shes been through a lot ealstan realizednot the sort of idea he was used to having about his mother she said its a lot thicker now though it was a boys beard then it isnt any more she hesitated then added it reminds me a lot of your brothers there just before she broke off shed been thinking of leofsig too then ealstan limped over to her and leaned one of his canes against his hip so he could set a hand on her shoulder hed gone off to eoforwic and conberge had got married but his older brother would never come to the house again elfryth smiled up at him but unshed tears made her eyes brighter than they should have been someone knocked at the door whos that ealstan and his mother said together she went on ill find out i can move faster than you can these days stir the chicken if you please all right he said to elfryths back she was hurrying toward the entry hall ealstan plied the big iron spoon aye his mother said at the door in the polite but distant tone she used for commercial travelers and other strangers is is this the house of hestan the bookkeeper chicken utterly forgotten ealstan hobbled toward the entry hall at the best speed he could manage he was halfway there before he realized he was still holding the stirring spoon not his other cane that had fallen over he hadnt noticed aye it is his mother said doubtfully as he rounded the corner and you are vanai ealstan said ealstan somehow his mother got out of the way as they rushed to embrace each other ealstan couldnt squeeze her so tight as he wanted she had saxburh in a harness in front of her for a glorious forever that couldnt have lasted more than a minute and a half in the real world ealstan forgot everything but his wife then the baby started to cry and his mother said well i dont suppose i need an introduction now oh ealstan didnt want to let go of vanai the arm whose hand still held that serving spoon stayed around her shoulder but he made himself turn back to elfryth mother the quiet one is vanai and the noisy one is saxburh sweetheart this is my mother elfryth before vanai could say anything elfryth did powers above ealstan dont leave her standing out in the street like a peddler she darted forward and took the duffel bag vanai was carrying away from her come in my dear come in my husband and my son told you you were welcome here and they both have a habit of meaning what they say do come in thank you vanai took saxburh out of the harness and set her on the ground the baby stood easily she hadnt been able to do that when the unkerlanters hauled ealstan into the army she wants to run around vanai said she didnt have much of a chance while we were on the caravan car or in the cab and sure enough saxburhs wails stopped she looked up at ealstan with big dark eyes shaped like his own shes beautiful elfryth said that made vanai smile but only for a moment this isnt her true seeming you knowor mine either for that matter she sounded a littlemore than a littleanxious about reminding elfryth she was a kaunian but ealstans mother only shrugged aye i know you dont really look like my daughter ha ealstan broke in and pointed at vanai i told you so she stuck out her tongue at him they both laughed gamely elfryth went on but im sure youre beautiful in your own way too and so is your daughter she crouched down hello little one saxburh stared at her and then at ealstan pointing to him vanai said thats your dada weve got your dada back dada saxburh didnt sound as if she believed it she turned to vanai and spoke imperiously hat vanai reached into her handbag and took out a little hat ealstan had never seen before she set it on saxburhs head saxburh jammed it down till it almost covered her eyes hat she squealed youre still standing in the street elfryth told vanai please come in you must be tired ill get you some wine and cheese and olives and supper will be ready pretty soon she noticed ealstan was still holding the serving spoon took it away from him and went back into the house come on ealstan said all right vanai looked anxiously at him how are you im getting better he answered it still hurts and i still have some trouble getting aroundi left my other cane back in the kitchen when i heard you out herebut im getting better and im a lot better seeing you here i like your mother vanai sounded relieved she also did sound tired come on sweetiewere going in there she told saxburh holding her hand the baby walked into the entry hall she couldnt do that when the unkerlanters grabbed me ealstan said she does all kinds of things she couldnt do then vanai answered as he closed and barred the door behind them a few months dont matter much to us but theyre a big part of saxburhs life ealstan reached out and lightly patted her on the backside who says a few months dont matter he said she smiled back over her shoulder at him come in here elfryth called from the kitchen ive poured the wine and your cane is by the doorway there ealstan thanks mother he said i dont know if i ought to drink any wine im so happy i feel drunk already im going to vanai declared after ive come halfway across the kingdom with a baby in tow ive earned some wine by the powers above this kitchen is wonderful she said to ealstans mother its three times the size of the one in our flat in eoforwic its bigger than the one i had back in oyngestun too and laid out better ill show you around the house in a little while if you like elfryth said first though i thought youd want to relax for a bit that would be nice vanai shook her head no that would be more than nice that would be wonderful she picked up a mug of wine what shall we drink to to being able to drink together ealstan said vanai nodded so did his mother they all drank ill have to dig out your old high chair and your old cradle elfryth said you still have them ealstan said in astonishment of course we do his mother answered we knew we would have grandchildren one day and we thought they would come in handy theyre down in the cellari remember seeing them when we spent so much time there during the siege seeing the mugs had emptied in a hurry she poured them full again they drank more slowly the second time through ealstan could feel the wine by the way her expression grew slack it hit vanai hard when the next knock on the door came they all jumped thatll be father ealstan said he was closest to the door he didnt move as fast as he had when he heard vanais voice but he got there soon enough he threw open the door and announced theyre here whos here hestan asked but then he went on nodont tell me by the idiot grin on your face ive got a pretty good idea he pushed past ealstan and went into the kitchen where he spoke in classical kaunian vanai i am your fatherinlaw and i am very glad to meet you at last thank you sir she said in the same language im very glad to meet you too this is your granddaughter i suspected as much hestan said gravely who else in this house would be sitting there banging the lid of a pot on the floor well perhaps ealstan but he is larger slander ealstan said from behind him vanai looked from one of them to the other and back again now i understand some things about you that i didnt before she told ealstan i come by absurdity honestly he agreed suppers just about ready his mother said i know i can find that high chair she did too and triumphantly brought it into the dining room saxburh ate little bits of tornup chicken and bread and drank wellwatered wine from a cup whose lid had three little holes she made a mess elfryth smiled at ealstan in a way that said she remembered him doing the same thing halfway through supper the sorcerous disguises vanai had given herself and the baby wore off all hestan said to ealstan was you married a pretty girl either which way ealstan nodded he hadnt seen much of vanais true kaunian features for a long time vanai couldnt see her own features change of course but she noticed it on saxburh and understood what hestans comment had to mean i can put the spell back on she said hastily only if you want to ealstans father said myself i dont think theres any need to not when youre among friends among friends vanai echoed she shook her head in wonder her grayblue eyes wide you dont know how strange that sounds to me be thankful you dont know hestan didnt try to argue all he said was strange or not its true here it certainly is elfryth agreed vanai brushed at her eyes with the back of her hand she didnt quite cry but ealstan thought she came close after supper saxburh fell asleep in vanais lap maybe the wine helped but the baby had had a long hard day too ealstans mother brought out the cradle it was right by the high chair she said vanai laid saxburh in it before too much longer vanai started yawning herself ealstan and his father moved a bed from a guestroom into the one he was using that crowded the chamber but he didnt care yawning still vanai went off to bed i see what you see in her ealstans father said after the door closed shes very sweet his mother added nodding and i want to eat your daughter up were all back together again ealstan said that counts for more than anything his wounded leg twinged he ignored it in spite of it what hed said remained true he waited till he thought vanai would surely be asleep then tiptoed back to the bedroom careful not to tap with his canes opening the door as quietly as he could he stepped inside then closed it behind him from the new bed vanai whispered i thought youd never get here if youd waited much longer i really would have fallen asleep she flipped back the bedclothes under them she was bare ive missed you she said oh darling was all ealstan answeredwith words anyhow prince juhainens image stared out of the crystal aye mistress pekka he said the demonstration was everything we could possibly have wanted it to be the gongs who saw it with their own eyes were horrified the crew aboard the leyline cruiser all agree on that but the gyongyosians in gyorvar wont believe them pekka said is that where the problem lies that seems to be it aye the prince answered they have made it plain they intend to keep fighting pekka scowled we could have brought the lash down on gyorvar straightaway dont they see that we try to warn them we try to show them mercy and they refuse to take it are they mad just stubborn i think juhainen said if they insist on paying the price you can make them pay it aye your highness pekka said though i dont like to think about doing that to a place with people in it if theyll heed nothing else we do have to gain their attention juhainen said i suppose so sir pekka said in fact i know youre right but doing something like that to gyorvar or to one of the gongs other towns still comes hard id sooner have done it to algarve i know you would and i understand your reasons juhainen said in your turn though you have to understand those are not reasons of state revenge isnt the only reason i said that your highness pekka replied it plays a part id be lying if i told you anything else taken all in all though the gongs have fought a pretty clean war theyre just enemies people who want the same islands we do and wont take no for an answer the few times theyve used the murderous sorcery the algarvians came up with the men they killed to fuel it were all volunteersreal volunteers by everything we could learn with what mezentios men did they deserved being on the receiving end of this more than gyongyos does very well i see your point prince juhainen said but if we cant convince them to give up the fighting any other way we shall have to hit them over the head with a rock better that than all the kuusaman soldiers lives we would have to spend invading their homeland or do you think im wrong even if i did think you were wrong you and the rest of the seven would go right on down the ley line youve chosen pekka knew that perfectly well but in fact she agreed with the prince no your highness if this lets us win the war quickly then we should do it i hope the gongs give up before we loose the magic on them though well so do ibut if not not juhainen said is there anything else mistress pekka when pekka shook her head the prince gestured to his crystallomancer who broke the etheric connection light flared in the crystal in front of pekka and then it went dark and inert she walked back to her chamber fernao sat at the desk there filling leaves of foolscap with calculations he set down the pen and levered himself upright with the help of his cane hello he said i love you i love you too pekka said smiling it was true things being as they were she didnt even have to feel guilty when she said it but that thought by itself was enough to raise guilt in her when fernao held out his arms to hug her she slipped into his embrace as if it could shield her from all the complications of the world she wished it were so unfortunately she knew better after kissing her fernao asked what did the prince say that brought another piece of the outside world into the chambernot that it hadnt already been there on the leaves of foolscap about what we thought pekka said the gongs dont seem to believe that we can do this to them in spite of the demonstration at becsehely theyre fools fernao said theyre a stubborn folk they always have been pekka said if they werent they wouldnt have been able to keep so much of their own way of life while they added on modern eastern derlavaianstyle sorcerous techniques theyre strange and theyre hard and were going to have to break them right now id do almost anything to end the derlavaian war fernao pointed to the papers on pekkas desk we can do this gyorvars farther away than that becsehely place but not enough to change the spell much theres no sign the gyongyosians have any counterspells in place im not sure there are any counterspells for this magecraft pekka said im not sure there are either but were just starting to explore it so there may be fernao said pekka nodded he had a point he went on whether there are or not there certainly arent any up for gyorvar if we want to he snapped his fingers we can i know pekka clicked her tongue between her teeth i dont like to think about being able to wreck a city from halfway around the world neither do i fernao said but ill tell you this id rather be able to do it than to know someone else could do it to me and i couldnt answer back pekka thought about that too then slowly nodded if we have to do this to gyorvar i wonder how king swemmel will take it she said actually i dont wonder ive got a pretty good idea swemmel will have fawns have kittens wed say in lagoan fernao told her amounts to about the same thing either way i suppose i wonder how long the unkerlanters will take to figure out what weve done and how weve done it years pekka said confidently theyre brave and theyre very tough and theyre very big but theyre very backward too i wonder i really do fernao said the algarvians thought the same thing about them i suppose and look at the surprise they got they deserved the surprise they got pekka said they should have got more and worse as a matter of fact thats not what i meant fernao wagged a finger at her in an algarvic gesture whats more you know its not what i meant unkerlanter mages turned out to know their business pretty well if they matched what mezentios men did why shouldnt they match us too it doesnt seem likely to me pekka said what will swemmel do to push them forward kill the sorcerers who tell him it cant be done as fast as he wants shed meant it for a joke but fernao nodded he might nothing concentrates the mind like the prospect of being boiled alive in the morning pekka made a horrible face thats disgusting i know fernao answered that doesnt mean it wont work there are times i wish id never performed my experiments pekka said if you hadnt someone else would have fernao said it might have been an algarvian or an unkerlanter if anyone can do this better kuusamo and lagoas than most other places i could name i think youre right she said if you were to ask an algarvian or an unkerlanter though he would tell you different oh no doubt fernao agreed that doesnt mean theyd know what they were talking about though he laughed after all what are they but a bunch of ignorant foreigners youre impossible pekka told him andshe jabbed a finger his way as far as im concerned youre an ignorant foreigner too even if you do speak kuusaman with a southcoast accent whose fault is that fernao said besides if i settle down with you in kajaani will i still be a foreigner he held up a hand i know ill still be ignorant you dont need to remind me of that no eh pekka was a trifle annoyed that hed seen her next gibe coming before she could make it she thought about the question hed put her i dont know if youd be a foreigner or not a lot of that would depend on you wouldnt you say and on how much youd want to fit in fernao bent down and kissed the top of her head that reminded her how much taller he was than the average kuusaman woman or man he said ill never look like one of your countrymen you do have the eyes she answered and he nodded she went on and there are a fair number of kuusamanspeople who speak kuusaman who think of themselves as kuusamanswith red hair and with legs longer than they need to be especially in the western part of the land the part close to lagoas you have some short dark slanteyed folk who think of themselves as lagoans too we have people who look like everything under the sun who think of themselves as lagoans fernao said for the past hundred years people have been coming to setubal to get away from wherever they were living they think of themselves as exiles but their children learn lagoan and were a mongrel lot anyhowwe mostly look algarvic but you said it weve got kuusaman blood in us too and some kaunian blood besides from the days of the empires province in the northwest of the island pekka snapped her fingers that reminds me she said kuusamo is going to get some new kaunian blood of its own remember the poor fellow from jelgava whose wife wrote to leino when he got thrown in a dungeon i translated the letter for you id better remember he answered so you know what happened to him do you aye pekka nodded the seven princes complained to king donalitu donalitu let him out of the dungeon all right but he kicked him and his wife out of jelgava altogether theyve just come to yliharma hes a tailor i think hell have to get used to doing some new things fernao said with a chuckle kaunians wear trousers algarvic folk wear kilts and unkerlanters and forthwegians wear long tunics but you kuusamans throw on whatever you please we arent kaunian we arent algarvic pekka said and we dont need our clothes to tell us who and what we are fernao reached out and patted her on the bottom i should hope not sometimes its more fun finding out things like that with no clothes at all thats not what i meant and you know it pekka said severely but the corners of her mouth couldnt help curling up if you move to kajaani will you stay in kilts all the time or will you wear leggings and trousers now and again too i dont know fernao answered i hadnt really thought about it well maybe you should if youre talking about turning into a kuusaman pekka said he did quite visibly after a bit to her relief he nodded fourteen hajjaj had been going on about his business and doing his best to forget that a good many highranking algarvian refugees had taken up residence in zuwayza hed always known how much trouble that might cause till it did though hed kept hoping it wouldnt as so many of his hopes had been since unkerlant attacked his kingdom more than five years before that one was wasted without warning a blocky unkerlanter strode into the outer office of the foreign ministry hajjaj heard him arguing with qutuz that wasnt hard everyone along the whole corridor surely heard the unkerlanters shouts in accented zuwayzi getting to his feet the foreign minister went out to the outer office where he found his secretary nose to nose with the irate unkerlanter whats going on here hajjaj asked mildly this gentlemanplainly not the description qutuz had in mind desires to speak with you your excellency i do not desire i demand the unkerlanter said and i demand that you come to the unkerlanter ministry at once at once do you understand me the man snorted like a bull either he was a better actor than any of his countrymen hajjaj had seen minister ansovald included or he was genuinely furious if he was really that angry hajjaj knew what was likeliest to make him so alarm ran through the zuwayzi foreign minister this is too soon for them to have found out he thought much too soon in fact he did his best to sound calmer than he felt a man does not make demands of another kingdoms minister in his own office sir thats what i told him your excellency qutuz said thats just what i told him curse me if it isnt shut up both of you the unkerlanter shouted you old man you can come with me right now or we can have another war right now theres your choice powers below eat you this is an outrage qutuz exclaimed too bad the unkerlanter said he scowled at hajjaj are you coming or not you say no you watch what happens to this pisspot of a kingdom they know hajjaj thought gloomily they must know with a sigh he replied i will come with youunder protest may i dress first to match your custom dont waste the time its inefficient the unkerlanter said get your scrawny old carcass moving thats all very well i am at your service hajjaj said he nodded to qutuz ill see you later i hope i will i hope they let me leave the ministry he took a broadbrimmed hat from the hat rack in the outer office and set it on his head let us go at this season of the year even zuwayzin went out as little as they could in the middle of the day the sun smote down from as close to the zenith as made no difference the palaces thick walls of mud brick shielded against the worst of the heat out in the streets the air might have come from a bake oven hajjajs shadow puddled at his feet as if even it were looking for someplace to hide the unkerlanter ignored the heat he had a carriage waiting outside the driveralso hatless and a bald man to bootsat steaming under that merciless sun hajjaj hoped he wouldnt keel over halfway to the unkerlanter ministry the fellow whod stormed into his office spoke to the driver in their own language then held the carriage door open for hajjajone of the few formal courtesies hed ever had from an unkerlanter by the way the man slammed it shut after getting in behind the zuwayzi foreign minister that courtesy hadnt come easy they got to the ministry unscathed the driver kept right on sitting out in the open you really should let him come inside and cool off hajjaj remarked this weather can kill you know you worry about your business the unkerlanter told him we will tend to ours zuwayza has been saying that very thing to unkerlant for centuries hajjaj said somehow you never seem to listen the fellow escorting him didnt seem willing to listen unkerlanters as hajjaj had said never did listen to their northern neighbors being badly outweighed zuwayzin had to listen to unkerlanters no matter how little they cared to this particular unkerlanter took hajjaj straight to minister ansovald and spoke two words in his own tongue hes here hajjaj was far from fluent in unkerlanter but had no trouble understanding that ansovald glared at hajjaj hajjaj had met the unkerlanter ministers glares before and bore up under this one when he didnt immediately crumple and admit guilt ansovald shouted you treacherous son of a whorein algarvian because hajjaj didnt have enough unkerlanter to carry on diplomacyif such this wasin that language good day your excellency hajjaj said now as always i am delighted to see you too irony was wasted on ansovald like so many of his countrymen he seemed immune to both shame and embarrassment to serve king swemmel he needs to be hajjaj thought but unkerlanter boorishness was far older than the reign of the current king of unkerlant were going to hang all those algarvian bastards ansovald shouted now and when were done with that were liable to hang you too how far will that scrawny neck of yours stretch i dont know what youre talking about hajjaj said liar ansovald said what would have been an ugly truth from another man sounded like a compliment from him youre hiding balastro and a whole raft of other redheads in a stinking little town called harran we want em were going to get em tooor youll be sorry and so will everybody else in this tinpot kingdom even if i were to admit their presence which i do not on what grounds could you want them hajjaj asked conspiracy to violate the treaty of tortusso by annexing rivaroli conspiracy to wage war against forthweg valmiera jelgava sibiu lagoas kuusamo and unkerlant conspiracy to murder kaunians from forthweg ansovald answered those will do for starters we can find plenty more dont you worry about a thing well try em before we hang em so everything looks pretty hajjaj winced he hadnt expected ansovald to come up with such a detailed and damning indictment no doubt a good many of the algarvian refugees were guilty of those things still he said if they had won the war they could charge you with as many enormities as you blame them for now ansovald didnt even waste time denying it all he said was so what the bastards lost you can turn em over to us or we can bring in soldiers to come and get em thats the only choice youve got hajjaj king swemmel isnt playing games here believe you me he isnt the last thing hajjaj wanted was unkerlanter soldiers in zuwayza if they came would they ever leave not likely he thought but he said there is no law between kingdoms governing whether one may make war on another or how to fight such wars maybe there isnt but theres going to be the unkerlanter minister to zuwayza replied where is the justice in hanging a man for breaking a law that was not a law when he did what he did hajjaj asked futter justice ansovald said were not going to let those buggers get away and thats flat you have three days hajjaj give em up or well come get em i cannot guarantee your soldiers reception if you do hajjaj said try and stop em ansovald relished being on top we shall do what we have to do hajjaj said coldly your master will not thank you for starting a war here when he plainly has plans farther west only goes to show you dont know king swemmel ansovald said are we quite through here have you made all your demands hajjaj asked if so i shall take your words to king shazli go on get out ansovald gestured contemptuously biting his lip hajjaj turned and left the ministers chamber the hardfaced young unkerlanter waited outside and escorted him to the carriage in stony silence the carriage he saw had a new driver he didnt remark on it he wanted nothing more than to get away from the unkerlanter ministry back at the palace he hurried to king shazlis private audience chamber he had to wait there for the king was greeting the new minister from sibiu shazli came in rolling his eyes im glad to be out of those clothes he said would you care for tea and wine and cakes your excellency no thank you your majesty hajjaj answered your majesty we have a problem he summed up what ansovald had told him leaving out only the coarse language and the shouts when hed finished shazli frowned do you think he means these threats aye your majesty i fear i do i fear he does i was afraid of that shazli let out a long sad sigh when we took in these algarvians i made up my mind i would not let the kingdom suffer on account of them i still hold to that if swemmel wants them so badly i shall give them to him that took hajjaj by surprise your majesty he exclaimed will you turn over men who helped in our revenge who fought side by side with us for as long as they could where is the loyalty a man must show his friends i am willing to be loyal to my friends in their place the king answered but their place is behind that of my own people i will not go to war with unkerlant to save these algarvians i will not even risk war with unkerlant to protect them i dont think swemmel could fight much of a war to get these redheads hajjaj said from everything weve been able to learn hes shipping soldiers west as fast as he can to drive the gyongyosians out of his kingdom in an aside he added i have warned minister horthy of thisdiscreetly of course he returned to the main topic while the unkerlanters are busy in the west they cant bother us too badly i am sorry your excellency but i dare not take the chance king shazli said the algarvians will be surrendered shazli had rarely overruled hajjaj having it happen now hurt more than all the other times put together i must protest your majesty hajjaj said stiffly im sorry shazli told him in this matter my mind is made up hajjaj took a deep breath that being so you leave me no choice but to offer my resignation hed done that a handful of times in his long tenure it had always persuaded the king to change his mind king shazli sighed you have served this kingdom long and well your excellency without you there might well be no kingdom of zuwayza today but i shall do what i think i must do i hope you will consult with me on my choice of your successor of course your majesty hajjaj bowed his head hed tried hed failed now it was time to go so he tried to tell himself but the blood pounded in his ears he suddenly felt very old very shaky just as hed been a part of zuwayza for so very long so zuwayza was also a part of him had been a part of him its over he told himself its all over colonel lurcanio sat across the table from a young lagoan major who spoke algarvian with such a thick accent he would sooner have conversed with the fellow in classical kaunian he swallowed vowels and case and verb endings as if he were still speaking his own tongue theres some difficulty about your release your excellency the lagoan said thank you so much major simao for informing me of this lurcanio said acid in his voice without your telling me i never should have noticed simao turned almost as red as his hair your attitude colonel is not helpful he said reproachfully pride and annoyance rang in lurcanios voice why should i be helpful i see the men i commanded being freed from this captives camp and i see myself still confined what i fail to see is the reason for it i should like to return to albenga as quickly as possible my county is under unkerlanter occupation and i want to do everything i can to protect the people from king swemmels savages you are speaking of my kingdoms allies simao said more stiffly than ever the more shame to you lurcanio retorted you are most uncooperative the lagoan said lurcanio threw his arms wide i have surrendered i will not go back to war if you turn me loose what more do you want do you ask me to love you there i fear you ask for too much that is not the issue simao said you spoke of your county under unkerlanter occupation my kingdom has a request from valmiera to return you to priekule to answer for what you did there while algarve was the occupying power how thoroughly barbarous lurcanio said using scorn to hide the unease prickling through him the war is over will you blame me for fighting on my kingdoms side major simao shook his head no colonel we have investigated that when you were in the field you fought as a soldier should fight when you were on occupation duty however does the phrase night and fog mean anything to you that unease curdled into outright fear how much did simao know of the quiet vicious war between occupiers and occupied how much of it had been war and how much murder lurcanio didnt precisely know himself he wondered if anyone else did you do not answer my question colonel simao said sharply ive heard the phrase lurcanio said if he denied even that much he was too likely to be proved a liar one heard all sorts of things during the war dont forget i spent four years in priekule i fathered a child there and not i assure you in a rape that may be one reason for the valmierans malice simao shrugged then you object to being returned to priekule of course i object lurcanio said you lagoans and the kuusamans aye and the unkerlantersbeat us in battle you earned the right to dictate to us but the valmierans he made a horrible face or is it that algarve thought she would never have to answer for what she did there simao asked before lurcanio could answer the lagoan went on and of course there were the massacres of kaunians from forthwegand other kaunians from valmiera and jelgavawhen you aimed your sorcery across the strait of valmiera at my island i know nothing of any of that lurcanio said which was a lie he thought he could get away with he really didnt know much about such things he also hadnt gone out of his way to find out better not to ask where groups of people pulled out of gaols were going major simao scribbled something on a leaf of paper i have noted your objection he said you will be notified as to whether it is heeded how lurcanio asked will you drag me out of here and haul me off to valmiera probably the lagoan answered you are dismissed as lurcanio left the makeshift office in the captives camp another worriedlooking algarvian officer went in i wonder what he did during the war lurcanio thought i wonder how much hell have to pay for it we had our revenge on our enemiesand now theyre having theirs on us he mooched around the camp more often than not time hung heavy here even the interview however unpleasant had broken routine he could look up to the sky of his kingdom but more than a palisade separated him and his fellow captives from the rest of algarve outside the camp his countrymen had begun to rebuild here lurcanio shook his head rebuilding would come here last memory and misery reigned here nothing else algarvian soldiers walked as aimlessly as lurcanio did himself for close to six years theyd done everything they could do and what had it got them nothing less than nothing theyd had a thriving kingdom before the war now algarve lay in ruins and all her neighbors despised her so we made the feint from the front and when the unkerlanters bit on it we hit em from behind one scrawny captive was telling another we cleaned em out of that village neat as you please his pal nodded aye thats good those whoresons never did pay enough attention to anything that wasnt right under their noses one of them had two bars under his wound badge the other three they went on hashing over the fights theyd been through as if those battles still meant something as if other algarvian soldiers remained in the field to take advantage of what theyd so painfully learned lurcanio wondered how long the war would stay uppermost in their thoughts he wondered if it would ever be anything but uppermost im lucky he thought i was only in the field for the early campaigns and then at the end in between i had those four civilized years in priekule it wasnt so much that his body had come through unscarred though he was anything but sorry to have escaped the enormous grinding battles in the west a great many men had gone from valmiera to fight in unkerlant and precious few ever came back again but lurcanio hadnt had the war branded on his spirit to the same degree as most of his fellow captives he shrugged an elaborate algarvian shrug i dont think i have anyway hed spent most of his nights in priekule in his own bed or more pleasantly in krastas instead of warring with a stick hed fought his battles against the valmieran irregulars with a pen and i won most of them he thought the kingdom had stayed quiet or quiet enough under algarves heel till the situation in the west and in jelgava grew too desperate to let the occupiers stay for a moment he took pride in that but then he shrugged again what difference did it make no matter how well hed done his job his kingdom had lost the war that mattered the other didnt two days later he was summoned from the ranks of the captives at morning roll call his wasnt the only name the lagoan guard called out about a dozen men most of them officers but with two or three sergeants among them stepped forward major simao came out of the administrative center you men have been ordered remanded to valmieran custody for investigation of murders and other acts of cruelty and barbarism inflicted on the said kingdom during its occupation by algarve simao droned his mumbling nasal lagoan accent making the bureaucratic announcement even harder to follow but lurcanio understood what it was all too likely to mean i protest he said how can we hope to get a fair investigation from the valmierans they want to kill us under form of law how many of them did you kill without bothering with form of law simao said coldly your protest is denied lurcanio hadnt expected much else but the speedand the relishwith which simao rejected his appeal were illuminating hed known the kingdoms allied against his own hated algarvians seeing that hatred in action though showed him how deep it ran as the lagoans marched the captives out of the camp and toward wagons that would lurcanio supposed take them to a leyline caravan depot one of the sergeants said well were futtered royal and proper only question is whether they blaze us or hang us or drop us in the stewpot valmierans dont do that lurcanio said but then he added of course by the look of things they might make an exception for us thats right the sergeant nodded but ill tell you something else sir they can only get me once and i got a lot moren one o those stinking blond bastards good for you lurcanio said algarvian bravado ran deep he hoped he would be able to keep it up himself when he needed it most sure enough the wagon ridewith as many lagoan soldiers as captives a compliment of sortstook them to a small depot the soldiers stood watch over them till an eastbound leyline caravan came up and stopped one of the cars had bars across the windows a lagoan guard favored the captives with a nasty smile like the ones you used for kaunians you killed eh he said in algarvian a comparison lurcanio could have done without after lurcanio and the other captives and most of the guards boarded the caravan car it glided away the bars didnt keep lurcanio from peering avidly out the windows as the caravan drew near the border with valmiera he saw long columns of redheaded kilted men and women and children trudging westward some pushing handcarts some with duffels slung over their shoulders a lucky handful with a horse or a donkey to bear their burdens that algarvianspeaking guard said the valmierans throw you whoresons out of the marquisate of rivaroli no more trouble there no more treason there either algarvians had lived in rivaroli for more than a thousand years even when valmiera annexed the marquisate after the six years war no one had talked of expelling them but a generation and more had gone by since then these were new timeshard times too at a stop by the border the lagoan guards left the caravan car blonds in trousers took their place now you get what is coming to you one of them said proving he too spoke algarvian his laugh was loud and unpleasant go ahead have your joke the irrepressible sergeant said i bet you ran away from the fighting too just like all your pals the valmieran spoke in a low voice to his comrades four of them beat the sergeant bloody while the rest held sticks on the other algarvian captives to make sure they didnt interfere any other funny men the guard asked no one said a word on through valmiera glided the leyline caravan in the early afternoon the landscape started looking familiar to lurcanio before long he saw the famous skyline of priekule i enjoyed myself here aye he thought all the same id sooner have kept the memories krasta paid as little attention to newssheet hawkers as she could when she came to the boulevard of horsemen she came to spend money to get away from her bastard son and to show herself off she had her wig all done up in curls in the style of the glory days of the kaunian empire a lot of valmieran women wore their hair that way these days perhaps to affirm their kaunianity after the algarvian occupation the wig was hot and uncomfortable but her own hair hadnt grown out far enough for her to appear in public without its help betterfar betterdiscomfort than humiliation hawkers who worked the boulevard of horsemen were supposed to be discreet and quiet so as not to disturb the wellheeled women and men who shopped there such rules had gone downhill since the algarvians pulled out though these days the men who waved the sheets on street corners were about as raucous here as anywhere else in priekule redheads coming back for justice one of them yelled as krasta came out of a clothiers during the war the dummies in the window had worn some of the shortest kilts in town these days of course they were all patriotically trousered the vendor thrust a sheet in krastas face its our turn now she started to wave him away in annoyance but then checked herself let me have one she couldnt remember the last time shed bought or even looked at a news sheet and had to ask how much five coppers lady the fellow answered apologetically adding everythings up since the war is it krasta paid as little attention to prices as she could she gave him a small silver coin took the news sheet and her change and sat down on a local leyline caravan bench to read the story it was what the hawker had said it was an account of how a dozen algarvians whod helped rule valmiera for king mezentio were being brought back to priekule to stand before valmieran judges and answer for their brutality and atrocities it is to be hoped the reporter wrote that the vicious brutes will get no more mercy than they gave thats right krasta nodded vigorously she had to turn to an inside page to find out what she really wanted to know the names of the algarvians coming back to priekule those didnt seem to matter to the fellow writing the story as far as he was concerned one algarvian was as goodor rather as badas another at last though the reporter came to the point krasta shook her head when he called an algarvian brigadier a fiend and a known pervert a man who took pleasure in killing shed met the officer in question at several feasts and dances maybe he liked boys but he liked women too hed pinched her behind and rubbed himself against her like a dog in heat what do reporters know she muttered but then she saw the next name the name shed wondered if she would find with the previously mentioned officer is his henchman the vile and lecherous colonel lurcanio who made our capital a place of terror for four long years lurcanio openly boasts of the child he sired on marchioness krasta from whose mansion at the edge of the capital he leaped out like a wolf on honest citizens krasta read that twice then furiously crumpled up the news sheet and flung it in a trash bin powers below eat him she snarled had lurcanio stood before her and not a panel of judges he wouldnt have lasted long shed thought him a gentleman and one of the things a gentleman didnt do was tell he hadnt just toldhed told the news sheets people who knew her of course knew her baby had hair the wrong color some of them had cut her including some whod been at least as cordial to the occupiers as she had but this in the news sheets every tradesman shed ever dealt with would know shed had an algarvians bastard heels clicking on the slates of the sidewalk she hurried down the boulevard of horsemen to the cross street where her carriage waited when she got there she found her new driver reading the news sheet she wished she still had the one who drank to while away the time put down that horrible rag she snapped aye milady the driver said but he carefully folded the sheet so he could go on reading it later shall i take you home now he spoke as if certain of the answer but krasta shook her head no drive me to the central gaol to the central gaol milady the driver sounded as if he couldnt believe his ears you heard me krasta said now get moving she sprang into the carriage slamming the door behind her he took her where she wanted to go if he hadnt she would have fired him on the spot and either engaged a new driver or tried to take the carriage back to the mansion herself she was convinced she could do it drivers certainly werent very bright and they had no trouble so how hard could it be luckily for hershed never driven a carriage in her lifeshe didnt have to find out here you are milady the driver said stopping in front of a fortresslike building not far from the royal palace krasta descended from the carriage and swarmed toward the gaol an invading army of one what do you want asked one of the men at the entrance were they constables soldiers she didnt know and she didnt care i am the marchioness krasta she declared i must see one of the nasty algarvians you have locked up here both the guards bowed neither of them opened the formidably stout door though uh sorry milady said the fellow whod spoken before nobody can do that without the warders permission then fetch the warder here at once krastas voice rose to a shout at once do you hear me if theyd read the news sheet if theyd paid attention to her name they might not have been so willing to do as she said but valmierans were used to yielding to their nobles one of them left he returned a few minutes later with a fellow in a fancier uniform may i help you milady the warder asked i must see colonel lurcanio one of your algarvian captives krasta said as she had before for what purpose the warder asked to ask him how he dares have the nerve to tell so many nasty lying stories about me krasta said that the stories might be nasty but werent lies had entirely slipped out of her memory what was your name again the warder inquired fuming krasta told him marchioness krasta the man repeated oh youre the one who by the way his expression sharpened krasta could tell hed read the days news sheet himself you say these are lies he asked i certainly do say that krasta answered saying it of course didnt mean it had to be true she dimly remembered that distinction the warder didnt note it he bowed to her and said all right you come with me she came the place was grimier and smellier than shed imagined the warder led her to a room with two chairs separated by a fine but strong wire mesh to her annoyance he not only made her leave her handbag outside but also turn out her pockets and put whatever she had in them on a tray im not going to give this algarvian anything except a piece of my mind she said with a shrug the warder said these are the rules against the rules plainly the powers above themselves contended in vain even krasta who was anything but shy about arguing regardless of whether or not she had a case forbore to do so here the warder said you wait someone will bring him krasta waited longer than she cared to staring at the wire mesh made her feel imprisoned herself she drummed her fingers on her trouser leg trying to fight down her annoyance after about a quarter of an hourit seemed much longer to krastatwo guards brought in lurcanio they shoved him toward the chair on the far side of the mesh heres the whoreson one of them said as the other slammed the door instead of sitting down on the hard chair lurcanio bowed to krasta good day milady he said in his musically accented valmieran have you come to gloat or perhaps to throw nuts to the monkey in the cage i could use the nuts they do not feed me very wellwhich considering how you valmierans stuff yourselves is doubly a crime how dare you tell the news sheets you fathered my boy krasta demanded how dare you well did i not lurcanio asked i surely had more chance than anybody else but did valnu or whoever get there at the right time that has nothing to do with anything krasta said suddenly recalling little gainibus unfortunate hair color lurcanio laughed out loud which only infuriated her further how dare you say it lurcanio gave back a serious answer perhaps the most annoying thing he might have done well for one thing it isor it appears to bethe truth what has that got to do with anything krasta yelped very conscious of the difference between what was said and what was and for anotherlurcanio went on as if she hadnt spokeni can still strike a blow of sorts by telling the truth here you valmierans are going to be as hard on me as you know how i doubt that not at all why shouldnt i make things as difficult as i can for you malicious amusement sparked in his catgreen eyes revenge krasta understood she didnt care to have it aimed at her its not gentlemanly she exclaimed i am not in a gentlemanly predicament you stupid little twat lurcanio snapped you were pleasant in bed but you havent the brains the powers above gave a hedgehog i fought a war here in priekule and they intend to murder me under form of law on account of the way i fought it i cannot do much to stop them either now have you got that through your thick skull futter you krasta said shrilly i would tell you to go right ahead my former dear but the mesh is too narrow to make it practical lurcanio replied powers below eat you you put my name in the news sheets krasta said and when have you ever complained about that lurcanio asked futter you krasta said again this time she didnt wait for an answer but flounced out of the visiting chamber when she slammed the door behind her an earthquake might have hit the building the warder who was waiting in the anteroom jumped get me out of this horrible place krasta snarled snatching up her chattels the warder started to say something looked at her and thought better of it he led her back to the entrance he did dare a goodbye then krasta ignored him she stalked back to her driver take me home this instantthis instant do you hear me she said the driver sensibly obeyed without a word bembo threw away his cane and stood up on his own two legs in the middle of his flat actually judging by what his kilt displayed he stood up on about a leg and a half the one that had been broken in eoforwic was still only a little more than half as thick as the other but he did stand and he didnt fall over how about that sweetheart he said to saffa she looked up from her baby who was nursing to clap her hands seeing the baby at her breast never failed to make bembo jealous even though he knew how foolish that was the baby wasnt interested for the same reasons as his thats good she said pretty soon youll be able to run like the wind well bembo looked down at his portly form hed lost a good deal of weight since getting hurt and he was still portly i might be able to run like a slow breeze one of these days he thought that was about as much speed as he had in him he said maybe i will be able to start walking a beat before too long having some money coming in again would be good aye saffa nodded her little boy was falling asleep her nipple slipped out of his mouth she raised the baby to her shoulder to burp him then set her tunic to rights as she patted the babys back she went on you know something i know all kinds of things bembo said what have you got in mind saffa made a face at him i was going to say youre nowhere near as big a bastard as i thought you were before i let you get lucky maybe i ought to keep my mouth shut maybe you should bembo agreed she made another face he laughed you asked for that if you got everything you asked for you wouldnt think that was so cursed funny saffa said hotly her temper would kindle on the instant and then calm down again just as fast even when she was angry she noticed people around her which bembo wouldnt have done when he gnawed on his lower lip instead of giving her a snippy answer she asked whats the matter nothing he said and limped over to a chair he was glad to sit down standing hadnt been easy and walking without a cane made him feel as if hed fall over at every step he took with his bad leg saffa knew a lie when she heard one how many lies had she heard from how many men bembo didnt want to think about that she gave him an exasperated look and said i didnt mean to bite you there i didnt think i had bitten you why do you think i did you dont want to know bembo answered believe me you dont before saffa said anything she eased her son whod fallen asleep down off her shoulder and held him in the crook of her arm then with her free hand she shook a finger at bembo why dont i what do you think i am a baby myself curse it saffa i dont want to think about this stuff myself let alone talk about it with anybody else bembo said what stuff she said if i got everything i asked for bembo shuddered he remembered too well the old kuusaman mages eyes piercing him like swords looking at the memories he concealed from everyoneincluding as best he could from himself i told you you dont want to know and i dont want to talk about it saffa got up from the couch using her free hand to help her rise she went into the flats cramped kitchen bembo listened to her opening cupboards in there when she came back she was carrying a mug of spirits which she set on the wooden arm of bembos chair drink she said then talk bembo picked up the mug willingly enough he rarely needed a second invitation to drink you poured that quick he said youre good at doing things with one hand id better be she answered its like hes attached to me all the time she joggled the baby who never stirred powers above only know what im going to do when he gets too big to carry in one arm though but never mind that she pointed imperiously to the mug he drank do you really want to know he said the spirits werent what made him ask it was much more that he hoped to perform an exorcism or perhaps to lance a festering wound if you really want to know ill tell you saffa leaned forward go on then you know all the things the islanders and the blonds say we did he asked her lip curled im sick of the lies they tell those arent lies bembo said saffas jaw fell he went on as a matter of fact they dont know the half of it and he told her of clearing kaunians out of the villages near gromheort of sending them off in packed leyline caravans to the west and occasionally to the east of forcing them into their guarded districts in gromheort and later in eoforwic and of hauling them out of those districts and loading them into caravans too he told of their desperation of the bribes hed taken and the bribes hed turned down by the time he got done the mug of spirits was finished too hed fallen into the days gone by while he was talking hed hardly paid any attention to saffa through most of that torrent hed been peering back into his time in forthweg not at her now at last he did she was white her face set we really did those things she said in a small voice you really did those things youve hinted before every once in a while but no buts bembo said harshly dont press me about this again or ill make you sorry for it do you hear me im sorry for it already saffa said i dont want to believe it neither do i and i was there bembo said if im lucky by the time im an old man i wont have nightmares about it anymore if im very lucky i mean saffa eyed him as if shed never seen him before you were always a softy bembo how could you do things like that they told me what to do so i did it bembo answered with a shrug but it hadnt been quite that simple and he knew it he remembered evodio whod begged off pulling blonds out of houses and whod regularly drunk himself into a stupor because he couldnt stand what the algarvians were doing in forthweg he said its like a lot of things after a while you dont think about it and it gets easier maybe saffa didnt sound convinced she got to her feet and went back into the kitchen when she returned she had another mug in hand she set this on the little table in front of the sofa saying i could use some spirits myself after that do you want some more while im still up please bembo said if i drink enough maybe ill forget for a while he didnt believe that he wouldnt forget till they laid him on his pyre but his memories might at least get a little blurry around the edges saffa sipped spirits before saying hearing about things like that makes me ashamed to be an algarvian doing things like that but bembos voice trailed away it was better than going farther west and fighting the unkerlanters only after hed spoken did he remember what had happened to the fellow whod sired saffas son the sketch artists face worked she looked down at the baby i suppose so she whispered well it was safer than going to fight the unkerlanters bembo amended better he shrugged again i saw some real war of my own you know when the forthwegians rose up in eoforwic that was a pretty filthy business too the only difference was both sides were blazing then you did what needed doing thats all he thought about oraste whod cursed him for getting wounded and escaping eoforwic before the unkerlanters could overrun it he thought about fat sergeant pesaro whod stayed behind in gromheort when he and oraste got transferred to eoforwic he wondered if either one of them still lived not likely he supposed not after what had happened to the two forthwegian cities and even if they did would the unkerlanters ever let them come home again even less likely he feared saffa said i dont think i know you at all i was always sure what to expect from you youd make your bad jokes youd try to get your hand up under my kilt youd strut and swagger like a rooster in a henyard and every once in a while youd show you were a little smarter than you looked the way you did when you figured out that the kaunians here were dyeing their hair to look like proper algarvians but i never dreamt you hadthatunderneath before captain sasso ordered me west i didnt bembo answered saffa dont you see everybody who comes back alive from the west is going to have stories like mineoh maybe not just like mine but the same kind of stories fighting that war did something horrible to algarve and the whole kingdoms going to be a long time getting over it were going to be a long time getting over everything saffa said what with this new king the unkerlanters have put on the throne in the west were not even one kingdom anymore i know i dont like that either bembo said for powers above only know how long there were all these little kingdoms and principalities and grand duchies and plain duchies and marquisates and baronies and counties and whatnot here instead of a real kingdom of algarve and our neighbors would play them off against each other so we fought amongst ourselves id hate to see that day come again but what can we do about it nothing not a single thing saffa sipped at her spirits she still studied bembo with a waryindeed a frightenedcuriosity hed never seen from her before but since i cant do anything about it i dont see much point to worrying over it either you though do i want to have anything to do with you any more when youvedone all these things bembo pointed to the baby sleeping in her arms if the kids father was here hed give you the same kind of stories i did us constables didnt do clean things but neither did the army and you can take that to the bank would you tell his father what you just told me i hope so saffa said aye you probably would bembo admitted youve got a way of saying whats on your mind he sighed sweetheart i want you to stay you know that saffa nodded of course i do and i know why too she made as if to spread her legs men she added scornfully women bembo said in a different tone but also one old as time they both laughed cautious laughs he went on im not going to lie and say i dont like bedding you if i didnt would i care whether you went or not curse it though saffa its not the only reason would i have chased you so hard when you werent giving me anything if that was all i cared about i dont know would you depends on what you had going on the side i suppose youre making this as hard as you can arent you bembo said saffas answering shrug was unmistakably smug he stuck out his tongue at her powers above you stupid bitch dont you know i really like you oh bembo she crooned you say the sweetest things he grimaced again in a different way he could have put that better but she didnt up and walk out on him either so maybe things werent so bad after all skarnu liked his move to the provinces much better than hed thought he would he stayed busy learning what needed doing in his new marquisate and in setting to rights whatever he could the algarvian occupation had made endless squabbles flare upand some had been smoldering for years the more recent ones were usually straightforward some of the longstanding disputes though proved maddeningly complicated they gave him a certain small sympathy for the collaborationist counts whod preceded him as local lords how am i supposed to know how to rule on a property dispute thats been going on so long everybody who first started quarreling about its been dead for twenty years he asked merkela at breakfast one morning thats how things are here she answered there are quarrels older than that too why havent i seen them he said sipping tea people are still making up their minds about you merkela told him they dont want to stick their heads up too soon and be sorry for it later skarnu grunted hed seen that sort of country caution when hed lived on the farm with merkela he didnt care to have it aimed at him but could understand how it might be to a lot of people in the marquisate people who hadnt heard about him till he came here as local lord what was he just a stranger from priekule he wouldnt have understood that before the war he did now when he remarked on it merkela said oh youll always be that stranger from priekule to a lot of people after a while though theyll know youre honest even if you arent from here and then youll hear from them all right he set down his cup pass me the inside of the news sheet would you people complain about me because im new do they well i complain about the news sheets we get too by the time i see them theyre old news old back in priekule maybe she said nobody else around here sees them any sooner than you do she had a point even if it wasnt one he would have thought of he was used to getting news as soon as it happened he hadnt been able to do that hereabouts during the war but the war had thrown everything out of kilter not being able to do it for the rest of his days depressed him but why should it he wondered merkelas rightno one else in these parts will know more about whats going on than i do his wife passed him the part of the news sheet shed been reading he went through it greedily if he couldnt get the news on time at least he could seize all of it the news sheet offered ha he said so were going to get some revenge from the redheads who ran the occupation just what they deserve too we cant take full revenge from them unless we go through their countryside and start grabbing people and killing them merkela said i wouldnt mind a bit i know skarnu answered the war itself had done that to a good deal of the algarvian countryside but he didnt say so whatever had happened to algarve merkela wouldnt think it was enough skarnu had no love for the algarvians either but he stiffened well well what is it his wife asked one of the redheads theyve hauled in is my nephews father skarnu answered merkela needed a moment to work out who that was but bared her teeth in a fierce grin when she did skarnu nodded aye theyve got their hands on lurcanio sure enough i hope they hang him merkela said what hed have done if he ever got his hands on you we met once you know under flag of truce and he honored that skarnu said merkela waved his words away as being of no account maybe she was right too by that time the valmieran underground had become a power in the land and the algarvians had troubles enough in other places to want to keep things here as quiet as they could he added i really dont think my sister blabbed anything special that had to do with me tartly merkela answered i suppose the next thing youll tell me is that she doesnt have a sandyhaired little bastard too skarnu coughed and reached for the teapot to pour himself another cup he couldnt tell her anything of the sort and they both knew it he sipped his tea and concentrated on reading the news sheet theyre charging him with brutality during the occupation and with sending valmierans off to be sacrificed they will hang him then and a good thing too merkela declared for he did do those things if hed caught you mezentios men would have used your life energy and they would have been glad to do it in fact skarnu doubted that he suspected the redheads would have killed him right away if theyd got hold of him in their shoes that was what he would have done with a dangerous captive and he knew hed proved himself dangerous but he didnt argue with his wife even if she was wrong as to details she was right about the bigger picture she asked do you suppose theyll call you back to the city to testify against him i dont know i hadnt thought of that he read on then clicked his tongue between his teeth in annoyance curse him hes bragging in the news sheet about fathering krastas baby thatll do the family name a lot of good you see merkela said with something like triumph you and valnu had doubts about who did what but the redhead hasnt got any he hasnt got any hes admitting anyhow skarnu said in his place id likely be trying to embarrass us as much as i could i wouldnt be surprised if thats why he claims the baby for his own whatever reasons hes got hes right merkela said since skarnu couldnt very well argue with that he buried his nose in the news sheet again glancing up over the top of it he saw the triumphant look on merkelas face he let out a silent sigh his wife despised his sister and nothing in the world looked like changing that hed hoped at first that time might but thought himself likely to be disappointed there that might eventually matter very muchbut even if it did he failed to see what he could do about it instead of bringing it up and starting an argument he found another story in the news sheet to talk about the last little algarvian army in siaulia has finally surrendered that made merkela raise her eyebrows i didnt even notice she said what took the whoresons so long laughing skarnu wagged a finger at her thats not how a marchioness talks its how i talk merkela said and you didnt answer my question they stayed in the field a long time and caused a lot of trouble skarnu said not a lot of real redheads in the army there of coursemost of the soldiers are natives from the siaulian colonies and they lost their last crystal a while ago so nobody here on derlavai could let them know algarved given up the lagoan general up there let the algarvian brigadier in charge keep his sword i know where id have let him keep itright up his merkelas voice trailed off as she realized that wasnt fitting language for a marchioness either by everything the news sheets said the algarvians fought a clean war up there skarnu said i dont care his wife replied theyre still algarvians to her that was the long and short of it servants cleared away the breakfast dishes skarnu went out to the reception hall good morning your excellency valmiru said the butler bowed low good morning to you valmiru skarnu said whats on the list for today the servitor was doing duty for a majordomo and handling the job well let me see sir valmiru said now taking a list from a tunic pocket and donning spectacles to read it your first appointment is with a certain povilu who accuses one of his neighbors a certain zemglu of complicity with the algarvians another one of those eh skarnu said with a sigh aye your excellency valmiru replied although perhaps not quite of the ordinary sort for zemglu has also lodged a charge of collaboration against povilu oh dear skarnu said one of thosehow many generations have these two families hated each other i dont precisely know sirone of the disadvantages of coming here from the capital valmiru replied i had hoped you might be familiar with the gentlemen from your ah earlier stay in this part of the kingdom no such luck skarnu said are they from over by adutiskis at valmirus nod he nodded too merkelas farm was close to pavilosta i know those people better he sighed again but im everybodys marquis so i have to get to the bottom of it if i can he sat in the seat of judgment in the reception hall and looked out at povilu and zemglu and their supporters povilu was squat and zemglu was tall and skinny theyd each brought not only kinsfolk but by the packed hall all their friends as well the two sides plainly despised each other skarnu wonder if they would riot not if i can help it he thought all right gentlemen i will hear you he said master povilu you may speak first thank you your excellency povilu rumbled he was a man of no breeding but hed obviously practiced his speech for a long time and brought it out well he accused his neighbor of betraying men from the underground to the redheads zemglu tried to shout objections wait skarnu told him youll have your turn at last povilu bowed and said that proves it your excellency skarnu waved to the other peasant now master zemglu say what you will now youll hear truth sir after this buggers lies zemglu said povilu howled skarnu silenced him zemglu went on to accuse his neighbor of having left one daughter behind so he wouldnt have to show skarnu her bastard child that was rape povilu yelled you say so now zemglu retorted and went on with his accusations his followers and those of povilu pushed and shoved at one another enough skarnu shouted hoping they would listen to him eventually they did still at the top of his lungs he went on now youll listen to me povilu and zemglu both leaned forward tense anticipation on their faces skarnu said i doubt either of you has clean hands in this business i dont doubt you were enemies before the algarvians came and that youre trying to use the cursed redheads to score points off each other will you tell me im wrong both peasants loudly denied it skarnu studied their followers those abashed expressions told him hed hit the mark he waited for povilu and zemglu to fall silent againit took a whilethen held up his hand hear my judgment he declared and something close to silence fell into it he said i charge the two of you to live at peace with each other for the next year neither of you to do anythinganything do you hear meby word or deed to trouble the other if you care to pursue these claims at the end of that time you may either to me or to his majesty the king but be warned justice may fall on both of you alike for now go back to your lands and think on what happens when you aim sticks at each other from a distance of a yard still glaring at each other the peasants and their followers filed out of the reception hall skarnu hoped hed bought a year if he hadnt he promised himself both sides in the quarrel would regret it grandmaster pinhiero looked out of the crystal at fernao fernao had made the etheric connection with the head of the lagoan guild of mages himself no kuusaman crystallomancers were in the room with him pekka fortunately understood he sometimes had to talk with his countrymen without anyones overhearing him this thing can be done pinhiero said aye sir it can be done fernao answered i dont doubt it for a moment and it will be done if the gongs are too stubborn to see sense the grandmaster persisted i dont doubt that either fernao said he didnt go into details about just what sort of sorcery might be used gyongyosian mages were probably trying to spy on these emanations so were unkerlanter mages he wouldnt have been surprised if the valmierans and jelgavans were doing their best to listen in as well but if the gongs were looking for evidence that what their captives had seen at becsehely was faked they would be disappointed pinhiero nodded and you know of course the workings of the sorcery you can bring them back to setubal i know the workings fernao agreed he took a deep breath as for the other though sir im not so sure i dont know if ill be coming back to setubal the way things look now i would doubt it he waited for the storm to burst he didnt have to wait long rage filled pinhieros foxy face you got her drawers off so now you love her kingdom better than your own too eh he growled i was afraid this would happen but i thought you had better sense shows what i know doesnt it i have done our kingdom no harm nor would i ever fernao said stiffly but i am allowed to please myself now and again as well is that what you call it the grandmaster said id tell you what i call it though i dont suppose you care to hear youre right siri dont fernao said i will send you what i can by courier i will answer any questions you may have but i dont think ill come back to setubal any time soon ill have to arrange to have my books and instruments shipped here kajaani grandmaster pinhiero said scornfully how well will you love it when the first blizzards roll in its a town with ten months of winter and two months of bad snowshoeing shrugging fernao answered lagoas didnt worry about that when i got sent to the land of the ice people you had to go there pinhiero said but to want to go to kajaani a man would have to be mad its not that bada pleasant little place really fernao said about as much praise as he could find it in himself to give pointedly he added and i am fond of the company id be keeping you must be to think of leaving setubal behind pinhiero spoke with the automatic certainty that his city was and had every right to be the center of the universe not so very long before fernao had known that same certainty the grandmaster went on what do they have in the theaters there do they even have theaters there im sure they do answered fernao who didnt know but he added since i havent gone to the theater since before i left for the austral continent though i wont lose much sleep over it well whatever you saw then in setubal should be coming to kajaani any day now pinhiero said soothing and sarcastic at the same time fernao glared the grandmaster added are you sure she didnt ensorcel you that did it fernao growled just because nobodys ever been daft enough to fall in love with you you old serpent you dont think it can happen to anyone else either i thought you had better sense pinhiero said i thought youd be sitting in my seat one of these years i hoped so in fact me grandmaster fernao said in surprise pinhiero nodded the younger mage shook his head no thanks i like the laboratory too well im not cut out for politics and i dont care to be thats why you have someone like brinco pinhiero said whats a secretary for doing work i dont feel like doing myself is that what youre saying pinhiero nodded thats exactly what im saying my dear young fellow a chap like brinco does the work that needs doing but that you dont care to do that gives me time to go out and chat with people keep myself abreast of whats on their minds if youd sooner spend your odd moments in the laboratory no one would hold it against you very kind of you fernao meant it he knew a grandmaster should be a man like pinhiero a man who enjoyed backslapping and politicking pinhiero had to know it too if he was willing to bend the unwritten rules for a theoretical sorcerer like fernao he badly wanted him back fernao sighed you do tempt me sir but the point is id sooner spend my odd momentsjust about all my momentsin kajaani im going to be blunt with you pinhiero said your kingdom needs what you know it needs every scrap of what you know for you know more about this business than any other lagoan mage he paused frowning you do still reckon yourself a lagoan i trust that hurt fernao didnt try to pretend otherwise he said youd better know that i do or id break this etheric connection and walk away from you sir ive already told you if you want to send a man to me i will tell him and write down for him everything i know lagoas and kuusamo are allies i dont see how the seven could possibly object to that and king vitor would have every right to scream if they did pinhiero still looked unhappy better than nothing he admitted but still less than id like you surely know how the cleanestseeming written instructions for a spell dont help a mage as much as having another mage a knowledgeable fellow take him through the conjuration im sorry im doing the best i can what fernao didnt say was that he feared he wouldnt be allowed to come back to kuusamo if he went to lagoas as grandmaster pinhiero had pointed out he knew too much when the time comes then i will make the necessary arrangements with you pinhiero said sourly i suppose i should congratulate you on finding love i must say though that your timing and your target could have been better as for timing you may possibly be right fernao admitted as for whom i fell in love withfor one thing thats none of your business and for another you couldnt be more wrong if you tried for a year and now i think weve said about everything we have to say to each other grandmaster pinhiero bridled he wasnt used to having fernaohe wasnt used to having anybodyspeak to him that way but he wasnt king swemmel he couldnt punish fernao for speaking his mind especially if fernao no longer cared about advancing through the lagoan sorcerous hierarchy all he could do was glare as he said good day and cut the etheric connection the crystal flared then became no more than a sphere of glass fernao let out another sigh a long heartfelt one as he rose from the chair in front of it nervous sweat ran from his armpits and made the back of his tunic stick to his skin defying the grandmasteressentially declaring he was abandoning allegiance to his kingdomdidnt couldnt come easy when he left the chamber he found the kuusaman crystallomancer outside her nose in a romance im finished he told her in his own language and then wondered how hed meant that he walked up to his room a couple of mosquitoes whined in the stairwell outside the hostel they swarmed in millions so that going out for long was asking to be eaten alive when all the ice and snow melted they made puddles uncountable as they did in spring and summer on the austral continent and oh how the mosquitoes and gnats and flies reveled in those spawning grounds fernao swatted one of the buzzing bugs when it lit on the back of his wrist the otherif there was only one otherdidnt land on him which meant it survived he heard more buzzes in the hall something there bit him he slapped at it but didnt think he got it he was muttering to himself when he went into his chamber pekka sat studying a grimoire there as engrossed as the crystallomancer had been in her book she looked up from it with a smile which faded when she saw how grim fernao looked you didnt have a happy time with your grandmaster did you she said worse than i thought i would fernao answered i told him he could send someone to learn what i know once i get settled in kajaani i think i would be foolish to go back to setubal any time soon for all practical purposes ive walked away from my kingdom pekka put down the sorcerous text without bothering to mark her page you had better be quite sure you want to do that he limped over to her and let his free hand the one without the cane rest on her shoulder she set her hand on top of his im sure he answered it follows everything else thats been on this ley line weve traveled will it be all right truly she asked can you live in kajaani after setubal the companys better he said which made her smile he went on besides once pinhieros man squeezes everything i know about this business out of me the lagoan guild of mages will forget i was ever born you wait and see whether im right you wont do any such thing i should hope not pekka squeezed his hand fernao hoped not too he was betting his happiness on it in the end he said people matter more than kingdoms do the kings who would say different arent the sort of rulers i care to live under he thought of mezentio of swemmel of ekrekek arpad and shook his head we have one more job to doif we must do itand then two of them wont trouble us anymore pekka nodded and one will hold more of derlavai in his sway than any one sovereign ever did before so he will fernao agreed but hell be more afraid of us than we are of him and hell have reason to be too thats true she admitted when this wars finally over spending some quiet years in kajaani will look very good to me fernao said very very good pekka squeezed his hand again fifteen garivalds company stood at attention in the town square of torgavi not far from the albi river the river dividing the part of algarve occupied by unkerlant from the part the kuusamans had overrun lieutenant andelot strode along in front of the soldiers in their rockgray tunics all men who have volunteered for further service in king swemmels army one step forward he commanded about half the soldiers took that step here for once they were genuine volunteers along with the rest of the men who wanted nothing more than to go home garivald stayed where he was andelot dismissed the men who wanted to go on soldiering he dismissed the common soldiers whod chosen to leave the army he talked briefly to one corporal who also wanted to leave then sent him away too that left him alone in the square with garivald at ease sergeant fariulf he said and garivald relaxed from the stiff brace hed been holding andelot eyed him i wish i could talk you into changing your mind sir ive done enough garivald answered ive done more than enough only thing i want is to get back to my farm and get back to my woman obilot would have clouted him in the ear for talking about her like that but she was far far away which was such a big part of what was wrong you cant possibly hope to match a sergeants pay and prospects with some little plot of ground down in the duchy of grelz andelot said maybe not sir garivald said but its my little plot of ground and that was true now whoever had owned that farmhouse before garivald and obilot took it for their own was most unlikely to come back after it the house that had been his ownthe village that had been his ownno longer existed i ought to order you to stay in andelot said youre far and away the best underofficer ive ever had thank you sir garivald said if you gave me an order like that though i probably wouldnt stay the best underofficer you ever had for long youd end up sorrier about that than i would andelot said which was bound to be true but the young officer didnt go on with his threat instead he threw his hands in the air i still wish i could talk you into changing your mind sir i want to go home garivald said stubborn as only an unkerlanter peasant knew how to be curse it you even learned to read and write here in the army andelot exclaimed and i thank you for teaching me sir garivald said i still want to go home all right andelot said all right i could keep you here regardless of what you want i expect you know that he waited for garivald to nod then continued but you did serve me and serve the kingdom well enough to deserve better than that if you hadnt spotted that sorcerously disguised redhead who knows how much mischief would have come to our bridgehead by eoforwic go home then and good luck to you thank you sir garivald said andelot was at bottom a decent fellow which made him unusual among the officers garivald had seenand which put him at a disadvantage when trying to deal with peasant stubbornness ill give you your musteringout papers tomorrow and passage on westbound leyline caravans to whats the name of the closest town to your farm linnich sir garivald answered thank you very much im not at all sure youre welcome andelot told him go on get out of my sight i tell you frankly i wish i had some good reason to change my mind if this regiment had been sent west to fight the gyongyosians but we werent and so you get what you want garivald hurried away algarvians on the streets of torgavi hurried to step aside a couple of bold redheaded womensluttish redheaded women in the reckoning of someone from a grelzer peasant villagemade eyes at him he ignored them he knew they wanted money or food from him and cared nothing about himself hed visited a brothel a couple of times there at least the bargain was open an algarvian man in a filthy threadbare uniform tunic and kilt stared at garivald too and then turned away some surrendered soldiers were starting to come back to their home towns garivald knew he would have a hard time putting his life together once he got back to the farm how much harder would it be for the redheads with their kingdom under unkerlants heel he didnt waste much sympathy on them theyd done their best to conquer his kingdom and to kill him theyd come much too close to managing both too that fellow on the street looked as if the war hadnt ended in his eyes when morning came andelot asked have you by any chance changed your mind no sir garivald replied without hesitation very well here are your orders andelot handed him a folded leaf of paper this includes your travel authorization a westbound caravan leaves from the depot in about an hour good luck to you sergeant thank you very much sir garivald said once more as soon as andelot left he unfolded the orders to make sure they were what the company commander had said he didnt want to get off the caravan car to find that the orders told whoever checked his papers there to arrest him on sight but everything was as it should have been the only mention of his destination was as the place where he was to receive his musteringout bonus he wondered if he really would get the money getting his back pay would have been plenty to satisfy him soldiers with duffel bags slung over their shoulders crowded the depot most of them made way for him the sergeants emblems he wore on the collar tabs of his tunic still carried weight he got a seat without trouble too and no one presumed to take the space next to his he put his own duffel there this wouldnt be such a bad trip nothing to do but look out the window till he got home later than it should have the caravan left the depot so much for efficiency garivald thought unkerlanters spent a lot of time talking about it and not very much practicing it he shrugged resignedly that was nothing he didnt already know looking out the window proved poor sport the landscape was battered and cratered every time the leyline caravan glided through an algarvian town the place was in ruins the redheads had done everything they could to hold back his countrymen they hadnt been able to do enough mile after mile of wreckage and devastation and ruin went by here and there in the countryside algarvians tended to their crops most of the people in the fields were women garivald wondered how many men of fighting age the redheads had left too many if theyve got any at all he thought then he wondered how many men of fighting age his own kingdom had left one of the soldiers in the compartment with him was close to fifty the other looked at most seventeen unkerlant had won a great victory and had paid a great price for a moment he wondered if the price had been too great only for a momentthen he shook his head whatever his kingdom had paid to beat algarve it would have paid more had mezentios men overrun all of unkerlant hed seen how the algarvians had ruled the stretches theyd occupied imagining that kind of rule going on and on year after year across the whole kingdom made him shiver even though the caravan car was stuffy and warm almost hot then he shivered again no matter how brutally the algarvians had ruled in unkerlant more than a few grelzersand he supposed more than a few men from other parts of the kingdom as wellhad chosen to fight on their side and against king swemmel hed had no love for swemmel himself not till the redheads showed him the difference between bad and worse that anyone could have chosen mezentio over swemmel only proved how much better things might have been in his homeland for that matter things were better in algarve than they were in his homeland he wondered why the redheads had tried to conquer unkerlant what did they want with it their farmers were richer than unkerlanter peasants dreamt of being and their townsfolk to his eyes their townsfolk all lived like nobles and rich nobles at that how can they have lived the way they did when we live the way we do he wondered about that too if the redheads managed such prosperity why couldnt his own kingdom unkerlant was far bigger than algarve and had more in the way of natural richeshe knew how many problems the algarvians had had because their dragons ran out of quicksilver but it didnt seem to matter not in the way people lived maybe well live like that too once the war is done we wont have it hanging over us like a thundercloud at harvest time he could hope that might be so he could hope but he had trouble believing it mezentios subjects had lived better than swemmels before the war too of course unkerlant had gone through the twinkings war while garivald was a boy that might have had something to do with it or it might not have tooalgarve after all had fought and lost the six years war garivald shrugged again yawned and gave it up here he knew all too well how little he knew he was a peasant whod had his letters for less than a year who was he to try to figure out why his kingdom had a harder time than the algarvians at doing so many different things he could see it was true why remained beyond him he fell asleep not long after the sun went down by then the leyline caravan had left algarve and gone into forthweg the forthwegians were better off than his own countrymen too but to a lesser degree he didnt know why that was so either and he refused to dwell on it sleep was better after some of the places hed slept during the war a leyline caravan car might have been a fancy hostel when he woke he was in unkerlant once more it wasnt the duchy of grelz but it was his kingdom and it had taken a worse battering than either forthweg or algarve the algarvians had wrecked things coming west then the unkerlanters pushing back toward the east counterattacks from both sides meant war had touched many places not once not twice but three or four times or even more as in algarve most of the people in the fields were women here though great stretches of land seemed to have no one cultivating them what sort of crop would the kingdom have this year would it bring in any crop garivald had plenty of time to wonder he had to change leyline caravans twice and didnt get in to linnich for another day and a half a couple of inspectors met the departing soldiers garivald didnt think much of it someone had to pay the men their musteringout bonuses how long in algarve one of the men asked him since the minute our soldiers got there garivald said proudly uhhuh the fellow said and scribbled a note you have your letters sergeant hed asked other men that question garivald had heard them answer no more proudly still he nodded aye sir i do uhhuh the inspector said again come along with me then he led garivald toward a back room in the depot is this where youll pay me off garivald asked instead of answering the inspector opened the door two more inspectors waited inside and three unhappylooking soldiers one of the inspectors aimed a stick at garivalds face youre under arrest charge is treason of the kingdom the other sergeant tore the brass squares of rank from garivalds collar tabs youre not a sergeant any morejust another traitor well see how you like ten years in the minesor maybe twentyfive hajjaj had never felt so free in his life even before hed gone off to the university at trapani hed had nothing but public service ahead of himin those longago days before the six years war service to unkerlant and service to his own revived kingdom in the years since hed worked hard hed been influential without false modesty he knew hed served zuwayza well and then king shazli had chosen to go his own way not hajjajs now a new more pliant foreign minister served the king hajjaj wished them both well he wasnt used to not worrying about things outside his own household now though affairs of state were passing him by i could get used to that he thought i could get used to it very soon he had wondered if shazli would also order him to give tassi back to iskakis of yanina that hadnt happened it didnt look like happening either propitiating unkerlant was one thing propitiating yanina was something else again something over which not even defeated zuwayza needed to lose much sleep you ought to write your memoirs kolthoum told hajjaj one blazing summer day when they both stayed within the houses thick mudbrick walls to have as little as they could to do with the furnace heat outside you flatter me he told his senior wife ministers from great kingdoms write their memoirs ministers from small kingdoms read them to find out how little other people remember of what they said you dont give yourself enough credit kolthoum said there are more problems than you think hajjaj said what language should i use for instance if i write in zuwayzi no one outside this kingdom will ever see the book if i use algarvian well algarvian is a stench in everyones nostrils except in algarve and people there have more urgent things to worry about than what an old black man who wears no clothes has to say and im so slow composing in classical kaunian the book would probably never get finished i can write it certainlyone has tobut its less natural to me than either of the other tongues i notice you dont mention unkerlanter kolthoum remarked hajjaj answered that with a grunt like anyone else whod grown up back in the days when zuwayza was part of unkerlant hed learned some of the tongue of his kingdoms enormous southern neighbor hed taken patriotic pride in forgetting as much of it as he could since he still spoke a bit but he wouldnt have cared to try to write it and even if he had hardly anyone east of swemmels kingdom understood its tongue but none of that was to the point the point was that he wouldnt have used unkerlanter to save his life kolthoum knew as much too tewfik walked into the chamber where hajjaj and his senior wife were talking with a short stiff bow the ancient majordomo said your excellency you have a visitor minister horthy of gyongyos has come up from bishah to speak with youif youd be so kind as to give him a few minutes he says horthy didnt speak zuwayzi tewfik didnt speak gyongyosianor a lot of classical kaunian either the gyongyosian minister to zuwayza must have had some work to do getting his message across but that was beside the point hajjaj said why would he want to speak to me im in retirement you may leave affairs behind young fellow but affairs will take longer to leave you behind tewfik said that young fellow never failed to amuse hajjaj only to tewfik did he seem young these days the majordomo went on or shall i send him back down to the city no nothat would be frightfully rude hajjajs knees creaked as he got to his feet ill see him in the library let me find a robe or some such thing to throw on so i dont offend him bring him tea and wine and cakeslet him refresh himself while hes waiting for me unlike most zuwayzin hajjaj kept clothes in his house he dealt with too many foreigners to be able to avoid it he threw on a light linen robe and went to the library to greet his guest gyongyos was far enough away for the political implications of kilt or trousers not to matter much when hajjaj entered the library horthy was leafing through a volume of poetry from the days of the kaunian empire he was a big burly man his tawny beard and long hair streaked with gray he closed the book and bowed to hajjaj a pleasure to see you your excellency he said in musically accented classical kaunian may the stars shine upon your spirit er thank you hajjaj replied in the same language the gyongyosians had strange notions about the power of the stars how may i serve you sir horthy shook his head which made him look like a puzzled lion you do not serve me i come to beg the boon of your conversation of your wisdom he sipped at the wine tewfik had given him already you have gone to too much trouble the wine is of grapes not of thedates is that the wordyou would usually use and you have taken the time to garb yourself this is your home your excellency if i come here i understand your continuing your own usages i am also fond of grape wine and the robe is light hajjaj waved to the cushions piled on the carpeted floor sit drink as much as you care to of wine or tea eat of my cakes when you are refreshed i will do for you whatever i can you are generous to a foreigner horthy said hajjaj sat and used pillows to make himself comfortable rather awkwardly horthy imitated him the gyongyosian minister ate several cakes and drank a good deal of wine only after horthy paused did hajjaj ask and now your excellency what brings you up into the hills on such a hot day as host he was the one with the right to choose when to get down to business i wish to speak to you concerning the course of this war and concerning possible endings for it horthy said are you sure i am the man with whom you should be discussing these things hajjaj asked i am retired and have no interest in emerging from retirement my successor would be able to serve you better if you need his help in any official capacity no horthys voice was sharp for one thing my being here is in no way official for another with due respect to your successor you are the man who knows things you honor me beyond my deserts hajjaj said though what he felt was a certain amountperhaps more than a certain amountof vindication no horthy repeated i know why you resigned it does you honor a man should not abandon his friends but should stand by them even in adversity especially in adversity hajjaj shrugged i did what i thought right my king did what he thought right you did what you thought right your king did what he thought expedient horthy said i know which i prefer therefore i come to you the kuusamans have threatened us with some new and titanically destructive sorcery unkerlant masses men against us how may we escape with honor do you believe the threat hajjaj asked ekrekek arpad does not so gyongyos does not horthy replied but there has been so much dreadful magic in this war more would not surprise me i speak unofficially of course of course hajjaj echoed do you knowhave you heardanything that would lead you to believe the kuusamans either lie or speak the truth the gyongyosian minister asked no your excellency whatever this magic may beif in fact it is anything at alli cannot tell you what of unkerlant you already know that you are the last foe still in the field against king swemmel he loves you not he will punish you if he can the time has come that he thinks he can horthys broad heavyfeatured face soured into a frown if he should think that he may find himself surprised so he may hajjaj agreed politely still your excellency if you thought your own kingdoms victory certain you would not have come here to me would you he wondered if hed phrased that carefully enough gyongyosians were not only touchywhich bothered hajjaj not at all coming as he did from a touchy folk himselfbut touchy in ways zuwayzin found odd and unpredictable horthy muttered something in his own language down deep in his chest then he returned to classical kaunian there is i fear too much truth in what you say can gyongyos rely on your kingdoms good offices in negotiating a peace with our enemies you understand sir that i cannot answer in any official sense hajjaj said were i still part of his majestys government i would do everything i could toward that end of that you may be certain you might have done better to consult with my successor who can speak for king shazli i cannot your successor would have asked me about what gyongyos proposes to yield horthy growled gyongyos does not propose to yield anything my dear sir hajjaj said if you will yield nothing how do you propose to negotiate a peace we might discover that we had previously misunderstood treaties pertaining to borders and such the gyongyosian minister replied but we are we have always been a warrior race warriors do not yield i see hajjaj said slowly and part of him did every man every kingdom needed to salve pride now and again the gongs found odd ways to do it though professing a misunderstanding was one way not to have to admit they were beaten whether it would do to end the derlavaian war would kuusamo and lagoas and unkerlantespecially unkerlantunderstand your meaning your own excellent officials might help to make them understand horthy said i see hajjaj said again well obviously i can promise nothing but you are welcome to tell anyone still in the government that i believe finding a ley line to peace is desirable anyone who wishes may ask me on this score horthy inclined his leonine head i thank you your excellency this is the reassurance i have been seeking he left not much later as the sun sank in the west and the days scorching heat at last began to ease hajjajs crystallomancer told him general ikhshid wished to speak with him perhaps because they were much of an age ikhshid had stayed in closer touch with hajjaj than had anyone else down in bishah now the whitehaired officer peered out of the crystal at him and said it wont work what wont hajjaj inquired horthys scheme ikhshid replied it wont fly the gongs arent going to be able to get away with saying sorry it was all a mistake theyre going to have to say youve beaten us we give up and if they wont hajjaj said ikhshids face was plump and most of the time jolly now he looked thoroughly grim if they wont my best guess is theyre going to be very very sorry because ceorl was a war captive hed expected to be treated worse than the unkerlanters who also had to labor in the cinnabar mines of the mamming hills he didnt need long to realize hed made a mistake there the guards in the mines and the barracks treated all their victimsunkerlanters forthwegians algarvians kaunians gyongyosians zuwayzinthe same way badly they were all small eminently replaceable parts to be used till used up and then discarded im going to die here and die pretty soon unless i do something about it the ruffian thought as he queued up for supper he had a mess tin not much different from the one hed carried in plegmunds brigade the only real difference was that hed eaten pretty well as a soldier the unkerlanters fed the men in the mines horrible slop he counted himself lucky when he found bits of turnip in the stew as often as not what he got were nettle leaves he could have done more work with better food but swemmels men didnt seem to care about that and why should they have they had plenty of people to take his place behind him an algarvian said im too bloody worn to eat he wont last long ceorl thought men who gave up who didnt shovel every bit of food they could into themselves no matter how vile it was quickly turned up their toes and died sooner or later ceorl was convinced everyone in the mines would die the unkerlanters had set up the system with extermination in mind but he wouldnt give them the satisfaction of making it easy the queue snaked forward ceorl thrust his tin toward the cooks behind their vats of stew they were also captives they had it soft as far as anyone here did at the very least they were unlikely to starve to death theyd probably had to sell their soulsand for all ceorl knew their bodies tooto get where they were he didnt care he wanted the same chance fill it up he said a phrase similar in unkerlanter and forthwegian and the cook did digging his ladle deep down into the big pot to give ceorl the best of what there was ceorl hadnt been here long but hed already got a name for himself as a man who wouldnt tamely yield up his life the luckless algarvian behind him got mostly water in his mess tin he didnt even complain he just went off to find a spot where he could spoon it up he would probably leave it unfinished too someone else would get what he left before long he would leave feet first in the refectory sudaku was holding a space for ceorl thanks the ruffian said and sat down beside the blond from valmiera sudaku had a good thick bowl of stew too people knew he was ceorls righthand man another happy day eh sudaku said bugger happy we got through it ceorl shoveled stew into himself the same way hed shoveled ore for so long itll be better tomorrow he went on the supervisor whos on then doesnt know anything powers above he doesnt even suspect anything we wont have to work so hard quota sudaku said doubtfully scorn filled ceorls laugh the unkerlanters talk about efficiency but they fornicating lie they dont keep quota either i know they lie about that something to what you say sudaku admitted ceorl wanted to laugh again this time at the blond sudaku was a trusting soul an honest man or something close to itnot far from a fool the way ceorl reckoned things but he was strong and brave and hed had his eyes opened for him in the desperate fighting of the last few months of the war anyone who came through that without learning from it would have deserved whatever happened to him come on ceorl said lets get back to the barracks weve got to keep watch on things or else were in trouble right sudaku didnt doubt that nobody in his right mind could doubt it only the strong had any hope of lasting here if you didnt show your strength you often couldnt keep it bunks in the barracks were in tiers that went up four high in the warmth of the brief southern summer where a man slept didnt matter so much but ceorl had been through unkerlanter winters he and the gang from plegmunds brigade he headed had taken bunks close by the coal stove in the middle of the hall theyd taken them and defended them with fists and boots and improvised knives when they settled down for the night now nobody troubled them on the other side of the stove a group of algarvian captives had carved out a similar niche for themselves their leader was a burly fellow whose faded tattered uniform didnt quite match those of the soldiers alongside whom ceorl had fought that didnt mean the ruffian was ignorant of what sort of uniform it was ha oraste he called throw anybody in gaol lately futter you ceorl the redhead replied without rancor youd have done better if somebody had jugged you sooner or later theydve let you out but lets see you get out of this ceorl gave back an obscene gesture oraste laughed at him though the algarvians eyes never lit up like any redhead oraste was indeed here for good even if he escaped the mines hed be hunted down in short order for he stood out among the unkerlanters like a crow among sea gulls because he couldnt get away he naturally thought nobody else could youre not as smart as you think you are ceorl thought thinking themselves more clever than they really wereand than anybody else washad always been the algarvians besetting vice but ceorl looked like anybody else around these parts forthwegian wasnt impossibly far removed from unkerlanter if he managed to escape he thought he could stay free a couple of unkerlanter thieves swaggered into the barracks each with some of his followers in train they waved to ceorl and to oraste as equals their gangs held the other bunks close by the stove theyd made as much of their captivity as they could even the guards treated them with respect they and their henchmen took their places beyond back toward the walls came algarvian captives and unkerlanters who didnt belong to any of the principal gangs in the barracks they were the luckless ones the spiritless ones who would soon lose the battle for survival and as they died off new men just as lost would pour in to take their places ceorl knew a sort of abstract admiration for king swemmel he made sure he was never short of captives between supper and lightsout men gossiped told storiestold liesabout what theyd done in the war except for who was talking about whom and in which language those of algarvians and unkerlanters sounded very much alike and nobody cared whod been on which sidehere in the mamming hills they were all losers gambled and passed around jars of clandestinely brewed spirits some of them especially those beginning to fail fell asleep as soon as they could and stayed asleep in spite of all the noise the others made ceorl had learned better than to roll dice with oraste he couldnt prove the redheads dice were crooked but hed lost to him too often to believe it nothing but chance he didnt say anything as oraste started fleecing a young unkerlanter too new here to know better than to accept such invitations ceorl didnt care what happened to the unkerlanter and he was curious about how oraste cheated so smoothly he didnt find out that night any more than he had when the redhead had taken his money after a while even though the sky remained palewhich it would do through most of the nighta guard came in and shouted lights out that meant shuttering the windows too so that something approaching real darkness filled the barracks ceorl lay down on his bottom bunk which boasted one of the thickest mattresses in the building hed made himself as comfortable as well off as one of swemmels captives could be things could have been a lot worsehe even knew that he also knew it wasnt remotely close to being enough he would break out if he ever found the chance as usual he slept hard the next thing he knew the guards were screaming at the captives to get out of their bunks and line up for roll call routine there hadnt changed since the captives camp outside of trapani ceorl took his place waited to sing out when his name was called and wondered if the unkerlanters would make a hash of the count which they did about one day in three efficiency he thought and laughed a mocking laugh to complicate things a leyline caravan full of new captives chose that moment to arrive in the barracks the guards bringing in the new fish and those trying to keep track of the ones already there started screaming at one another each group blaming the other for its troubles ceorl spent his time eyeing the newcomers most of them looked to be unkerlanter soldiersor rather former unkerlanter soldiers no swemmel wasnt shy about jugging his own people any more than hed been shy about murdering his own people when the algarvians started killing kaunians swemmel wanted results and he got them no one cared about roll call for a while the captives just stood there had it been winter they would have stood there till they froze nobody dared ask permission to go to breakfast eating before roll call and the count were done was unimaginable in fact they didnt have breakfast at all the delay just meant they went straight to the mines if they had nothing in their bellies too bad ceorl shoveled cinnabar ore into a handbarrow when it was full another captive lugged it away shoveling wasnt so bad as chipping cinnabar out of the vein with picks and crowbars it also wasnt so bad as working in the refinery where quicksilver was extracted from some of the cinnabar despite sorcery quicksilver fumes killed the men who worked there long before their time before too long some of the new fish started coming down into the mine they would have needed a while to get processed to have their names recorded and to get assigned to a barracks and a work gang that was efficiency too at least as the unkerlanters understood it to ceorl it often seemed like wheels spinning uselessly on an iceslick road but swemmels men had won the war and didnt have to worry about what he thought one of the new men spoke with such a strong grelzer accent ceorl could hardly understand him powers below eat you the ruffian said doing his best to make his forthwegian sound like unkerlanter i spent a good part of the war hunting whoresons like you the unkerlanter followed him i was in the woods west of herborn he answered a lot of the bastards who hunted me didnt go home again is that so ceorl threw back his head and laughed i hunted through those woods and you stinking irregulars paid for it when i did murderer the unkerlanter said bushwhacker ceorl retorted he laughed some more fat fornicating lot of good our fight back then did either one of us eh were both buggered now he had to repeat himself to get the unkerlanter to understand that when the fellow finally did he nodded fair enough we both lost this war no matter what happened to our kingdoms he stuck out his hand im fariulf well futter you fariulf ceorl clasped it im ceorl futter you too ceorl fariulf said squeezing ceorl squeezed back the trial of strength proved as near a draw as made no difference work a guard shouted sure enough no matter which of them was the stronger theyd both lost the war everything in yliharma was different from anything talsu had ever known the air itself tasted wrong cool and damp and salty even on the brightest days the blue of the sky had a misty feel to it and even in summer fog and rain could come without warning and stay for a couple of days that would have been unimaginable in skrunda the kuusamans themselves seemed at least as strange to him as their weather did even gailisa was taller than most of their men children eyed both talsu and his wife in the streets not being used to fair blueeyed blonds adults did the same thing but less blatantly to talsu little swarthy slanteyed folk with coarse black hair were the strange ones but this was their kingdom not his it wasnt even a kingdom or not exactlysomehow the seven princes held it together the kuusamans drank ale not wine they cooked with butter not olive oil and even put it on their bread they wore all sorts of odd clothes which to a tailor seemed even more peculiar their language sounded funny in his ears its grammar which he and gailisa tried to learn in thriceweekly lessons struck him as stranger yet and its vocabulary except for a few words plainly borrowed from classical kaunian was nothing like that of jelgavan but none of that marked the biggest difference between his homeland and this place to which he and gailisa had been exiled he needed a while to realize what that big difference was it came to him one afternoon as he was walking back to the flat the kuusamans had given gailisa and him a bigger finer flat than the one his whole family had used back in his home town i know he said after giving his wife a kiss ive got it thats nice gailisa said agreeably what have you got now i know why up in balvi the kuusaman minister told us living in jelgava was like living in a dungeon talsu answered everybody always went around watching what he said all the time she nodded well of course something bad would happen to you if you didnt or sometimes even if you did her mouth twisted we know all about that dont we aye we do talsu agreed and thats the difference we know all about it the kuusamans dont they say whatever they please whenever they feel like it and they dont have to look over their shoulders while theyre doing it theyre free we werent we arent we jelgavans and we dont even know it some do gailisa answered otherwise why would the dungeons be so full thats not funny talsu said i didnt mean it for a joke she told him how could i after everything that happened to you having had no ready comeback for that he changed the subject what smells good a reindeer roast gailisa replied talsu chuckled she rolled her eyes there might have been a few reindeer in jelgavan zoological parks but surely nowhere else in the kingdom she went on all the butcher shops here have as much reindeer meat as beef or mutton its cheaper too im not complaining talsu said youve picked it up before and it tastes fine he kissed her again to show her he meant itand he did he went on i wish the language were easier i cant get started in business till i can talk to my customers at least a little i know gailisa said when i buy things i either read what i want off the signsand i know i make a mess of that too because some of the characters dont sound the same here as they do in jelgavanor else i just point it makes me feel stupid but what else can i do nothing else i can think of talsu said i do the same thing the next day though talsu and gailisa found a parcel in front of their door when they came back from their language lesson unwrapping it he pulled out a jelgavankuusaman phrasebook it looked to have been made for kuusaman travelers in jelgava but it would help the other way round too gailisa unfolded a note stuck in the little book oh she said its in classical kaunian she knew next to none of the old language so she handed talsu the note his own classical kaunian was far from perfect too but he did his best i hope this book will help you he read it helped me when i visited your kingdom i am pekka wife to leino whom you helped talsu i am glad i could help you leave your kingdom my husband was killed in the fighting i was pleased to do anything i could for his friends hes the one i wrote to gailisa said i know talsu answered i didnt know hed got killed though she must have been the one who helped me get out of the dungeon too then he blinked its somethingthat they paid attention to a woman i mean maybe shes important in her own right gailisa said she must be in fact the kuusamans seem to let their women do just about anything their men can i like that if you want to know the truth im not sure its natural talsu said why not his wife demanded its what you were talking about before isnt it its freedom thats different talsu said how gailisa asked in his own mind talsu knew how the kind of freedom he had in mind was no more than the freedom to say what you wanted without fear of ending up in a dungeon because the wrong person heard you surely that was different from the freedom to do what you wanted regardless of whether you were a man or a woman surely it was and yet for the life of him he found no way to put the difference into words it just is he said at last gailisa made a face at him he tickled her she squealed they werent equal there she was ticklish and he wasnt he took unfair advantage of it after the next language lesson a couple of days later the instructora woman named ryti whose standing went some distance toward proving gailisas pointasked talsu and his wife to stay while the other students were leaving in slow careful jelgavan she said we have found a tailor who is looking for an assistant and who speaks classical kaunian would you like to work for him id like to work for anyone talsu answered in his own tongue id like to work for myself most but i know i dont speak enough kuusaman yet i couldnt understand the people whod be my customers how much will this fellow pay gailisa asked the practical question when ryti answered she did so of course in terms of kuusaman money that still didnt feel quite real to talsu what would it be in jelgavan coins he asked ryti thought for a moment then told him he blinked you must be wrong he said thats much too much after a little more thought the language instructor shook her head no i do not believe so one of ours is about three and a half of yours is it not so it was so to talsu kuusaman silver coins were big and heavy but not impossibly big and heavy things cost more in yliharma than they had back in skrunda but not a great deal more the money this fellow offered a tailors assistant would have made an independent jelgavan tailor prosperous how much does this man make for himself talsu asked i cannot answer that ryti answered but he does make enough to be able to pay you what he says he will we have looked into that we do not want people going into bad situations tell me his name tell me where his shop is talsu said tell me when i need to be there and ill be there at that time tomorrow good the instructor smiled i told him i thought you were diligent i see i am right his name is valamo his shop is near the center of town not far from the hostel called the principality herelet me draw you a map she did quickly and competently where are you staying now she asked when talsu told her she nodded i thought you dwelt in that district there is a leyline route that will take you close to the shop valamo says he would like you to be there by an hour after sunrise this far south the sun rose very early in the summertime one more thing talsu was getting used to even so he nodded i will and he did though he missed the caravan stop closest to the tailors shop and had to get out at the next one and then go running back up the street people stared at him he didnt care he didnt want to be late not on his first day greetings you must be talsu valamo said in classical kaunian when he came in out of breath and sweaty the tailor wasnt young past that talsu had trouble guessing kuusamans seemed to show their years less than his own countrymen did aye sir talsu answered in the same tongue thank you for taking me in i shall work hard for you i promise it good glad to hear it despite a kuusaman accent valamo was more fluent in the old language than talsu was himself talsu found that distressing as he had with other kuusamans who knew more classical kaunian than he did valamo said come here behind the counter and i will show you what wants doing the first jobs he gave talsu were simple repairs talsu handled some of them with no more than needle and thread others with the craft tricks that were sorcery but hardly seemed like it before long he was done here you are he told valamo thank you his new boss was polite enough but inspected the work with a knowing eye before nodding good you have some notion of what you are doing one can never tell beforehand you understand i speak without intending to cause offense of course talsu said what else have you for me to do i have the pieces of an outfit here valamo said join them together if you would be so kind of course talsu said again he examined the pieces got needle and thread to sew small parts of them together and then used the sorcery an algarvian mage had taught his father to finish the joining all told it took about an hour he brought valamo the finished garment this time the kuusaman tailor gave him a very odd look how did you get done so fast he asked did you use one of those basting spells that will not last no talsu answered judge for yourself valamo poked and prodded at the tunic and leggings he examined the stitchery not only with his bare eyes but with a jewelers loupe and with spells at last he said this looks to be good work but how did you do it so well so quickly talsu explained finishing i shall be glad to teach you the charm you have earned your pay by the powers above valamo exclaimed you have more than earned it please do teach me that spell before long i am sure you will use it in a place of your own a place of my own talsu echoed dreamily could he ever find such a thing in this foreign land slowly he nodded to himself maybe i can ealstan looked at his father aye of course ill help you with this business he said i have my doubts you really need any help from me though well that depends hestan answered two can often do a job quicker than one i suppose i could manage it myself but i know for a fact it would take me longer and the town officials have said theyd pay for an assistant im hoping you recall that nine comes after eight and not the other way round i still have some notion of how to cast accounts ealstan agreed i made a living at it in eoforwic you taught me well fatheri knew more than most of the men whod been bookkeepers for years that teased out one of his fathers rare slow smiles you make me proud of myself hestan said and thats a dangerous thing in any man why is being proud of what youre good at dangerous ealstan asked most ways eoforwic makes gromheort look like a provincial town and it is his father broke in but you would have made any of the bookkeepers there ashamed to call himself by the name ealstan went on as if the older man hadnt spoken you could have gone there and got rich father it makes me wonder why you stayed here dont forget up till about the time i was your age gromheort was in algarve and eoforwic was in unkerlant hestan replied forthweg didnt get its freedom back till after the six years war and then not much later i married your mother and settled down and i never truly wanted to be what youd call rich enough is enough too much he made a face if you go after money for the sake of money instead of for the sake of being comfortable it has youyou dont have it any more im not so sure i believe that ealstan said hestan smiled again at least with half his mouth im sure i didnt not at your age and you asked why being proud of what youre good at is dangerous ill tell you why it can make you proud of yourself in general and it can make you think youre good at things youre not ealstan considered then nodded if that wasnt his careful cautious father he didnt know what was using a cane ealstan got to his feet well i already told you if you want me to come along i will and if our city fathers want to know where every last copper in the rebuilding of gromheort is going ill help you tell them good hestan said truth to tell i dont think the city fathers care so much baron brorda never did back before the war and things havent changed a great deal since but the unkerlanters want to know what everything is worth efficiency you know in a different tone of voice that would have been praise as ealstan and his father walked toward the door saxburh toddled down the hall toward them dada she said she called ealstan that with much more conviction these days than shed shown when she first came to gromheort he picked her up gave her a kiss and then jerked his head back in a hurry so she couldnt grab a couple of handfuls of beard and yank she looked over at hestan she had a name for him too now pop hello sweetheart ealstans father kissed her too this time hestans smile was broad and rather sappy he took to being a grandfather with great relish when vanai came around the corner ealstan was glad enough to put saxburh down handling her and the cane was awkward and her weight put extra strain on his bad leg mama saxburh squealed and dashed for vanai as fast as her legs would take her as far as the baby was concerned vanai was the center of the universe and everyone and everything elseealstan includedonly details out and about vanai asked as she bent to scoop up saxburh bookkeeping ealstan answered ah she said good we can use the money your parents are wonderfully generous but she didnt know what to make of generous parentsor of any parents come to that ealstan didnt care to think about what being raised by brivibas would have been like hestan switched to classical kaunian you make it sound as if you were a burden how long will it be before you understand that is not so you are very kind sir vanai replied in the same language which meant she didnt believe him for a moment ealstans father understood the meaning behind the meaning too he let out a slightly exasperated snort come on son he said maybe you can talk some sense into her when we get home oh i doubt it ealstan answered after all she married me so how much sense is she likely to have now vanai snorted a point hestan said a distinct point that speaks well for your sense but not for hers although ealstan laughed at that vanai didnt how can you say such a thing she demanded if he wasnt mad to marry a kaunian in the middle of the war what would you call madness i knew what i was doing ealstan insisted you can argue about that later too his father said come on gromheort still looked like a city that had undergone a siege and a sack streets were largely free of rubble but blocks had houses missing and practically every house still standing had a chunk bitten out of it people on the street were still thinner than they should have been too though not so thin as when ealstan fought his way into the city some of the men werent undernourished at all unkerlanter soldiers doing constables duty as algarvian soldiers had before them when do we get to be our own kingdom again ealstan asked after walking past a couple of them things could be worse his father answered as i told you back at the house when i grew up we werent our own kingdom swemmel could have annexed us instead of giving us a puppet king like beornwulf i feared he would pendas still my king ealstan said but he pitched his voice so no one but hestan could hear him penda was no great bargain either hestan said also softly he led us into a losing war remember and more than five years of occupation but he was ours ealstan said hestans laugh held both amusement and pain spoken like a forthwegian son a labor gang trudged past its men carrying shouldered shovels and picks and crowbars as if they were sticks they had reason to walk like soldiers most of them were algarvians in tattered uniforms the men herding them along had smooth faces and wore rockgray tunics which meant they came from unkerlant ealstan eyed the few forthwegians in the labor gang i keep wondering if ill see sidroc one of these days he said his fathers face hardened i hope not i hope hes dead if he happens not to be dead and i do see him ill do my best to make sure he gets that way each word might have been carved from stone ealstan needed a heartbeat to remember why his father sounded as he did hed already fled to eoforwic himself when sidroc killed leofsig he knew it had happened but it didnt seem real to him his memories of his cousin went back further to school days and squabbles no more serious than those between a couple of puppies hestan though had watched leofsig die recalling that ealstan understood every bit of his fathers fury the gang went by on the sidewalk coming toward ealstan and his father was hestans brother hengist he saw the two of them and deliberately turned away ealstans father muttered something under his breath him too ealstan asked in dismayhe hadnt seen or looked for uncle hengist since returning to gromheort him too hestan said gravely when he finally found out from dear sidroc some of the reasons why youd run away he tried to turn me in to the algarvians powers below eat him ealstan exclaimed and then tried to turn you in to the redheads his father chuckled a noise full of cynicism one thing my dear unloving brother forgot was how much the algarvians enjoy taking bribes i paid my way out of it the same as i paid mezentios men to look the other way when leofsig broke out of their captives camp and came home saving my own neck cost me less because i only had to pay off a couple of constables still its the thought that counts eh the thought that counts ealstan echoed he wanted you dead his father nodded after a couple of angry steps ealstan said you ought to denounce him to the unkerlanters that would pay him back in his own coin first you talk like a forthwegian and then you talk like a bookkeeper hestan said anyone would think you were my own son he stooped picked up a quarter of a brick and tossed it up and down up and down dont think i havent thought about it i remember everything he did to me and everything sidroc did to the whole family and i want vengeance so much i can taste it but then i remember hes my brother too in spite of everything i dont need revenge that badly id take it ealstans voice was fierce and hot for my sake let it go his father said if hengist ever causes us more trouble then aye go ahead but i dont think he will he knows we could tell the unkerlanters about sidroc that would make hengist a traitor too if i rightly read some of these new laws king beornwulf has put forth hows your leg holding up not bad ealstan answered he didnt push his father any more about sidroc or uncle hengist hestan wouldnt have changed the subject like that unless he didnt want to talk about them at all a couple of minutes later hestan said here we are if i remember rightly the algarvians used this place for one of their field hospitals the unkerlanters did try not to toss eggs at those on purpose which is probably why its still standing ealstan recognized a couple of the men waiting for them inside the red brick building the place kept the smell of a field hospital even now pus and ordure warring with strong soap and the tingling scents of various decoctions it must have soaked into the bricks one of the men he didnt know spoke to hestan so this is your boy eh chip off the old block if hes as good with numbers as you are or even half as good well be well served he manages just fine hestan answered he introduced ealstan to the men saying if it werent for this crowd a lot less of gromheort would be standing today pleased to meet you all ealstan said i spent a good deal of the time outside of town trying to knock things flat boy does a good job at everything he sets his hand to doesnt he hestan said several of the powerful men in gromheort laughed lets see what the two of you can do when you set a hand to our books here said the one whod spoken beforehis name was osferth he pointed to the two ledgers which sat side by side on a table at the back of the hall got to keep king swemmels inspectors happy you know if such a thing is possible ealstans father sat down in front of one ealstan himself in front of the other he sighed with relief as the weight came off his wounded leg the two bookkeepers bent over the ledgers and got to work as far as colonel lurcanio could tell the valmierans didnt know much about interrogation and were doing their level best to forget everything they could about what had happened to their kingdom while the algarvians occupied it the officer posturing at him now was a case in point no lurcanio said with such patience as he could muster i did not rape marchioness krasta i had no need to rape her she gave herself to me of her own free will suppose i tell you the marchioness herself has given you the lie the officer thundered as if trying to impress a panel of judges suppose you do lurcanio said mildly i would sayi do sayshe is lying and why should we prefer your word to hers the valmieran demanded you have more to gain by lying than she does if you care about the truth there you might really try to find it lurcanio said you could ask viscount valnu what he knows for instance as hed hoped it would that knocked the interrogator back on his heels valnu was a hero of the underground so his word carried weight and lurcanios guess was that he unlike krasta wouldnt lie for the fun of it also interrogating someone else meant the algarvians might not try to question lurcanio himself under torture or under sorcery he hadnt raped krasta but they might find plenty of other things for which to put a rope around his neck the officer said viscount valnu cannot know the truth indeed lurcanio agreed only krasta and i can know the truth but valnu will know what krasta said to him about what we did and i have no doubt she said a great deal getting her to stop talking has always been much harder than getting her to start when will you give over your slanders of the decent citizens of valmiera the officer demanded indignantly for one thing truth is always a defense against a charge of slander replied lurcanio who feared other charges awaited against which he had no defense but he intended to make his captors squirm as long as he could and so went on as for dear krasta considering some of the things we did i am not altogether sure she is one of your precious decent citizens of valmiera still i will tell you she enjoyed them all whether decent or not how dare you say such things the valmieran officer gabbled lurcanio hid a smile he didnt play by the rules the victors thought theyd set up he didnt act afraid and he wasnt apologetic that confused the blonds as long as they were confused as long as they had trouble deciding what to do aboutand tohim he wasnt too bad off if they did decide how dare she say such things about me he returned sounding as indignant as he could i at least am telling the truth which she certainly is not you were her lover at the same time as you were trying to hunt down and kill her brother the illustrious marquis skarnu the officer said as if hed scored a point well what if i was lurcanio answered that may have been in poor taste but you will have precious few men left in a kingdom if you set about killing everyone guilty of poor taste and skarnu was in arms against my kingdom as he himself would be the first to tell you he was in fact in arms against my kingdom after king gainibu surrendered what do you people do to algarvians captured in arms against your occupying armies nothing pretty and you know it as well as i that has nothing to do with what you tried to do to skarnu the valmieran said of course it does you foolish little man lurcanio said if you are too dense to see it i hope they take you away and give me an interrogator with the sense to understand plain speech in his own language that was the last thing he wanted but the officer didnt need to know it if you insult me here it will only go harder for you the blond warned flushing with anger ah splendid lurcanio gave him a seated bow i thank you for admitting that what i did and did not do during the late war has in fact nothing to do with what will happen to me i said nothing of the sort the valmieran turned redder still i beg your pardon lurcanio bobbed his head once more that was what it sounded like to me guards the officer said and several valmieran soldiers took one step forward from the places against the wall where theyd stood the interrogator pointed to lurcanio back to his cell with this one hes not ready to tell the truth yet a valmieran sergeant pointed his stick at lurcanios belly get moving he said him lurcanio obeyed without backtalk and without hesitation a confused or frightened ordinary soldier was liable to get rid of his confusion and fear by blazing games that tied the earnest and rather stupid interrogator in knots would be useless or worse against a man for whom simple brutality solved so many problems we thought simple brutality could solve the problem of the underground lurcanio thought as he marched along in front of the guards were we any more clever than a simple sergeant valmieran captives snarled curses at him when he went past their cells he strode by as if they didnt exist they threw things less often then they werent supposed to have anything to throw but he knew those rules could bend when authorities wanted something unfortunate but also unofficial to happen to a captive today he reached his own cell unscathed the door slammed behind him a bar outside the cell thudded down the sergeant muttered a charm to keep anyone from magically tampering with the bar lurcanio wished he were a mage he shrugged had he been he would have gone to a more sorcerously secure prison than this one as cells went he supposed his wasnt so bad it was certainly better than the ones his own folk had given valmieran captives during the war his cot was severely plain but it was a cot not a moldy straw pallet or bare stone his window had bars but it was a window he had a privy not a stinking slop bucket he would have fired any cook who gave him food like the stuff he got here but he did get enough to hold hunger at bay but what did this mild treatment mean did he have some chance of getting back to algarve because the valmierans werent sure of exactly what hed done or were they keeping him comfortable now because they knew how harsh they would soon be with him he didnt know by the nature of things he couldnt know brooding over it would have gone a long way toward driving him mad and so he did his best not to brood his best wasnt always good enough presently they fed him again light leaked out of the sky he had no lamp in the cell the hallways had lamps but not much light came through the small window in the door he lay down and went to sleep this was an animal sort of life and he tried to store up rest against a time when he might badly need it somewhere in the middle of the night the door flew open guards hauled him out of bed come on you son of a whore one of them growled another gave him a roundhouse slap in the face that snapped his head back ah he thought as they hustled him along the corridors to a room where hed never gone before at last the gloves come off he was afraidhe would have been an imbecile not to be afraidbut he was oddly relieved too hed been waiting for a moment like this now it was here the guards slammed him down onto a hard stool a bright light blazed into his face when he involuntarily looked away he got slapped again face forward a guard shouted from behind that blazing lamp a valmieran rasped you were the one who sent some hundreds of folk of kaunian blood south to the strait of valmiera to be slain for your kingdoms foul sorceries i do not know anything about lurcanio began yet another slap almost knocked him off the stool dont waste my time with lies warned the blond behind the lamp youll be sorry if you do now answer my questions you stinking worthless sack of shit you were the one who sent those people to die it wasnt a question that didnt matter what mattered was that the valmierans knew how to play the game of interrogation after all his head ringing the taste of his own blood in his mouth lurcanio fought to gather himself if he admitted the charge he was a dead man that much he could see no he said through bruised and cut lips i was not the one liar the interrogator shouted one of the guards punched lurcanio in the belly he groaned for one thing he couldnt help himself for another he wanted them to think him hurt worse than he was so you werent the one eh the valmieran sneered a likely story well if you say you werent who was talk powers below eat you that question had as many eggs buried in it as a field on the western front another slap encouraged lurcanio not to take too long answering he didnt know how much the valmierans knew he didnt want to betray his own countrymen but he didnt want the charge sticking to him alone either hed had something to do with sending blonds south but he was a long way from the only one our orders came from trapani he said we only followed this time the slap did knock him off the stool he thudded down onto stone the guards kicked him a few times before they picked him up the interrogator still unseen said that wont work algarvian aye those whoresons in trapanill get the axe for what they did but you dont get off for following orders you know the difference between war and murder youre a big boy you are the victors lurcanio said you can do with me as you please you bet your balls we can redhead you just bet the valmieran gloated but werent you listening youve got a chancea skinny chance but a chanceof saving your lousy neck name names and we just might be happy enough with you to keep you breathing is he lying he probably is but do i dare take the chance lurcanio thought as well as he could think with pain pouring through him and if i name the names of othersor even if i don twho will be naming me one more thing he didnt care to dwell on talk you fornicating bastard the interrogator snarled we know all about your fornicating too shell get herswait and see if she doesnt you have this one chance pal talk now or else dont and see what happens to you then would all his captive countrymen keep quiet a bitter smile twisted lurcanios lips algarvians were no less fond of saving their own skins than the folk of any other kingdom somebody would name himand even if someone didnt how many documents had the valmierans captured thered been no time to destroy them all last chance algarvian very very last the fellow behind the lamp said we know what you did who did it with you lurcanio felt old he felt tired he hurt all over had they been toying with him up till now to make this seem harsher when it came he had no answers save that he didnt want to die that he knew well he said to begin with there was sixteen cottbus had changed marshal rathar hadnt seen the capital of unkerlant this gay since now that he thought about it hed never seen cottbus so gay gaiety and unkerlanters seldom went together hed seen the capital gray and frightened before the derlavaian war when nobody knew whom king swemmels inspectors would seize next or on what imagined charge and hed seen cottbus past frightened the first autumn of the war against algarve hed seen it on the ragged edge of panic then with functionaries burning papers and looking to flee west any way they could expecting the city to fall to the redheads any day but cottbus hadnt fallen and hed also seen it grimly determined to do to king mezentio what hed come so close to doing here with algarve beaten the city itself seemed on holiday people in the streets smiled they stopped to chat with one another before they would have reckoned that dangerous who could say for certain whether a friend was only a friend or also an informer no one and few took the chance unkerlant remained at war with gyongyos of course but who took the gongs seriously aye they were enemies no doubt of that but so what they were a long way off theyd never had a chance to get anywhere near cottbus no matter how successful they were in the field they could have been nuisances but no more as far as rathar was concerned that made them almost the ideal foes what made them even more perfect as enemies was the war they were fighting against kuusamo through the islands of the bothnian ocean theyd been losing that war for some time and pulling men out of western unkerlant to try without much luck to tip the balance back their way theyd got away with that because unkerlant had been busy elsewhere now now rathar walked across the great plaza surrounding the palace at the heart of cottbus the square was more crowded than he ever remembered seeing it womens long bright tunics put him in mind of flowers swaying in the breeze he laughed at himself youll be writing poetry next even inside the palace courtiers and flunkies went about their business with their heads up a lot of them were smiling too they didnt look as if they were sneaking from one place to another as they so often did come with me lord marshal one of them said nodding to rathar i know his majesty will be glad to see you what rathar knew was that king swemmel was never glad to see anybody and when he got to the anteroom outside the kings private audience chamber ageold unkerlanter routine reasserted itself he unbelted his ceremonial sword and gave it to the guards there they hung it on the wall then thoroughly and intimately searched him to make sure he bore no other weapons once they were satisfied they passed him in to the audience chamber routine persisted there too swemmel sat in his high seat rathar sank down on his knees and his belly before his sovereign knocking his forehead against the carpet as he sang the kings praises only when swemmel said we give you leave to rise did he get to his feet sitting in swemmels presence was unimaginable the king leaned forward peering at him in his high thin voice he asked shall we serve gyongyos as we served algarve well your majesty i doubt our men will march into gyorvar any time soon rathar replied but we ought to be able to drive the gongs our of our kingdom and i think we should take a bite out of them too many men hereabouts have told us that gyongyos will be utterly cast down and overthrown the king said why dont you who command our armies promise the like or even more courtiers rathar thought contemptuously of course they can promise everything they dont have to deliver but i do your majesty he said i can tell you what you want to hear or else i can tell you the truth which would you rather with king swemmel the question had no obvious answer swemmel had punished plenty of men whod tried to tell him the truth whatever fantasies went on in his mind must often have seemed more real to him than the world as it was he wasnt stupid people who thought he was commonly paid for that mistake in short order but he was strange he muttered to himself before coming out with something that astonished rathar well we dont want gyorvar anyhow your majesty the marshal wasnt sure hed heard straight grabbing with both hands had always been swemmels way to say he wasnt interested in seizing the capital of gyongyos was more than strange but he repeated himself we dont want gyorvar there wont be anything left of the place before long anyhow what do you mean your majesty rathar asked cautiously he could usually tell when the king drifted into delusion he couldnt do anything about it of course but he could tell today king swemmel was as matteroffact as if talking about the weather he was if anything more matteroffact than if talking about the weather for he rarely had anything to do with it he was a creature of the palace and came forth from it as seldom as he could his journey to herborn to watch false king raniero of grelz die had been out of the ordinary and showed how important he thought that was if id captured mezentio he would have come to trapani too rathar thought we mean what we say swemmel told him what else would we mean of course your majesty but please forgive me for i dont understand what youre saying king swemmel made an exasperated noise did we not tell you the cursed islanders powers below eat them can keep nothing secret from us no not even if they work their mischief in the middle of the bothnian ocean rathar nodded the king had said something like that in one of their conversations by crystal but the marshal still failed to see how the pieces fit together im sorry what does whatever the kuusamans and lagoans may be up to out in the bothnian ocean have to do with gyorvar they will do it there next swemmel replied and when they do he made a fist and brought it down on the gemencrusted arm of his high seat no point to spending unkerlanter lives on gyorvar the gongs will spend lives by the powers above oh aye how they will spend them sudden gloating anticipation filled his voice sudden alarm filled marshal rathar your majesty do you mean the islanders have some strong new sorcery they can work against gyorvar of course what did you think we meant till now i didnt know rathar wished hed learned a great deal sooner swemmel clutched secrets like a miser clutching silver if they can do that to gyorvar can they also do it to cottbus as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wondered if he should have kept quiet swemmel was sure everyone around him was out to get him and every kingdom around unkerlant out to destroy it and that in good times in bad the kings fear could be like a choking cloud but now swemmel only nodded grimly they can we know they can we are not safe not until we learn how to do the like to them how long will that be rathar asked kuusamo and lagoas were not enemies to unkerlantnot now if they could badly harm this kingdom while unkerlant couldnt strike back that limited how far swemmeland rathar dared go in antagonizing them swemmel half snorted half spat in disgust that fool of an addanz does not know he spent the war chasing after algarvian mageries and now when we ask himwhen we order himto switch ley lines we find he cannot do it quickly he calls himself archmage we call him archidiot rathar knew a certain amount of sympathy for addanz hed done what hed needed to do for the kingdoms survival doing much of it had horrified him he wasnt a man who took naturally to murder but he and his fellow wizards had to learn new things without a doubt swemmel was right about that has he any idea how long this will take any idea at all rathar tried again he might have to try to head off swemmel himself at some time in the future one more war might beprobably would beone more than unkerlant could stand he speaks of years the king said years why were the blunderers he leads not doing more before that was so breathtakingly unfair rathar didnt bother responding to it he stuck to what he could handle will having the islanders know what they know whatever it is hurt our campaign against the gongs it should not swemmel glowered down at rathar it had better not or you will answer for it of course your majesty rathar said wearily he tried to look on the bright side of things kuusamo and lagoas want gyongyos beaten too and then the warall of the warwill be over then we can go on about the business of putting the kingdom back on its feet again as far as he was concerned that was the most important thing ahead for unkerlant king swemmel gave an indifferent sniff we have enemies everywhere marshal he said we must make sure they cannot harm us did he mean we as the people of unkerlant or in the royal sense rathar couldnt tell not here he wondered if swemmel recognized the distinction the king went on everyone who stands in our way shall be cast down and destroyed enemies and traitors deserve destruction if only mezentio had lived if mezentio had lived he might still be alive alive and wishing for death thinking about what swemmel would have done to the king of algarve made rathar shiver though the audience chamber was warm and stuffy to keep from thinking of such things he said well soon be in position to begin the attack against gyongyos we know but swemmel didnt sound happy even at the prospect of beating the last of his foes still in the field a moment later he explained why we spend our blood as usual and the cursed islanders reap the benefit dyou think they could have invaded the derlavaian mainland unless our soldiers were keeping the bulk of the algarvian army busy in the west not likely no your majesty not likely marshal rathar agreed unless that is they used this new strong sorcery of theirs whatever it is against mezentios men he did want to keep king swemmel as closely connected to reality as he could if kuusamo and lagoas had this dangerous new magical weapon swemmel needed to remember that or heand unkerlantwould fall into danger but the kings muttering and eyerolling alarmed rathar theyre all against us every cursed one of them swemmel hissed but theyll pay too oh how theyll pay we have to be careful your majesty rathar said while they have it and we dont were vulnerable we know we do and so we shall king swemmel replied we shall pay the butchers bill in gyongyos on account of it but the day of reckoning shall come never forget it for a moment marshal even against those who play at aiding us we shall be avenged rathar nodded only later did he wonder whether that warning was aimed at kuusamo and lagoas or at him bembo knew he wouldnt win a footrace any time soon if a robber tried to run away from him odds were the whoreson would get away on the other hand that had been true throughout his career as a constable long before hed got a broken leg hed had a big belly by the middle of summer though the leg had healed to the point where he could get around without canes im ready to go back to work he told saffa the sketch artist snorted tell that to somebody who doesnt know you she said youre never ready to work even when youre there come on bembomake me believe youre not the laziest man who ever wore a constables uniform that stung not least because it held so much truth bembo put the best face on it he could other people look busier than i do because i get it right the first time and they have to run around chasing after themselves captain sasso might believe that saffa said a lot of times officers will believe anything me i know better since bembo knew better too he contented himself with sticking out his tongue at her well any which way im going to find out i never used to think id be glad to walk a beat in tricarico after everything that went on in the west though this will be a treat he wouldnt have to worry about rounding up kaunians here or about a forthwegian uprising or about the unkerlanters rolling east like a flood tide about to drown the world criminals wifebeaters after all hed been through in gromheort and eoforwic he would take them in his stilllimping stride at the constabulary station the sergeant at the front deska man only about half as wide as sergeant pesaro whod sat in that seat for yearsnodded and said aye go on upstairs to captain sasso hes the one who makes you jump through the hoops what hoops are there bembo asked i got my leg broken fighting for my kingdomnot constabulary duty fightingand now ive got to jump through hoops go on the sergeant jerked a thumb at the stairway he was no more disposed to argue than any other sergeant bembo had ever known ah bembo sasso said when bembo was admitted to his august presence how good to see you back healthy again thank you sir bembo replied though he felt none too healthy climbing the stairs had been hard on his leg he wasnt about to admit that though nodding to the officer he went on im ready to get back to it captain sasso nodded he wasnt much older than bembo wellfounded rumor said hed gained his fancy rank by knowing to whom to say aye at any given moment im sure you are he replied but there are certain formalities you have to go through first the sergeant had spoken of jumping through hoops now sasso talked about formalities like what sir bembo asked cautiously you went west sasso said aye sir of course i did bembo replied sasso was the one whod sent him west along with pesaro and oraste and several other constables we have orders from the occupying powers that no man who went west is to serve as a constable before he goes through an interrogation by one of their mages captain sasso said the penalties for going against that particular order are nastier than i really want to think about what kind of interrogation what for bembo was honestly confused captain sasso made a steeple of his fingertips and spelled things out for him the occupying powers dont want anyone who was involved with whatever may have happened in the west with the kaunians to do any kind of work that entails the trust of the kingdom you have to understand bemboits not up to me i didnt give the order im only following it bembo grunted hed only followed orders in the west were they going to punish him for it now and how nasty would this interrogation prove every time he thought about that dreadful old kuusaman wizard his heart stuttered in his chest that whoreson had been able to look all the way down to the bottom of his soul he didnt spit in my face bembo reminded himself quite he steadied himself bring on the cursed wizards im ready for em sasso blinked are you sure of course im sure bembo answered either theyll let me back in or they wont if they dont how am i worse off than i would be if i didnt try at all a point the constabulary captain admitted you have nerve dont you sir i have the balls of a burglar bembo grinned at sasso i nailed em to the wall of my flat and the burglars talked like thishe raised his voice to a high falsetto squeakever since captain sasso laughed all right youll get the chance to prove it come along with me ill take you to the mage do you know any classical kaunian only a little bembo said im like most peoplethey tried to thrash it into me at school and i forgot it as soon as i escaped escaped sasso got up from his desk youve got a way with words too thinking back i remember that how many of the reports you filed before the war were nothing but wind and air before bembo could answer the captain shook his head dont tell me i dont want to know just come on where are we going bembo asked if the stinking kuusamans want to deal with constables dont they have a wizard here powers above no captain sasso said we go to them they dont come to usthey won the fornicating war but i dont dare not go to them powers below eat em all like i said if they find out ive hired anybody who isnt checked he let out a hiss to show what was likely to happen to him ah bembo said all right if we have to go somewhere else for this that explains why saffa didnt know about it and warn me the kuusaman garrisonto which a few jelgavan soldiers and officials were also attachedwas headquartered not far from tricaricos central plaza the jelgavans acted as if bembo and sasso were beneath their notice the kuusamans simply dealt with them jelgava had lost its share of the war kuusamo had won its bembo wondered what that said about the two kingdoms actually he didnt wonder he had a pretty good idea what it saidnothing good about king donalitus realm to his relief the kuusaman mage who questioned him turned out to speak fluent algarvian so the fellow said you used to be a constable and you want to be a constable again and in between times you were where answer truthfully he made a couple of passes at bembo i will know if you lieand if you do you will not be a constable again bembo wondered whether to believe him an algarvian would not have phrased the warning so baldly but bembo had seen that kuusamans didnt indulge in flights of fancy as his own countrymen delighted in doing besides which he saw no point in lying here i was in gromheort and later in eoforwic i fought against the forthwegian uprising there and i was wounded when the unkerlanters flung eggs into the place at the start of their big attack i see the slanteyed mage said neutrally this is all very interesting but not very important it is to me bembo said it was my leg not very important to what we are talking about here the kuusaman said what we are talking about here is your dealings with the kaunians in these two cities and thereabouts you had dealings with kaunians in these two cities and thereabouts did you not aye bembo answered hed been a constable in the west how could he have helped dealing with blonds all right then the kuusaman grudged him a nod now we come down to it did you ever kill any kaunians while you were on duty in these two cities and thereabouts aye bembo said again then what are you doing here wasting my time and yours the kuusaman demanded showing annoyance for the first time i shall have to speak to your captain he knows the regulations and knows them well will you listen to me bembo said let me tell you how it was and powers below and your miserable spell both eat me if i lie he told the mage the tale of how he and oraste had met the drunken ruin of a kaunian mage sleeping in an overgrown park in gromheort and how the kaunian hadnt survived the encounter he was out after curfew and he would have done something to us he tried to do something to us which is why we blazed the old bugger and what does your precious magecraft have to say about that at first glance it seems the truth but i shall probe deeper the kuusaman made more passes he muttered in his own language by the time he got done he looked dissatisfied this is the truththe truth as you remember it at least if he asked a question like is that the only time you killed a kaunianif he asked a question like that bembo would never be a constable again to keep him from asking it bembo went on i dont suppose you want to hear about the time i pulled two kaunians right out of the old nobles castle in gromheort and let em get away say on the kuusaman mage told him remember though if you lie you will be permanently disqualified who said anything about lying bembo said with what he hoped was a suitable show of indignation he told the mage about spiriting doldasais parents out of the castle the algarvians used as their headquarters in gromheort and uniting them with their daughter finishing go ahead and use your fancy spell im not lying he struck a pose as well as he could while sitting down the kuusaman mage made his passes he muttered his charm his eyebrows rose slightly he made more passes he muttered another charm this one bembo thought in classical kaunian those black eyebrows rose again how interesting he said at last this does seem to be the truth will you now tell me you did it from the goodness of your heart no bembo said i did it on account of i thought id get a terrific piece if i managed it and i did too hed never mentioned doldasai to saffa not even when he was spilling his guts to her and he never intended to either to his surprise the kuusaman turned red under his golden skin prissy whoreson bembo thought you are venal the mage said i suspect you took bribes in the form of money too he might have accused bembo of picking his nose and then sticking his finger in his mouth but bembo only nodded of course i did fearing the spell wasnt what made him tell the truth there to himto most algarviansbribes were nothing more than grease to help make wheels turn smoothly and quietly the mage looked almost as if he were about to be sick disgustingly venal he muttered but that is not what i am searching for very well i pronounce you fit to resume service as a constable he filled out forms as fast as he could plainly he wanted bembo out of his sight as fast as he could arrange it he was too embarrassed or perhaps too revolted to probe much deeper bembo hadnt thought things would work out just like that but he had thought they would work out he usually did and more often than not he turned out to be right little by little vanai got used to living in gromheort little by little she got used to not living in fear she needed a while to believe in her belly that no one would come through the streets shouting kaunians come forth the algarvians were gone they wouldnt be back a lot of them were dead and the forthwegians whod bawled for kaunian blood along with the redheads during the occupation were for the time being pretending theyd never done any such thing living in the same house with ealstans mother and father helped vanai get over the terror shed known it proved to her day after quiet day that forthwegians could like her and treat her as a person regardless of her blood ealstan did of course but that was different that was special elfryth and hestan hadnt fallen in love with her though they certainly had with her daughter conberge often visited the house the first time vanai met ealstans older sister she stared intently at her then asked do i really look like that when i wear my forthwegian mask i should say you do conberge answered eyeing her with just as much curiosity we could be twins i think oh good vanai exclaimed im so lucky then that raised a blush from conberge despite her swarthy forthwegian complexion vanai meant it too she thought conberge an outstandingly goodlooking woman in the dark buxom strongfeatured way of her people im prettier with her face than i am with my own she told ealstan that night no youre not he answered and kissed her youre beautiful both ways he spoke with great conviction he didnt quite make vanai believe him but he did prove he loved her she already knew that of course but more proofs were always welcome she did her best to show ealstan it went both ways too as summer advanced she and conberge stopped looking just alike when she wore her sorcerous disguise for her sisterinlaws belly began to bulge as her own had not so very long before conberge also grew even bustier than she had been which vanai thought almost too much of a good thing she doubted whether grimbald conberges husband agreed the two of them walked to the market square together one blistering afternoon vanai had saxburh along conberge watched her niece i ought to carry around a little notebook she said so ill know all right she does this when shes that old and then when she gets a little older shell do that instead vanai rolled her eyes what shes doing now is being a nuisance shed brought along a carriage but saxburh pitched a fit every time she tried to put her into it shed just learned to walk and walking was what she wanted to do that meant her mother and her aunt had to match her pace which annoyed vanai but didnt bother saxburh at all its all right conberge said im in no hurry she set a hand on her belly i feel so big and slow already but i know im going to get a lot bigger ill be the size of a behemoth by the time i finally have the baby wont i no not quite but youre rightyoull think you are vanai answered a squad of unkerlanter soldiers patrolled the market square vanai was finally used to men who shaved their faces though the smoothfaced unkerlanters had startled her the first few times she saw them they didnt give her cold chills the way algarvian troopers would have for one thing they didnt despise her people in particular for another they didnt leer the way the redheads did when they stared around it seemed much more like wonder at being in a big city she couldnt know but she would have guessed they all came from villages far smaller than oyngestun had ever been and they all looked so young she doubted any of them could have been above seventeen when she remarked on that conberge nodded unkerlant had to give sticks to boys she answered the algarvians killed most of their men vanai blinked in its bleak clarity that sounded like something hestan might have said they bought olive oil and raisins and dried mushroomssummer wasnt a good season for fresh ones except for some that growers raised when they put parcels in the carriage saxburh started to fuss whats the matter with you vanai asked you dont want to use it but you dont want anyone else using it either thats not fair saxburh didnt care whether it was fair or not she didnt like it vanai picked her up that solved the babys problem and gave vanai one of her own are you going to carry her all the way home conberge asked i hope not vanai answered her sisterinlaw laughed though she hadnt been joking do we need anything else or are we finished conberge said if we can get a bargain on wine that might be nice vanai said conberge shrugged hard to tell what a bargain is right now at least without a set of scales vanai nodded a bewildering variety of coins passed current in forthweg these days king beornwulf had started issuing his own money but it hadnt driven out king pendas older forthwegian currency and along with that both algarvian and unkerlanter coins circulated keeping track of which coins were worth what kept everybody on his toes conberge coped better than most im jealous of how well you handle it vanai told her my father taught me bookkeeping too conberge answered im not afraid of numbers im not afraid of them either vanai said remembering some painful lessons with brivibas but you dont seem to have any trouble at all he gave me his trade conberge replied with another shrug he didnt stop to think there might not be anyone whod hire me at it thats not right vanai said maybe not but its the way the world works conberge lowered her voice going after kaunians isnt right either but that doesnt mean it doesnt happen i wish it did now that you mention it so do i vanai said she pointed across the market square looktheres someone else with dried mushrooms shall we go over and see what hes got why not conberge seemed content perhaps even eager to change the subject too im not going to go in the other direction when someone has mushrooms for sale forthwegians and kaunians in forthweg shared the passion for them i wonder what hell have vanai said eagerly and i wonder what hell charge some dealers seem to think theyre selling gold because there arent so many fresh ones to be had she would have hurried to the new dealers stall but no one with a toddler in tow had much luck hurrying halfway across the square she started to notice people staring at her whats wrong she asked conberge has my tunic split a seam her sisterinlaw shook her head no dear she answered but you dont look like me anymore oh taking saxburh off her shoulder vanai saw the baby looked like herself too and not like a fullblooded forthwegian child any more i forgot to renew the spell before we went out she thought i never used to do that i must be feeling safer now though she was going to find out if she had any business feeling safer how long had it been since these people had seen a kaunian who looked like a kaunian years surely for a lot of them how many of them had been hoping they would never see another kaunian again more than a few no doubt vanai thought about ducking into a building and putting the spell on again she thought about it but then shook her head for one thing too many people had seen her both ways by now and seen her change from one appearance to the other for another her back straightened all right by the powers above i am a kaunian my people were living in forthweg long before the forthwegians wandered up out of the southwest i have a right to be here if they dont like it too bad conberge walked along at her side as naturally as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened that steadied vanai her sisterinlaw wasnt ashamed to be seen in public with her no matter what she looked like but how many people are going to wonder whether conberges a kaunian in disguise now she wondered and hoped ealstans sister wouldnt think of that nobody shouted for a constable being a kaunian wasnt against the law in forthweg anymore but laws had only so much to do with the way the world worked vanai feared people would start shouting curses or throwing things if they did would the unkerlanter soldiers on patrol try to stop them she supposed so even if the soldiers did though the damage would still be done she would never again be able to show her face as a blond in gromheort and maybe not in forthwegian disguise either no one threw anything no one said anything no one as far as vanai could tell so much as moved as she came up to the forthwegian who was selling dried mushrooms a plump fellow somewhere in his middle years into that frozen silenceit might have sprung from a wizards spell rather than from one wearing offshe spoke not in forthwegian but in classical kaunian hello let me see what you have if you please even conberge inhaled vanai wondered if shed gone too far using her birthspeech wasnt illegal any more either but when had anyone last done it in public here would the mushroomseller try to shame her by denying that he understood or would he prove to be one of those forthwegians whod either never learned or whod forgotten his classical kaunian neither as it happened not only did he understand the language shed used he even replied in it of course youll find some good things here he pushed baskets toward her thank you she said a beat slower than she should havehearing her own tongue took her by surprise around her the market square came back to life if the dealer took her for granted other folk would do the same now i have to buy something from him she thought no matter how much he charges i have to buy i owe it to him but the fellows prices turned out to be better than the ones vanai and conberge had got from the man on the other side of the square he wrapped up the mushrooms she bought in paper torn from an old news sheet and tied it with a bit of string enjoy them he told her thank you very much she said again not just for the mushrooms youre welcome he answered and then leaned toward her and lowered his voice im glad to see you safe vanai her jaw dropped suddenly she too spoke in a whisper youre someone from oyngestun arent you one of us i mean who tamulis he said oh powers above be praised she exclaimed the apothecary had always been kind to her she asked is anyone else from the village left i dont know he replied youre the first one ive seen with nerve enough to show your true face more than ive got believe you me it hadnt been nerve it had been a mistake but i got by with it vanai thought if i want to lean do it again maybe lean do it again anyway somehow that maybe felt like victory garivald had thought he would forever hate all algarvians and the men whod fought for the redheads now he found himself swinging a pick beside one of mezentios men while a former soldier from plegmunds brigade shoveled the cinnabar ore theyd loosened into a car another unkerlanter had charge of being careful the algarvian said in bad unkerlanter almost dropping pick on my toes sorry garivald answered and found himself meaning it hed worked beside this particular redhead before and didnt think he was a bad fellow here in the mines in the mamming hills the captives whatever they looked like werent one anothers worst foes that honor without question went to the guards all the captivesunkerlanters forthwegians gyongyosians algarvians black zuwayzinhated the guards with a passion far surpassing anything else they felt they worked alongside their fellows in misery well enough the guards were the men who made life a misery come on you lazy whoresons one of them shouted now you dont work harder well just knock you over the head and get somebody who will dont think we cant do it on account of we cursed well can maybe some of the foreigners in the mine were naive enough to believe the guards wouldnt kill any man they felt like killing garivald wasnt he doubted whether any unkerlanter was inspectors and impressers had always meant that life in unkerlant was lived watchfully anyone who spoke his mind to someone he didnt know quite well enough would pay for it the work went on here in the summertime it would still be light when the men in the mines came up after their shift ended as it had been light when they came down to their places at the ends of the tunnels come winter it would be dark and freezingworse than freezingabove ground at each end of the shift down here in the mine winter and summer day and night didnt matter to a farmer like garivald a man whod lived his life by the rhythm of the seasons that felt strange of course his being here at all felt strange no one thought he was garivald the fellow whod been a leader in the underground and come up with patriotic songs as garivald he was a fugitive anyone whod presumed to resist the algarvians without getting orders from king swemmels soldiers was automatically an object of suspicion after all he might resist unkerlant next plenty of grelzers had some of them were in the mines too but no garivald was here because of what hed done what hed seen while using the name of fariulf which he still kept what did i see he wondered much of what hed seen in battle he wanted only to forget but that wasnt what had made the inspectors seize him when he got off the leyline caravan by now thanks to a good deal of thought and some cautious talk with other captives he had a pretty good notion of why he was here what did i see i saw the algarvians were a lot richer than we are i saw they took for granted things we havent got i saw their towns were clean and well run i saw their farms grew more grain and had more livestock than ours do i saw water in pipes and lamps that run on sorcerous energy and paved roads and a thick leyline network i saw people who werent hungry half the time and who werent nearly so afraid of their king as we are of ours being an unkerlanter he even understood why his countrymen had yanked him out of freedomor what passed for it hereaboutsand sent him to the mines if hed gone back to his farm to his life with obilot he would have come into the town of linnich every so often to sell his produce and buy what the farm couldnt turn out and he might have talked about what hed seen in algarve that in turn might have made other people wonder why they couldnt have so much their enemies took for granted oh aye im a dangerous character i am garivald thought i could have started a rebellion a conspiracy a lot of the men in the mines were no more truly dangerous than he was but he knew some who were that fellow from plegmunds brigade whod once tried to comb his band out of the forest west of herborn sprang to mind no one would ever make ceorl out to be a hero he didnt pretend to be one either he was a born bandit a son of a whore if ever there was one and he flourished here in the mines he led a band of forthwegians and a couple of kaunians they hung together and got good food and good bunks for themselves when other gangs challenged them they fought back with a viciousness that made sure they didnt get challenged often and ceorl seemed to like garivald as much as he liked anyone that puzzled the unkerlanter at last he decided being old enemies counted almost as much as being old friends would have out in the wider world the notion would have struck him as absurd here in the mines it made a twisted kind of sense even seeing someone whod tried to kill you reminded you of what lay beyond tunnels and barracks weve got to get out of here ceorl kept saying to whoever would listen his unkerlanter was foul listening took effort but he spoke his mindspoke it without the least hesitation weve got to get out this place is a manufactory for dying a man at the head of a gang can live soft garivald told him why do you care what happens to anybody else i spent too fornicating much time in gaol ceorl answered forthwegian obscenities werent too different from their unkerlanter equivalents this is another one he spat besides this cinnabar stuffs poison look at the quicksilver refineries and even the raw stuffs bad i was talking with somebody from a dragon groundcrew itll kill younot fast but it will garivald shrugged he didnt know whether that was true but he wouldnt have been surprised the mines werent run as health resorts for miners what can you do about it he asked reasonably run away no of course not ceorl said i wasnt thinking of anything like that not me pal i know better by the powers above he spoke louder than he had been louder than he needed to looking over his shoulder garivald saw a grimfaced guard within earshot he doubted ceorl had fooled the guard of course any captive in his right mind wanted to get away but the forthwegian couldnt very well say he wanted to break out of the captives camp and mine complex escape was punishable too a couple of days later at the end of a blind corridor ceorl picked up the thread as if the guard had never interrupted it how about you buddy you want to get out of here if i could garivald said who wouldnt but what are the odds theyve got it shut up tight the forthwegian laughed in his face you may be tough but you aint what anybodyd call smart garivald marveled that the ruffian found him tough but he let that go what do you mean he asked theres ways ceorl answered thats all im gonna tell youtheres ways maybe not if youre a redhead or a blond but if youre the right kind of ugly theres ways speaking the lingo helps too as far as garivald was concerned ceorl didnt really speak it but his own grelzer dialect made a lot of his countrymen automatically assume hed been a traitor unkerlanter came in a lot of flavors maybe people somewhere in the kingdom talked the way ceorl did garivald rubbed his chin you arent the right kind of ugly if you keep that beard ceorl grinned aye i know it ill get rid of the fornicating thing when the time comes till then though he eyed garivald if you dont feel like staying here till you croak wanna come along if they catch us theyre liable to kill us and so ceorl shrugged what difference does it make i aint gonna live the rest of my days in a fornicating cage they think i am they can kiss my arse for garivald it wasnt the rest of his life his official sentence was twentyfive years but hed be a long way from young if they ever let him outand if he lived to the end of the sentence how likely was that he didnt know not for certain but he didnt like the odds informing on ceorl might be one way to get his sentence cut he realized as much but never thought of actually doing it he hated informers even more than he hated inspectors and impressers the latter groups at least were open about what they did informers as far as he was concerned informers were worms inside apples what would you do if you got out he asked ceorl who knows who cares whatever i futtering well please the ruffian replied thats the idea when youre out you do what you futtering well please he didnt know unkerlant so well as he thought he did nobody in the kingdom save only king swemmel did what he pleased eyes were on a man wherever he went he might not know they were there but they would be well if a fornicating forthwegian doesntknow how things work if he gets caught again what do i care garivald thought if i can get out of here i know how to fit back into things all id have to do is separate from him would he have thought like that before the war he didnt know he hoped not the past four years had gone a long way toward turning him into a wolf he wasnt the only one either he was sure of that he stuck out his hand aye im with you good hed already known how strong ceorls grip was by all the signs the forthwegian had been born a wolf well be able to use each other i know how and you can do most of the talking fair enough garivald said and if we do get out which of us will try to kill the other one first as long as one of them knew about the other they were both vulnerable if he could see that ceorl could surely see it too he studied the ruffian ceorl smiled back the picture of honest sincerity that made garivald certain he couldnt trust the forthwegians very far what are you whoresons doing down there a guard called whatever it is come do it where i can keep an eye on you you wanna watch me piss ceorl said tugging at his tunic as if hed been doing just that the tunnel stank of urine hed made a good choice for cover the guard pulled a horrible face and waved him and garivald back to work hes got nerve garivald thought he isnt stupid even if he doesnt understand unkerlant if he has a plan for getting out of here it may work as ceorl walked back toward the mouth of the tunnel he muttered this whole fornicating kingdoms nothing but a fornicating captives camp garivald blinked maybe the man from plegmunds brigade understood unkerlant better than hed thought garivald started swinging his pick with a vim he hadnt shown before he wondered why could hope however forlorn do so much maybe it could since sabrino had declined to become king of algarve or of a part of algarve hed got better treatment in the sanatorium hed expected worse after all hed warned general vatran he wouldnt make a reliable puppet he had no reason to think the unkerlanter general disbelieved him maybe vatran had more courtesy for an honest and crippled enemy than hed expected little by little sabrino learned to get around on one leg he stumped up and down corridors at the sanatorium eventually he even got to go outside to test his crutches and his surviving leg on real dirt he remained in pain decoctions of poppy juice helped hold it at bay he knew hed come to crave the decoctions but he couldnt do anything about that if the pain ever went away he would think about weaning himself from them not now not soon either he didnt think youre doing very well his chief healer said one day when he came back worn and sweaty from a journey of a few hundred yards youre doing much better than we thought you would in fact when you first came in here plenty of people doubted you would live more than a few days i was one of them sabrino answered and i would be lying if i said i were sure you did me a favor by saving me now what sort of attitude is that the healer spoke in reproving tones mine sabrino told him this is my carcass or whats left of it im the one whos got to live in it and thats not a whole lot of fun the healer tried cajolery wed hate to see everything we did go to waste after we worked so hard to keep you going huzzah sabrino said sourly im not a fool and im not a child i know what you did i know you worked hard what i still dont know is whether you should have bothered algarve is mutilated too the healer said we need all the men we have left wouldnt you say to that sabrino had no good answers he sat down on his cot and let the crutches fall i never thought i would hope for calluses under my arms he said but these cursed things rub me raw before the healer could speak sabrino wagged a finger at him if you tell me ive got the rest of my life to get used to them ill pick up one of those crutches and brain you with it i didnt say a thing the healer replied and if you kill a man for what hes thinking how many men would be left alive today about as many as are left alive today if youre thinking about algarvians sabrino said he lay down and fell asleep almost at once part of that was the decoctionsthough sometimes they also cost him sleepand part of it was the exhaustion that came with being on his feet if only for a little while when he woke the healer was hovering above his cot in his long white tunic he reminded sabrino of a sea bird he said you have a visitor what now sabrino asked are they going to try to make me king of yanina i couldnt be worse than tsavellas thats certain no indeed your excellency the healer turned toward the doorway and made a beckoning motion you may come in now thank you to sabrinos astonishment his wife walked into the room gismonda he exclaimed by the powers above what are you doing here i sent a message to tell you to get to the east if you could and i thought you had the kuusamans and lagoans beat us but the unkerlanters his gesture was broad expansive algarvian theyre unkerlanters i know gismonda said by the time i made up my mind to get out of trapani it was too late i couldnt and soshe shruggedi stayed the healer shook a warning finger as he walked to the door ill be back in half an hour or so he said he is not to be overtired and he added pointedly i am leaving this door open with the decoction in him sabrino didnt much care what came out of his mouth leering at the healer he said you dont know how shameless i can be do you the fellow left in a hurry now really gismonda said sounding a little amused but much more scandalized you may be dead to shame my dear but what makes you think am shed been a beauty when they wed she was still a handsome woman but one who showed she had iron underneath shed rarely warmed up to sabrino in the marriage bed she gave him what he wanted when he wanted it with her and like a lot of algarvian wives shed looked the other way when he took a mistress but shed always been fiercely loyal and sabrino had never embarrassed her as some husbands enjoyed doing to their wives now instead of answering her he asked the question uppermost in his mind are you all right oh aye she nodded all things considered the place isnt too badly damaged and as for the unkerlanters another shrug one of them had some ideas along those lines but i persuaded him they were altogether inappropriate and theyve given me no trouble since good for you sabrino wondered if gismondas persuasion had been something swift and lethal in a cup of wine or spirits or whether a show of sternness had convinced the unkerlanter to take his attentions elsewhere that wouldnt have been beyond her but swemmels men by all sabrino had heard and seen werent always willing to take no for an answer he said i hope you didnt take too much of a chance i didnt think so gismonda replied and i turned out to be right i have had some practice at judging these things you know men are men regardless of which kingdom they come from she spoke with what sounded like perfect detachment and if thats not a judgment on half the human race powers below eat me if i know what would be sabrino thought he knew what his own countrymen had done in unkerlant it didnt go very far toward making him think she was wrong well any which way im glad you came through safe and im very glad to see you he said i would have come sooner she said but the first word i got was that you were dead she angrily tossed her head it wasnt anything officialby then the official ley lines had all broken down but one of the officers from your winga captain of no particular breedingcame to the house to give me the news that he had seen you flamed out of the sky that would have been orosio sabrino said breeding or not hes a good fellow i wonder if he came through alive i dont know that was the name though gismonda said if he came to tell me such a story he might at least have had the courtesy to get it right it must have been kindly meanti cant doubt thatbut im lucky to be alive sabrino answered if this is luck he added but only to himself aloud he went on i cant blame him for thinking i was dead if your dragon goes down you usually are mine didnt smash into the ground and didnt crush me after i got out of the harness luckexcept for my leg he couldnt pretend that hadnt happened no matter how much he wanted to his wife nodded im very sorry it was more than polite less than loving exactly what he might have expected from gismonda how did you finally find out orosio had it wrong a mad rumor went through trapani a couple of weeks agoa rumor that the unkerlanters had offered to make some wounded dragonflier king of algarve or of what they held of algarve and that hed turned them down flat gismondas green eyes glinted i know you my dear it sounded so much like something you would do i started asking questions and here i am here you are sabrino agreed im glad you are he held out his hands to her they still hadnt touched that was very much like gismonda too but she did take his hands now she even bent down by the side of the bed and brushed her lips across his he laughed you are a wanton today oh hush she told him youre as foolish as that healer of yours he patted her backsidenot the sort of liberty he usually took with her if you wanted to shut the door i wasnt supposed to make you tired gismonda said primly sabrino grinned you just told me the fellow was a fool so why pay attention to him now men gismonda said again maybe fondly maybe not youd sooner have lost your leg than that no the grin fell from sabrinos face id sooner not have lost anything this hasnt been easy and it hasnt been fun and ill thank you not to joke about it im sorry his wife said at once youre right of course that was thoughtless of me when do they think youll be able to leave here she was clever not only did she change the subject she reminded him what he would be able to do when he healed not of what hed lost it shouldnt be too much longer he answered i am on my feeton my foot i should say id just gone out and about not long before you got here theyre talking about fitting a made leg to the stump but that wont be for a while longer it needs to heal more i understand gismonda said when you do get out ill take the best care of you i canand ill do what i can for that too once were someplace where no one is likely to walk in on us i appreciate it sabrinos tone was sardonic as soon as the words were out of his mouth he realized that was a mistake if he was to get any pleasure from a woman from now on from whom would it be but gismonda who else would be interested in a mutilated old man no one he could think of half a lifetime earlier such a reflection would have cast him into despair now at just this side of sixty he burned less feverishly than he had when he was younger the decoctions he drank to hold pain at bay helped dampen his fire too and the brute fact of the injury hed taken also reduced his vitality he sighed even if you had shut the door there i wonder if anything would have happened one way or another i expect well manage when youre well enough to come home gismonda said in your own way sabrino you are reliable for which i thank you indeed he replied it may be flatteryin my present state of decrepitude its bound to be flatterybut you mustnt think im not grateful to you for keeping up the illusion isnt that part of what marriage is about keeping up illusions i mean on both sides mind you so husband and wife can go on living with each other or maybe youd sooner just call it politeness and tact i dont know sabrino groped for a reply found none and let out a small embarrassed laugh i dont know what to say to that but i can use the distillate of poppy juice as an excuse and count on you to be polite enough not to let me see you dont believe a single solitary word of it gismonda smiled of course my dear the healer bustled in well well how are we doing he asked in a loud hearty voice no we my dear fellow i turned the kingship down sabrino said grandly the healer laughed gismonda smiled again sabrino was gladder for that he knew she made a more discriminating audience in the refectory pekka raised her mug of ale in salute powers above be praised that we arent teaching teams of mages anymore she said and took a long pull at the mug ill certainly drink to that fernao did setting his mug on the table he gave her a quizzical look but im surprised to hear you say such a thing how will you go back to kajaani city college if you feel that way pekka cut a bite from her reindeer chop chewing and swallowing gave her time to think its not the same she said at last that wont be an emergency andshe looked around the refectory before she went on making sure none of the mages theyd worked with was in earshotand i wont be trying to get through to so many stubborn dunderheads some of the people we tried to teach must still be sure the world is flat i ran into that too fernao said you wouldnt expect it from mages i thought the same thing at first pekka broke in but now im not so sure mages know the world is full of sorcerous laws when we showed them the ones they thought they knew werent really at the bottom of things some of them didnt want to hear that at all they certainly didnt fernao agreed some of them didnt want to believe the spells i was casting actually worked even though they saw them with their own eyes but even so the ones we did manage to train went out and stopped the algarvians as if theyd run into a wall that was true pekka couldnt deny it and was glad she couldnt have you read the interrogation reports from some of the captured algarvian mages she asked aye fernao nodded his smile might have belonged on the face of a shark it was all teeth and no mercy they still havent figured out how we did what we did they know we did something they couldnt match but there are about as many guesses as to what it is as there are mages and not very many of them are even close to what we really did pekka said that makes me happier too because its likely to mean the unkerlanters arent close to figuring it out either i hope theyre not so do i fernao said as long as they dont figure it out we still hold the whip hand the longer we can keep it the better he took another sip from his mug then asked anything new from gyongyos not that ive heard pekka answered with a mournful shake of the head if they dont decide we meant that warning demonstration well have to show them it was real i dont want to do that so many people it will end the war fernao said it had better anyhow that made pekka drain the rest of her ale in a hurry the notion that the gongs might try to keep fighting even after having horror visited on them had never crossed her mind no one rational would do such a thing but were the gyongyosians rational wouldnt they have quit already theyd surely seen by now that they couldnt hope to win hadnt they what would we do if they didnt quit she muttered smash another city of theirs i suppose fernao answered better that than invadingor do you think im wrong no pekka waved to one of the serving women and ordered more ale i dont want to have to cast this spell once though twice she shuddered when the new mug of ale got there she gulped it down fast too her head started to spin fernao wagged a finger at her am i going to have to carry you up to your bedchamber she laughed it sounded like the laugh of someone whod had a little too much to drink ha she said feeling very wittyand slightly tonguetied you just want me defenselessshe had to try twice before she could get the word outso you can work your evil will on me evil fernao raised a gingery eyebrow you thought it was pretty good the last time we tried anything as best she could remembernone too clearly not at the momenthe was right that hasnt got anything to do with anything she declared no eh fernao said i a commotion at the entrance to the refectory interrupted him whats that pekka said kuusamans didnt commonly cause commotions she got to her feet to see what was going on so did fernao since he was a good deal taller he could see more when he exclaimed pekka couldnt tell whether he was delighted or horrified a moment later he spoke two words that explained why perfectly well ilmarinens back is he pekka said in tones identical to his back ilmarinen was he somehow contrived to look raffish even in the uniform of a kuusaman colonel catching sight of fernao who stood out not only on account of his inches but also for his red hair the elderly theoretical sorcerer waved and made his way toward him shaking off the mages and servants clustering round a few steps later ilmarinen caught sight of pekka too and waved again pekka waved back trying to show more enthusiasm than she felt whats he going to say seeing the two of us together she wondered it was a question whose answer she could have done without what ilmarinen did say was i was very sorry to hear about leino he was a good man id hoped to see him in jelgava but i got up to the front just too late thank you pekka answered she couldnt find anything exceptionable in that aye ilmarinen spoke almost absently he looked from her to fernao and back again glowering up at the jelgavan he said youd better take good care of her i can take care of myself master ilmarinen pekka said sharply ilmarinen waved that aside as being of no account he waited for fernao to speak im doing my best fernao said youll have to do better than that ilmarinen said with a dismissive snort he waved a forefinger under fernaos nose if you make her unhappy ill tear your arm off and beat you to death with it do you understand me im not kidding master ilmarinen pekka felt herself flush i didnt think you were master fernao said seriously almost as if he were speaking to pekkas father but ilmarinen wasnt feeling fatherly old perhaps but not fatherly by the powers above if i were twenty years youngerten years younger evenid give you a run for your money you overgrown galoot see if i wouldnt master ilmarinen pekka hadnt thought her cheeks could get any hotter now she discovered shed been wrong she wondered if fernao would laugh in ilmarinens face that wouldnt have been a good idea to her relief fernao saw as much for himself nodding soberly he said i believe you pekka believed him too master siuntio would have tempted her more ilmarinen she just didnt know about ilmarinen and she never had in a land of steady reliable people he was hairraisingly erratic about three days out of four she found that a bad bargain the fourth it seemed oddly attractive youd better believe me you redheaded ilmarinen began before he could get any further though he found himself upstaged pekka wondered if that had ever happened before ilmarinen usually did the upstaging but now linna the serving woman whooped illy sweetie and threw herself into the theoretical sorcerers arms illy pekka echoed deliciously dazed she couldnt imagine anyone calling ilmarinen that when she thought about it she also had trouble imagining anyone calling him sweetie as linna kissed ilmarinenand as he responded with an enthusiasm that said he wasnt so very old after allfernao said obviously master you have a prior commitment here when ilmarinen wasnt otherwise distracted he said a man should be able to keep track of more than one bit of business at the same time bit of business eh pekka thought amused and indignant at the same time he sounded almost like an algarvian but then her amusement evaporated while leino lived shed had to keep track of more than one bit of business at the same time herself how would that have turned out in the end she shook her head she would never know now ilmarinen kissed linna again patted her gave her a silver bracelet and told her ill see you in a little while all right ive got some business to talk with these people she nodded and went off ilmarinen hadnt been talking business before but pekka didnt contradict him as ilmarinen pulled up a chair another serving womanthe one whod been taking care of the tablecame up and asked him what he wanted he ordered salmon and ale she went back to the kitchen pekka asked what brings you back here master you went off to see what the war was like so i did but now the war in the east is over ilmarinen answered pity anything in algarve is still standing but it cant be helped nothing that happened to those bastards was half what they deserved but what am i doing here youre going to drop a rock on the gongs sometime soon arent you how do you know that pekka demanded who told you that whole sorcerous project was supposed to be as closely held a secret as kuusamo had ilmarinen only laughed i dont need people to tell me things sweetheart i can figure them out for myself i know what you were up to here and i can see where it was going i want to be here when it arrives i want to help it arrive as a matter of fact the magecraft has come a long way since you left us fernao said how quickly can you prepare ive been doing some thinking on my own ilmarinen took a few bedraggled leaves of paper from his beltpouch and spread them on the table my guess is youre headed in this direction pekka leaned forward to study the calculations after a minute or so she looked up at ilmarinen awe on her face youre not just even with us she said quietly i think youre ahead of us slowly fernao nodded with a shrug ilmarinen said it was something to keep me busy in my spare time i didnt have much or idve done more something to keep me busy in my spare time pekka thought dazedly she and fernao and the rest of the mages here in the naantali district were clever and talented she knew that but ilmarinen had just reminded her of the difference between talent and raw genius she shook her head trying to clear it all she could find to say was im glad youre back seventeen after ilmarinen got down from his carriage he gave the blockhouse in the naantali district a salute half affectionate half ironic congratulations he told pekka and fernao who alighted just after him you never did quite manage to kill yourselves here or to blast this place off the face of the earth fernaos smile showed fangs you were the one who came closest to that you know when you told linna goodbye and came out here with your miscalculations ilmarinen scowled he didnt like being reminded of that i still say theres more to that side of the equation than youre willing to admit you dont want to see the possibilities you dont want to see the paradoxes fernao retorted you ignored such a big one when you came out here you could have taken half the district with you that was also true and ilmarinen liked it no better before he could snap back at fernao again pekka said its so good to have you back master the bickering got dull after you went away did it ilmarinens smile was sour well i cant say im surprised raahe and alkio and piilis got out of their carriages so did the secondary sorcerers who would transmit the spell to the animals that would power it an enormous bank of cages larger than any ilmarinen had seen no one approached the blockhouse with any great eagerness except for ilmarinen all the mages here had already seen that this spell worked as advertised so they werent out to discover anything new that might have accounted for part of their reluctance the rest you remind me of so many hangmen on execution day ilmarinen said thats about what i feel like pekka said weve tried everything we could to make the gongs heed us but they wouldnt if they had we wouldnt need to do this i wish we didnt theyre proud and theyre brave and they still dont believe theyre overmatched ilmarinen said when you run into someone like that you usually have to hit him in the face to get his attention we are i understand the need pekka said ilmarinen found himself nodding when he first got to know her hed made the mistake of thinking her soft hed had to change his mind about that in short order she went on i understand it but i still dont like it it will end the war fernao said it had better end the war aye it had better pekkas tone was bleak if it doesnt i dont want to think about doing this twice or more than twice not to cities thats one of the reasons we have some hope of getting away with this and keeping our spirits clean ilmarinen said believe me if the algarvians had known what we do they wouldnt have thought twice about using it the deeper in trouble they got the nastier the wizardry they tried and the less they counted the cost they deserved having the unkerlanters overrun them and if thats not a judgment i dont know what is lets go do what needs doing pekka said we have a crystal in the blockhousei ordered one moved there if the gyongyosians decide to be sensible at the last moment we can abort the spell shes grasping at straws ilmarinen thought she has to know shes grasping at straws but shes doing it anyhow cant blame her for that blame powers above i admire her for it but it wont do any good if the gongs were going to quit theyd have quit by now beating them on the field hasnt been enough to make them change their minds maybe this will be if it is itll be worthwhile one after another the mages marched into the blockhouse it was as cramped as ilmarinen remembered with his bad leg fernao was the last one through the door he slammed it shut and let the heavy bar fall into place the blockhouse might have been sealed away from the rest of the world no need for that not anymore ilmarinen said maybe not fernao said but by now its become part of our ritual ilmarinen nodded routine did have a way of crystallizing into ritual and fernao was a good deal more fluent in kuusaman these days than he had been before ilmarinen left the naantali district the lagoan wizard hardly ever needed to fall back into classical kaunian now his southcoast accent was also stronger than it had been ilmarinen glanced toward pekka he had no doubt where fernao had picked up his style of speaking pekka might have felt his eye on her if she had she didnt know why hed looked her way for she said master ilmarinen are you sure youre comfortable here in spite of your work youre a latecomer to this sorcery ill pull my weight ilmarinen answered this is the end the very end i want to be a part of that all right she nodded youre entitled to it so much of the work weve done is based on your calculations if it werent for you we wouldnt be here today i will say though i hope you dont plan on standing on your head the way you did in the hallway outside my office no ilmarinen said what were here for today is standing gyongyos on its head thats a different business piilis said so it is master but one day you must tell us why you chose to stand on your head in the hallway outside mistress pekkas office i was demonstrating an inverse relationship ilmarinen replied piilis blinked but didnt smile he was bright enoughmore than bright enough but had only a vestigial sense of humor he might have gone further had he had more or he might not have too ilmarinen had his own opinion about such things but recognized it was no more than an opinion are we ready pekka asked no one denied it she took a deep breath and intoned before the kaunians came we of kuusamo were here before the lagoans came we of kuusamo were here after the kaunians departed we of kuusamo were here we of kuusamo are here after the lagoans depart we of kuusamo shall be here ilmarinen repeated the ritual words with her so did the rest of the kuusaman mages crowding the blockhouse and so he noted did fernao that was interesting before ilmarinen left the lagoan mage had always hung back from the stylized phrases with which kuusamans began any sorcerous endeavor no more though was he starting to think of himself as a kuusaman then even if fernao did think of himself as belonging to the land of the seven princes ilmarinen didnt and wouldnt and neither would the lagoan if he werent sleeping with a kuusaman woman the master mage thought but then he shrugged plenty of menand women toohad changed their allegiance over the years for reasons like that i ask you once more master pekka said are you ready to take your place in this spell along with the rest of us and i tell you once more i am ilmarinen replied i think i can keep up with you do you doubt it he found himself flattered by how quickly she shook her head by no means she told him and looked to the other mages are we all ready when no one denied it pekka took a deep breath let it out and said pursuant to the orders conveyed to me by the seven princes of kuusamo i begin whenever she incanted up till now it was always just i begin ilmarinen thought does she want to have it on the record that shes following orders a lot of algarvians tried to do that or is her conscience bothering her a little so she wants to lay the blame on the seven and not on herself he had little time to wonder about such things his own spell along these lines would have required only one operator hed designed it for himself the charm the mages here had come up with was a good deal more complex and when did you ever know a committee to do anything that wasnt clumsy and cumbersome ilmarinen asked himself but that wasnt altogether fair and he was honest enough to admit it to himself his spell was a barebones affair a good sorcerer needed arrogance and he had it in full measure hed simply assumed nothing would go wrong as he loosed the cantrip on the world if anything did go wrongif by some mischance he made a mistakethe spell would ruin him in short order this version if more complicated was also a good deal safer raahe and alkio and piilis not only helped draw and aim the sorcerous energy they also stood ready to turn it aside in case pekka or fernao or ilmarinen himself stumbled i dont intend to stumble he thought as pekka pointed to him and he took up the chant the passes he used were a good deal more elegantand more difficult than those the mages here had worked out he accepted the revised words theyd come up with safety for elegance was a reasonable trade but he thought their passes ugly he felt sure he could manage these and so he used them no mage intends to stumble went through his mind by then though hed finished that portion of the spell he pointed to fernao and poised himself to deflect any trouble if the lagoan slipped fernao still irked ilmarinen but no denying hed come a long way in a short time he got through his portion of the spell without difficulty even if ilmarinen reckoned his passes graceless then pekka took over once more and brought the charm up to its first plateau ilmarinen could feel the power already gathered and could also sense the shape and size of the power still to be drawn as he sensed it awe washed over him could i have managed this by myself i thought i could but maybe i was wrong arrogance brings down as many mages as clumsiness pekka pointed to him he nodded stopped thinking and started incanting once more theyd given him the task of getting the cantrip past that first plateau up to the point where the power the sorcerous energy having all been gathered could be launched against any target the mages chose ilmarinen felt as if he were pushing a boulder up a hill for a bad moment he wondered if the boulder would roll down over him and crush him then without any fuss he felt added strength from pekka and from fernao the lagoan mage nodded to him as if to say we can do it and with his help they could that boulder of power went up the metaphorical hill againand somehow began to move up it faster and faster which just proved metaphor was not only slippery but also dangerous now ilmarinen grunted hoarsely pekka pointed to raahe alkio and piilis fernao to the secondary sorcerers the power didnt belong here it needed to be on the far side of the world where a new day would soon be dawning with the other mages in the blockhouse ilmarinen felt the sorcerous energy fly east they cried out in triumph and then some tiny fraction of a heartbeat later ilmarinen and the others felt it strike home against gyorvar he cried out again almost before the echoes of his first shout had faded but what he felt this time was a long way from triumph when istvan went back to gyongyos he hadnt expected merely to exchange one captives camp for another by now though hed concluded he wouldnt be getting out of this center near gyorvar any time soon all the guards spoke his language the food was what he was used to but for those details he might as well have been back on obuda you have a simple way to go free balazs told him the interrogator spoke in calm reasonable tones all you need do sergeant is say you are convinced the accursed kuusamans may the stars never shine on them tried to trick and terrorize you with their show on becsehely all i have to do is lie you mean istvan said sourly all i have to do is turn my back on the stars your attitude is most uncooperative balazs said i am trying to tell you the truth istvan said in something not far from despair if you dont listen what will happen to gyongyos nothing much i expect the interrogator answered nothing much has happened to our starsbeloved land up till now why should that change because the slanteyes have given us a little time to make up our minds istvan said pretty soon theyll go ahead and do this to us if they can which i do not believewhich everyone with a dram of sense from ekrekek arpad on down does not believe balazs said most of your comrades have also seen sense and been released you know what you have to do to join them why make an avalanche of a snowflake you would say the same thing if you were trying to talk me into eating goat istvan said the scar on his left hand throbbed he ignored it and where nothing else had that remark succeeded in insulting balazs he stalked away his nose in the air and bothered neither istvan nor captain petofi the rest of the day petofi noticed the interrogators absence at supper he asked why balazs had gone missing istvan explained the officer normally a dour man laughed out loud but then he sobered he probably went into gyorvar to denounce you he warned you may have got satisfaction now but for how long will you keep it istvan shrugged they already have me in what might as well be another captives camp what can they do to me thats so much worse those are the sorts of questions you would do better not to ask petofi replied all too often they turn out to have answers and you generally end up wishing they didnt too late to worry about it now sir istvan said with another shrug i already opened my big mouth today was mine and ill enjoy it if he makes me sorry after he gets back here from gyorvar then he does thats all and ill have to see if i can find some other way to get my own back sadly the captain shook his head those whoresons are armored against attack by virtue of their office being the ekrekeks eyes and ears they think they can do as they please and they are commonly right balazs isnt arpads eye and ear istvan said hes the ekrekeks he named an altogether different portion of his sovereigns anatomy one as necessary as an eye or an ear but much less highly esteemed no doubt youre right petofi said this time favoring him with no more than a wintry smile being right of course will get you what being right usually does the blame and nothing else on that cheerful note the captain nodded to istvan almost as if they were equals and then left the dining hall for his own private roomhe was an officer after all istvan didnt linger long himself he felt oppressed and he didnt think it was at the prospect of balazs coming revenge the very air felt heavy with menace he tried to tell himself it was his imagination sometimes he succeeded for several minutes at a stretch balazs had told one truth anyhow the barracks hall where istvan slept held only a handful of other stubborn underofficers besides himself he didnt care much save that he missed corporal kun kun must have thought telling a few lies a small enough price for going home to gyorvar istvan hardly blamed him he knew mulishness was all that kept him here with kun gone he was in no mood for company anyhow lampsout came as more than a little relief gyorvars distant lights came in through the southfacing windows casting a pale grayish illumination on the northern wall of the barracks it was less than moonlight more than starlightnot enough to disturb istvan in the least when he fell asleep having fallen asleep he promptly began to wish hed stayed awake he kept starting up from a series of the ghastliest nightmares hed ever had the misfortune to suffer in one of them captain tivadar cut his throat instead of his hand on finding out hed eaten goat that was one of the gentler dreams too most of the others were worse far worse full of red slaughter he couldnt always remember the details when he woke but his pounding heart and the terrified gasps with which he breathed told him more than he wanted to know and then some time toward morning he woke to bright sunlight streaming in through the window but it wasnt morning not yet and the window didnt face east and the light into the barracks might have been as bright as sunlight but it wasnt sunlight it rippled and shifted like wavesor flames with a cry of horror and despair istvan sprang to his feet and rushed to the window he knew what he would see and he saw it the same destruction poured down onto gyorvar as had descended upon becsehely hed been closer to the disaster in the kuusaman leyline cruiser than he was now but he wasnt so far away as to have any doubt about what was happening even through the window even across the miles separating him from the capital of gyongyos savage heat beat on his face for a moment that was the only thought in his mind then he wondered what it was like in gyorvar itself and then sickly he wished he hadnt well he thought if that accursed balazs went into the capital he isnt coming back may the stars not shine on his spirit he faced that loss with equanimity but then one of the other men in the hall whispered if ekrekek arpads there he couldnt live through that if his kin are there they couldnt either that was horror of a different sort the ekrekek of gyongyos was the only man alive who communed with the stars as an equal that was what made him what he was if he died if all his kin died in the same searing instantwho would rule gyongyos then istvan had no idea he doubted anyone had ever imagined such a nightmare could befall the land what do we do another soldieror was he another captivemoaned what can we do the flames pouring out of the sky onto gyorvar abruptly ceased though they remained printed on istvans vision when he blinked gyorvar without the ekrekek without the ekrekeks whole family arpads house had reigned in gyongyos since the stars made the world that was what people said at any rate and so istvan wondered if arpad had the brains of a carrot he would have realized kuusamo was trying to warn us not trying to bluff us now hes paid for being wrongalong with the stars only know how many people who never did anyone any harm if theres any justice the stars will refuse to shine on his spirit other lands just have kings istvan said maybe we can get along with nothing more than a king too but three shockedsounding men began an automatic protest istvan cut them off with a sharp chopping motion of his right hand wed better be able to get along with nothing more than a king how much good did ekrekek arpad do us we lost the war we lost gyorvarstars above we might as well have had a goateating savage on the throne two of the soldiers at the window with him backed away as if afraid he had some deadly highly contagious disease the third one a corporal said youre right by the stars i wonder what well do now and who the new ekrekek or king or whatever he is of gyongyos will be istvan said and then with a shrug it probably wont matter not to the likes of us no said the underofficer whod noddedhis name was diosgyor only thing that matters to us is whether they let us out captain petofi strode into the barracks hall in time to hear that well need to be very lucky to get away he said why istvan said in dismay we were right everything we told them was trueand everything we warned them about came true petofi nodded all the more reason for locking us up and losing the key wouldnt you say sergeant few offenses more dangerous than proving right when your superiors say you must be wrong of coursehe grimacedmost of our superiors or the ones immediately concerned with us are dead uhof course istvans stomach lurched he hadnt even tried to think about how many people might have died in gyorvar thinking about the ekrekek and his kinsfolk was bad enough add in all the ordinary men and women and children by the stars sir this wasnt war this was murder youre half right petofl said in a way looked at from the kuusaman point of view this was murder but the slanteyes did their best not to commit it they could have loosed this magic on gyorvar as soon as they found it instead they let us watch when they threw becsehely on the pyre they let us watch and take back word of what wed seen arpad wouldnt hear it though he sighed wouldnt you say he helped kill himself and all of gyorvar with himself slowly istvan nodded corporal diosgyor said can we still go on fighting the war now by the stars i hope not istvan and captain petofi exclaimed at the same time it was impossible to say which of them sounded more horrified and then istvan let out a different cry of horror and despair whats wrong this time petofi and diosgyor spoke together my comrade corporal kun istvan said he gave the eyes and ears what they wanted and he liveslivedin gyorvar we fought together on obuda in the forests of unkerlant and on becsehely he was the cleverest man i ever knew he would never have praised kun so where the exmages apprentice could hear him now though kun would never hear anything again if either of us died i thought id surely be the one may the stars shine on his spirit forevermore petofi said if he was in gyorvar that is the most any man can hope for i know istvan said heavily he was a warrior from a warrior race tears were for women or so hed heard from boyhood hed never come so close to shedding them as he did now not since hed grown out of childish things he was a brother to me a brother in arms many of us have lost brothers petofi said with gyorvar gone gyongyos has had its heart torn from it and what can we do i have no answers istvan had no answers either no one left alive did he was sure of that and the answers ekrekek arpad and the other dead had come up with were wrong hed been sure of that even before fire enfolded gyorvar in its dreadful embrace now the whole world knew it was true leudast knew hed passed through the enormous forests of western unkerlant on his way to fight the gongs in the elsung mountains he hadnt imagined how huge they really were back in those distant days that halfhearted border war and gyongyos skirmishes with kuusamo among the islands of the bothnian ocean had been the only flareups in an otherwise peaceful world the rest of derlavai had gone through six years of darknessand the gongs were still fighting unkerlant here in the uttermost west and the slanteyes in the bothnian ocean lets see how much longer the whoresons last leudast muttered under his breath if it turned out to be much longer he would own himself surprised even as he muttered unkerlanter eggtossers pounded the gyongyosian positions near the western edge of the woods he didnt quite know how his countrymen had managed it but theyd moved a lot of eggtossers through the trees till they bore on the lines the gongs still held hardly any gyongyosian eggtossers answered back the algarvians had fought hard for as long as they could whenever king swemmels men started flinging eggs at them theyd responded sharply that remained true up to the day they surrendered theyd gone down but theyd gone down swinging the gyongyosians by contrast hardly seemed to believe what was hitting them things had been quiet here in the distant west for the past couple of years unkerlant had thrown as much as possible into the fight against algarve while the gongs had taken their men farther west still to fight the kuusamans in a watery sort of war leudast didnt pretend to understand he understood perfectly well the task lying ahead of him seizing his shiny bronze officers whistle he blew till the shrill note made his ears ring forward he shouted now we take the land away from them forward his company wentone company among hundreds more likely thousands forward went behemoths down game tracks and sometimes down no tracks at all overhead dragons dropped more eggs on the gongs skulking in the forest and swooped low to incinerate whatever they found in clearings no brightly painted gyongyosian beasts rose to challenge them they had the sky to themselves the terrain here was as rugged as any in which leudast had fought on the other side of his kingdom the woods west of herborn werent a patch on these they could have been swallowed up as if they never were in fact leudast and his men had to pick their way forward past great tree trunks scattered and tumbled like so many jackstraws but the country in which they were fighting did more to hold them back than did the gyongyosians here and there a few tawny shaggybearded men in leggings did keep blazing at them but they overran those pockets of resistance like men beating boys nothings going to slow us down now leudast shouted exultantly its not like it was when we were fighting the fornicating algarvians itll be easy powers above am i really saying things like that he wondered but he was even at the end of the war against the redheads theyd been dangerous whenever they managed to scrape together enough men and beasts and eggs to make a stand or to counterattack and theyd always looked for chances to hit back the gongs by contrast seemed stunned at the attack rolling over them for the first couple of days of that attack leudast knew it reminded him of something hed been through before but couldnt put his finger on what then encamped for the night in a clearing he snapped his fingers in sudden realization what is it sir one of his men asked he still had trouble getting used to being called sir but that wasnt the reason he answered oh nothing important all at once he understood why the gongs were acting as they were the unkerlanter army had behaved exactly the same way when the algarvians swarmed over the border more than four years earlier theyd been hit by a force not just stronger than they were but also almost beyond their comprehension gyongyos had never expected a blow like this unkerlant thanks to its vast spaces and dreadful winters had managed to ride out the algarvian storm leudast didnt think the gongs would be able to do the same they didnt have so much land to yield and they did have another war to worry about the fight on the bothnian ocean came closer to the offshore balaton islands closer to gyorvar itself every day and so while the unkerlanters swarmed forward a lot of gyongyosian soldiers simply threw up their hands threw down their sticks and went off into captivity some of them looked relieved some looked resigned one who spoke a little unkerlanter asked what you do move here so fast he got no answer the guards leading him and his countrymen back toward the camps that would house them kept them moving even if someone had sat him down and explained exactly what the unkerlanters were doing he might not have understood it leudast wouldnt have understood exactly what the redheads were doing just after they started doing it all he would have knownall he had known at the timewas that something dreadful had happened to his countrymen less than a week after the great attack began the unkerlanters burst out of the vast forest and into the more open country that led to the foothills of the elsung mountains behind them leudast knew pockets of gongs still held out so what he thought pockets of unkerlanters had still held out as the algarvians swarmed west too the redheads had mopped them up at their leisure peering ahead at the mountains leudast wondered how close he was to where hed been when the derlavaian warwhat everybody but unkerlant reckoned the derlavaian warbroke out he shrugged he couldnt tell one set of peaks looked much like another to a man raised on the broad plains of northeastern unkerlant he was settling his company for the night when captain dagaric called him and the other company commanders together dagaric took them out onto the meadow well away from the common soldiers campfires whats gone wrong sir leudast asked obviously something had or dagaric wouldnt have acted as he was doing he said i just got word from the regimental crystallomancergyorvars been destroyed gone vanished off the map disappeared he snapped his fingers to show how thoroughly wrecked the capital of gyongyos was well thats good isnt it sir another lieutenant asked if we smashed the place up thatll hurt the gongs wont it oh the gongs are hurting all right dagaric said ekrekek arpads dead and so is everybody in his clan as far as anyone can tell the whoresons whore left are all running around like chickens after the axe then whats wrong sir the other junior officer repeated if we got rid of gyorvar of arpad thats whats wrong dagaric broke in we didnt do it we didnt have anything to do with it the kuusamans smashed gyorvar with some newfangled sorcery they came up with powers below eat them leudast said softly he remembered how lucky hed been to come through alive after the algarvians started murdering kaunians the first autumn of their war with unkerlant the only answer his kingdom had found was killing its own peoplea solution he thought no one but swemmel would have imagined another company commander a sergeant asked can we match this magic dagaric shook his head no the slanteyes know how to do it and we dont thats not good leudast thought he was the first to speak but three or four company commanders said the same thing at more or less the same time of course its not dagaric said those whoresons ll hold it over our head like a club you see if they dont but that hasnt got anything to do with our job here our job here is kicking the stuffing out of the gongs and its more important than ever that we do it up good and proper how come sir somebody asked the regimental commander made an exasperated noise the more we grab now the better off well be for now were still officially friends with kuusamo how long will that last though anybodys guess so we grab with both hands while the grabbings good makes sense leudast said and the gyongyosians were falling to pieces against us even before this happened now that it has they ought to turn to mush i hope they do dagaric said other chance is that they might decide to make us pay as much as they can from here on out because everythings lost i hope they dont try to do that but weve got to be alert for it i want you to let your men know it could happen dont tell them about gyorvar not yet i havent got any orders on how were supposed to present that to them leudast felt foolish warning his troopers the gongs might turn desperate without telling them why nobody asked questions though curiosity was not encouraged in the unkerlanter army he did say well know better when we see how things go in the morning lying there wrapped in a blanket listening to eggs burst not so far away but almost all of them off to the west falling amongst the gyongyosianshe realized that might not be so dagaric had ordered him to keep the news of the destruction of gyorvar from his men would officers on the other side also keep it from the shaggy soldiers they led he wouldnt have been surprised forward he shouted when first light came forward the men went the gongs continued to crumble their disintegration was so quick and thorough in fact that leudast couldnt tell whether they knew some dreadful sorcery had claimed their capital unkerlant had been hammering their armies before the news came and went right on hammering them now three days later dagarics regiment was well up into the foothills of the elsung mountains looking east back in the direction from which hed come leudast saw nothing but a sea of dark green a sea that stretched out to the horizon and far beyond ahead towered the mountain peaks even in the summertime they remained shrouded in snow and mist he didnt look forward to climbing higher in them hed done that once all those years before and found mountain warfare harder work for fewer rewards than any other kind hed met since no help for it though he thought and ordered the men forward once more but then as the sun set ahead of him a gyongyosian with a white flag came out from behind a lichencovered boulder he waited to be recognized for what he was then called out in musically accented unkerlanter it is over you and the slanteyes have beaten us we can fight no more we admit it and we surrender by the powers above leudast whispered i lived through it those four words seemed to say everything that needed saying krasta looked from the ornate parchment to the valmieran official whod given it to her what is this she asked in distaste those seals and stamps meant little to her it is what it says it is milady the flunky replied it summons you to appear before his majestys court day after tomorrow to testify as to your dealings during the time of occupation with a certain accused algarvian namely one captain lurcanio why on earth would i want to do that krasta demanded she didnt want to do it she couldnt think of anything she wanted to do less but the official said by the laws of the kingdom your desires here are irrelevant and immaterial having been served with this summons you are required to appear failure to do so willnot may milady but assuredly willresult in your being fined or imprisoned or both good day he turned and strode down the walk away from krastas mansion she started to shout an obscenity after him but ended up whispering it instead she still hoped for something like a pardon from king gainibu insulting one of his servants wouldnt help her get it she glared down at the summons she wanted to tear it to pieces as if it knew what she wanted and were mocking her a couple of sentences in amongst the legalese leaped out this document must be presented at your court appearance she read it will be counterstamped to document the said appearance as shed whispered curses at the man whod brought the summons so she aimed more at the document itself no help for it though she put on the most demure outfit she could find the trousers were so baggy they might have done duty for a forthwegianstyle long tunic or so she imagined anyhow again her wig was a confection of piled blond curls it shouted her kaunianity to the world the hair underneath that was still growing out shouted something else altogether but she refused to pay any attention to that the last thing she expected when she got to the royal courthouse was a pack of newssheet scribblers standing outside they shouted rude questions at her how good was the redhead marchioness thats really his baby isnt it will you tell the judges you fell in love with him nose in the air she stalked past them as if they didnt exist a bailiff led her to the courtroom and had her sit in a row of chairs reserved for witnesses lurcanio himself sat not far away he grinned and blew her a kiss her nose went up higher he laughed outwardly as brash as ever to her dismay more reporters in the courtroom scribbled notes about the byplay a panel of judges came in two of them wore black tunics and trousers of a cut even baggier than the ones she had on they were supposed to be dressed as ancient kaunian judges she thought the third was a soldier his uniform glittered he had two rows of medals on his chest he sat in the middle between the other two everyone rose and bowed when the judges took their places krasta was a beat behind most people because she didnt know she was supposed to be seated the soldier said in a voice that sounded as if hed used it on the battlefield to krastas indignation she wasnt the first witness summoned to the box a weedy little commoner stood there and droned on and on about captured documents it would have had to be more exciting to rise to dullness krasta yawned buffed her nails and yawned again the judges kept on questioning the fellow for what seemed like forever then when they finished lurcanio started in on him she didnt like that if he could ask her questions too at last the military judge dismissed the boring commoner marchioness krasta you will come forward he said the clerk will administer the oath forward krasta came the clerk took away her summons and stamped it then in a monotone he said do you swear the testimony you give here today and in any subsequent appearances will be the truth and nothing but the truth knowing you may be sorcerously monitored and you are subject to the kingdoms statutes pertaining to perjury aye krasta said people tittered one of the judges in oldfashioned black said the customary response milady is i do i do then krasta said with a toss of her head having sworn the witness may enter the box the military judge intoned when krasta had taken her place he went on you are the marchioness krasta sister to marquis skarnu thats right she answered and during the late war you were mistress to the colonel lurcanio the defendant here however much krasta wished she could deny it she had to nod and say aye i was lurcanio could give her the lie if she did say no and doubtless would take malicious glee in doing just that she scowled at him shed been so sure algarve had won the derlavaian war mezentios men had beaten valmiera hadnt they what else was there five years ago she hadnt thought there was anything else shed learned differently since after rustling a couple of leaves of paper to find the name the chief judge asked and colonel lurcanio is the father of your son gainibu if krasta had wished she could deny the one she wished even more that she could deny the other but it wasnt lurcanio who would give her the lie if she did it was her own sons sandy all too unvalmieran hair as venomously as she could she said aye again i note milady you are not on trial here the judge said we seek information against the algarvian now to resume being lurcanios mistress you yielded yourself to him of your own free will not always krasta exclaimed why there was this one time when he lurcanio burst out laughing a coarse rude raucous laugh you deserved that you miserable bitch he said i caught you rubbing up against valnu he must have been tired of boys that day but i wanted to remind you he liked them at least as well as he liked you all three judges rapped furiously with their gavels all three of them were redfaced one of the civilians said the recorder will expunge that from the transcript of this proceeding for the most part the military judge resumed you did yield yourself of your own free will to colonel lurcanio is that correct marchioness i suppose so krasta said most unwillingly very well then the judge said you being his willing mistress do you believe you were in his confidence did he trust you enough to talk to you of his affairs if hed had affairs and i found out about them i wouldnt have let him touch me the miserable whoreson krasta tossed her head again did they think she had no pride at all several people laughed which puzzled and angered her the judges gaveled them to silence the senior man the one in uniform said that is not what i meant what i meant was did he talk to you about his duties during the occupation to her powers above sir do i look so foolish lurcanio said i am affronted that you should ask such a thing his tone told krasta she should have been angry at him again but she couldnt see why hed told the truth no he didnt talk to me about anything like that she answered why would he have i cant imagine anything more boring the judges put their heads together krasta leaned toward them as she would have tried to eavesdrop on any conversation near which she found herself here she had no luck one of the civilian judges asked did this algarvian ever mention to you his work in transporting kaunians to the south coast of this kingdom for the purpose of slaying them and utilizing their life energy oh that krasta said if i tell them he talked about it i can hurt him she saw that very clearly aye he told me all about that he bragged about it in fact over and over again that is not the truth said a nondescript little man in the front row marchioness krasta you swore an oath of truthfulness and were informed of the penalties involved in violating the said oath the military judge said the mage has informed us that response was untruthful perhaps your error was accidental i shall give you oneand only onechance to revise your testimony if you care to do so what was the question again krasta asked the judge repeated it resentfully krasta said i suppose i was wrong i suppose he didnt talk about it the boring little man nodded with almost simultaneous sighs the judges put their heads together again the man in uniform asked did colonel lurcanio ever speak to you about the algarvian edict called night and fog no krasta said after giving the mage a dirty look did he ever speak to you about the way algarve treated captives from the underground it captured no krasta said but he wouldnt do anything to save the kaunian column of victory when the redheads knocked it over that is also a crime against kaunianity one of the civilian judges said still evidence suggests he was not a primary perpetrator we had hoped the algarvian might have been more forthcoming with you the other judge in black said i was forthcoming in her not with her lurcanio said with a nasty grin and you werent half as good as you think you were either krasta squealed furiously while the judges banged their gavels again and again that little mage in the first row stirred but krasta fixed him with such a glare he kept his mouth shut that will be quite enough of that the military judge declared very well marchioness krasta you may stand down from the witness box as my colleague said we hoped you might have more to offer oh i have plenty to offer krasta said i hope you blaze him he has his nerve dragging my name through the dirt marchioness when you chose to sleep beside him for four years you dragged your own name through the dirt to a degree greater than anyone else could have done you are dismissed outside the courtroom krasta expected another swarm of vicious newssheet scribblers but they had vanished as if a wind had risen and blown away a pile of rubbish instead newssheet hawkers were out in force all screaming out the identical headline gyongyos surrenders derlavaian war ends isnt it splendid milady krastas driver said as he handed her up into the carriage the wars finally over aye splendid she said part of her really meant it the rest was irked the end of the war had forced her out of public notice true the notice would have been unflattering but if no one noticed her at all how could she be sure she really existed fernao peered down from his perch behind the dragonflier once this journey was done he hoped with all his heart never to travel on dragonback again hed set out from kihlanki in easternmost kuusamo six days before and had islandhopped his way east across the bothnian ocean he wasnt quite saddlesore but he wasnt far from it either the dragons and dragonfliers had changed several times a day he lacked that luxury and remained his weary self theyd flown over the balaton islands earlier in the day now at last they passed above the narrow sea separating the balatons from the gyongyosian mainland gyorvar lay not far ahead a gyongyosian dragon rose to meet the newcomer seeing the beast gaudy in red and yellow and blue and black relieved fernao and alarmed him at the same time the gongs were supposed to send up a dragon to meet him and guide him to a working dragon farm outside shattered gyorvar they were supposed to aye but what if this werent the appointed beast but a lonewolf dragonflier intent on whatever revenge he could get from a kuusaman dragon and a lagoan mage because the gyongyosians were a warrior race such worries went through fernaos mind as the other dragon neared theyd surrendered but did they really mean it then the gong on the dragons back waved and pointed southeast fernao and his dragonflier waved back the dragonflier whacked his mount with a goad after a couple of badtempered screeches it followed the gyongyosian beast tawnybearded dragon handlers secured the kuusaman beast to a spike dragon farms the world around operated on similar principles fernao slid down from his perch on the dragons back and looked around the grass under his feet was grass some of the bushes a little farther away looked unfamiliar to him but he would have had to be an herbalist to recognize the differences the buildings on the edge of the dragon farm they had steeply pitched roofs in that they resembled buildings in kuusamo and lagoas and unkerlant which also saw a lot of snow but they didnt look like houses or hostels they looked like gray stone fortresses they were spaced well apart from one another too as if the gyongyosians didnt think it safe to have them too close together when the gongs werent warring with their neighbors they often fought among themselves their architecture showed it too a man emerged from the nearest of those fortresslike buildings and walked toward fernao he wore a sheepskin jacket over wool leggings gray streaked his beard and hair you are the mage from kuusamo he called in slow oddly accented but understandable classical kaunian i am fernao a mage of the first rank aye actually i represent both lagoas my own kingdom and kuusamo fernao replied and you are sir i am called vorosmarty a mage of five stars the gyongyosian said it is a rank more or less equal to your own how can you be trusted to represent two kingdoms i am from lagoas as i said and i am engaged to be married to a kuusaman mage neither kingdom feels i would betray its interests fernao said that wasnt strictly true grandmaster pinhiero was less than delighted to have him representing lagoas but he was the best bargain pinhiero could get and so the grandmaster had had to make the best of it vorosmarty shrugged very well this is not truly my concern i am ordered to show you gyorvar to show you what your magecraft has done i obey my orders come with me a carriage waits for us he didnt he couldnt know that fernao was one of the mages whod unleashed that sorcery his your had to mean your kingdoms fernao didnt intend to enlighten him either he said you are ordered who gives orders in gyongyos these days with ekrekek arpad and his whole family dead how were the gyongyosians running their affairs marshal szinyei who ordered our surrender has announced that the stars commune with his spirit and has declared himself our new ekrekek vorosmartys voice was studiously neutral fernao judged he would be unwise to ask the gyongyosian wizard how he felt about szinyeis elevation as he got into the carriage he did ask how far to gyorvar perhaps six miles vorosmarty replied no dragon farm closer than this one survived in working order his gray eyes flicked over to fernao in the name of the stars what did your wizards do what we had to fernao said that is no answer the gyongyosian said did you expect one fernao replied even if i knew how this wizardry was madeno he wouldnt admit iti could not tell you vorosmarty grunted i am sorry i do not know how to act like a defeated man no such disaster as this has ever befallen my kingdom lagoas and kuusamo tried to warn your sovereign fernao said he would not believe the warnings but we were telling the truth vorosmarty only grunted again had he been one of the advisors telling ekrekek arpad the islanders couldnt do as they claimed if he had he wouldnt want to admit that gyongyosian farmhouses also looked like strongpoints designed as much for defense as for comfort since they were of stone their exteriors showed little damage but the fence rails were wood before the carriage had got even halfway to gyorvar fernao saw that the sides of the rails facing the city were scorched vorosmarty noticed his gaze and nodded aye your spell did that even this far away before long fruit trees showed leaves sere and brown as if autumn had come early but something worse than autumn had come to gyorvar after another half mile or so even stone farmhouses looked as if they had been through the fire and the trees werent just scorchedthey were burnt black on the side facing the gyongyosian capital and then a little later burnt black altogether the air stank of stale smoke here and there smoke still rose from one place or another a different stench also rode the breeze the stench of death you threw this whole city on a pyre vorosmarty said as they passed a party of workers taking bodies out of a block of flats you would not yield fernao said this was the way we saw to make you know you were beaten vorosmarty shuddered when you raise your children do you spank them with swords no but our children are not trying to kill us fernao replied when our children grow up to be murderers we do hang them the gyongyosian mage sent him a resentful look he pretended not to see as they got closer to the heart of gyorvar devastation grew worse only a few upthrusting charred sticks showed where wooden buildings had stood stone structures were more common they went from looking burnt to looking slagged as if the stone blocks from which they were built had begun to melt a little later on there was no doubt of what had happened to them they looked like butter sculptures starting to sag on a hot day the death stink got stronger this was a great city once vorosmarty said how long shall we be rebuilding it the carriage rattled over something in the middle of the road wreckage a burnt body fernao didnt want to know he said you should have thought of the risks you were taking when you went into this war you should have had the sense to yield when you saw yourselves losing it risks the gyongyosian rumbled war has risks aye but this he shook his head his beard seemed to bristle with indignation for the past century and more the thaumaturgical revolution has made war more horrid at the same time as it has made life better during times of peace fernao said you gyongyosians should have realized that yours was the only kingdom not of eastern derlavai that kept its freedom and learned these arts itself we never imagined the stars had written this for us vorosmarty said the carriage stopped vorosmarty opened the door here we are in the heart of the city come out representative of kuusamo and lagoas come see what your sorcery has wrought fernao got out and looked around he wished he didnt have to breathe the smell was so thick he was sure it would soak into the fabric of his tunic and kilt here where the sorcery had been strongest the flames hottest and thickest next to nothing remained standing buildings had melted and puddled the sun sparkled off curves of resolidified stone as smooth as glass perhaps a quarter of a mile away something had been massive enough to stay partly upright despite everything the spell had done pointing toward those ruins fernao asked what was that the look vorosmarty gave him was so savage he took an involuntary half step back what was that the gyongyosian echoed nothing much outlanderno nothing much only the palace of the ekrekeks since time out of mind and the central communing place of the stars he scowled again this time at himself this language does not let me say how much that means or even the thousandth part of it may i go there fernao asked you are the conqueror you may go where you please vorosmarty replied when fernao started straight toward the ruined palace though his guide said you would be wise to stay on the streets as best you can some of the melted stone is but a crust your foot may go through as with thin ice and you would cut yourself badly thank you fernao said and then i did not suppose that would make you unhappy it would not vorosmarty said frankly but you might blame me for not having warned you and since you are the conqueror who knows what you might order done to me and to this land fernao hadnt thought of that you dont make the best conqueror do you he thought he hadnt had much practice for the role picking his way with care he started toward what remained of the very heart of gyorvar when he got to the palace he found people going in and out through an openinga doorway he supposed though no sign of a door remainedin a wall vorosmarty said something in gyongyosian one of the men nearby answered back what does he say fernao asked this sergeant says he saw what you did to becsehely vorosmarty replied he says he wishes everyone would have heeded the warning the sergeant added something else again vorosmarty translated he says it is even worse close up than it was from the kuusaman ship fernao ducked into the palace though the walls had held out the worst of the sorcerous fire not much inside remained intact maybe the gongs had already carried out what they could salvage maybe there hadnt been much worth salvaging vorosmarty said you did this to us lagoan your folk and the kuusamans now a new starless darkness walks the earth one day maybe it will stop at setubal i hope not fernao said i hope we are coming out of the darkness of these years just past vorosmarty held his peace but he did not look convinced well he wouldnt fernao thought somehow that left him less happy less secure than he would have liked after such a triumph from the crenelated battlements of his castle skarnu looked out over his new marquisate the castle on high ground was admirably sited for defense the traitorous simanu and enkurus ancestors had known what they were doing when they built here not till eggtossers came along would anyone have had much chance of taking this place merkela came up beside him and pointed to where fields ended and forest began a mile or two away that was where we settled simanu she said good riddance to him too aye skarnu put his arm around her its over now weve won nobodys at war with anybody anywhere in the world he shook his head half in sorrow half in wonder and how long has it been since the last time that was so his wife shrugged she didnt worry much about the world at large her worries as usual lay closer to home there are still collaborators loose we have to smoke them out aye skarnu repeated it did need doing but fewer people these days still shared merkelas zeal a lot of them wanted nothing more than to go back to living their lives as if the derlavaian war had never happened as day followed day skarnu found it harder and harder to blame them merkela said did you see the news sheet that came yesterday they put that woman in the witness box against lurcanio she still refused to call krasta skarnus sister when she hated she did a thorough job i saw it skarnu answered with a sigh at least the news of peace pushed it to the back pages every time i think weve had all the embarrassment were going to get from that i turn out to be wrong it doesnt look like theyll summon you merkela said no it doesnt skarnu agreed im not really surprised the only dealings i ever had with the redhead were the kind the people on opposite sides in a war usually have he played by the rules then i hope they call vatsyunas and pernavai his wife said they can tell the judges what the algarvians did to kaunians in forthweg the married couple had been aboard the leyline caravan skarnu and merkela helped sabotage as it went past her farm if that caravan hadnt been sabotaged all the captives aboard it would have been sacrificed for their life energy as things were a good many of them had scattered over the valmieran countryside vatsyunas and pernavai had worked on merkelas farm for a while and had both worked with the underground too what i remember about vatsyunas is the way he spoke valmieran skarnu said that got a smile and a nod from merkela stern as she was she couldnt deny vatsyunas had sounded pretty funny his birthspeech of course was classical kaunian hed known not a word of valmieran one of the old tongues daughters when he found himself here in learning hed seemed like a man stuck in time halfway between the days of the kaunian empire and the modern world hed make himself understood merkela said and he would be able to testify from the other side about what the redheads did to folk of kaunian blood aye but would he be able to testify that lurcanio had anything to do with the caravan he was on skarnu asked i dont know merkela replied and i dont much care either all i care about is that all the redheads get whats coming to them i hope the soldiers in algarve are taking plenty of hostages and i hope theyre blazing them too shed lost her first husband when mezentios men took him hostage and blazed him if they hadnt seized gedominu after whom shed named her son she wouldnt be wed to skarnu now and wouldnt be a marchioness skarnu wondered if she ever thought about that after a moment he also wondered if it was true he and merkela had been drawn to each other before the redheads took gedominu what would have happened if they hadnt no way to know would they have kept on holding back or would they have lain together even with gedominu still there what would he have done if they had looked the other way maybehed been twice merkelas age but maybe not too he might have come after both of them with a hatchet or with a stick skarnu shrugged it hadnt happened it belonged in the vague ghostly forest of mighthavebeens along with such things as valmiera holding her own against algarve and magic being impossible they might be interesting to think about but they werent real and never would be merkela said im going down to tend to the herb garden all right skarnu answered but dont you think the cooks helper could handle the job well enough maybe but maybe not too his wife said im sure i know at least as much about it as she does and i dont care to sit around twiddling my thumbs all day i was taking care of an herb garden as soon as i was big enough to know how why should i stop doing it now because noblewomen dont do such things because it makes the servitors nervous when they do skarnu might have thought that but he didnt say it it made sense to him he knew it would have made perfect sense to krasta but he also knew it would have been meaningless to merkela as shed said shed worked since she got big enough to do it stopping because her social class had changed was beyond her mental horizon come to that skarnu himself had been more useless back in priekule before the war than he was here and now he looked out over his domain everything he could see near enough was his to administer true that would have meant more a few centuries earlier when being a marquis was like being a king in small king gainibu held the ultimate authority here these days and skarnu was no rebellious vassal but he still had low justice in this domainsubject to an appeal to the kings courts but such appeals were rare and he was doing his best to get to the bottom of real cases of collaboration and to make sure people didnt launch false accusations to pay back old enemies hed fined a couple of people for doing exactly that and dared hope the rest would get the message high overhead a goshawk called out kyekyekye the hawk had a better view than skarnu did and better eyes too in the old days skarnu thought i might have flown a bird like that at game falconry though was one thing of which he knew nothing he laughed softly i have enough trouble keeping merkelas feathers unruffled that was a joke but it also held no small amount of truth his wife was as she was and nothing he could do would change her very much hed taken a while to realize that but was convinced hed touched truth there so far as he could tell merkela hadnt tried very hard to make him over maybe that showed good sense maybe it just showed shed been married once before he waved up toward the goshawk the bird of course paid him no attention it rode the breeze that ruffled his hair the air was its element as the ground was his good hunting he called to it and he went down the spiral stair to his own proper place they made them turn this way so attackers would have the wall hampering their right arms while defenders could freely swing their swords he thought even in the longgone days they worried about tactics when he came down into the main hall valmiru the butler said im glad to see you your excellency his tone implied id have come to get you if youd stayed up there much longer are you skarnu asked suspiciously any time a servitor used a tone like that it made him doubt he was glad to see the said servitor whats gone wrong now valmiru gave him an appreciative nod a gentlemana country gentleman requests a few moments of your time he coughed his request was ah rather urgent your excellency a junior servant piped up he said hed whale the stuffing out of anybody who got in his way hes drunk as a lord he is then realizing he hadnt picked the best simile he gulped begging your pardon your excellency its all right skarnu turned to the butler and what is this country gentlemans name and why does he want to see me so badly he called himself zemaitu sir valmiru answered he would not tell me precisely what he wants whatever it is though he is most emphatic in wanting it and he is indeed somewhat elevated by spirits well ill listen to him skarnu said if hes too greatly elevated well just throw him out after his time in the army and the underground dealing with one drunken peasant didnt worry him but when he saw zemaitu he had second thoughts here stood a bear of a man taller than skarnu and broad as an unkerlanter through the shoulders by the aroma that hovered around him he might have come straight from a distillery he gave skarnu a clumsy bow youve got to help me your excellency he said his voice was surprisingly high and light for a man of his bulk i will if i can skarnu answered what am i supposed to help you about though till i know that i dont know what i can do i want to marry my sweetheart zemaitu said i want to but her old man wont let me even though we made our promises back before the war a tear ran down his stubbly cheek he was very drunk indeed why wont he skarnu asked he thought he could guess the answer one of them wouldbe groom or prospective fatherinlaw was accusing the other of getting too cozy with the redheads and that turned out to be close though not quite on the mark i was in the army zemaitu said and i got captured when mezentios whoresons broke through in the north i spent a while in a captives camp in algarve and then they put me to work on a farm there growing things so their men could go off and fight and now draskas pa he says i sucked up to the algarvians and he dont want me in the family no more you got to help me your excellency sir what in blazes could i have done but work where they told me to thats all you did you worked on a farm skarnu asked sternly by the powers above sir i swear it zemaitu said you got a mage sir he can see for hisself i aint no liar not me a truth spell was a simple thing skarnu set a hand on the peasants shoulder well do that he said not because i dont believe you but to convince your sweethearts father when you were in their power they could set you to work where they pleased youre lucky they didnt do worse to you i know that sir zemaitu said i know that now all right then ill settle it skarnu said zemaitu started sniffling again skarnu clapped him on the back sometimes his post was worth having eighteen good day to you valamo said in classical kaunian as talsu walked into the kuusaman tailors shop good day to you sir talsu answered in kuusaman a word a phrase a conjugation at a time he was picking up the language of the land that had taken him in the flat vowels some short some long still felt strange in his mouth but people understood him when he spoke unless they slowed down for him though he had trouble understanding them how are you today valamo asked switching to kuusaman himself i am well thank you talsu came out with another stock phrase then he had to fall back on classical kaunian what is there for me to do today some leggings a cape to finish a few other things valamo said also in the old tongue he smiled at talsu since you taught me that wonderful charm we get more done in less time talsu smiled back and managed a dutiful nod he still had mixed feelings about that charm it was everything the algarvian whod taught it to his father and him said it would be if only he hadnt learned it from a redhead the spell itself was surely clean but hadnt it grown in tainted soil well to work he said pushing down his qualms as he did almost every day he had that bit of kuusaman down solid valamo said it at any excuse or none talsus new boss was a sunnier man than his own father but no less dedicated to doing what needed doing and making sure everyone else did too talsu asked what do you want me to do first he could never go wrong there either even if he did have to say it in classical kaunian do the cape valamo told him once you get done with that tell me and i will see what wants doing next that was also in classical kaunian talsu could answer in kuusaman and did all right he was busy working on the capea much heavier garment than anyone in jelgava would have worn and one more like those hed made for algarvian soldiers bound for unkerlantwhen the bell above the door to valamos shop chimed when talsu looked up he started in alarm for he thought the man walking into the shop was himself an algarvian the fellow was a tall redhead and wore a tunic and kilt but he also had narrow eyes set on a slant and wore his hair gathered in a neat ponytail at the nape of his neck a lagoan talsu realized and let out a sigh of relief if he was a lagoan though he spoke excellent kuusamanspoke it too fast for talsu to follow in fact he blinked when valamo turned to him and said he does not want to talk to me he wants to talk to you to me talsu said startled into jelgavan switching to classical kaunian he nodded to the newcomer what do you want sir can you follow my valmieran the fellow asked talsu nodded his own tongue and that of the other kaunian kingdom in the east were close kin good the redheaded man said i want you to make me a wedding suit a wedding suit talsu echoed still taken aback then his wits started to work why me you seem to know who i am aye i do the lagoan answered you see the woman i am marrying is named pekka he waited to see if that would get a reaction from talsu oh talsu exclaimed please make her happy ah my name is fernao the lagoan said thank you master fernao talsu said please make her happy i owe her so much if it werent for her i would still be sitting in a jelgavan dungeon i translated your wifes letter fernao told him she had a little something to do with this too then i thank you too sir talsu said if i had my own shop i would be proud to make you your suit for nothing as things are he glanced over toward valamo i did not come in here for that fernao said i can afford to pay you and to pay your boss talsus boss took advantage of the pause to ask what is going on i see the two of you know each other but i cannot follow the language you use he spoke in classical kaunian fernao started to reply in the same language he used it more fluently than valamo much more fluently than talsubut then switched to kuusaman in which he was also very quick and smooth how many languages does he know talsu wondered he wished fernao hadnt switched to kuusaman it gave him no chance to follow what was going on valamo went back to classical kaunian this is your friend then i would like to think so aye talsu answered in the same tongue i would be honored to think so i would like to think so too fernao said with algarvic courtesy he bowed talsu nodded in return hes not an algarvian he reminded himself all the redheaded kingdoms have some of the same customs and lagoans helped free jelgava after seeing so much of mezentios men in skrunda he needed the reminder good valamo beamed very good a wedding suit is it that is very good too i am sure talsu will do a splendid job he is a clever fellow as soon as he learns our tongue and saves up a stake he will do very well in a shop of his own a wedding suit his narrow eyes narrowed further shall we speak of price now take the price from my pay talsu said i want to do this no no no fernao shook his head i will go somewhere else before i let that happen i want to bring you business not to cost you money seeing what i owe the lady you are marrying talsu began hush valamo said sharply he has said he will pay good enoughhe will pay sure enough the tailor was all business but just when that thought went through talsus mind valamo went on i will offer some discountsay one part in four now fernao bowed to him that is very generous sir we have several styles valamo said while the gentleman is here i will show him some of the possibilities he took a big book off a shelf and opened it on the counter sir if you would aye and you too talsu you should get a notion of what you will be doing with a sheepish smile talsu said i certainly should i have to find out what a kuusaman wedding suit looks like i do not makehave not madea kuusaman wedding suit before now to fernao valamo added understand these are only for guidance if what you see does not please you or if you want to combine two styles you do see we can do that too fernao studied the illustrations so did talsu to him the clothes kuusamans wore to get married were ridiculously gaudy but nobody wanted his opinion fernao pointed to one and said this ought to suit me you are a man of taste valamo said that is a very fine style for a man who is tall and slim as you are except for my eyes i am never going to look like most kuusamans fernao said but this should do well enough not all of us look like me valamo said generously most aye but not all you have that lagoan accent and i do not suppose you will lose it but how did you come to speak kuusaman like a man from the south coast most foreigners try to talk like folk from yliharma fernao laughed that is because of the company i keep my fiancée is from kajaani i see i see valamo laughed too aye that makes sense to talsu he said you see here is another foreigner who has learned our tongue you can do it too i hope so talsu said he asked fernao how long did it take you to feel comfortable speaking kuusaman every day somewhere between one year and two fernao answered at first i would have to use classical kaunian for words i did not know in kuusaman and i should warn you that you may not learn as fast as i did for i am good with languages but he is also a younger man than you valamo said he has time to learn i am no scholar talsu said but i am doing my best what more can a man do the kuusaman tailor responded now do your best to measure the gentleman one moment fernao said first a part in four off a price of the haggle quickly went from classical kaunian into kuusaman talsu knew his numbers so he could follow pieces of it he did his best to pick up other words from context he thought he learned the term for swindler which struck him as a useful thing to know but the kuusaman tailor and the lagoan didnt start screaming at each other even if they did throw insults around as talsu had seen algarvians gotor at least actedmuch more excited in a dicker bargain valamo said at last and stuck out a hand fernao took it to talsu valamo said what are you standing there for get to work he bared his teeth in a smile to show he meant it for a joke or at least some of a joke talsu took out the tape measure now i will measure you if you put your tunic on this hanger sir so i can get the most accurate measurements in valmieran fernao said i am not used to having people as tall as i am around me here in kuusamo i understand that talsu answered in jelgavan children here often think i am something very strange i have had that happen too fernao said at least they would not suspect you of being an algarvian well no talsu said raise your arm if you please sir i need another measurement when he was through he nodded to the lagoan that will be all for now i expect i can have your suit ready for you in a week or so good enough fernao said thank you very much he reclaimed his tunic donned it again and left the shop that was a nice bit of business he just brought us even with the discount valamo said so it was talsu said doing it will be a pleasure a man should enjoy his work the kuusaman tailor agreed a man should also make money at his work the lagoan gentleman understood that you should too if i have to choose between money and friendship i know what my choice will be talsu said if he is going to wed the woman who helped me escape from that dungeon i owe him everything i can give him you owe him your best work he owes you a fair price valamo said he will pay one now you have to do your best for him i intend to talsu said good before long you will be working for yourself in your own shop your labor is all you have make it as good as you know how but do not give very much of it away or you will not eat good advice talsu said let me see the patterns for the style he picked out please valamo passed him the book hed never tried anything so complicated not on his own but he thought he could do it he went into the back of the shop to see exactly what fabric he had available then settled down and got to work bembo hadnt wanted to come back to duty on night patrol but he didnt dare complain from captain sassos point of view he supposed putting him here on the schedule made sense sasso already had a solid rotation of constables nobody much cared to go out at night so why not give the newcomer that shift ill tell you why not bembo thought if i trip over a high cobblestone i didnt see in the dark and break my leg again ill be very annoyed but he couldnt say that to sasso for fear the captain would tell him he couldnt do the job six years had gone by near enough since hed had the night shift when the war was new things had been pretty quiet then and were pretty quiet now for the same reason a curfew was in force kuusaman patrols also tramped the streets bembo had had to show them his badge once already tonight he didnt care for that but liked the idea of getting blazed even less tricarico wasnt black now as it had been when the derlavaian war was new no enemy dragons flew overhead ready to drop eggs on the city but more than a few enemy dragons now ate their stupid heads off on algarvian territory if bembos people ever thought of rising up against their occupiers he shuddered the idea of suicide had never appealed to him he strode up the street toward the stump of the old kaunian column in the center of town the column itself had come down while he was in forthweg razed by the algarvians not by enemy action not much from the kaunian past survived in tricarico these days not much in all of algarve from what hed heard the stump was bare plain marble about as tall as a man the reliefs above it gone beyond the remains of the column somebody moved bembos stick was in his hand on the instant who goes he said sharply its only me a womans voice answered you wouldnt do anything to bother me now would you who the blazes bembo burst out but the voice was familiar fiametta is that you well who else would it be sweetheart she said as she came around what was left of the column her tunic might have been painted on her kilt barely covered her shapely backside bembo she asked stopping short in surprise when she recognized him i thought you were dead not quite bembo said what are you doing out after curfew you ought to know better than that what do you think i was doing fiametta twitched her hips i was working thats what ill go along home like a good little girl i promise bembo barked laughter you havent been a good little girl since you got too big to make messes in your drawers i caught you out right about here back when the war started remember i ought to run you in you wouldnt do that the courtesan exclaimed in dismay why wouldnt i bembo said you know what time it is youre out late you cant very well say i beat your door down and dragged you out of bed have a heart bembo fiametta said bembo just stood there looking official the woman muttered something under her breath he couldnt make out what which was probably just as well she sighed look suppose i give you some too will you leave me alone then it wouldnt be the first time you know he didnt even think about saffa constables and courtesans made bargains like this all the time now youre talking he said they found an alley where the street lights didnt reach when bembo came out a few minutes later he was whistling fiametta he supposed headed to her home or maybe just to another paying job he wondered what she would do if she ran into a kuusaman patrol from everything hed seen the kuusamans didnt make deals like that the rest of his shift passed less enjoyably but he didnt have to do much that suited him fine the sun climbed up over the bradano mountains he met his relief on the streets then made his way back to the constabulary station to check out as he neared the stairs a skinny old man came up the street from the other direction the fellow called his name aye thats me bembo answered who are you curfew doesnt end for another hour or so if this fellow had no good explanation for being out and about hed grab him and haul him in that would show people what a diligent fellow he was you dont know me the skinny man looked down at himself well i cant say im surprised there was more of me when we saw each other last bembos jaw dropped sergeant pesaro powers above if this isnt old home week i dont know what but you were in gromheort how did you get out alive pesaro shrugged i hadnt quite starved to death when the unkerlanters took the placeadvantage to being fat you knowand the fellow i surrendered to let me do it instead of blazing me i got lucky there i know they didnt feed me much in the captives camp but they finally let most of us goeasier than hanging on to us i expect ive walked across most of algarve to get here on account of an awful lot of the ley lines still arent working the way theyre supposed to you were lucky bembo said if you want to call it that pesaro answered how about you you were in eoforwic when the unkerlanters took it so i didnt think id ever see your ugly mug again i got woundedbroken legwhen the unkerlanter attack opened up bembo said we still had a line of retreat open from the town so they shipped me out i dont think oraste got away well he always was a tough bastard pesaro said if swemmels men caught him hell have the chance to prove it and if they didnt catch him hes bound to be dead bembo climbed the stairs and held the door open come on sergeant show em you still know whats what all i know is im cursed glad im still breathing pesaro said as he wearily joined bembo at the top of the stairs there were plenty of times when i didnt think i would be who you jawing with bembo the desk sergeant asked you arrest somebody no sergeant bembo answered look heres sergeant pesaro back from the west if he can make it back maybe more people will sergeant pesaro the desk sergeant sounded as if he couldnt believe his ears he got up and stared at pesaro why by the powers above it is welcome home sergeant always good news when another one comes back he glanced over at bembo well almost always and i love you too sergeant bembo said sweetly hearing pesaros name brought constables and clerks out from the back rooms of the constabulary station they pounded the newcomers back clasped his wrist and congratulated him on coming home again they never paid that much attention to me bembo thought resentfully but then he smiled to himself let them fuss as much as they want ive got saffa warming my bed and pesaro wont be able to match thator hed better not anyhow even captain sasso who was in early came down from his lofty office to greet pesaro good to see you too captain pesaro said i wondered if i ever would after you sent me west that brought a moment of silence bembo hadnt dared say any such thing to sasso the constabulary captain licked his lips everyone waited to hear how he would answer at last he said well sergeant back then none of us thought things would turn out the way they did now it was pesaros turn to think things over grudgingly he nodded all right captain thats fair enough i guess when bembo went back to his flat he found saffa getting ready to go in to work she burst into tears when he told her pesaro had come back to tricarico she seemed so delighted bembo wondered if she had slept with the sergeant before he went west but then saffa said if he can come home she didnt finish the sentence but she didnt have to if he can come home my little bastards daddy can come home too and then the powers below eat you bembo that was what she meant that or something enough like it not to matter bembo almost said something sharp in return but at the last minute he decided to keep his mouth shutsomething that came close to constituting an unnatural act for an algarvian he kissed her patted her on the backside yawned and headed for the bedroom he was tired saffa he thought gave him a grateful look for not picking a fight just before he fell asleep he heard the door close as she went off to the constabulary station he got a rather different welcome when he came back to his flat a couple of mornings later saffa stood just inside the doorway you son of a whore she shouted and slapped him in the face hard enough to rock him back on his heels you stick it into that cheap slut and then you want to touch me not futtering likely she belted him again backhand this time though his ears rang he did ask the right question what in blazes are you talking about hed nearly said how did you know that would have lost the game before it even started but asking the right question didnt do him a bit of good for saffa ground out fiametta told adonio what you did and adonio brought the lovely news back to the station and now everybody there must know it and if you think youll ever lay a finger on me again let alone anything else she swung at him again he caught her by the wrist when he didnt let go right away she tried to bite his hand stop that powers below eat you he said i can expl i dont want to hear it saffa said i never want to hear it youre not even wasting time telling me its all a lie she tried to twist away he didnt let go she snarled youd better turn me loose bembo or ill really start screaming all right bitch he said but if you try and take my head off again i promise youll lose teeth got it saffa nodded warily even more warily bembo let go of her arm she took a quick step back i spent most of the night getting my stuff out of this place she said i have to see you at the station but thats all i have to do as far as im concerned youre dead dead do you hear me curse it saffa all i did was screw a tart the first chance you got no thanks pal you dont play those games with me nobody plays those games with me but sweetheart bembo whined i really love you did he he doubted it but knew he had to sound as if he did it was just one of those things he even made the ultimate sacrifice darling im sorry sorry till the next time you think you can get it wet on the side goodbye saffa hyphenated the two syllables by slamming the door so hard the frame quivered bembo stood staring at it for several heartbeats then he walked into the flats little kitchen poured himself a glass of spirits and drank it down all alone ceorl scratched at his cheeks hed been doing that for days now and cursing and fuming every time he did it this fornicating itch is driving me out of my mind he said i dont know what im going to do about it one of the unkerlanter gang bossesone of the few captives who ranked as ceorls equal in the cinnabar minesaid why dont you cut your throat then we wont have to listen to you anymore but even he smiled when he said it he didnt want trouble from ceorl nobody not captives not guards wanted trouble from ceorl another unkerlanter one less prominent in the camp hierarchy said why dont you cut off that ugly beard maybe that would do some good it sure looks like youve got the mange it does not ceorl said indignantly he was right too he had a fine thick curly beard but he could have kissed that unkerlanterhed been waiting for days for somebody to suggest shaving to him he scratched again then cursed again powers above maybe i will cut it off anything would be better than what im going through now whos got a razor he can lend me the gang boss said youll need a scissors first to get that mess short enough so a razor will cut it if you say so ceorl answered i dont know anything about this shaving business i really may cut my throat he didnt get the chance to find out for another couple of days he carefully spent all that time grumbling about how his face itched when he got a scissors and a broken piece of mirror to guide his hand he snipped away at the whiskers hed never done more than trim before by the time he set down the scissors he was shaking his head i really do look mangy now the unkerlanter called fariulf handed him a straight razor and a cup of water to wet down what was left of his whiskers you wont once youre done here he said ceorl rapidly discovered he despised shaving he cut himself several times the razor scraped over his face had he really had an itchy skin he was sure what he was doing would only have made things worse his hide in fact did itch and sting by the time he got done he shook his head again people have to be out of their cursed minds to want to do this every day reaching for the scrap of mirror he added how do i look his unkerlanter was still foul he knew that people mostly understood him now though somebodysomebody behind him whom he couldnt note said youre still ugly but not the same way looking into the mirror ceorl had to admit that wasnt far wrong a stranger stared back at him a man with a thrusting chin with a cleft in it hollows below his cheekbones and a scar above his upper lip hed never seen before he hadnt shown the world his bare face since he was a boy he looked as if hed suddenly got five years younger he also looked like an unkerlanter not a forthwegian how does it feel fariulf asked lousy ceorl thought but that was the wrong answer he splashed a little water from the cup onto his abused face and ran the palm of his hand over his cheeks and chin his skin felt as strange to him as it looked making himself smile he said i think its better im going to have to keep doing this acquiring a razor of his own didnt take long unkerlanter miners died all the time survivors split what little they had they werent supposed to have razors but the guards usually winked at thatpicks and shovels and crowbars made weapons at least as dangerous one of those razors ended up in ceorls hands little by little he learned to shave without turning his face into a mass of raw meat one afternoon he took sudaku aside and said when i give you the word im going to want you and the boys to screw up the count ah the blond from the phalanx of valmiera nodded unsurprised going to disappear are you i dont know what youre talking about ceorl answered he slapped sudaku on the back i wish you could come along but it wouldnt work you know he wasnt even lying kaunian or not sudaku made a pretty good righthand man but sudaku was a kaunian a blond if he escaped from this mine from this captives camp he couldnt possibly pretend to be an unkerlanter ceorl could good luck sudaku told him and sounded as if he meant it thanks ceorl said ill let you know when sudaku nodded ceorl knew he was taking a chance by saying even this much but judged he could trust sudaku so far and the longer the head start he and fariulf got when they broke out of this mining compound the better the chance they had of getting away clean if ceorl hadnt believed in taking risks he never would have become a robber or joined plegmunds brigade then he had to get as ready as he could saving food wasnt easy not when the captives got barely enough to keep them alive still and all he managed to accumulate a good many little bricks of black bread they would be stale and hard by the time he made his move but he would still be able to eat them he hoped fariulf was making similar preparations he hoped so but he didnt try to find out if fariulf wasnt ready once they broke out too bad for him ceorl bided his time when he did make the move he knew it would have to succeed if it didnt he would never see a second chance fariulf kept asking when when ill tell you when ceorl answered dont hop out of your tunic waiting paid off a couple of weeks after he started shaving the runs went through the camp most of the time men needed leave to visit the latrine trenches when they were liable to foul themselves if they waited the guards waived the rule it wasnt for the sake of the miners ceorl knew as much it was so the guards wouldnt have to smell the stink or watch where they put their feet why mattered little to him the waiver did he sidled up to fariulf in the mine and said tonight a couple of hours after midnight the unkerlanter nodded without looking up hed learned such lessons as a captives life could teach him later that day ceorl managed to whisper a couple of words in sudakus ear tomorrow morning the blond didnt even nod he just gave ceorl the sort of wave he would have used in the field to show hed understood an order this may work ceorl thought and then it had better work even in the middle of the night he wasnt the only one heading for the latrine trenches he didnt want to think about what easing himself would be like in the middle of winter he didnt intend to be here to find out he didnt hurry to the stinking trenches before long fariulf caught up with him what now the unkerlanter asked now you get a guard to pay attention to you ceorl answered i dont care how you go about itjust do it once you manage it we go from there right fariulf said then he added the same thought ceorl had had earlier in the day this had better work you arent taking any chances i aint ceorl said fariulf nodded out beyond the slit trenches guards paced beyond a deadline marked off by a rail fence any captive who crossed the deadline got blazed so camp rules said ceorl had other ideas fariulf squatted over a trench and started moaning and grunting in such a good simulation of agony that even ceorl who knew better wanted to do something for him when a guard drew near fariulf moaned i want to go to the infirmary ive got to go to the infirmary shut up the guard said but his steps slowed fariulf didnt shut up he kept on giving a splendid impression of a man in distress the guard never noticed ceorl sliding under the fence ceorl had had practice killing men silently before joining plegmunds brigade and much more practice since he slid up behind the unkerlanter clapped a hand over his mouth and drew the razor across his throat even he had trouble hearing the whimpering gurgle that was the only sound the fellow made he eased the body to the ground picked up the guards stick and started walking his beat fariulf rose and hurried over to him stay down ceorl hissed dont draw eyes fariulf flattened out on the ground ceorl gave him a kick in the ribs to remind him to keep low get going ill be along he marched along till he saw another guard coming out of the darkness and made sure the other fellow saw him then he turned as if going back along the beat he almost went past the spot where hed killed the guard fariulf had dragged the corpse somewhere out of the way efficiency ceorl muttered nearly too much efficiency he hurried out and soon caught up with the unkerlanter the trenches and fences around the mine were designed to keep captives in before the war they probably would have done a good enough job they werent adequate for confining men whod faced worse barricades and better manned ones in unkerlant and forthweg and yanina and algarve ceorl killed another guard on the way out again without a sound were leaving a trail fariulf said did you want him to nab us ceorl snarled and the unkerlanter shook his head for all of king swemmels preaching about efficiency the guards took a long time to realize anything was amiss ceorl and fariulf were out of the enclosure around the cinnabar mine by then looking around for somewhere to lie up during the approaching day i didnt think it would be this easy fariulf said why doesnt everybody escape most people are sheep ceorl said scornfully would you have tried breaking out if i hadnt pushed you a troubled look on his face fariulf shook his head but the search once it started was not to be despised no matter how sudaku muddled the count two dead guards got noticed dragons circled low overhead teams of guards swept through the hills had ceorl and fariulf not learned their trade in a harder school than this they might have been taken that first day as things were they stayed hidden in scrubby bushes and pushed north after nightfall fariulf did have food of his own which was as well for ceorl had no intention of giving him any of his to ceorls amazement fariulf had no idea where in his own kingdom the mamming hills lay once we get over the wolter well be back in regular country without all these bastards snooping around ceorl said inspectors are everywhere fariulf told him sadly the warning made ceorl fight shy of approaching the few herdsmen he saw in the hills perhaps it didnt make him wary enough though he and fariulf were nearing the wolter when dogs started baying close behind them a moment later men shouted their voices harsh as crows caws theyve seen us fariulf said panic in his voice ceorl shoved the unkerlanter away split up he said itll be harder for them to catch us both what he expected was that the pursuer would go after fariulf for the other man wasnt so good in open country as he was himself maybe fariulf had been an irregular but he hadnt learned enough so ceorl thought but the men in rockgray came after him instead some of them were veterans too he could tell by the way they spread out and came forward in waves making him keep his head down he blazed one at close range anyhow then whirled and blazed another when he whirled again a beam caught him in the chest as he crumpled he thought maybe living in a cage wouldnt have been so bad after all but as hed given no second chances he got none darkness swallowed him garivald stared at the wolter hed never imagined a river could be so widehe hadnt been able to see out when the leyline caravan car took him over it to the mine in the mamming hills he wasnt a bad swimmer but knew he would drown if he tried to cross it if he stayed here on the south bank the guards would hunt him down he was sure of that too even if they hadnt pursued him after he left ceorl i need a boat he thought he saw none though at night that proved little a big one might have been tied up a quarter of a mile away and he would never have known it he doubted one was swemmels men knew more about efficiency than to make things easy for their captives a raft he thought a tree trunk anything to keep me afloat he wondered what he would do even if he got to the far bank of the wolter he had no money he had nothing in fact except his boots the ragged tunic on his back and a rapidly dwindling store of bread before long he would have to start stealing food from the local peasants and herders if he did that he knew he wouldnt last long he wrapped brush around himselfa miserable bed but better than bare groundand went to sleep when i wake up maybe everything will be all right he thought he had no idea why hed come up with such a preposterous unlikelihood but if he hadnt believed it would he have tried to escape with the forthwegian a shout thin in the distance threw him out of sleep a little before sunrise the next day he sprang up ready to flee had they found his trail after all but the shout came from the river not the land garivald realized as much when he heard it again this time fully conscious he stared out toward the wolter his jaw dropped he began giggling as if suddenly stricken mad maybe i was he thought giddily maybe im not really seeing this hed hoped for a tree trunk to help him cross the river never in all the days of the world he told himself had such a hope been so extravagantly fulfilled thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousandsfor all garivald knew millionsof felled trees floated on the wolter drifting downstream toward what sawmills he supposed he wondered why anyone would have cared to build sawmills on a river sure to freeze up in winter maybe those sawmills were like the mines a scheme to get some use out of captives instead of just killing them outright or maybe king swemmel had simply pointed at a map and said build sawmills here if he had the sawmills would have gone up regardless of whether the wolter froze here and there tiny in the distance insignificant among the countless trunks of the floating forest men with poles rode logs somehow staying upright now and again they would use the poles to keep the tree trunks from jamming together it was one of their shouts that garivald had heard he didnt waste more than a couple of minutes gawping how long would that seemingly endless stream of trees endure if it passed without his taking advantage of it how long would he have to wait till another one came down the wolter too longhe was sure of that when he got down to the riverbank he shed his boots pulled his tunic off over his head and plunged into the wolter although it flowed from down out of the warmer north its waters still chilled him he struck out toward the immense swarm of logs before long garivald wondered if hed made a dreadful mistake going from log to log across the river hadnt seemed so hard till he tried it not getting crushed by all that floating drifting timber was a lot harder than hed imagined hed made it perhaps halfway through the logs when one of the men riding herd on them spotted him what in blazes are you doing here you son of a whore the fellow bawled getting away from the mines garivald shouted back if the logrider came over to try to seize him hed do his best to drown the man but the fellow with the pole only waved when he heard that good luck pal he said me i never saw you my brother went into the mines almost ten years ago and he never came out powers above there are some decent people in this kingdom after all garivald thought as he went on toward the far bank of the wolter after the way hed got dragged into the armyand after the way hed been seized coming out of it hed had his doubts he couldnt dwell on that though for he had to scramble to keep an oncoming log from crushing him to jelly against the one he was riding he went from one log to another and then quite suddenly no more logs remained between him and the far bank which was now the near bank he swam till his feet hit bottom then he waded ashore and redonned his sodden tunic and even soggier boots his belly growled the bread hadnt survived the trip across the wolter he trudged away from the stream hoping to find a road or a village when he saw a man working in a field he waved and called ill do whatever you need for a supper and a chance to sleep in a barn the farmer looked him over he still wasnt dry nor anywhere close to it what happened to you the fellow asked looks like you fell in a creek oh you might say so garivald agreed drylyhis words made the grade even if he didnt or so he thought till the farmer screwed up his face and said youre not from around these parts i dont reckon no garivald admitted what he could hardly denyhe did sound like a grelzer he came out with the best excuse he could im just anothersoldier who got dumped in the wrong place trying to get back to my own farm and my own woman huh the local looked toward the wolter there was garivald realized bound to be a reward for men who turned in escaped captives but the farmer said so youve got a place of your own eh well prove it after grubbing cinnabar out of a vein with pick and crowbar farm work wasnt so bad when the sun swung to the west garivald followed the farmer back to his hut he got a big bowl of barley porridge with onions and dill and sausage and a mug of ale to wash it down set beside the little bricks of bread and famine stews in the mines it seemed the best meal hed ever eaten he did sleep in an outbuilding next to a couple of cows he didnt care when morning came the farmer gave him another bowl of porridge a length of sausage to take with him and a couple of coins tears came to garivalds eyes i cant pay this back he said pay it forward the local told him someday youll run into another poor bastard down on his luck now go on before somebody gets a good look at you day by day garivald worked his way north and east toward the duchy of grelz most people he thought took him for an escapee but no one turned him in to swemmels inspectors he got meals he got money he got shelter and he got a good look at what the war had done to this part of unkerlant what hed seen in grelz suddenly didnt seem so dreadful the city of durrwangen was still in ruins plenty of labor gangs were slowly putting the place back together again captives didnt man all of them garivald got the idea that king swemmel didnt have enough captives to do all the things he wanted to do he joined a gang that paid a littlenot much but a little hed had plenty of practice in zossen at making a little stretch before too long hed saved enough silver for a leyline caravan fare to linnich and then when he went to the depot in durrwangen to buy the fare he bought it for tegeler the next town northwest of linnichhe remembered the name from his journey back from algarve someone in linnich might be looking for him no one in tegeler would be the price went up a little but he reckoned it silver well spent when he climbed down from the caravan car in tegeler he saw a lounger keeping an eye on people descending but the lounger had never seen him before and had no reason to suspect him of anything aye he was ragged and none too clean but a lot of men on the leyline caravan could have used a bath and new clothes he started for linnich on foot he didnt know exactly how far it was if hed had to guess he would have said about twenty miles it proved farther than that for he needed a day and a half to get there he had no trouble cadging a couple of meals along the way for one thing there were no works with lots of captives anywhere close by for another his grelzer accent sounded just like everyone elses hereabouts garivald didnt go into linnich but skirted the town maybe dagulf hadnt told the impressers where he was working a farm maybe but he didnt want his former friendor anyone elseto have another chance at betraying him he worried about going back to the farm too did an inspector have an eye on it wondering if hed return how many inspectors did king swemmel have garivald had no idea of one thing he was sure though obilot was all he had left in the world without her he might as well have stayed in the mines the track leading to the farm was as overgrown as it had been the last time hed walked it more than a year before between the impressers whod hauled him into the army what did that mean he couldnt know till he got where he was going which didnt stop him from worrying his heart pounded in his chest as he came round the last bend and saw the farm at last crops are getting ripe he thought and then he spied obilot weeding in the vegetable patch by the farmhouse he didnt see anyone else that had been another worry hed been gone a long time including some little while after the end of the war how could anyone blame her for thinking he was dead she looked up and saw him coming through the fields toward the house the first thing she did was reach for something beside hera stick garivald thought then she checked the motion and got to her feet garivald waved so did obilot she ran to him she almost knocked him off his feet when she took him in her arms but her embrace helped keep him upright i knew you would come back she said i dont know why but i did where else would i come garivald said and kissed her for a long time that dizzied him it felt stronger than spirits but he couldnt afford to get drunk on anything even sensuality now he asked do they watch this place obilots eyes narrowed its like that she said he nodded i havent seen anybody she told him not since dagulf died and that was a while ago now oh garivald said how did that happen nobody seems to know obilot answered not quite innocently enough are we going to have to find another abandoned place and learn new names for ourselves all over again garivald looked around shed done an astonishing job of keeping this farm going all the same he nodded im afraid so a couple of men ended up dead when i got out of the mines mines oh obilot nodded too briskly and without regret all right we do then we can manage im sure of it well have a chance garivald said ingrained peasant pessimism in his voice but then he shrugged in unkerlant a chance was all you could hope for and more than you usually got istvan climbed down from the wagon near the mouth of the valley that held kunhegyes and the neighboring villages thank you kindly for the lift sir he told the driver a graybearded man with stooped shoulders glad to help young fellow the other gyongyosian replied nothings too good for our fighters by the stars youd best believe it uh the war is over istvan saidmaybe the wagon driver hadnt heard we lost he brought the words out painfully they hurt aye but they were true no one whod seen gyorvar could doubt it even for a moment he wished he hadnt seen gyorvar himself he wished he hadnt seen a great many things hed had to see but the driver waved his words away as if they were of no account sooner or later well lick em he declared istvan doubted he had a particular em in mindany enemy of gyongyos would do he wished things still looked so simple to him they never would again the driver flicked his whip and said stars shine bright on you sergeant and on you istvan called as the wagon rattled away shouldering the duffel that held his few belongings he trudged toward kunhegyes he wasnt sure hed been formally discharged from the army back in the coastal lowlands government had been a matter of opinion since the death of ekrekek arpad and the destruction of gyorvar no one in all his long journey east had asked to see his papers he didnt expect anyone here would either he looked around his home valley with wonder on his face hed been back only once since the war began the place had seemed smaller then than when hed gone forth to fight for gyongyos it seemed smaller still now the mountains looming over the narrow bit of land trapped between them mountain apes up there istvan thought hed seen one of those too ive seen too much he looked down at the scar on his left hand the scar that had expiated his goateating and shuddered aye ive seen much too much somewhere back on obudaor more likely back in kuusamo by nowa little slanteyed mage knew what hed done that made him shudder too not that she would ever come to kunhegyesistvan knew better than that but he knew she knew and the knowledge ate at him he might as well have been naked before the world he tramped up to kunhegyes battered old palisade he had a much keener eye for field fortifications than hed owned when he left the village a couple of eggtossers could have knocked it down in nothing flat rocks and bushes within stick range might give marauders cover ill have to talk to somebody he thought never can tell what those whoresons from the next valley overor even from szombathely down the valley from usmight try and do a sentry did pace the palisade that was something istvan wondered how much though had the fellow been more alert he would have already spotted him that thought had hardly gone through istvans mind before the lookout stiffened peered out toward him and called who comes to kunhegyes istvan recognized his voice hail korosi he called back the villager had made his life difficult before hed gone into ekrekek arpads army but hed been mild enough when istvan visited on leave easier to overawe a youth than a veteran on leave istvan supposed is that you istvan korosi said now have you got another leave another leave istvan gaped have the stars addled your wits the wars over havent you heard hed known his home village was backward but this struck him as excessive kun would have laughed and laughed but kun was dead struck down by the sorcery that had slain gyorvar korosi said some commercial traveler tried to tell us that a couple of days ago but we figured it was a pack of lies he spouted all sorts of nonsensethe ekrekek stars love him slain gyorvar gone in a flash of light the goateating unkerlanters licking us in the east us surrendering if you can believe it some of us wanted to pitch him in the creek for that pack of crap but we didnt a good thing too because it isnt crap istvan said and watched the village bruisers jaw drop istvan qualified that well i dont know about swemmels bastards not so i can take oath about it but the rest is true i was stationed near gyorvar i saw the city die and ive been in it since the ekrekeks dead and so is his whole family and we have yieldedit was either that or get another dose of this wizardry i saw a lagoan going through whats left of gyorvar looking to see just what the magic did one of our mages was with him and acting mild as milk youre making that up korosi said in a different tone it could have been an insult even a challenge but istvan had heard men cry no when they knew they were wounded but didnt want to believe it korosis protest was of that sort by the stars korosi its true istvan said let me in the whole village needs to know aye korosi still sounded shaken to the core he descended from the palisade and unbarred the gate it creaked open istvan walked through korosi shut it behind him he looked around i probably wont go far from this place for the rest of my life part of him rejoiced at the realization the rest saw how small and cramped kunhegyes seemed as if crouching behind its palisade true the houses and shops stood well apart from one anothera precaution against ambushesbut they themselves were nothing beside those of gyorvar istvan shook his head no beside what once was in gyorvar only rocks and houses alike melted to slag there now korosis booted feet thumped on the wooden stairs as he went up to the walkway once more people came out into kunhegyes narrow main street istvan found himself the center of a circle of staring eyes some green some blue some brown did i hear you right somebody asked did you tell korosi its over we lost thats right maleter istvan said to the middleaged man it is over we did lose he repeated what had happened to gyorvar and to ekrekek arpad and his kin quietly women began to weep tears didnt suit the men of a warrior race but several of them turned away so no one would have to see them shed any the sounds of mourning drew more folk into the street one of them was the younger of istvans two sisters she shrieked his name and threw herself into his arms are you all right she demanded he stroked her curly tawny hair im fine ilona he said thats not what people are upset about i told them the war was lost is that all she said what difference does that make as long as youre safe istvans first thought was that that was no attitude for a woman from a warrior race to have his second thought was that maybe she owned better sense than a lot of other people in gyongyos remembering what had happened to gyorvar he decided there was no maybe to it whats happened here he asked thats whats really important isnt it it is if i stay here the rest of my days thats certain sure of course it is ilona had no doubts shed never been out of the valley well for one thing sariaistvans other sisteris betrothed to gul the bakers son that weedy little worm istvan exclaimed but he checked himself gul might have been weedy when he went off to war but probably wasnt any more and his father had or had had more money than istvans own what else he asked greatuncle batthyany died last spring his sister told him stars shine bright on his spirit istvan said ilona nodded istvan went on he was full of years did he pass on peacefully aye ilona said he went to sleep one night and he wouldnt wake the next morning cant ask for better than that istvan agreed trying not to think of all the worse deaths hed seen his sister took him by the hand and started dragging him toward the family housemy house again at least for a while he thought she said but what happened to you by the stars istvan we all feared you were dead you never wrote very often but when your letters just plain stopped coming i couldnt write he said i got sent from the woods of unkerlant out to this island in the bothnian ocean we know that ilona said that was when your letters stopped they stopped because i got captured istvan said i was in a kuusaman captives camp on obuda for a long time but then the slanteyes sent me to gyorvar why did they send you there because of something id seen i wasnt the only one they wanted us to warn the ekrekek theyd do the same to gyorvar if he didnt yield to them he didnt and so they did i wish he would have wed all be better off if he would havehim included by that time theyd come to his front door alpri his father was nailing the heel of a boot to the sole the cobbler looked up from his work may i help he began as he would have when anyone walked into the shop that was also a house then he recognized istvan he let out a roar like a tigers rushed around the cobblers bench and squeezed the breath from his son i knew the stars would bring you home he shouted planting a kiss on each of istvans cheeks i knew it he let out another roar this one with words in it gizella saria istvans home istvans mother and his other sister came running up from the back of the house they smothered him in kisses and exclamations someonehe never did see whopressed a beaker of mead into his hand youre home his mother said over and over again aye im home istvan agreed i dont think im ever going to leave this valley again stars grant it be so gizella said istvans father and his sisters all nodded vigorously somehow they held beakers of mead too had istvan got out of the army not long after going in he would have had no qualms about staying close to kunhegyes the rest of his days either but hed seen so much of the wider world the past six years the valley still felt too small to suit him as well as it might have fillet used to it again he thought i have to get used to it again a pull at the sweet strong mead went a long way toward reconciling him to being home with the war lost with the ekrekek dead where would i go he said as much to himself as to his family alpri and gizella and saria all exclaimed again this time in shocked dismay so he had to tell his news once more what will we do his father asked what can we do have the stars abandoned us forever istvan thought about that i dont know he said at last im not even sure it matters we have to go on living our lives as best we can any which way dont you think was that heresy or simply common sense he had the feeling kun would have approved the scar on his left hand didnt throb as it often did when he found himself in doubt or dismay and that evening the stars shone down brilliantly on the celebrating village of kunhegyes maybe that meant they approved of what hed said maybe it didnt matter either way how can i know istvan wondered he didnt suppose he could which didnt stop him from celebrating too for once the great square in front of the royal palace in cottbus was packed with people the unkerlanters remained in holiday mood too and why not marshal rathar thought we didnt just beat algarve we beat gyongyos too he looked back at the assembled might in the victory parade he was to lead we could lick the kuusamans and the lagoans too we could if if the word ate at him he hadnt gone into gyorvar himself but hed had reports from men who had the sorcery that had destroyed the capital of gyongyos could fall on cottbus too he knew that he never forgot it he had to hope king swemmel also remembered it high and thin and spidery a single note from a trumpet rang out the signal for the parade to begin it should have been an officers whistle ordering the advance rathar thought but it was what it was he thrust out his chest thrust back his head and marched forward as proudly and precisely as if he were on parade at the officers collegium hed never attended when he came into sight the people who packed the squareall but the parade route through itshouted his name again and again rathar rathar rathar rathar had rather thought they would do that hed rather feared they would do that in fact he held up his hand silence fell he pointed toward the reviewing stand on which surrounded by bodyguards his sovereign stood king swemmel he shouted huzzah for king swemmel to his vast relief most of the people started shouting swemmels name he suspected they did so for the same reason hed pointed to the king simple fear if a vast throng of folk started crying rathars name swemmel was too likely to think his marshal planned to try to steal his throneand to make sure rathar had no chance to do so as for the folk whod started yelling for rathar all of them had to know one of the men and women standing nearby was bound to be an inspector the mines always needed fresh blood despite the great glut of captives in them now inside a couple of years most of those captives would be dead behind rathar came a block of footsoldiers behind them trudged weary hungrylooking gyongyosian captives most of those men would probably head for the mamming hills after their display here or maybe swemmel had canals he wanted dug or rubble that needed carting away the possibilities in a kingdom ravaged by war were endless after the gongs marched a regiment of unicornriders and then a regiment of behemoths rathar could hear the chainmail clanking on the great beasts through the rhythmic thud of marching feet hearing that clank reminded him of reports the islanders had come up with behemoth armor better at stopping beams than anything his own kingdom had one more project to keep the mages busyas if they didnt have enough more behemoths hauled eggtossers of all sizes through the square another shambling throng of gyongyosian captives came after them followed by more unkerlanter footsoldiers those gongs and soldiers might have to watch where they put their feet dragons painted rockgray flapped past overhead they were incontinent beasts too rathar hoped none of them chose the wrong moment to do something unfortunate as he passed the reviewing standwhich along with swemmel and his guardsmen held unkerlanter courtiers and foreign dignitaries and attachés the latter sure to be taking notes on the parademarshal rathar met the kings eye and saluted him king swemmel gave back his usual unwinking stare but then to the marshals surprise he deigned to return the salute rathar almost missed a step did a formal public salute from swemmel mean the king truly trusted him or did it mean swemmel wanted to lull his suspicions and put him out of the way how could he tell till the day came or didnt you could rebel he thought plenty would back you but as always he rejected the idea as soon as it crossed his mind for one thing he didnt want the throne for another he was sure swemmel would win in a game of intrigue he was doing what he wanted to do he did it well the crown if swemmel wanted it so badly he was welcome to it out of the square marched rathar out of the square and down cottbus main avenue the sidewalks there were packed too only a continuous line of constables and impressers held the crowd back men and women cheered much more enthusiastically than unkerlanters usually did if they were proud of what their kingdom had accomplished theyd earned the right to be and if they were relieved unkerlant had survived theyd also earned that right how many of them had tried to flee west when cottbus looked like falling to the algarvians almost four years before more than a fewrathar was sure of that how many would admit it now next to none and the marshal was sure of that too people who didnt have the pull to get into the central square shouted swemmels name more often than they shouted rathars these are the poor people the ignorant people rathar thought they dont really know who did what that thought salved his vanity even so he wondered how much truth it really held aye rathar had been the one whod made the plans and given the orders that led to the defeat of the redheads and the gyongyosians but king swemmel had been the one who refused even to imagine that unkerlant could be beaten without such an indomitable man at the top the kingdom might have fallen to pieces under the hammer blows the algarvians struck during the first summer and autumn of the war of course if we hadnt been readying our own attack on mezentio s men if wed paid more attention to defending our kingdom against them they might not have been able to strike those hammer blows rathar shrugged it was years too late to worry about such things now after the parade ended a carriage waited to take marshal rathar back to the palace major merovec waited in his office rathar set a sympathetic hand on merovecs shoulder no one cared about adjutants in victory parades no one would ever know how important a job merovec had had or how well hed done it either perhaps not quite no one merovec said thank you sirmy promotion to colonel has finally come through good rathar said i put that in for you more than a year ago one thing nobody can do though is hurry his majesty no of course not his adjutant replied what do they say though a rising tide lifts all boats thats how things are right now my boat has lifted me as far as i care to rise thank you very much the marshal said he didnt know for certain that king swemmel could sorcerously listen to his conversations but had to assume the king could manage it and there was only one higher rank to which a rising tide could lift him the one swemmel now held he didnt want the king believing he aspired to the throne such notions as hed thought during the parade were dangerous he nodded to merovec after putting up with me for so long you deserve a promotion thank you sir merovec said what rank do you suppose ill have when the next war comes down the ley line at us the next war rathar echoed his adjutant nodded aye sir the one against the islanders i mean whoever wins that will have all of derlavai in his beltpouch if it comes soon we wont win it rathar said if it comes soon theyll serve cottbus as they served gyorvar and we cant hit back the same way they can make us back away from whatever we try wed have to i hope wed have to the marshal thought if swemmel gets a sudden attack of pride he could throw this whole kingdom down the sewer he would have worried less with a calmer more sensible rulernot that unkerlant had enjoyed a lot of calm sensible rulers in her history a young lieutenant stuck his head into the office spotted marshal rathar and brightened there you are lord marshal he said as if rathar had been playing hideandseek his majesty wants to confer with you at once at once should have gone without saying where swemmel was concerned being king meant never having to wait im coming rathar said that also went without saying merovec saluted as the marshal left the office as always when summoned by swemmel rathar wondered if he would ever come back here again he surrendered his ceremonial sword to swemmels guards let them frisk him and then abased himself before his sovereign you may rise the king said did you see the kuusaman and lagoan vultures perched on the reviewing stand with us when you marched past aye your majesty rathar replied i noticed the islanders ministers and their attaches what do you think they made of our might king swemmel asked your majesty no matter how strong we are in soldiery we dare not cross lagoas and kuusamo in any serious way till we can match them in magecraft too rathar said they have to know that as well as we do grimly swemmel nodded and so they laugh at us behind their hands well we shall set our own mages to work as indeed we have already done and we shall see what spying can bring us too that will not be so easy marshal rathar said how can one of our people pretend to come from lagoas or kuusamo one of our people would have a difficult time the king agreed there are however some few algarvians who speak lagoan without a trace of accent some of them were mezentios spies paid well enoughand with their families held hostage to guard against betrayalthey should serve us well too ah rathar said if we can bring that off it will serve us well many algarvians are whores who will do anything for money swemmel said rathar nodded the king went on our task is to find the ones who will be able to understand what they need to learn and to slip them into the lagoan guild of mages it may not be easy or quick but we think it can be done as they say in cards one peek is worth a thousand finesses rathar laughed he couldnt remember the last time hed heard king swemmel crack a joke then he realized the king wasnt joking he nodded again all the same joking or not swemmel was right nineteen when the door to lurcanios cell opened at a time when he wasnt scheduled to be fed or exercised he bit down on the inside of his lower lip a break in routine meant trouble he hadnt taken long to learn that how many captives in algarvian gaols learned the same lesson he wondered more than a few of that he had no doubt it didnt matter now it was happening to him that mattered more than anything else in the world one of the valmieran guards who came in pointed a stick at his face get moving he snapped lurcanio got moving he moved slowly and carefully always keeping his hands in plain sight the guards had made it very clear that they wanted him dead he didnt care to give them any excuse to get what they wanted may i ask where we are going he inquired he got a nasty grin from that guard another one replied the judges have your verdict very well lurcanio did his best not to show the fear he felt the judges could do whatever they pleased with him and he had no chance of stopping them hed sung like a nightingale for his interrogators maybe that would count enough to keep him breathing of course maybe it wouldnt too bright sunlight outside the gaol made him blink his eyes watered not much light leaked into his cell the guards hustled him into a carriage that carried more iron than a behemoth a fourhorse team had to draw it locks clicked and snapped on the doors after he got in in the passenger compartment an iron grill separated him from the guard who rode with him as the valmieran locked it lurcanio asked what if i were a wizard could i conjure my way out of here go ahead and try the blond answered this here carriage is warded against anything a firstrank mage can do lurcanio didnt believe him sorcerers were often more inventive than those who tried to stop them gave them credit for being so were other people come to that gaolers would have had an easier time were that not so but lurcanio himself was no wizard he remained a captive they hadnt even let him clean up before hauling him off to court he didnt take that for a good sign he went into the courtroom through a hallway reserved for the accused and even more lined with guards than usual today when he entered he found the place packed excitement filled the air it was almost as palpable as sorcerous energy just before a major spell the three judges two in civilian costume the third in uniform strode in and took their places at the head of the courtroom everyone rose respectfully lurcanio bowed to them as he would have done in an algarvian lawcourt be seated the bailiff intoned the chief judge the soldier sat in the center he rapped loudly for order we have reached a verdict in the case of the kingdom of valmiera against colonel lurcanio of algarve he declared is the accused present no your excellency i am not here lurcanio declared the scribe recording his words gave him a reproachful look a few people giggled lurcanio thought he heard krastas voice he looked around aye there she was she wants to see me pay lurcanio thought she would likely get what she wanted too bang the gavel stifled the giggles by speaking the accused admits his presence the senior judge said his display of levity is out of order and will not be tolerated again will you do worse to me for making a bad joke than for any of the other things you claim i did while i served my kingdom lurcanio asked by no means colonel the judge replied but we will bind and gag you if that is what you want you have but to say the word he waited lurcanio said nothing the judge nodded all right then are you ready to hear the verdict of this court ready lurcanio thought powers above no but his dignity kept him from saying that out loud he was sure they would bind and gag him he was sure they would enjoy doing it too refusing to give them the satisfaction he nodded curtly i am ready your excellency though i still insist this court has no legal jurisdiction over a soldier engaged in prosecuting a war we have rejected that argument for others and we reject it for you as well the chief judge shuffled papers then looked up at lurcanio this court colonel finds you guilty of facilitating the transportation of kaunians through the kingdom of valmiera for the purpose of sacrifice it also finds you guilty of facilitating the program known as night and fog which seized valmierans for the purpose of sacrifice this court further finds that these programs constitute murder not warfare accordingly you are hereby sentenced to be blazed to death lurcanio had been braced for it it still came like a punch in the belly so did the baying applause from the crowd in the courtroom i appeal this false verdict he said as steadily as he could no the chief judge shook his head this court was set up to deal with cases of this kind there is no court to which to appeal our verdict very neat lurcanio said the sarcasm got through the judge flushed lurcanio went on no court to which to appeal you say may i not appeal to king gainibu himself i got to know him well during the occupation he turned out not to be quite so sottish and worthless as i thought he was too you never can tell that request seemed to catch the panel by surprise the judges put their heads together and argued in low voices at last the senior judge looked up very well colonel you will be furnished pen and ink for this purpose he turned to the guards take him back to his cell let him write what he will take the appeal to the king and let his will be done aye your excellency the guards chorused they hauled lurcanio from his seat he blew krasta a kiss as they led him away her scowl made him smile he wondered whether they would bother following the judges orders but they did lurcanio put his case as best he could he wished he were writing algarvian being persuasive in a language not his own was hard but then how much difference would it make not much he feared when hed finished he gave the appeal to the guards and asked for another leaf of paper whats this one for one of them asked suspiciously lurcanio looked at him i am going to fold it into a ladder stick it out the window climb down it and escape he answered deadpan for a moment the guards took him seriously alarm flared on their faces when they realized he hadnt meant it they started to get angry he wondered if hed earned himself a beating but then to his relief one of them laughed funny boy arent you the fellow said you arent going anywhere not till he drew the edge of his hand across his throat enough jokes now tell me what you want it for i want to write another letter lurcanio said your censors will read it you will probably read it yourself by all the signs i will not have many more chances to write letters youve got that straight the guard thought for a moment then shrugged well why the blazes not if we dont like what you write the letterll never get out of gaol exactly so lurcanio bowed i thank you he gnawed at the end of the pen when they gave him the new leaf of paper hed known exactly what he wanted to say to king gainibu even if hed sometimes had trouble writing it in valmieran here how do i even begin he wondered but that solved itself by the time you read this i expect i shall be dead he wrote coming out and saying that even on paper felt oddly liberating he had an easier time going on from there than hed thought he would the guards took away not only the letter but also the pen and the bottle of ink we dont want you turning this into a stick now one of them said and laughed at his own joke lurcanio dutifully chuckled too if i could i would he said but a man would have to be more than a firstrank mage to bring that off i fear he would have to be what the ice people call a god those stinking hairy savages the guard said nothing but scorn in his voice he took the letter out of the cell the door slammed shut the bar thudded into place to keep it shut two afternoons later the answer from the king of valmiera to lurcanios appeal arrived lurcanio broke the seal and unfolded the leaf of paper he recognized gainibus script though the writing looked less shaky than it had when the king drank himself into a stupor almost every night colonel lurcanio greetings i have read your appeal king gainibu wrote the essence of it seems to have two parts first that you were only obeying the orders your superiors gave you and second that you might have done far worse than you did the first falls to the ground at once a man who murders again and again under orders remains a murderer as for the second it is probably true no i have no doubt that it is certainly true i would not claim that i have forgotten our acquaintance you might indeed have done more and worse that you did not was surely due to the fact that you wanted to keep valmiera as quiet as you could but does remain so it being so i must ask myself whether it constitutes an adequately mitigating circumstance with some regret i tell you that in my judgment it does not aye you might have done worse what you did was quite bad enough the sentence shall stand gainibu king of valmiera slowly deliberately lurcanio folded the kings letter and set it down nothing left now but to die as well as he could the guards had watched him read the letter he nodded to them you will not have to worry about my complaints on the quality of accommodations and the dining much longer he said did you really think his majesty would let you off one of them asked lurcanio shook his head no but how was i worse off for trying something to that the guard said tomorrow morning then tomorrow morning lurcanio agreed can you give me something worth eating tonight as long as i am here i aim to enjoy myself as best i can as the guards trooped out one of them remarked whoresons got guts lurcanio felt a certain amount of pride as soon as the door slammed shut though it evaporated what difference did it make when the sun came up tomorrow he would stop caringstop caring foreverwhat happened to him time seemed to race hed hardly blinked before it got dark his supper was no different from any other meal hed had in gaol he savored it just the same he found himself yawning but didnt sleep with experience about to end forever he didnt care to miss the little he had left they wouldnt have brought me a woman even if id asked for one he thought too bad the sky or the tiny scrap of it he could see through his window began to grow light the door opened a squad of guards came in lurcanio got to his feet can you walk the guard captain asked him i can walk he answered and he did though his knees wobbled from the fear he fought not to show they led him to a courtyard and bound his wrists and ankles to a metal pole he could smell terror seeping out from the old bricks behind him blindfold asked the guard captain lurcanio shook his head a dozen men aimed sticks at him the captain raised his hand then let it fall the valmierans blazed even as lurcanio braced himself he thought how useless he cried out once then it was over whats this krasta asked irritably as the butler handed her an envelope on a silver tray i dont know milady he answered and did his best to vanish muttering something unpleasant about the quality of help available these days krasta opened the envelope it bore no return address and she didnt recognize the hand that had written out her name and address she was tempted to throw the envelope away unopened but curiosity got the better of her the script of the letter inside was different from that of the addressdifferent and familiar by the time you read this krasta read i expect i shall be dead i make no special plea for myselfwhat point to it you know what you did and you know what we did you will try to deny it now especially to yourself but you went into our affair with your eyes open as wide as your legs powers below eat you lurcanio krasta snarled she almost tore the letter to pieces but that first sentence kept her reading i have a favor to ask youa deathbed favor you might say lurcanio wrote it has nothing to do with me so you need feel no pain in granting it again krasta almost tore up the letter even beyond the grave was the algarvian trying to tell her what to do then she laughed unpleasantly she could finish the whole wretched thing find out exactly what he wanted and then do just the opposite she nodded to herself the more she thought about it the better that sounded no one gives me orders she said no one she spoke louder than she had to as if to persuade herself for close to four years lurcanio had given her orders and shedmostlyobeyed she would be a long time forgetting that however hard she tried you bore my son lurcanio wrote krastas scowl darkened she wished she could forget that too the little bastards yowling made forgetting impossible though so did the shocking things being pregnant had done to her figure for the moment little gainibu was mercifully asleep pretty soon he would wake up and start being noisy again even thinking about lurcanio was easier than thinking about the baby because of the baby because of what hed turned out to be she still had to wear this hot uncomfortable wig whenever she appeared in public aye lurcanio and his bastard boy both had a lot to answer for what i ask you is try to forget he is mine the letter continued krastas lip curled not bloody likely she said try to treat him as you would have treated him were the charming viscount valnu indeed his sire lurcanio wrote you may think of me as you please i made life inconvenient for you i know for i did not let you do just as you pleasedand what crime could be worse than that krasta studied his words she suspected a cut was hiding among them but couldnt quite find it lurcanio had always enjoyed being obscure moreover he went on you were too friendly with me during the war to suit valmiera as it is now this i know has caused you some embarrassment you must be sure the said embarrassment is all my fault and so you will hate me for it krasta nodded savagely i certainly do she could almost see lurcanio shrugging hate me if you will then he wrote i can do nothing about it in any case but i beg you my former dear do not hate the baby nothing that has happened here is the babys fault oh you lying son of a whore krasta exclaimed if little gainibu hadnt been born with sandy hair people now wouldnt think she herself had been a collaborator even skarnus peasant cow of a wife wouldnt have been able to keep scorning her wouldnt have been able to crop her hair right after she gave birth no lurcanio didnt understand much or did he i know that with his hair as it is he will not have an easy time in your kingdom during the war some kaunians tried to disguise themselves as algarvians by dyeing their hair red going in the other direction might serve the child well here at least for a time later when passions have cooled people may be better able to accept him for what he is hmm krasta read that over again it wasnt such a bad idea oh certainly people who knew her also knew shed had an algarvian bastard but with little gainibus hair dyed a safe blond she would be able to take him out in public shed never before imagined being able to do that her free hand touched the curls of the wig before too long she would be able to shed her disguise her son might have to keep his up his whole life long and thats your fault lurcanio yours and nobody elses krasta said as if gainibu hadnt come forth from between her legs if the boy has your looks and my wit he may go far in the world given any sort of chance at all lurcanio wrote arrogant to the end i hope you will give him that chance my time is over his is just beginning the squiggle he used for a signature sat under his closing words now krasta did tear the letter into tiny pieces once shed done so she put them down the commode as shed put the sheet in her brothers writing down the commode while the redheads still occupied priekule then she would have got in trouble if lurcanio had found skarnus words these days if anyone found lurcanios she shook her head it wouldnt happen she wouldnt let it happen she watched the water in the commode swirl away the soggy paper gone gone for good she sighed with relief a moment later almost on cue little gainibu started to cry krasta gritted her teeth as far as she could see a babys cry was good for nothing but driving all the people within earshot out of their minds her first impulse as always was to turn around and get out of earshot as fast as she could this once though she resisted that and went into the babys bedroom instead gainibus wet nurse looked up in surprise she was changing the babys soiled linen and wiping his bottom krastas nose wrinkled gainibu had done something truly disgusting hello milady the wet nurse said she deftly finished the job of cleaning and changing and picked up krastas son the baby smiled and gurgled the wet nurse smiled too hes not a bad little fellow even if she caught herself hes not a bad little fellow let me have him krasta said of course milady the wet nurse sounded astonished krasta had hardly ever said anything like that before be careful to keep a hand under his head its still a little wobbly ill manage krasta took her son from the other woman he smiled up at her too before she knew what she was doing she smiled back he tricked it out of me she thought almost as if realizing a grown man had seduced her when she smiled at him gainibu laughed and wiggled he likes me krasta said in surprise because she had no use for the baby shed thought he wouldnt care for her he likes everybody the wet nurse said hes just a baby he doesnt know anything about how mean people can be she held out her hands let me have him back please i was going to feed him after i got him cleaned up here krasta said the wet nurse undid her tunic and gave the baby her right breast gainibu sucked eagerly krastas breasts were dry again though they still seemed softer and slacker than they had before she gave birth not till now hearing the small happy noises gainibu made had she wondered whether nursing him might have been a good thing she shook her head when he came out with hair sandy not blond shed wanted him dead nurse him herself no no no as casually as she could krasta asked do you suppose hes still too young to dye his hair dye his oh the wet nurse blinked then saw what krasta was aiming atwhat lurcanio had been aiming at though she wasnt about to admit it the other woman said i dont know milady you might ask a healer about that but when he gets a bit bigger im sure it wouldnt hurt and it would make things easier for him wouldnt it it might krasta said im sure it would make things easier for me i could show him in public without worrying about all the dreadful things that happen to people with babies that have the wrong color hair her own convenience came first that looking like everyone else might be better for little gainibu was also nice but distinctly secondary sooner or later things will ease up the wet nurse predicted people will get excited about something else and then they wont care so much about who did what during the war thats how it works i hope so krasta said fervently as far as im concerned people have made much too big a fuss about that already the wet nurse nodded sympathetically maybe shed had an algarvian boyfriend during the occupation for all krasta knew she might have a little bastard at home herself the wet nurse said plenty of women were friendly with the redheads that was just how things were back then a baby a baby was bad luck he certainly was krasta said giving her son a venomous stare if hed looked the way he was supposed to or if he hadnt come along at all she wouldnt have had nearly the troubles shed had but the wet nurse said the same thing lurcanio had its not really his fault milady he cant help what he looks like i suppose not krasta said reluctantly and he is a nice little baby the wet nurse went on doing what i do i see plenty of the little brats hes sweeter than most i think dyeing his hair is a good idea you must be very clever to have thought of that if he looks like everybody else he should be able to get on fine maybe krasta said no she wasnt about to admit that dyeing gainibus hair hadnt been her idea if the wet nurse thought it was clever she would take credit for it lurcanio she snapped her fingers by the time you read this i expect i shall be dead she didnt miss him on the contrary as long as hed lived shed had to remember she hadnt always been able to do exactly as she pleased few thoughts could have been less pleasant to her let me have gainibu again she said the wet nurse burped the baby before handing him to her krasta peered down into his little face but for the color of his hair he did look like her as best she could tell he smiled again and then without any fuss spit up on her the wet nurse hadnt burped him quite well enough for once krasta didnt get angry she kept studying the baby with blond hair he might do after all if the boy has your looks and my wit he may go far in the world krasta shook her head shed flushed those words down the commode since they were gone they couldnt possibly be true could they leudast stood on the farther slopes of the elsung mountains looking west into gyongyos no matter what his superiors said hed never expected to come so far so fast hed never expected the gongs to lie down and surrender either hed fought them before and knew they didnt do things like that but they had he also knew the unkerlanters onslaught hadnt been the only thing that made gyongyos quit every new rumor said something different and horrible had happened to gyorvar leudast didnt want to believe any of the rumors because they all sounded preposterous but if something truly dreadful hadnt happened to their capital would the gyongyosians have thrown in the sponge he didnt think so his regiment had come far enough that right at the edge of visibility he could see the mountains sloping down toward the lowlands farther west still he could also see the green in the bottom of a good many valleys the gongs hed heard recruited a lot of their soldiers from such places unkerlants broad almost endless plains yielded many more men he wasnt sure the average unkerlanter made as ferocious a warrior as the average gyongyosian but that hadnt turned out to matter captain dagaric came up to stand beside him and look at the vast expanse of rock and snow and greenery after staring a while in silence dagaric asked do you know what youll do next lieutenant no sir leudast admitted im afraid i dont ive been in the army a long time it wasnt forever it only felt that way aye youve been in the army a long time the regimental commander agreed if you were still a common soldier or a sergeant i wouldnt worry about it so much but youre an officer now and you havent been an officer all that long you ought to think about it i have been thinking about it sir leudast replied if i werent an officer id be on my way home now well trying to get home anyhow but you dont mind my saying so youre dead when they blaze you regardless of whether youre a sergeant or a lieutenant thats so dagaric said had he tried to deny it leudast would have ignored everything else he said the captain went on a couple of things for you to think about though for one nobodys going to be blazing at you for a while after what we just went through do you think anyone wants another war any time soon who can tell with king swemmel but leudast didnt trust dagaric far enough to say that out loud he did say youve got a point you bet i do dagaric told him and my other point is we need good officers and you are one common soldiers and underofficers are conscripts officers are the glue that holds things together especially in peacetime losing you after all youve done all youve learned would be a shame im still thinking sir from his days as a common soldier and an underofficer leudast knew better than to come right out and tell a superior no you should also remember marshal rathar has his eye on you dagaric said who knows how high you could rise with him behind you leudast gave a truly thoughtful nod in the army as anywhere else whom you knew counted for at least as much as what you knew that he should know the marshal of unkerlantand that rathar should know himstill left him astonished no denying that dagaric had a point officers without patrons were liable to watch their careers wither he wouldnt have to worry about that but sir i dont know that i want to be a soldier at all leudast said this isnt my proper trade well what is your proper trade farmer dagaric asked and leudast nodded again the regimental commander snorted do you really want to see nothing but your own villagewhatevers left of itthe rest of your days do you really want to push a plow behind an oxs arse every year till you fall over dead its what i know leudast answered its about the only thing i do know captain dagaric shook his head youre wrong lieutenant you know soldiering you were in the army at the start and you came out alive at the end have you got any idea how unusual that is millions of men know farming not very many have experience to match yours he was probably right the only trouble was leudast didnt want most of the experience he had he knew how lucky he was to have come through all the dreadful fighting hed seen with only two wounds but the wounds werent all of itin many ways werent the worst of it terror and hunger and cold and exhaustion and filth and the agony of friends did he want to stay in a trade that only promised more of the same something else occurred to him too something that had been in the back of his mind ever since the gyongyosians yielded sir there was this girl back in a village in the duchy of grelz would alize even remember who he was if he showed up there now or would she be married to some local man plenty of wartime romances didnt mean a thing once the war was done some did though no way to find out which sort was which without going back there and seeing how things stood a girl eh dagaric said you serious about her or are you just looking for another excuse im serious sir i dont know if she is id have to go back to leiferde to find out in peacetime you know a married officer isnt necessarily at a disadvantage dagaric remarked and who knows she may be looking for a way to get off the farm and out of her village he rubbed his chin ill tell you what you want to court her do you leudast nodded aye sir i do you dont need to resign your commission to do that dagaric said i think the most efficient thing to do would be to give you oh a months leave so you can sort out your personal affairs at the end of that time youll have a better notion of what you want to doand youll have an officers travel privileges to get to this leiferwhereverinblazesitis does that suit you lieutenant aye sir thank you sir leudast said saluting the military ceremonial let him hide his astonishment dagaric really must want me to stay in the army or he wouldnt go so far out of his way to help me he still wasnt sure he wanted to remain a soldier but knowing his superior wanted him to was no small compliment leave papers in his beltpouch he was two days in a wagon making his way back to the nearest ley line then he spent another nine days traversing unkerlant from west to east as hed gone across the kingdom from east to west not so long before the month of leave dagaric had given him suddenly seemed less generous than it had when hed got it it left him about ten days in and around leiferde he found he could tell exactly how far the algarvians had come all at once the countryside took on the battered look with which hed grown so familiar during the war how long would it take to repair so many men were gone every glimpse he got of life in the fields confirmed that the old the young the female they labored to bring in the harvest he shivered anew when the leyline caravan passed through herborn the capital of the duchy of grelz there among those ruins king swemmel had boiled false king raniero of grelz alive thanks to me leudast thought and wondered if he would ever get the smell of ranieros cooking flesh out of his nostrils leiferde wasnt on a ley line but didnt lie far from one leudast needed only half a day to get to the village after so long cooped up on the wagon and the caravan getting down and using his own legs felt good the sun was sliding down the sky toward the western horizon when he strode up the dusty main street women peered at him from their vegetable plots and herb gardens a soldier he heard them murmur whats a soldier doing here now he knocked on the door at alizes house hed hoped she would open it herself but she didnt her mother dida woman who looked much the way alize would in twenty years or so hullo bertrude leudast said pleased he remembered her name the womans jaw dropped powers above she exclaimed youre that lieutenant how are you your excellency she curtsied im fine thank you leudast had never said he was a nobleman on the other hand hed never said he wasnt he asked the question that needed asking is alize anywhere about shes out in the fields shell be back for supper bertrude answered that shouldnt be long sir wont you come in and share what we have if its not too much trouble and if you have enough leudast said i know how things are these days but bertrude shook her head its no trouble at all and weve got plenty she said firmly come have something to drink while you wait leudast found the world a rosier place after pouring down most of a mug of spirits he was fighting to stay awake when alize and her father akerin walked in leudast alize said and threw herself into his arms her face against his shoulder she added what are you doing here with the war over i came back he said simply it had been a long time since hed had his arms around a woman even longer since hed had them around one who wanted to be held alize stared at him men say theyll do that all the time i didnt think anybody really would though here i am leudast said she seemed glad to see him that made a good start before he could go on from there bertrude broke in suppers ready leudast sat down with alize and her mother and father the stew bertrude served was full of oats and beets not wheat and turnips as it would have been in leudasts village in the north mutton was mutton though bertrude flavored it with mint rather than garlic nothing at all was wrong with the ale she gave him to go with the supper after hed eaten alize said i hoped youd come back i didnt really think you would but i hoped so now that you have come what exactly do you have in mind it cant be just you know you cant have me for the sport of it she meant leudast nodded hed already understood that he said i came to wed you if youll put up with me i think i can alize said with a smile leudast grinned with relief he hadnt known how she would answer though he wouldnt have returned to leiferde if he hadnt had his hopes her father asked you aim to settle down here and farm then the question went to the nub of things that depends leudast said i might but then again i might not my other choice is staying in the army the way the world looks therell always be jobs for soldiers thats so akerin said and bertrudes head bobbed up and down alizes father asked another question how do you aim to make up your mind well if you really want to know a lot of it depends on what your daughter wants leudast looked to alize if youd sooner stay in leiferde i know how to farm or i did up north it cant be too different here he realized hed just shown he was no noble shrugging he went on or if youd rather be a soldiers wife again he shrugged the unkerlanter peasants businesslike shrug so different from the fancy algarvian variety i can do that too go to a city alize breathed maybe even to cottbus her eyes glowed ive seen enough of a farming village to last me the rest of my days however life turns out in a town it has to be easier there than here her father and mother didnt argue with her in fact they nodded solemnly leudast thought her likely right too he also nodded all right then he said ill stay a soldier captain dagaric would be pleased marshal rathar might be pleased leudast wondered if hed be pleased himself that depends on how long peace lasts he thought of course if war came again a peasant village near unkerlants eastern border wasnt safe either but if war came again was any place at all safe one way or another hed find out after supper ealstan tried to read the news sheet and play with saxburh at the same time that didnt work very well because he couldnt give either one of them his full attention the news sheet didnt care his daughter did dada she said and managed to put a distinct note of reproach in her voice youre fighting a losing battle son hestan said what other kind is there for a forthwegian ealstan answered that earned him one of hestans slow smiles when he was talking to his own father he wasnt paying attention to saxburh either dada she said again and tugged at his hand laughing he picked her up she grabbed for his beard he managed to fend her off no you cant do that he told her that hurts hestan said you got some pretty good handfuls of mine in your day if i did shes giving you your revenge ealstan tickled saxburh who squealed arent you she squealed again if youre going to play with her may i see the news sheet vanai asked ealstan spun it across the room to her as soon as vanai started to read saxburh scrambled down off ealstans lap toddled over to her and started batting at the news sheet cut that out vanai said saxburh didnt vanai rolled her eyes she doesnt want anybody readingthats what it is maybe she thinks well get too excited when we see that king penda vows hell come back to forthweg ealstan said not likely vanai exclaimed whod want him back after he led the kingdom into a losing war thats the line the story takes ealstan said im surprised the news sheet mentioned his name at all hestan said it takes the same tone vanai did ealstan repeated the feeling it wants to give is oh he cant possibly be serious and who would care even if he were its not a headline or anythingit shows up at the bottom of an inside page thats one more way to show nobody thinks pendas very important any more i guess his father musingly plucked at his beard you know thats clever he said after hed thought it through if they just ignored penda people would hear about this vow of his anyhow and theyd think king beornwulf is afraid see how hes trying to hide things this way theyll go well beornwulf is king now and penda can make as much noise as he wants off in lagoas aye clever mama saxburh said indignantly and swatted at the news sheet you know youre not supposed to do that vanai said are you getting fussy are you getting sleepy no saxburh denied the mere possibility and burst into tears when her mother picked her up most babies dont start saying no till theyre a few months older than that hestan remarked of course my granddaughter is naturally very advanced for her age i wish she were advanced enough to stop making messes in her clothes ealstan said is she dry vanai felt the baby and nodded i think shell go to sleep too she said putting the critical word in classical kaunian so saxburh wouldnt follow it but shed done that once too often her daughter had figured it out and cried harder than ever vanai looked half pleasedone day she did want saxburh to learn the language shed grown up speakingand half annoyed there there itll be all right she rocked the little girl in her arms saxburh didnt think it was all right she went on wailing but the wails grew muffled as her thumb found its way into her mouth after a little while they stopped almost like the quiet after the fightings over hestan said ealstan shook his head no he said positively thats different his father didnt argue he just shrugged and said youd know better than i im sure hows your leg these days its getting better its still sore ealstan shrugged too when the rainy season comes ill make a firstrate weather prophet im sorry about that im more sorry than i can tell you hestan said but im glad youre still here to be able to predict bad weather before it comes oh so am i ealstan said ill tell you what gravels me though he laughed at himself i know its a small thing especially when you set it against all the evil that came during the war but i wish id been able to finish my schooling first the algarvians watered everything down and then i had to leave he glanced over at vanai and at saxburh whod started snoring around that thumb of course i learned a good many other things instead his wife was wearing her swarthy forthwegian sorcerous disguise she turned pink even so everyone learns those lessons sooner or later she said i think its very fine that you want to learn the others too her grandfather had been a scholar of course considering how badly he and she had got along it was a wonder she didnt hate the whole breed but kaunians had often looked down their noses at forthwegians as being ignorant and proud of it vanai had never said any such thing to ealstan which didnt mean she didnt think it from time to time not about him necessarily but about his people hestan said if there hadnt been a war i was thinking about sending you to the university at eoforwic or maybe even to the one at trapani i doubt either of them is still standing these days and powers above only know how many professors came through alive trapani ealstan said in slow wonder if there hadnt been a war i would have wanted to go there too thats very strange the only thing id want to do now is drop an egg on the place its had plenty but one more wouldnt hurt he eyed his father sending me to a university would probably ruin me as a bookkeeper you know bookkeepers make more than professors ever dream of added vanai sharply practical as usual hestan shrugged i do know both those things but a man who can dream should get his chance to do it a careful manwhich youve always been ealstandoesnt need to be rich he gets by well enough with a little less not having the chance to do what you really want can sour you for life vanai carried saxburh off and put her to bed when she came back she asked youre not talking about yourself are you sir you dont seem soured on life if you dont mind my saying so me no hestan sounded a bit startled not really anyhow but then ive been lucky with my wife andmostlylucky with my children that makes up for a good deal believe me i believe you ealstan said and looked at vanai in a way that made her turn redder than she had before his father smiled that slow smile that isnt what i meant or not all of what i meant though i expect youll have a hard time believing me when i say so but the truth is i like moving numbers around maybe if id had a chance id be moving them around in different ways from those a bookkeeper uses but if i tried to tell you im pining for a scholarly career i never had that would be a lie elfryth ducked her head into the dining room i just looked in on saxburh shes so sweet lying there asleep sure she is ealstan said shes not making any noise his mother sniffed indignantly his father chuckled and said spoken like the proper sort of parent a tired one stop that hestan elfryth said what were you saying there about telling lies i was telling them about running off and joining a traveling carnival when i was young hestan answered deadpan everything went fine till the elephant stepped on me i used to be a much taller man you know pity the beast didnt squash the silliness out of you too elfryth observed vanai looked from ealstans father to his mother and back again is that where well be in twenty years she asked ealstan didnt answer he didnt know elfryth said either something like this or youll shout at each other all the time this is better i think so too vanai said hestan asked are you still interested in going on to the university ealstan we could probably afford it if you are i dont know he answered i never even graduated from the academy you can always find ways around things like that his father spoke with great assurance maybe ealstan said the other thing though well you said it yourself ive got a family to worry about nowand i think ive been pretty lucky there too having a wife and child would make his life as a student more complicated having a kaunian wife and halfkaunian child might make his life as a student much more complicated that wasnt anything he could say to vanai it does make a difference doesnt it hestan said and ealstan nodded as ealstan and vanai lay down together that night she said if you want to be a scholar we could make it work i think he shrugged things arent the way they were before the war theyre never going to be the same as they were before the war im sorry he took her hand i wish they could be but its not going to happen i know vanai answered there are some things that once you break them you cant put them back together again that held nothing but truth the ancient kaunian population of forthweg more ancient here than the forthwegians themselveswould never be the same again ealstan caught vanai to him one thing though he said because we met im the luckiest fellow in the world she kissed him youre sweet i wonder if we would have met anyhow we might have i came to gromheort every now and then and we we both knew about that oak grove where we found each other in mushroom season ealstan broke in we really might have my grandfather wouldnt have approved he didnt approve vanai said in peacetime that might have mattered more i hope not ealstan said so do i vanai said but we dont know we cant know a lot of dreadful things have happened the past six years im just glad weve got each other this time ealstan kissed her and hugged her to him i am too vanai let out a small laugh youre very glad arent you she said and reached between them to show how she knew and getting gladder every second too ealstan told her she laughed again he started undoing her tunic as often as not that seemed to wake up the baby not tonight though he teased her nipple with his tongue her breath sighed out in a bit ealstan poised himself above her not too long after that he was as glad as he could possibly be that they had each other count sabrino former and forcibly retired colonel of dragonfliers had a roof over his head and for the most part enough to eat in occupied devastated trapani that made him a lucky man indeed as lucky as an aging cripple can be anyhow he thought sourly day by day his crutches seemed more a part of him some men whod lost a leg preferred a wheeled chair to crutches sabrino might have too in the trapani hed known before the war a city of paved boulevards and smooth sidewalks on the rubblestrewn cratered streets of the algarvian capital these days such chairs got stuck too easily to seem practical to him he saw enough mutilated men of all ages from barely bearded to older than he was to have plenty of standards of comparison each one was an emblem of what algarve had gone through taken together they made a searing indictment of the darkness through which his kingdom had passed he stopped into a tavern not far from his home and ordered a glass of wine the tapmans right arm stopped just below his shoulder no possible hope of fitting him with a hook but he handled the glass and the wine bottle with his remaining hand as well as anyone possibly could when sabrino praised him he let out a short bitter burst of laughter its not quite what you think friend he said im well off if you want to call it thatyou see ive always been lefthanded if what you kept is more useful to you than what you lost that is good fortune sabrino agreed plenty of people have it worse if a whole man said something like that to me id punch the son of a whore in the nosewith my left hand of course the tapman said but you buddy you went through it too ill take it from you whered you get hurt not far west of here not long before the war ended sabrino answered i was on a dragon and it got flamed out of the sky some of the flame got my leg too and so he shrugged then politely added you on the way to cottbus the first winter of the war in the west the other cripple told him a flying chunk of eggshell tore the arm almost all the way off and the healers finished the job the same burst killed two of my pals sabrino shoved a silver coin across the bar to him have a glass of whatever you care for on me i usually dont not when im working but the tapman dropped the coin into the cash box powers below eat it once wont hurt thank you kindly friend youre a gentleman he poured himself a shot of spirits then took a shiny new copper coin from the box and gave it to sabrino i wouldnt cheat youheres your change sabrino looked at the coin it showed the profile of a plump man with a receding chin not the strong beaky image that had been stamped onto algarves currency for so many years so this is the new king is it he said if you believe the unkerlanters he is the tapman answered me i dont know why they dont just put king swemmels face on the money and have done with it that would have been my face there if id told vatran aye sabrino thought as he put the copper in his beltpouch it was a strange notion and not one hed had in the sanatorium bed when the unkerlanter general came to call on him he finished his wine picked up his crutches which hed leaned against the side of the bar while he perched on a stool and drank left the tavern and made his slow way home when he got there he found his wife more excited than hed seen her in years powers above gismonda whats going on he asked wondering what sort of calamity could have upset her so but it turned out to be a different kind of excitement you may be able to get your leg back she said dramatically what he shook his head dont be silly im an abridged edition these days and ill stay that way as long as i last maybe not gismonda said one of my friendsbaroness norizia it was whose husband got killed outside durrwangenheard about this new healer called pirello hes supposed to be able to restore lost limbs by sorcery something to do with the law of similarity norizia didnt know just what what she knows about wizardry would fit in a thimble believe me my darling pirello has something or other though the law of similarity sabrino said musingly he looked down at himself his surviving leg was indeed very similar to the one hed lost a clever mage might beable to use that resemblance or odds are hes just a quack preying on maimed men sabrino didnt want to let himself feel hope maybe gismonda was every bit as coldblooded perhaps more so but she went on shouldnt you talk to him anyhow what have you got to lose money sabrino answered he clicked his tongue between his teeth how much would i give to have my leg back really and truly the answer didnt take long to form anything at all might be worth seeing him just to find out gismonda snapped her fingers i remember now what norizia called it an elixir thats what he uses a miracle elixir she said it would take a miracle sabrino said and miracles arent what magecraft is all about still he shrugged as well as he could with crutches bearing so much of his weight i may as well take a look ill send one of the servants over to norizias and see if she knows where the fellows offices are gismonda said from the word the servant brought back the healer did business not far from the wreckage of the royal palace once the carriage had taken sabrino to that part of town finding his place of business proved easy broadsheets praising pirellos miracle elixir were plastered to walls and fences veterans missing arms and legsand one man short his left earfilled pirellos waiting room sabrino gave his name to a pretty receptionist he wouldnt have minded knowing better then eased himself down into a chair and got ready to wait till everyone ahead of him had seen the healer before long though the receptionist gave him an inviting smile and said count sabrino master pirello will see you now sabrino struggled to his foot other mutilated men gave him sour looks for which he didnt much blame them his own suspicions flared he hadnt given the receptionist his rank how did pirello know it hes likely a mage after all sabrino thought and his own name and station hadnt been unknown in trapani before the war still he wasnt the only sabrino around either if he knows im a noble maybe he thinks he can pry more money out of me than from ordinary men whove had bad luck if i can get my leg back though here you are your excellency the girl said her kilt was very short showing off shapely legs go right in thanks sabrino said she beamed at him he wondered if he ought to ask her name later he thought a hitching step at a time he went into pirellos sanctum it was lined with books though not all of them had anything to do with healing or sorcery the mageor is he just a mountebank sabrino wondered sprang from his chair and bowed himself almost double your excellency what a privilege to meet you he cried he was about thirty with his mustaches and chin beard waxed to spikes plainly hed never missed a meal i hope i can help you i hope you can too sabrino said ive heard about something to do with the law of similarity and about some elixir of yours and i decided to see whats going on here what have i got to lose exactly so your excellency exactly so pirello beamed as if sabrino had been clever do sit down sir i will tell you what i do i will tell you in great detail in fact and he did he went on and on and on and grew more technical the longer he spoke not all of what he said made sense to sabrino who wondered how much of it would have made sense to a firstrank mage before long he held up a hand and said enough sir cut to the chase you can help me or else you cant if you can how long will it take and how much will it cost between the spell and the elixir which of course stimulates the regenerative faculty you should see resultsthe beginning of results i should saywithin two months pirello replied as for the fee i am the soul of reason you pay me a third when i begin and the balance when completely satisfied the price he named wasnt cheap but wasnt exorbitant either i would charge less sir but for the rare and costly ingredients in the miracle elixir gathered from the land of the ice people from zuwayza from the most inaccessible and exotic islands of the great northern sea it sounds impressive it sounded in fact a little too impressive for sabrino to trust it fully how did you learn about this sorcery and your precious elixir if i may ask of course you may i am the soul of truth as well as reason pirello said as the war neared an end i was working on spells to help hold back the unkerlanters i realized that one of themreversed you might saycould prove a boon to mankind rather than a bane further researchand here we are here we are sabrino echoed it had a certain amount of plausibility to it as sabrino knew to his own horror algarve had trotted out all sorts of desperate spells in the last days of the war it could have been as pirello claimed no doubt of that it could have been but not necessarily sabrino found another question how long have you had this place open not quite a month sir pirello replied all right grunting with effort spinello rose from the chair i may be back in a month or two then well see how things go you have no confidence in me pirello wailed i am insulted i am outraged i am furious you have made me into a cheat a criminal a man without honor in your mind sir this is what i am oh the indignity of it he made as if to rend his garments sabrino shook his head no im just careful i lived through the war i want to see how things go before i jump in good day behind him pirello expostulated volubly the more the mage squawked the less sabrino trusted him he made his slow way out of the office past the receptionistwhod stopped smiling at himand out onto the street his driver helped him up into the carriage take me home he said well gismonda asked when he got back hes a fraud sabrino answered i think hes a fraud anyhow if hes still in business six weeks from now maybe im wrong five weeks and three days after his visit to master pirello news sheets which had happily displayed his advertisingreported that his establishment was suddenly empty as was the account hed set up at a nearby bank a warrant had been sworn out for his arrest but the occupying authorities seemed more inclined to laugh at the algarvians than to go after the trickster well you were right gismonda said with a grimace so i was ive still only got one leg but ive still got all my silver too sabrino sighed but oh how i wish id been wrong hajjaj eyed tassi reproachfully you are extravagant you know you should come to me before you order jewels for yourself the yaninan woman stamped her foot which made her pale darktipped breasts jiggle invitingly they were pretty i wanted them i got them she replied in the throatily accented algarvian she still spoke far better than zuwayzi you should have asked me first hajjaj repeated i am happy to give you a refuge here tassi twitched her hip i should hope so i did not let you stay here on account of that the retired zuwayzi foreign minister said i let you stay here on account of your trouble with minister iskakis i am an old man i make no bones about it that does not matter to me nearly so much as it would have thirty years ago and there is something you should know and that is tassi asked ominously i divorced a wife not so very long agoa young wife a pretty wife a wife most enjoyable in bedbecause she spent more than she should have because she thought she could take advantage of me hajjaj said i sent her back to her clanfather i would send you away too you need to understand that and to believe it you wouldnt do such a thing to me she sounded very sure of herself as if by accident she scratched her hipbone hajjaj didnt believe in accidents certainly not in this one the motion he was sure was aimed at guiding his gaze toward her patch of pubic hair shed noticed him noticing it it stood out against her paleness much more than a darkerskinned zuwayzi womans did aye she knew what her weapons were and used them but those weapons wouldnt save her here hajjaj had to convince her of that wearily he said you had better listen to me i enjoy you i am not infatuated with you that i did not want iskakis to punish you does not mean i am you may not do whatever you like in my house i do not have to keep you here and i will not if i decide you abuse my hospitality have you got that tassi studied him at last she dipped her headand then a moment later nodded you mean this i think you had best believe i mean it hajjaj nodded too how can you be so cold the yaninan woman exclaimed i ran my kingdoms affairs the whole of my adult life hajjaj said did you think i would not be able to run my own but you ran your kingdoms affairs here tassi touched a painted fingernail to her forehead your own affairsthose belong here her finger came to rest near her left nipple i find less difference between the two than you seem to hajjaj said if my wits tell me my heart is making me act like a fool why should i go on doing it because your heart drives you because you are passionate she meant it hajjaj was sure of that he shook his head even so i would rather be right right tassi scornfully tossed her head wouldnt you rather be happy hajjaj thought about that i am happyor as happy as i can be with unkerlant too strong in this land if you mean do i want to be head over heels in love well no i have too many years and the wrong temperament for that his chuckle was rueful a good many of his own countrymen thought him coldblooded too tassi snorted but she also nodded again this time without using a yaninan gesture first i will remember she said and turned again walked wasnt quite the word the twists her bare backside made did their best to refute everything hajjaj had told her he chuckled enjoying someone in bed wasnt the same as falling in love with heror with him hajjaj supposed hed needed more than a few years to reach that conclusion but he was convinced of it now and besides he thought any woman who wants to make me fall head over heels in love with her isnt going to have much chance to do it because im already head over heels in love with someone else how kolthoum would laugh if he told her that and why shouldnt she laugh her temperament was much the same as his own that was one reason why he loved her why the two of them fit like foot and sandal why he wondered how he might go on living if anything happened to her arranged marriages didnt usually work out so then again from what hed seen marriages springing from first fruits of passion didnt usually work out so either every once in a while you get lucky he rose to his feet and left the library he wasnt much surprised when tewfik came up to him a few minutes later and said you put a flea in her ear did you young fellow no one could have overheard his conversation with tassi but tewfik might have been as much prophet as majordomo hajjaj was convinced the old man knew what went on well before it happened i hope i did hajjaj said now maybe shell listen maybe shell go on thinking she can do just as she pleases the way lalla did shes smarter than lalla tewfik said i think so too hajjaj said i hope she is for her sake i dont want to give her back to iskakis but if she makes me not want to have her around either pity marquis balastro didnt want to keep her tewfik said pity balastro got himself hauled down to unkerlant too you could have sent her to him if he hadnt for one thing he didnt want her any more that was part of the reason she came here if youll recall hajjaj said the majordomo nodded hajjaj also thought it a pity the algarvian minister to zuwayza had been sent down to unkerlant had that not happened he wouldnt have been a retired diplomat himself but a great pity balastro got taken away swemmels men blazed him you know i had heard that aye sir most unfortunate im sure the marquis would be the first to agree with you hajjaj said tewfik coughed if i may say so sir it is perhaps not the worst of things that the unkerlanters passion for vengeance should be aimed mostly at our late allies and not at us passion indeed hajjaj saidone more dangerous exercise of it and i fear you are right there too as you usually are the majordomo made a selfdeprecating gesture inside though he would be preening hajjaj had known him all his own life and was sure of it but his praise of tewfik hadnt been hypocritical had the unkerlanters wanted to avenge themselves on zuwayza as they were avenging themselves on algarve he might have been blazed alongside balastro he wondered why swemmel was so much more intent on punishing the redheads maybe there was some sense in unkerlant that the zuwayzin had had good reason for waging the war they did after all the unkerlanters had invaded zuwayza before the war with algarve started king shazli owed them as much revenge as he could get and if he lined up with the algarvians to grab it then he did that was all or maybe im imagining things hajjaj thought if im giving swemmel a sense of justice thats bound to be senility creeping up on me if i may make a suggestion sir tewfik said by all means hajjaj said you really should get the roofers out here sir before the fall rainy season begins the majordomo said if the powers above be kind they may perhaps find some leaks before the rain makes them obvious and if they dont find any theyll start some to give them business later hajjaj hated roofers chance we take said tewfik who did not admire them either if we dont have them out though the rain is bound to show us where the holes are youre right of course hajjaj said why dont you see to it then ill do that sir tewfik said i expect theyll be out in the next few days ancient and bent he shuffled away hajjaj stared after him what exactly was that last supposed to mean had the majordomo already summoned the roofers and was he getting retroactive permission for it that was what it sounded like hajjaj shrugged hed run zuwayzas foreign affairs for a generation aye tewfik had been running this household a lot longer than that what will happen when he finally falls over dead hajjaj wondered his shoulders went up and down in another shrug he wouldnt have been at all surprised to find tewfik outlasting him the majordomo seemed as resistant to change as the hills outside bishah for a moment that thought cheered hajjaj then he frowned what would happen to these hills if someone unleashed on them the appalling sorcery the kuusamans and lagoans had used against gyorvar nothing good hajjaj was sure of that the more he heard about that spell the more it frightened him hed thought the first reports to come in to bishah no more than frightened exaggerations but theyd proved less than the dreadful reality hed never before known rumor to fall behind truth hed heard minister horthys aides had had to keep watch on the gyongyosian minister day and night to make sure he didnt slay himself hajjaj didnt know whether that was true he did know horthy hadnt been seen in public since gyongyos surrendered to the islanders and to unkerlant he sighed so many things that had once seemed as changeless as these hills looked different doubtful dangerous in the aftermath of the derlavaian war for as long as hed been alive algarve had been the pivotal kingdom in the east the one around which events revolved the one toward which her neighbors looked with awe and dread that had remained so even after she lost the six years war no more hajjaj was sure of that it wasnt just that mezentios kingdom had been shattered with one king in algarve propped up by the islanders the other by swemmel of unkerlant but algarve had shattered herself morally as well no one could look toward her now without disgust that marked a great change in the world would everyone turn to unkerlant then swemmel surely ruled the most powerful kingdom on the mainland of derlavai would yaninans and forthwegians and zuwayzin and even algarvians start shouting efficiency at the top of their lungs the notion made hajjaj queasy but where else would folk look kuusamo maybe he thought kuusamo and lagoas were the only kingdoms that could hope to hold any sort of balance against unkerlant kuusamo isnt even a kingdom not really hajjaj reminded himself how does it hold together under seven princes somehow it managed and more than managed its soldiers had done more than the lagoans to beat algarve in the east and it had also beaten gyongyos even without the final sorcery aye kuusamo was a place to watch hard to have a vicious tyranny like unkerlants with seven lords in place of one hajjaj thought and anything else he was sure made a better choice than swemmel of unkerlant twenty here vanai elfryth held out a platter would you like another slice of mutton no thank you vanai said im full her motherinlaw frowned are you sure powers above you havent even finished what youve got there now that we have enough food again you really ought to eat im full vanai repeated she meant it too in fact what shed already eaten was sitting none too comfortably in her belly ill have some more mutton ealstan said and pass the porridge too please garlic and mushrooms and almonds he grinned and smacked his lips hestan picked up the bowl and handed it to vanai pass this to your husband all right she said and did shed had a helping of porridge herself and liked it but the odor of garlic wafting up from it now made her insides churn here she told ealstan then gulping she left the table in a hurry when she came back shed got rid of what was bothering hergot rid of it most literally she took a cautious sip of wine to kill the nasty taste in her mouth she swallowed it even more cautiously wondering if her stomach would rebel again but the wine gave her no trouble mama saxburh said from her high chair vanai gave her a wan smile the baby looked to be wearing more porridge than shed eaten are you all right dear elfryth asked im finenow vanai said something in her tone made her motherinlaws eyes widen oh she said and then if im wrong youll tell me but is saxburh going to have a little brother or sister so much for keeping it a secret a while longer vanai thought of course bolting from the table in the middle of a good meal had a way of killing a secret dead vanai made herself nod aye i think she will and maybe it hadnt been such a secret after all hestan nodded and said youve been falling asleep pretty early lately thats always a sign ealstan said i thought so too i wasnt going to ask you for another little while though so well have a twoyearold and a baby in the house at the same time will we he looked from his father to his mother how did you two manage its simple enough hestan answered you go mad most of the time though youre too busy to notice youve done it elfryth nodded emphatically saxburh plucked the spoon from her bowl of porridge and flung it on the floor done she announced vanai grabbed the bowl before it followed ealstan surveyed his daughter before we turn her loose i think we ought to take her to the public baths they might have enough water to get her properly clean shes not so bad as that vanai said a wet rag will do the job just fine and so it did though saxburh liked getting washed no better than usual sometimes washing her face wasnt much different from wrestling another grandchild hestan smiled i like that so do i elfryth said we can enjoy them but vanai and ealstan have to do most of the work whats not to like about an arrangement like that ha ealstan said in a hollow voice ha ha ha what makes you think your mother was joking hestan asked sounding as serious as he did most of the time no matter how serious he sounded vanai knew better than to take him seriously youboth of youhave given us lots of help with saxburh i know youll help some with the new baby too of course well do moreits our child after all you married a sensible woman son hestan said to ealstan my only question is if shes as sensible as she seems why did she marry you in a lot of families a question like that would have been the opening blaze in a row here ealstan didnt even blink i fooled her i told her i was rich and i came from a good family she hadnt met you yet of course so she didnt know what a liar i was well i like that elfryth said but her eyes twinkled too im sorry mother ealstan said i guess im only half a liar oh stop all of you vanai said shed seen how ealstan and his family teased one another without angering or hurting anybody shed seen it aye but she didnt understand it or fully believe it had she and her own grandfather made cracks like that the air around the two of them would have frozen for days brivibas appreciated a certain sort of dry wit but hed had no sense of humor to speak of and i always meant everything i told him too vanai thought looking back some of the things shed said didnt make her proud but her grandfather had always had the knack for infuriating her saxburh banged both little fists down on the high chairs tray interrupting her mothers gloomy reflections out she said shes talking very well elfryth said as vanai turned the baby loose shes going to be smart she shook her head no shes already smart must take after her mother hestan remarked no doubt ealstan agreed do you suppose im an idiot because i got it from you or just because you raised me both id say hestan answered placidly he turned to vanai and shifted from forthwegian to classical kaunian when do you intend to teach the baby this language along with ours my fatherinlaw i didnt do it before because of the occupation vanai said in the same language if shed spoken the wrong tongue while we were sorcerously disguised that could have been very bad of course hestan said but you can do it nowand you should i think with so many of your people gone on account of the cursed algarvians classical kaunian is in danger of dying out as a birthspeech after so many generations that would be very bad too ive had the same thought vanai said that a forthwegian would feel as she did surprised her ealstan would ealstan does she thought but ealstan was in love with her his father wasnt but he gets a lot of his ideas from his father she shook her head bemused at arguing with herself hestan plucked at his thick gray beard im not my brother and i thank the powers above that im not he said we dont all hate kaunians and kaunianity even if the war let too many who do run wild i know that vanai said if i didnt know that would i have married your son would we have a baby whos not one thing or the other with another one on the way no indeed hestan answered but sometimes these things do need saying fair enough vanai nodded saxburh scrambled up into her lap the toddler looked curiously from her to hestan and back again they were talking but they were using words she hadnt heard much before and couldnt understand by her wide eyes that was very interesting ealstan said the next question is how do i make enough money to feed a wife and two babies and maybe even myself he laughed after six years of questions like how do i stay alive and how do i keep the cursed redheads from murdering my wifeafter worrying about questions like those thinking of money isnt so bad ive never gone hungry and neither did my children hestan said i dont think yours have much to worry about if this were real peace i wouldnt worry ealstan said but with everything all torn to pieces by the war business just isnt what it used to be not now his father agreed but its bound to get better it could hardly get worse after all and were still willing to share you know havent we taken enough already ealstan said were a family this is what families are for elfryth nodded most vehemently toward vanai from personal experience vanai had only a vague notion of what families were for she didnt want to shrug so she just sat still her husband still seemed unhappy youre not helping conberge the same way youre helping us so were not and do you know why hestan asked ealstan shook his head his father went on because grimbalds parents are helping the two of themthe three of them soonthats why oh ealstan said in a small voice vanai said thank you very much for everything youve done for us i dont know what we would have done without you this is what families are for elfryth repeated hestan added and if you and ealstan got by in the middle of eoforwic in the middle of the war i dont expect you would have had much trouble here in gromheort in peacetime its because he says things like that vanai realized that all his teasing doesnt pack a sting ealstan couldnt doubt he really was loved no matter how sardonic his father got and the ley line ran in both directions that was obvious too saxburh screwed up her face and grunted no matter how clever she was she was a long way from knowing how to wait when she needed to go vanai eagerly looked forward to the day when she learned but another babys coming she thought in sudden dismay even after saxburh knows what to do her little brother or sister wont she carried her daughter away to clean up the mess come on you little stinker she said saxburh thought that was funny so did vanaibut only after shed washed her hands after saxburh went to bed vanai soon followed in this pregnancy as in the one before she found herself sleepy all the time another baby ealstan said in wondering tones i had thought you might be expecting againyour courses hadnt come no they hadnt vanai replied around a yawn they wont not for a while now she laughed a little i miss nine months of cramps and then i get to make up for it all at once and then some if its a boy id like to name him leofsig for my brother ealstan said vanai didnt see how she could quarrel with that especially not when leofsig from all shed heard had got on with kaunians as well as the rest of this remarkable forthwegian family didand when sidroc whod gone into plegmunds brigade had killed him nodding she said i would like to give him or her if its a girla kaunian name too of course ealstan said he hadnt quarreled he hadnt even hesitated hed just said of course vanai gave him a hug i love you she told him i love you too he answered seriously thats what makes it all worthwhile by the powers above i do hope ill be able to keep feeding everybody i think you will vanai said ealstan still looked worried she added your father thinks you will too hes a very sharp man if he thinks you can manage hes likely right ealstan kissed her youre the one who always knows the right thing to say she yawned again what im going to say now is good night she rolled over onto her side and felt sleep coming down on her like a soft dark blanket she yawned one more time tomorrow life would go on it was an utterly ordinary thoughtfor anyone who hadnt been through what vanai had to her the ordinary would never seem so again not when she compared it to the years just past being able to have an ordinary life who really could want much more than that not me she thought and slept pekka had run the largest most complex sorcerous project the land of the seven princes had ever known over in the naantali district mages by the dozen had leaped to obey her thanks to the project the gyongyosians had surrendered and the derlavaian war was over aye and so elimaki said when pekka went over her accomplishments and so and so pekka threw her hands in the air and scowled at her sister and so youd think id be able to put together a simple wedding thats and so wouldnt you dont worry about it elimaki said soothingly youre doing fine everything will be wonderful youre only getting upset because its three days away and because the caterer and the florist havent got a cluenot even a hintabout what theyre supposed to be doing pekka added theyre both idiots how do they stay in business when theyre such idiots theyve both been in business as long as weve been alive her sister pointed out come the day everything will be perfect her mouth tightened a few years later though who knows barristers and solicitors were still gnawing over the remains of her marriage a marriage as much a wartime casualty as any wounded soldier pekka wished elimaki hadnt said that im nervous enough as things are she said if you dont want to go through with it elimaki began its not that pekka broke in shaking her head its not that at all she hoped she wasnt trying to convince herself as well as elimaki but how can i help worrying about it i worry about everything i have to i hope youre as happy ten years from now as you will be when you say your vows elimaki told her uto thinks the world of fernao if that means anything to you it means a lot pekka said the only question i have is whether it should make me happy or scare me elimaki laughed she knew pekkas son as well as pekka did herself she might know uto better than i do pekka thought the past few years shes seen a lot more of him than i have a little of both she said you dont want him not to like fernao i certainly dont pekka said but you wonder what hes liking if he likes him too much her sister went on how much of a mischievous little boy can your fiancé be some i expect pekka answered most men can from everything ive seen she thought of ilmarinen who still had a wide streak of mischievous little boy in him at more than twice her age he and uto had recognized each other as two of a kind that was another frightening thought if utos content with fernao thats good elimaki said a boy should have a man around i think she hesitated then nodded to herself and went on and you dont have to tell him anything either no pekka said that crossed my mind too as far as she was concerned it was far better that uto never find out she and fernao had been lovers before leino died her son would have a much easier time accepting fernao as a stepfather this way than as someone who might have displaced his real father even if leino hadnt died simpler elimaki said aye pekka nodded and the world usually isnt simple either dont i know it elimaki exclaimed its never simple once the solicitors get their claws into it believe me it isnt powers below eat olavin why didnt he just walk in front of a leyline caravan pekka thought she understood why olavin had taken up with his secretary hed been away from his wife for a long time so hed found someone else shed done something not far removed from that herself since she saw no way to tell elimaki anything of the sort without making her sister burst like an egg she prudently kept her mouth shut elimaki asked what sort of trouble is the caterer giving you that made pekka want to burst like an egg the moron the idiot the imbecile hes telling me he cant get enough smoked salmon for the feast why not why ill tell you why because his illiterate crackbrained assistant who does his ordering didnt order enough thats why pekka said he knew how much id asked for he just forgot to get it incompetent bungler powers above i wish we still took heads the way our ancestors did in the old days but his would be empty elimaki went out to the kitchen when she came back she was carrying two mugs of brandy here she handed one of them to pekka drink this youll feel better in the old days in the old days this would have been fermented reindeer milk her sister said firmly pekka found herself nodding she took a sip and nodded again sure enough civilization had made progress in the past thousand years elimaki went on everything will be fine at the wedding youll see and i hope everything will be fine afterwards but thats up to youyou and fernao i mean well do the best we can pekka said thats all anybody can do by the time shed finished the brandy she did feel better her sister had poured her a hefty tot she also felt sleepy and let elimaki put her to bed she was sure she would be worried again in the morning but she wasntonly frantic which wasnt quite the same thing frantic seemed to do the job she approached the caterer with blood in her eye and not only got a promise of all the smoked salmon shed ordered but got it at a reduced rate to make up for the problem our error caused you the fellow said to get you out of the shop before you murder someone was what he probably meant the day of the wedding dawned fair and mild pekka let out a long sigh of relief with summer past and autumn beginning weather in kajaani was always a gamble aye a canopy behind elimakis house would have shielded the guests from the worst of it but she didnt want everyone to have to come swaddled in furs and she especially didnt want to bring the ceremony indoors old old custom said weddings belonged outside under the sun and the wind and the sky if caught between old old custom and an early snowstorm i dont know what i would have done pekka thought im glad i dont have to worry about it we might almost be gyongyosians talking about the stars she was just getting into her leggings and elaborately embroidered tunic a good hour before people were supposed to start arriving when somebody knocked on the front door if thats fernao you can keep him she called to elimaki otherwise hit him over the head and drag him off to one side but it wasnt fernao and elimaki didnt hit him over the head i need to speak to pekka ilmarinen declared pekka threw her hands in the air thinking i might have known fastening the last couple of bone toggles she went out to the front room what is it she snapped it had better be interesting arent i always he asked with one of his raffish smiles she folded her arms across her chest what you always are without fail is a nuisance i havent got time for you to be a nuisance right now master ilmarinen say your say and come back when youre supposed to or youll make me sorry i invited you here let me show you he pulled a leaf of closely written calculations from his beltpouch and handed it to her it proves what ive been saying all along i really havent got time for this now but pekka took the paperit was either that or throw him out bodily she glanced through it and stopped after a moment it went from straight sorcerous calculation to purporting to prove by the same kind of calculations that she and fernao would have a happy marriage not a dozen people in the world could have followed all of itand she could imagine only one who could have written it she wondered how much labor and thought had gone into it in spite of herself she couldnt stay annoyed thank you very much she told him ill treasure it do better than that ilmarinen said make it come true he ducked out of the house pekka hoped hed remember to come back at the right time fernao did show up a few minutes later along with the burgomaster of kajaani who would recite the marriage vows the burgomaster who was a plump little man only a couple of inches taller than pekka looked odd standing beside her tall lean lagoan fiancé i hope youll be very happy the man kept saying oh i expect we will pekka answered in fact i have proof she passed fernao the paper ilmarinen had given her he started looking through it then did the same sort of double take she had who gave you this he said and held up a hand no dont tell me im a zuwayzi if its not ilmarinen pekka nodded fernao got down to the bottom and shook his head theres nobody like him nobody even close pekka looked fernao over how splendid you are am i he didnt sound convinced where any kuusaman man would have his tunic his jacket his leggings were even fancier than hers all the embroidery looked done by hand though it had surely had sorcerous augmentation so your jelgavan exile did a good job itsmagnificent pekka said good if anything fernao sounded amused its not what id wear back at home but if it makes people here happy thats good enough for me you are most impressive said the burgomaster looking up and up at fernao you will make an imposing addition to our fair city someone else knocked on the door an early arriving guest there was always bound to be one uto pekka called when her son appeared she said take the lady back out to the canopy all right uto said as docile as if hed never got into trouble in his life come with me please maam arent you sweet said the woman a distant cousin which only proved how distant she was before long pekka and fernao walked up a lane through the seated guests and stood before the burgomaster as representative of the seven princes of kuusamo i am pleased to be acting in this capacity today the fellow said it is far more pleasant than most of the duties i am called upon to fulfill he went on and on he was a burgomaster part of his job pleasant or not was making speeches uto stood beside pekka and a pace behind her he soon started to fidget a gleam came into his eyes pekka was keeping an eye on him and spotted it ever so slightly she shook her head her son looked disappointed but to her vast relief nodded and then at last the burgomaster got to the part of his duties he couldnt avoid no matter how much he talked do you pekka take this man fernao to be your husband forevermore aye pekka said in fernaos eyes the burgomaster of kajaani was a ridiculous little man not because he was a kuusamanby now fernao took kuusamans altogether for grantedbut because he was absurdly selfimportant but he didnt seem ridiculous at all as he asked do you fernao take this woman pekka to be your wife forevermore aye fernao did his best to make his voice something more than a husky whisper his best proved none too good but the burgomaster nodded and so did pekka they were the people who really counted by the authority vested in me by the people of kajaani and by the seven princes of kuusamo i now declare you man and wife the burgomaster said forevermore that word seemed to roll down on fernao like a boulder he hadnt come to kuusamo intending to find a wifeespecially not a woman who was then married to somebody else he hadnt even found kuusaman women particularly attractive but here he was and what hed just done did have certain compensations beaming the burgomaster turned to him you may now kiss your bride when fernao did all the kuusamans among the guestseveryone in other words except for a few cousins and an old uncle of his and grandmaster pinhiero burst into cheers and shouted they are married somebody had told him they would do that but hed forgotten it made him jump in lagoas as in most places passing a ring marked the actual moment of marriage the kuusamans did things differently as they often did i love you he told pekka i love you too she answered thats one of the better reasons for doing this wouldnt you say her eyes sparkled well now that you mention it fernao said pekka snorted if i may take my usual privilege the burgomaster kissed her too from some of the things fernao had read in the old days a kuusaman chieftains privilege had gone a good deal further than that one more reason to be glad we live in the modern age fernao thought where some kuusaman customs were very different the receiving line was just the same he and pekka stood side by side shaking hands with people and accepting congratulations a pretty ceremony my boy said his uncle a bony man named sampaio i didnt understand a word of it mind you but very pretty im glad you could come fernao answered speaking lagoan felt distinctly odd he didnt do it much these days but his uncle a successful builder knew no kuusaman and had long since forgotten whatever classical kaunian hed learned sampaio stuck an elbow in his ribs and chuckled and thats one blaze of a suit youve got on too he said fernao also thought he was on the gaudy side of splendid but he shrugged and forced a grin its what they wear here what can i do about it powers below eat me if i know sampaio gave fernao a hug i hope youre happy with her boy she seems nice even if we cant talk to each other well i wouldnt marry her if i didnt like her fernao said which made his uncle laugh he suspected pekka spoke a little more lagoan than she let on no point telling that to his uncle though he didnt think sampaio would be coming down to kajaani again anytime soon elimaki came up to him and gave him a fierce hug you take good care of my sister she said you take good care of her or you answer to me i will i intend to fernao said youd better elimaki made it sound like a threat remembering how her marriage had collapsed not so long before fernao supposed he understood why she sounded that way which didnt make it any less unnerving ilmarinen had a different take on things as he usually did sidling up to fernao he said i hope its still as much fun now that youve gone and made it official thank you so much for your good wishes fernao exclaimed always a pleasure always a pleasure ilmarinen wagged a finger at him see what you get for saving me from myself thats not the best recipe for getting a man to love you forever you know dont be silly fernao said you didnt love me even before then ilmarinen chuckled nastily maybe we understand each other after all now im going to raid the feast you have to stand here gabbing with the rest of these bores till half the good stuffs gone and off he went cackling like a broody hen before fernao could figure out what to say to thatnot that it gave him much room for a comebackhe found himself clasping wrists with grandmaster pinhiero the head of the lagoan guild of mages said i didnt remember meeting her before now ive got at least some notion of why you were willing to move to the back of beyond i wish you were still in setubal but i hope youll be happy thank you sir fernao hadnt been sure the grandmaster would be even that gracious but pinhiero he discovered had other things on his mind besides this wedding he asked do you know a thirdrank mage named botelho from down in ruivaes i know the townmiserable little place fernao answered ive never heard of the man neither has anyone else pinhiero said grimly his documents are all perfect he passed every obvious sorcerous test with easebut he turned out to be an algarvian on masquerade powers below eat him fernao said spying for king mainardo worse pinhiero replied while fernao was still wondering what could be worse the grandmaster told him spying for king swemmel fernao wished he hadnt cursed before he really wanted to do it now he contented himself with saying swemmel really wants to know things doesnt he just a bit pinhieros voice was dry the other interesting question is how many other guild members arent what theyre supposed to be youd do well to find out fernao said me im just as well pleased to be down here thank you very much aye have a good time while the worlds going down the commode around you pinhiero jeered fernao gave him a bright cheerful meaningless smile if you think you can make me feel guilty on my wedding day youd better think again tomorrow wont be your wedding day and youll still be down here the grandmaster said sourly you ought to come back to a place where things happen once in a while if things didnt happen here i never would have started working with the kuusamans in the first place fernao pointed out grandmaster pinhiero scowled at him i dont have to take his orders any more or even listen to his complaints fernao thought he turned away from pinhiero just in time to see pekka drop to one knee before a kuusaman younger than she was but her folk only do that for fernao needed no more than half the thought before leaning on his cane to bow very low himself your highness he murmured as you were both of you prince juhainen said pekka rose fernao straightened the prince went on powers above grant that you spend many happy years together thank you very much your highness fernao and pekka said together they smiled at each other juhainen smiled too and moved on toward the reception inside elimakis house in a low voice fernao said well sweetheart if you have any kin who havent been giving you enough respect one of the seven princes at your wedding ought to do the job i dont know pekka said people like that would complain because i didnt have two or three of the seven down here eventually the last cousins friends and colleagues went inside which meant fernao and pekka could too the caterer came up to pekka with something like panic on his face the smoked salmon he began she cut him off if anythings gone wrong with that deliveryespecially after all your promisesi wont just take it out of your fee ill blacken your name all over town but dont bother me about it now not on my wedding day his face a mask of misery the caterer fled how much will it matter if you blacken his name fernao asked his new bride looked surprised quite a bit she answered and then must have realized why hed asked the question for she went on this isnt setubal there wont be thousands and thousands of people here whove never heard of him when folks here find out about a fiasco itll hurt his business and it should its a small town fernao thought that would take getting used to as far as he could see the caterer had set out a very respectable spread everything he ate was good from prawns to slices of raw reindeer meat dipped in a fiery sauce he didnt particularly miss the smoked salmon but if it was supposed to be on the menu and wasnt there the caterer deserved at least some of the trouble in which hed landed a valmieran wine washed down the delicacies fernao would have expected one from jelgava tangy with lemon and orange juice then he remembered that pekka and leino had gone on holiday to jelgava if pekka didnt want to remind herself of days gone forever he understood that someone not far away let out a startled squawk someone else exclaimed how in blazes did a hedgehog get loose here people shooed the little animal out the door voice even grimmer than when shed dealt with the caterer pekka said wheres uto herson once found loudly protested his innocencetoo loudly to convince fernao pekka didnt look convinced either but a wedding reception was no place for a thorough interrogation uto escaped with a warning just this side of a threat and then the carriage that would take fernao and pekka to a hostel for their wedding night pulled up in front of elimakis house guests pelted them with little acorns and dried berriessymbols of fertility careful pekka warned fernao as they went down the walk to the carriage dont slip with his bad leg that was advice to take seriously i wont he said pekka protectively took his arm to make sure he didnt at the hostel another bottle of wine waited in a bed of snow pekka poured some for each of them she raised hers in salute were married were here were by ourselves its all right or as all right as it can be i love you fernao said they both drank to that he added what id bet you really feel like doing about now is collapsing thats one of the things i feel like doing aye pekka nodded but theres something else to attend to too is there fernao said as if he had no idea what she was talking about before long they were attending to it it was nothing they hadnt attended to a good many times before but no less enjoyable on account of thatmore enjoyable if anything because they knew each other better now and each knew what the other enjoyed and the first time after the ceremony made things official as it were i love you fernao said again lazy in the afterglow a good thing too after we just got married pekka replied a good thing he stroked her youre right it is a carpetbag by his feet ilmarinen stood on the platform at the leyline caravan depot in kajaani waiting for the caravan that would take him back up to yliharma he was not very surprised when a tall lagoan his oncered hair now gray walked up onto the same platform hello pinhiero you shifty old son of a whore he said in fluent classical kaunian come on over here and keep me company i dont know that i ought to the grandmaster of the lagoan guild of mages replied in the same tongue youd probably try to slit my beltpouch thats what you deserve for wearing such a silly thing ilmarinen said unperturbed pinhiero set his carpetbag down next to ilmarinens besides whom are you calling old you were cheating people before i was even a gleam in my papas eye dont worryyouve made up for it since ilmarinen said and youre the one who needs to steal from me more than i need to steal from you a year ago i would have the grandmaster said not now now i have what i need you boys did play fair on that one and i thank you for it dont thank me thank pekka and the seven princes ilmarinen told him if id had my way youd still be out on the street corner begging for coppers i wouldnt even have told you my name let alone anything else he waited for pinhiero to fly into a temper instead the lagoan mage said well maybe thats not so foolish as you usually are did you hear what i was telling fernao at the wedding last night cant say that i did ilmarinen answered pinhiero spoke of the algarvian in swemmels pay whom the lagoan guild of mages had unmasked ilmarinen scowled oh thats just what we need isnt it might have known the unkerlanters would try to steal what weve done its a lot faster and a lot cheaper than sitting down and doing the work themselves i expected they would try to spy pinhiero said i didnt expect them to be so good at it who knows if this one whoreson is the only mage they planted on us well have to do some more digging but this bastards credentials were good and he speaks lagoan as well as i do thats not saying much ilmarinen remarked pinhiero glared at him to the crows with you my friend he said trotting out the curse as if he were a kaunian from imperial days thank you so much ilmarinen gave the grandmaster a little half bow which made pinhiero no happier if youre so confounded smart what would you do about these fornicating algarvians in swemmels pay the lagoan demanded oh i can think of a couple of things ilmarinen said lightly pinhiero wagged a ringer at him and those are talk is cheap ilmarinen especially when you dont have to back it up ilmarinen bristled why should i tell you anything you old fraud all you do is insult me as far as i can see you deserve spies fine pinhiero said my first guess is you havent got any answers my second guess is youd be happy to see swemmel able to match our spells those both struck home nettled ilmarinen snapped itd be just like you lagoan bunglers to let him have the secrets to them before the grandmaster could answer the leyline caravan came into the depot from the north passengers got off along with the others waiting on the platform ilmarinen and pinhiero got on they went into an empty fourperson compartment and glared so fiercely at the other people who stuck in their noses that they still had it to themselves when the caravan started back towards yliharma as soon as it began to move they began to argue again im tired of your hot air ilmarinen pinhiero said if you werent such a stupid clot youd be able to see these things for yourself ilmarinen retorted see what things the lagoan mage said all i see is a fraud who talks fancy and doesnt back it up you say you have these magical answershe used the word with malice aforethoughtand then you dont say what they are and the reason you dont say is that you havent really got them five goldpieces say i do and better than anything youve come up with ilmarinen said grandmaster pinhiero thrust out his hand youre on by the powers above ilmarinen clasped pinhieros hand and then took his wrist in an algarvicstyle grip pinhiero gave him a seated bow all right your magnificence weve made the bet now talk i will ilmarinen said the first thing you need to do is you need to get swemmel thinking the algarvians hes hired to do his dirty work for him are going to pass whatever they find out to their own mages and not to him if anything will give swemmel nightmares its the idea of algarve getting strong again am i right or am i wrong he knew perfectly well he was right king swemmel saw plotters everywhere and he had plenty of reason to dread algarve even pinhiero didnt deny it all he said was you may be right what i may be is on the way to winning my bet ilmarinen said laughing are you doing any of that now none of your business the grandmaster said ha that means youre not i know you ilmarinen said and pinhiero didnt deny that either ilmarinen went on the other thing you need to do is you need to make some false results and put them where a spy who does a little work will come upon them they cant be out in the open or he wont trust them but if he digs and digs and then finds them hes bound to think theyre real and hell send them back to swemmel and the unkerlanter mages will try to use them and either they wont work at all or theyll be a disaster depending on how much effort you put into dreaming them up either way the unkerlanters will stop trusting what their snoops are feeding them youre not doing that either are you grandmaster pinhiero didnt answer right away he shifted his weight so he could get at his beltpouch then took out five gold coins and passed them to ilmarinen here he said if i were wearing a hat id take it off to you youre twistier than an eel dancing with an octopus thank you very much ilmarinen said smugly how in blazes do you come up with these things pinhiero asked with a little luck theyll tie the unkerlanters in knots for months maybe even years youre supposed to think of them for yourself ilmarinen said why are you grandmaster if not to think of things like that it cant be because youre such a brilliant wizard we both know youre not as far as magecraft goes fernao is worth ten of you hes a clever fellow pinhiero admitted i thought he would sit in my seat one of these years and then you kuusamans went and kidnapped him grabbed him by the prong by the powers above he leaned forward and stared suspiciously at ilmarinen was that your idea too ilmarinen shook his head not a bit of it i always thought hed cause pekka more trouble than he was worth i hope im wrong but i may be right yet a likely story pinhiero said i dont know whether youre lying or not youll never admit it if you are who me ilmarinen did his best to look innocent he hadnt had much practice at it and didnt bring it off well pinhiero laughed raucously ilmarinen muttered something under his breath here hed told the unvarnished truth and the lagoan grandmaster hadnt believed him as far as he was concerned that was just like lagoans as did their algarvian cousins they often thought they knew everything there was to know they couldnt get it through their heads that he and a lot of other kuusamans trusted them no further than the lagoans trusted folk from the land of the seven princes of course that cut both ways as pinhiero proved when he said do you have any notion how much it galls us to follow your lead some maybe ilmarinen said weve been stronger than you for a while now you just didnt notice because most of what we did was out in the bothnian ocean and on islands in the great northern sea where you dont have an interest and besides were only kuusamanswe dont make a big racket about what we do the way algarvic folk enjoy so much we just go on about our business grandmaster pinhiero turned a dull red he had to know ilmarinen was right however little he cared to admit it he said the world is changing by the way he said it he wished the world werent back in the days when the kaunian empire was tottering to a fall a lot of nobles there would have said the same thing ilmarinen observed they would have said it in the same language were using as a matter of fact so not everything changes easy for you to say such things ilmarinenyoure on the rising side pinhiero replied me i have to look at my kingdom shrinking not in size only in influence ilmarinen said things would have looked a lot worse for you had mezentio won the war for that matter the algarvians didnt even manage a full sorcerous attack against setubal they did against yliharma i was there youre always in the way of trouble pinhiero said the grandmaster subsided into gloomy silence as the leyline caravan went through over the vaattojarvi hills the weather was milder and the land fairer on the north side of the hills but pinhiero seemed no happier at last not too long before the caravan got into yliharma he burst out is this what we fought so hard for is this why we spent so many men and so much treasure to hand leadership in the world over to you well if you hadnt fought youd have handed it over to algarve ilmarinen answered and you may not have handed it to us you may have handed it to unkerlant instead you do so relieve my mind the lagoan grandmaster said and ilmarinen threw back his head and laughed pinhiero glared at him if the world does turn out to be unkerlants youll laugh out of the other side of your mouth by the powers above no doubt ilmarinen said no doubt at all but i at least wont be wearing that foolish expression on my face for itll come as no surprise and i assure you kuusamo will work as hard against the rise of unkerlant as we did against algarve and for most of the same reasons can you lagoans say as much when you cant even keep spies out of your guild of mages you cannot hold me responsible for the fact that algarvians and lagoans look much alike grandmaster pinhiero ground out no but i can hold you responsible for forgetting that that fact has consequences ilmarinen said this is why during the war we were so reluctant to train lagoans in the new sorcery we werent sure they would all be lagoans if you take my meaning pinhieros glower grew darker than ever before he could say anything more a conductor came through the caravan cars calling yliharma everybody out for yliharma ilmarinen laughed and clapped his hands hed managed to annoy the lagoan grandmaster all the way up from kajaani and hed got the last word as the leyline caravan slowed to a stop he grabbed his carpetbag and hurried for the door the fields around skarnus castle were golden with ripening grain some of the leaves on the trees were going golden too with others fiery orange still others red as blood from the battlements he could see a long way a mild breeze stirred his hair turning to merkela he said its beautiful his wife nodded aye it is her nails clicked as she drummed her fingers on the gray stone its harvest time i ought to be working not standing around here like somebody who doesnt know a sickle from a scythe when i walked onto your farm five years ago i didnt know a sickle from a scythe skarnu reminded her no but you learned and you worked merkela said im not working now and i wish i were youd make a lot of farmers nervous if you did skarnu said i know merkela said unhappily ive seen that all the fairy tales talk about how wonderful it is for the peasant girl to marry the prince and turn into a noblewoman and most of it is but not all of it because i cant do what ive been doing all my life and i miss it skarnu had never worked so hard in his life as when bringing in the harvest he didnt miss it at all saying that would only annoy merkela so he kept quiet she probably knew him well enough to understand it was in his thoughts valmiru came up on the battlements just then skarnu turned to the butler with something like relief aye what is it a woman with a petition to present to you your excellency valmiru replied a petition really a written one skarnu asked and valmiru nodded skarnu scratched his head isnt that interesting most of the time people here just tell me what theyve got in mind they dont go to the trouble of writing it out if nothing else had that by itself would have told him he was in the country he went down the spiral staircase the woman plainly a peasant waited nervously she dropped him an awkward curtsy good day your excellency she said and thrust a leaf of paper at him she would have retreated then but he held up a hand to stop her wait he added wait she did fright and weariness warring on her sunroughened face he read through the petition which was written in a semiliterate scrawl and phrased as a peasant imagined a solicitor would put things full of fancy curlicues that added nothing to the meaning and sometimes took away lets see if i have this straight he said when he was done youre the widow named latsisa she nodded thats me your excellency she bit her lip looking as if she regretted ever coming to him and you have a bastard boy you want me to declare legitimate skarnu went on thats right latsisa said looking down at her scuffed shoes and flushing how old is this boy skarnu asked you dont say here latsisa stared down at her shoes once more in a low voice she answered hes almost three your excellency is he skarnu said and the peasant woman nodded miserably skarnu sighed sometimes being a marquis wasnt much fun he asked the question he had to ask and does he have hair thats as much red as it is blond latsisa nodded again her face a mask of pain as gently as he could skarnu said then why do you think i would be willing to make him legitimate because hes all i have latsisa blurted she seemed to take courage from that for she continued its not his fault what color his hair is is it he didnt do anything wrong and i didnt do anything against the law either all righti slept with an algarvian he was nicer to me than any valmieran man ever was im not even sorry except that he had to go but it wasnt against the law not then and its not like i was the only one eitheris it your excellency she knows about krasta skarnu thought and had to work to hold his face steady but her other arguments werent to be despised either he asked didnt you care that you were sleeping with an enemy an invader latsisa shook her head all i cared about was that we loved each other her chin came up in defiance we did by the powers above and if he ever came back here id marry him in a minute so thats why i want the boy made legitimate your excellency hes what ive got even if he were made legitimate he wont have an easy time growing up not looking the way he does skarnu said i know that latsisa answered but hell have a harder time yet if hes a bastard and you still havent told me why itd be against the law to make him all proper just on account of his father had red hair skarnu knew why he didnt want to do it but the peasant woman was right that was different from finding a reason in law why an algarvians bastard should be treated differently from any other no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than latsisa said besides the wars supposed to be over and done with now isnt it she was doing her best not to make things easy skarnu tried another tack what would your neighbors think one of my neighbors is count enkurus bastard latsisa replied the count forced his mother too powers below eat him he looks just like enkuru my neighbor does but the count never gave his mother a copper for what hed done he was a noble and his shit didnt stinkbegging your pardon your excellency thats all right skarnu said abstractedly aye there were times when this job wasnt easy at all latsisa went on so my neighbors dont get so up in arms about bastards as a lot of people would maybe sometimes they happen thats all and a person whos a bastard doesnt usually act any different than anybody else finding that ley line blocked skarnu went down another he hardened his voice and said you do know that i was a valmieran officer dont you and that my wife and i were both in the underground after the kingdom surrendered aye i know that everybody knows thatand what happened to your wifes first husband latsisa said but i thought id come and ask you anyways on account of youd got a name for judging fair her mouth twisted maybe i heard that last wrong sure seems like i did skarnus cheeks and ears heated if youre going to ask me to set aside the whole war youre asking a lot war shouldnt have anything to do with it latsisa said i just want to make my little boy legitimate wouldnt have any trouble doing that if he was a blond like me would i i tried to get merkela not to hate little gainibu i didnt have any luck even though hes my nephewmaybe especially because hes my nephew skarnu thought now heres a halfalgarvian bastard ive never even seen and im ready to hate him or at least to treat him differently from the way i would if he were all valmieran how many bastards had valmieran women borne to algarvian soldiers during the occupation thousands surelytens of thousands right now he supposed algarvian women were lying down with occupying soldiers theyd raise up another crop of bastards before long but that had nothing to do with the questions at hand would latsisa have had any trouble legitimating a blond bastard boy skarnu knew she wouldnt it would be a routine procedure unless she had legitimate children who raised a fuss should her sons case be any different in law just because he had sandy hair try as he would skarnu could see no legal justification for denying the petition he ground his teeth there was nothing he more wanted to see but he couldnt find it the peasant woman had argued him down and why not he gibed at himself merkela does it all the time thinking about merkela made him wonder how he would explain himself to her he didnt care to contemplate that right now he took the petition scrawled i approve on it and signed his name then he thrust it at latsisa here her jaw fell her eyes widened thank you your excellency she whispered i didnt think you would skarnu hadnt thought he would either i didnt do it for you he said harshly i did it for honestys sake take that do whatever you need to do to register it with the clerks and get out of my sight aye your excellency the peasant woman didnt take offense she dropped skarnu another unpracticed curtsy what they say is trueyou are a just man i hope so skarnu said i do try he gestured brusquely toward the door to the audience chamber latsisa quite sensibly left in a hurry skarnu sat where he was for a while wondering if hed done the right thing at last he decided he had however little he liked it that fortified him he had the feeling hed need fortifying later that afternoon merkela asked what did the woman want he tensed she had a bastard she wanted me to declare legitimate a bastard merkela was quick on the uptake an algarvians bastard skarnu nodded she said i hope you sent her away with a flea in her ear the miserable stinking whore no skarnu said and braced himself for trouble its not the little boys fault who his father was if his father were valmieran there wouldnt be any question about making him legitimate and so i did merkek gave him a poisonous glare thats terrible she said its not just the boy you might as well have told the woman it was all right for her to play the slut during the occupation even a whore can make a child legitimate skarnu said i know that for a fact it hasnt got anything to do with whether shes good or not only with whether the child is hers and whether anyone else in the family makes a stink here there isnt anyone else in the family but her and the boyshe was a widow before she took up with the algarvian did the redheads blaze her husband before she spread her legs for this one merkela asked i dont know the answer to that skarnu said i dont think so disgraceful merkela said is it i dont think so skarnu said there are thousands of these bastards all over valmiera theres one in this castlebauskas little girl remember what are we going to do hate all of them for as long as they live thats asking for trouble the war is over we can start to show a little pity you can maybe no merkela had no yield in her with a sigh skarnu said i have to do things here as i think right i would have caused more trouble by telling her no than i did by saying aye i still think you made a mistake merkela told him that was milder than most of the things she might have said and she pushed it no further maybe a tiny bit at a time she was mellowing if she was she would never admit it and skarnu knew better than to say anything about it which would only put her back up over these past five years hed learned to get along with his hottempered stubborn wife and if that doesnt suit me for running a marquisate powers below eat me if i know what would he gave merkela a kiss and wouldnt answer when she asked him why when ealstan came out of the shop where he and his father had been casting accounts he looked around in surprise school was right over there he said pointing down the street i didnt even notice when we got here this morning my wits must be wandering hestan looked over to the ruins of the academythe algarvians had used it for a strongpoint not much left there so im not surprised you didnt notice and your wits were working fine if they werent how did you catch that depreciation allowance i missed oh that ealstan shrugged i did plenty of those casting accounts for pybbahe was a born thief and he had me run them all the time whether he deserved them or not he shook his head in memory half fond half furious the pottery magnate turned underground leader had never done things by halves youve spoken of him now and again his father said he must have been something something aye but i still wonder what ealstan answered i would have liked him better if hed had any use for blonds but he was an oldline forthwegian patriotforthwegians against the world if you know what i mean what finally happened to him hestan asked he surrendered when we couldnt hold out in eoforwic anymore ealstan answered the unkerlanters just sat there on the other side of the twegen and let mezentios men put us down the redheads promised to treat the fighters who yielded as proper war captives but i dont know what became of him after he went into the captives camp i wouldnt care to bet whether hes still alive depends on how good the algarvians are at keeping promises his father pointed toward some broadsheets printed in blue and whiteforthwegs colors on a nearby wall those werent here this morning i wonder what people are trying to convince us of now ealstan only shrugged ive seen a million different broadsheets im not going to get excited about another one but despite his words he and his father both craned their necks toward the broadsheets as they came up to them king beornwulf comes to gromheort the sheets declared below the caption was a portrait of beornwulf looking younger and handsomer and more kingly than ealstan remembered him being back in eoforwic of course ealstan had been dragged into the unkerlanter army right after seeing beornwulf so his memories were liable to be biased a parade his father said reading the smaller print below the king of forthwegs picture a week from today he glanced over to ealstan well have to make sure we dont get stuck in trafficunless you really want to go see him no thanksi have seen him ealstan said what with what happened to me after i did im not all that excited about doing it again as if in sympathy his wounded leg twinged he took another look at the broadsheet no we dont have to worry about it the day will be a holiday so nobody will go to work nobody whos looking for an excuse to stay home anyway hestan took work very seriously indeed when ealstan got home he found that vanai and his mother had already heard about the royal visit a crier was going through the streets shouting the news elfryth said didnt you hear him uh no ealstan admitted maybe he took work too seriously himself if the crier had gone byand he probably hadhed gone by unnoticed ealstan glanced over to his father hestan looked blank too who would have imagined columns of numbers could be so alluring ealstan thought he looked from his father to vanai at least he had good reason for finding her alluring how are you he asked not bad she answered breakfast stayed down so did lunch if dinner does too it will be a good day dada saxburh said gleefully and grabbed ealstan by the leg the only part of him she could reach he picked her up and gave her a big smacking kiss she giggled have you been a good girl today he asked no she sounded proud of herself then as if to prove her point she reached out for his beard with both hands he put her down in a hurry what else has she done or dont i want to know he asked vanai about what she usually does his wife put a hand up to her mouth to hide a yawn the only trouble is im so tired all the time chasing after her wears me out more than it did ealstan kissed her after you get through the first three months or so you wont be so worn out any more thats how it worked when you were carrying saxburh anyhow i know vanai said but its different now before i had saxburh i didnt have to chase a baby and keep an eye on her and nurse her im still carrying saxburh even if she isnt inside me anymore i hope that wont make too biga difference this time around its bound to make some you wont have to stay in hiding though and it wont matter if your masking spell wears off faster than it should because youre going to have a baby ealstan said you already found that out well so i did vanai admitted no one bothered me at all no one even yelled anything nasty at me that surprised me maybe hating kaunians has got to be bad manners for a while i hope so ealstan said it always should have been kaunians are people too after the words were out of his mouth he realized he was quoting his father vanai sighed i dont think that has anything to do with why it might be out of fashion if people thought like that we never would have had much trouble but the algarvians hated kaunians and everybody hates the redheads right now so whatever they did must have been wrong with a sigh of his own ealstan nodded youre probably right i wish you werent but you probably are elfryth called them to supper then which meant they dropped it that also meant they had to capture saxburh who sometimes thought having to sit in a high chair was as cruel a punishment as going to the mines this was one of those nights which made supper however tasty something less than a delightful meal when ealstan went off to cast accounts with hestan the next morning he noticed strangers on the streets of gromheorthardfaced businesslike men who eyed how traffic went and who cast unhappy suspicious glances toward every balcony and window above street level after he spotted two or three of them a lamp went on inside his head they must be king beornwulfs bodyguards coming to make sure nothing goes wrong when he has his parade mm i daresay youre right hestan replied howefficient of the new king he and ealstan both made faces beornwulf was swemmels puppet and everyone knew it the choice was between swemmels puppet and swemmel undiluted by a puppet and everyone knew that too swemmel was rumored to think his own shadow plotted against him if beornwulf imitated him there too why should anyone be surprised more and more of beornwulfs bodyguards came into gromheort as the parade grew nearer the afternoon before the king of forthweg was supposed to go through the town ealstan stopped in surprise what is it son hestan asked i know one of those fellows ealstan answered why dont you go on ahead id like to talk to him but i dont want him to see what any of my kin look like his father plainly wanted to argue with him after just as plainly wrestling with himself hestan didnt you make altogether too much sense he said i wonder where i got that from ealstan said go on i wont be long shaking his head and muttering to himself hestan went up the street after his father had turned a corner and got out of sight ealstan walked up to the bodyguard stuck out his hand and said hello aldhelm its been a little while the guard studied him in some concern he obviously hadnt expected to be recognized then his face cleared ealstan by the powers above he clasped ealstans hand i didnt know you were here last i saw you we were both trying not to surrender to the cursed algarvians back in eoforwic thats right ealstan nodded i managed to stay out of their hands but i ah went into the unkerlanter army a little while later he didnt want to say anything too nasty about that not if aldhelm served beornwulf and beornwulf served swemmel knew you werent around aldhelm nodded himself he looked ealstan up and down dont mean to pry but did i notice a limp aye ealstan said i got blazed in the leg in the street fighting here and the unkerlanters discharged me ive been here ever since he didnt say that gromheort was his home town true he had an eastern accent but this wasnt the only city in the eastern part of forthweg he went on its not so bad these days i get around on it pretty well thats good glad to hear it aldhelm sounded more or less sincere he continued you can guess what im up to these days unless im daft youre one of beornwulfs men ealstan said and his former comrade in arms nodded again ealstan asked how does serving the king stack up against serving pybba ah pybba a reminiscent smile spread over the guards face he was a whoreson and a half wasnt he he sure was but he was our whoreson ealstan sighed i suppose the fornicating redheads blazed him once they got their hands on him even if they promised they wouldnt you never could trust those bastards no you couldnt aldhelm agreed but they didnt break their word there youve been here in gromheort all this time have you he waited for ealstan to nod then continued after the war ended pybba came back to eoforwic he was skinny as a pencil and hed lost most of this teeth but he came back running his pottery again is he good for him ealstan said but aldhelm shook his head no hes dead now the unkerlanters blazed him for treason just a few weeks after he got home he scowled the expression of a man who feared hed said too much sure enough the next words out of his mouth were listen its good to see you but ive got business to take care of here so long he hurried away pybba dead pybba surviving mezentios men to perish at the hands of swemmels slowly ealstan nodded pybba had risen against algarve without leave and without help from unkerlant if that didnt make him a man who might rise against unkerlant itself what would it was logical if you looked at it the rightor was it the wrongway powers above ealstan said softly but it wasnt the news of pybbas death that made him exclaim or not that alone six years earlier hed been here right here when the news racing through gromheort that alardo the duke of bari was dead had caught up with him the death that had sparked the derlavaian war a death before the war a death after the war ealstan kicked a stone it spun away and too cursed many deaths in between he hurried after hestan back at home elfryth and saxburh and vanai would be waiting
