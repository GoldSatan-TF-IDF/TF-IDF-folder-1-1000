krispos of videssos by harry turtledove to constantine vii who liked rice pudding and leo the deacon i the gold flan was flat and round about as wide as krispos thumba blank surface about to become a coin krispos passed it to the mintmaster who in turn carefully set it on the lower die of the press all ready your majesty he said pull this lever here hard as you can your majesty krispos hid a smile hed been avtokrator of the videssians for only eight days and still was far from used to hearing his new title in everyones mouth he pulled the lever the upper die came down hard on the flan whose soft gold was squeezed and reshaped between it and the one beneath the mintmaster said now if you please your majesty just ease back there so the die lifts again he waited until krispos obeyed then took out the newly struck goldpiece and examined it excellent had you no other duties your majesty you would be welcome to work for me after laughing at his own joke he handed krispos the coin here your majesty the very first goldpiece of your reign krispos held the coin in the palm of his hand the obverse was uppermost an image of phos stern in judgment the good god had graced videssos coinage for centuries krispos turned the goldpiece over his own face looked back at him neatly bearded a bit longer than most nose high and proud yes his image wearing the domed imperial crown a legend ran around his portrait in letters tiny but perfect krispos avtokrator he shook his head seeing the goldpiece brought home once more that he was emperor he said thank your diemaker for me excellent sir to cut the die so fast and to have the image look like mehe did splendidly ill tell him what youve said your majesty im sure hell be pleased weve had to work in a hurry here before when one avtokrator replaced another rather suddenly so we ah the mintmaster found an abrupt urgent reason to stare at the coin press he knew hed said too much krispos thought krispos own ancestry was not remotely imperial hed grown to manhood on a peasant holding near videssos northern frontierand spent several years north of that frontier as a serf toiling for the nomads of kubrat but after a cholera outbreak killed most of his family hed abandoned his village for videssos the city the great imperial capital here hed risen by strength and guile to the post of vestiarioschamberlainto the emperor anthimos iii anthimos had cared for pleasure more than for ruling when krispos sought to remind him of his duties anthimos tried to slay him by sorcery hed slain himself instead with a bungled spell and so krispos thought my face goes on goldpieces now were cutting more dies every day both for this mint and those out in the provinces the mintmaster said changing the subject soon everyone will have the chance to know you through your coins your majesty krispos nodded good thats as it should be hed been a youth he remembered when he first saw anthimos face on a goldpiece im glad youre pleased your majesty the mintmaster bowed may your reign be long and happy sir and may our artisans design many more coins for you my thanks krispos had to stop himself from bowing in return as he would have before the crown came to him a bow from the avtokrator would not have delighted the mintmaster it would have frightened him out of his wits as krispos left the mint he had to hold up a hand to keep all the workers from stopping their jobs to prostrate themselves before him he was just learning how stifling imperial ceremony could be for the emperor a squad of halogai stood outside the mint the imperial guardsmen swung up their axes in salute as krispos emerged their captain held his horses head to help him mount the big blond northerner was redfaced and sweating on what seemed to krispos no more than a moderately warm day few of the fierce mercenaries took videssos summer heat well where to now majesty the officer asked krispos glanced down at a sheet of parchment on which hed scrawled a list of the things he had to do this morning hed had to do so much so fast since becoming avtokrator that hed given up trying to keep it all in his head to the patriarchal mansion thvari he said i have to consult with gnatiosagain the guardsmen formed up around krispos big bay gelding he touched the horses flanks with his heels twitched the reins come on progress he said the imperial stables held many finer animals anthimos had fancied good horseflesh but progress had belonged to krispos before he became emperor and that made the beast special when the halogai reached the edge of the palace quarter and came to the plaza of palamas they menacingly raised their axes and shouted way way for the avtokrator of the videssians as if by magic a lane through the crowded square opened for them that was an imperial perquisite krispos enjoyed without it he might have spent most of an hour getting to the other side of the plazahe had often enough half the people in the world he sometimes thought used the plaza of palamas to try to sell things to the other half though the presence of the emperorand the coldeyed halogaiinhibited hucksters and hagglers the din was still dreadful he rubbed an ear in relief as it faded behind him the halogai tramped east down middle street videssos the citys chief thoroughfare the videssians loved spectacle they stopped and stared and pointed and made rude remarks as if krispos could not see or hear them of course he realized wryly he was so new an avtokrator as to be interesting for noveltys sake if nothing else he and his guards turned north toward the high temple the grandest shrine to phos in all the empire the patriarchs home stood close by when it came into view krispos braced himself for another encounter with gnatios the meeting began smoothly the ecumenical patriarchs aide a lesser priest named badourios met krispos at the mansion door and escorted him to gnatios study the patriarch sprang from his chair then went to his knees and then to his belly in full proskynesisso full indeed that krispos wondered as he often did with gnatios if he was being subtly mocked though his shaven pate and bushy beard marked him as a cleric they did not rob the patriarch of his individuality as often happened with priests krispos always thought of him as foxlike for he was clever elegant and devious all at the same time had he been an ally he would have been a mighty one he was not an ally anthimos had been a cousin of his krispos waited for gnatios to rise from his prostration then settled into a chair across the desk from the patriarch he motioned gnatios to sit and plunged in without preamble i hope most holy sir youve seen fit to reverse yourself on the matter we discussed yesterday your majesty i am still engaged in a search of phos holy scriptures and of canon law gnatios waved to the scrolls and codices piled high in front of him but i regret to say that as yet i have failed to find justification for performing the ceremony of marriage to join together you and the empress dara not only is her widowhood from his late majesty the avtokrator anthimos extremely recent but there is also the matter of your involvement in anthimos death krispos drew in a long angry breath now see here most holy sir i did not slay anthimos i have sworn that again and again by the lord of the great and good mind and sworn it truthfully to emphasize his words his hand moved in a quick circle over his heart the symbol of phos sun may skotos drag me down to the eternal ice if i lie i do not doubt you your majesty gnatios said smoothly also making the sunsign yet the fact remains had you not been present when anthimos died he would still be among men today aye so he wouldand i would be dead if hed finished his spell at leisure it would have closed on me instead of him where in phos holy scriptures does it say a man may not save his own life nowhere the patriarch answered at once i never claimed that yet a man may not hope to escape the ice if he takes to wife the widow of one he has slain and by your own statements you were in some measure a cause of anthimos death thus my continued evaluation of your degree of responsibility for it as measured against the strictures of canon law when i have made my determination i assure you i shall inform you immediately most holy sir by your own statements there can be honest doubt about thismen can decide either way if you find against me i am sure i can discover another cleric to wear the patriarchs blue boots and decide for me do you understand oh indeed painfully well gnatios said putting a wry arch to one eyebrow im sorry to be so blunt krispos said but it strikes me your delays have more to do with hindering me than with phos sacred words i will not sit still for that i told you the night you crowned me that i was going to be emperor of all videssos including the temples if you stand in my way i will replace you your majesty i assure you this delay is unintentional gnatios said he gestured once more to the stacks of volumes on his desk for all you say your case is difficult and abstruse by the good god i promise to have a decision within two weeks time after you hear it you may do with me as you will such is the privilege of avtokrators the patriarch bowed his head in resignation two weeks krispos stroked his beard as he considered very well most holy sir i trust you to use them wisely two weeks dara gave her head a decisive shake no that wont do it gives gnatios altogether too much time let him have three days to play with his scrolls if he must but no more than that tomorrow would be better as he often had krispos wondered how dara fit so much stubbornness into such a small frame the crown of her head barely reached his shoulder but once she made up her mind she was more immovable than the hugest haloga now he placatingly spread his hands i was just pleased i got him to agree to decide within any set limit and in the end i think hell decide for ushe likes being patriarch and he knows ill cast him from his throne if he tells us we may not wed that amount of time we can afford no dara said even more firmly than before i grudge him every grain of sand in the glass if hes going to find for us he doesnt need weeks to do it but why krispos asked since ive already agreed to this i cant change my mind without good reason not unless i want him preaching against me in the high temple as soon as i leave him ill give you a good reason dara said im with child youre krispos stared at her his mouth falling open then he asked the same foolish question almost every man asks his woman when she gives him that news are you sure daras lips quirked im sure enough not only have my courses failed to come but when i went to the privy this morning the stench made me lose my breakfast youre with child all right krispos agreed wonderful he took her in his arms running a hand through her thick black hair then he had another thought it was not suited for the moment but passed his lips before he could hold it back is it mine he felt her stiffen the question unfortunately was neither idle nor save in its timing cruel dara had been his lover aye but shed also been anthimos empress and anthimos had not been immune to the pleasures of the fleshfar from it when at last she looked up at him her dark eyes were troubled i think its yours she said slowly i wish i could say i was certain but i cant not really youd know i was lying krispos thought back to the time before hed seized the throne as vestiarios hed had the bedchamber next to the one dara and anthimos had shared the emperor had gone carousing and reveling many nights but not all krispos sighed stepping back and wishing life did not give him ambiguity where he most wanted to be sure he watched daras eyes narrow and her mouth thin in calculation can you afford to disown a child of mine no matter who it looks like in the end she asked i just asked myself the same question he said respect in his voice nothing was wrong with daras wits and just as gnatios liked being patriarch she liked being empress she needed krispos for that but he knew he also needed her because she was anthimos widow she helped confer legitimacy on him by connecting him to the old imperial house he sighed again no i dont suppose i can by the good god krispos i hope its yours and i think it is dara said earnestly after all i was anthimos empress for years without quickening i never knew him to get bastards on any of his tarts either and he had enough of them i have to wonder at the strength of his seed thats so krispos said he felt relieved but not completely phos he took on faith his years in videssos the city had taught him the danger of similar faith in anything merely human yet even if the child was not his by blood he could set his mark on it if its a boy well name him phostis for my father dara considered nodded its a good name she touched krispos arm but you do see the need for haste not so the sooner were wed the better others can count months as well as we can a babe a few weeks early will set no tongues wagging much more though especially if the child is big and robust aye youre right krispos said ill speak to gnatios if he doesnt like being hurried too bad its just deserts for surprising me and making me speak unprepared when he was crowning me by the good god i know he was hoping id flub just deserts for that piece of effrontery would be some time in the prisons under the government office buildings on middle street dara said ive thought so ever since you first told me of it it may come to that if he says me nay here krispos answered i know hed sooner see petronas come out of the monastery and take the throne than have me on it being anthimos cousin means hes anthimos uncles cousin too hes not your cousin thats for certain dara said grimly you ought to have your own man as patriarch krispos one whos against you can cause you endless grief i know if gnatios does tell me no itll give me the excuse i need to get rid of him trouble is if i do id likely have to replace him with pyrrhos the abbot hed be loyal dara said so he would krispos spoke without enthusiasm pyrrhos was earnest and able he was also pious fanatically so he was a far better friend to krispos than gnatios ever would be and far less comfortable to live with dara said now i hope gnatios does stand up on his hind legs against you if you truly mean to slap him down for it all at once krispos was tired of worrying about gnatios and what he might do instead he thought of the child dara would havehis child he told himself firmly he stepped forward to take her in his arms again she squeaked in surprise as he bent his head to kiss her but her lips were eager against his the kiss went on and on when at last they separated krispos said shall we go to the bedchamber what in the afternoon wed scandalize the servants oh nonsense krispos said after anthimos antic reign nothing save perhaps celibacy could scandalize the palace servants though he did not say so aloud besides i have my reasons name two dara said mischief in her voice all right for one if you are pregnant youre apt to lose interest for a while so id best get while the gettings good as they say and for another ive always wanted to make love with you with the sun shining in on us thats one thing we never dared do before she smiled a nice mix of the practical and the romantic well why not they walked down the hall hand in hand if maidservants or eunuch chamberlains gave them odd looks neither one noticed barsymes bowed to krispos the patriarch is here your majesty the eunuch vestiarios announced in his notquitetenor notquitealto voice he did not sound impressed few things impressed barsymes thank you esteemed sir krispos answered palace eunuchs had their own honorifics different from those of the nobility show him in gnatios prostrated himself as he entered the chamber where krispos had been wrestling with tax documents your majesty he murmured rise most holy sir rise by all means krispos said expansively please be seated make yourself comfortable shall i send for wine and cakes he waited for gnatios nod then waved to barsymes to fetch the refreshments when the patriarch had eaten and drunk krispos proceeded to business most holy sir i regret summoning you so soon after i promised you would have your two weeks but i must seek your ruling on whether dara and i may lawfully wed he had expected gnatios to splutter and protest but the patriarch beamed at him what a pleasant coincidence your majesty i was going to send you a message later in the day for i have indeed reached my decision and krispos said if gnatios thought this affable front would make a rejection more palatable krispos thought he was going to get a rude awakening but the ecumenical patriarchs smile only grew broader i am delighted to be able to inform you your majesty that i find no canonical impediments to your proposed union with the empress you may perhaps hear gossip at the haste of the match but that has nothing to do with its permissibility under ecclesiastical law really krispos said in glad surprise well im delighted to hear you say so most holy sir he got up and poured more wine for the two of them with his own hands i am pleased to be able to serve you with honor in this matter your majesty gnatios answered he lifted his cup your very good health and yours avtokrator and patriarch drank together then krispos said from what youve just told me i dont suppose youd mind celebrating the wedding yourself if gnatios was just going along for the sake of going along krispos thought he ought to balk or at least hesitate but he replied at once it would be my privilege your majesty merely name the day from your urgency i suppose you will want it to come as soon as possible yes krispos said still a bit taken aback at this wholehearted cooperation will you be able to make everything ready inhmmten days time the patriarchs lips moved a couple of days after the full moon i am your servant he inclined his head to the emperor splendid krispos said when he rose this time it was a sign gnatios audience was done the patriarch did not miss the signal he bowed himself out barsymes took charge of him and escorted him from the imperial residence krispos gave his attention back to the cadasters he smiled a little as he took up his stylus to scrawl a note on a waxed tablet that had been easier than hed figured it would be he thought with a twinge of contempt for gnatios the patriarch seemed willing to pay whatever price he had to in order to keep his position a firm line with him would get krispos anything he required nice to have one worry settled he thought and went on to the next tax register dont worry your majesty we have plenty of time yet mavros said krispos looked at his foster brother with mixed gratitude and exasperation nice to hear someone say so by the good god all of daras seamstresses are having kittens wailing that theyll never be able to have her dress ready on the day and if theyre having kittens the mintmaster is having bearsbig bears with teeth he says i can send him to prista if i like but that still wont get me enough goldpieces with my face on them to use for largess prista he amusement danced in mavros eyes then he probably means it the lonely outpost on the northern shore of the videssian sea housed the empires most incorrigible exiles few people went there willingly i dont care if he means it krispos snapped i need to have that gold to pass out to the people we grabbed power too quickly the night i was crowned this is my next good chance if i dont do it now the city folk will think im mean and ill have no end of trouble from them i daresay youre right mavros said but does it all have to be your gold aye that would be nice but you hold the treasury as well as the mint so long as the coin is good no one who gets it will care whose face it bears something to that krispos said after a moments thought the mintmaster will be pleased tanilis would be too to hear you youre your mothers son after all ill take that for a compliment mavros said youd better i meant it for one krispos had nothing but admiration for mavros mother tanilis was one of the wealthiest nobles of the eastern town of opsikion and seer and mage as well shed foretold krispos rise helped him with money and good advice and fostered mavros to him though she was a decade older than krispos theyd also been lovers for half a year until he had to return to videssos the citymavros did not know about that she was still the standard by which krispos measured women including dara dara did not know about that barsymes politely tapped at the open door of the chamber where krispos and mavros were talking your majesty eminent sir your presence is required for another rehearsal of assembling for the wedding procession in matters of ceremony the vestiarios ordered the avtokrator about well be with you shortly barsymes krispos promised barsymes withdrew a couple of paces length he did not go away krispos turned back to mavros i think ill use the wedding to declare you sevastos you will me mavros was in his midtwenties a few years younger than krispos and had a more openly excitable temperament now he could not keep his surprised delight from showing when did you decide to do that ive been thinking about it ever since this crown landed on my head you act as my chief minister so you should have the title that says what you do and the wedding will be a good public occasion to give it to you mavros bowed one of these days he said slyly you ought to tell your face what youre thinking so itll know too oh go howl krispos said naming you sevastos will also make you rich even apart from what you stand to inherit itll also set you up as my heir if i die without one as he said that he wondered again whether daras child was his he suspectedhe fearedhe would keep on wondering until the baby came and perhaps for years afterward as well i see that since youre emperor you dont have to listen to people anymore mavros said realizing he hadnt been listening and had missed something krispos felt himself flush with the air of someone doing an unworthy subject a great favor mavros repeated himself i said that if you die without an heir it will likely mean youve lost a civil war in which case ill be a head shorter myself and in no great position to assume the throne in his breezy way mavros had probably hit truth there krispos thought he said if you dont want the honor i could bestow it on iakovitzes they both laughed mavros said ill take it then just to save you from that with his gift for getting people furious at him youd lose any civil war where he was on your side because no one else would be then as if afraid krispos might take him seriously he added he is in the wedding party isnt he of course he is krispos answered do you think i want the rough side of his tongue for leaving him out he gave it to me often enough in the days when i was one of his grooms and to you too id bet who me mavros assumed a not altogether convincing expression of innocence before krispos could reply barsymes stepped back into view implacably courteous he said your majesty the rehearsal will commence at any moment your presenceand yours eminent sir he turned to mavros would be appreciated coming krispos said obediently he and mavros followed the vestiarios down the hall barsymes bustled up and down the line clucking like a hen not sure all her chicks were where they belonged his long face was set in doleful lines made more than commonly visible by his beardless cheeks please excellent sirs eminent sirs your majesty try to remember all weve practiced he pleaded if the army had its drill down as well as we do videssos would rule the bloody world iakovitzes said rolling his eyes the noble stroked his graying beard come on lets get this nonsense done with shall we barsymes took a deep breath and continued as if no one had spoken smooth and steady and stately will most properly awe the people of videssos the city phos coming down from behind the sun with skotos all tied up in colored string wouldnt properly awe the people of videssos the city mavros said so what hope have we take no notice of any of my comrades krispos told barsymes who looked about ready to burst from nerves we are in your capable hands the vestiarios sniffed but eased a little then he went from mother hen to drillmaster in one fell swoop we beginnow he declared forward to the plaza of palamas he marched east from the imperial residence past lawns and gardens and groves past the grand courtroom past the hall of the nineteen couches past the other grand buildings of the palace quarter dara and her companions krispos knew were traversing the quarter by another route if everything went as planned his party and hers would meet at the edge of the plaza it had happened in rehearsals barsymes acted convinced it would happen again to krispos his confidence seemed based on sorcery but so far as he knew no one had used any magic or not when his party turned a last corner before the plaza of palamas he saw dara and the noblewomen with her round an outbuilding and come straight toward him once they got a few steps closer he also saw the relief on her face evidently shed worried too about whether their rendezvous would go as planned you look lovely he said as he took her right hand with his left she smiled up at him a light breeze played with her hair like him she wore no golden crown today her gown though was of dark gold silk that complemented her olive complexion fine lace decorated cuffs and bodice the gown cinched tight at the waist displayed her fine figure forward barsymes called again and the newly united wedding party advanced into the plaza the palace quarter had been empty the plaza was packed with people they cheered when they saw krispos and his companions and surged toward them only twin rows of streamersand halogai posted every ten feet or so along themkept the way open instead of his sword krispos wore a large leather sack on the right side of his belt he reached into it dug out a handful of goldpieces and threw them into the crowd the cheers got louder and more frantic all his groomsmen were similarly equipped they also flung largess far and wide so did a dozen servants who carried even larger bags of coins thou conquerest krispos people shouted many years the avtokrator many sons hurrah for the empress dara happiness they also shouted other things more money throw it this way over here and someone yelled a joyous year to the emperor and empress for each goldpiece i get what an ingenious combination of flattery and greed iakovitzes said i wish id thought of it the fellow was close krispos saw him waving like a madman he pulled on a servants sleeve give him a hundred goldpieces the man screamed with delight when the servant poured gold first into his hands then into a pocket that looked hastily sewn onto his robehed come ready for any good that might happen to him that was kindly done krispos dara said but however much we wish it we wont have a hundred years ill bet that chap wont have a hundred goldpieces by the time he gets out of the plaza either krispos answered but may he do well with those he manages to keep and may we do well with so many years the wedding party pushed out of the plaza of palamas onto middle street long colonnades shielded the throngs there from the sun more servantsthese accompanied by an escort of armored halogaibrought up fresh bags of goldpieces krispos dug deep and threw coins as far as he could as he had when visiting gnatios he turned north off middle street with his companions this time they bypassed the patriarchal mansion with its small dome of red brick for the high temple close by mavros tapped krispos on the shoulder remember the last time we saw the forecourt here so packed with people i should hope so krispos said that had been the day hed taken the throne the day gnatios had set the crown on his head in the doorway to the high temple dara sighed i wish i could have been here to see you crowned so do i krispos said they both knew that would not have looked good though not when he was replacing the man to whom shed been wed even this ceremony would stir gossip in every tavern and sewing circle in the city but dara was right with a child in her belly they could not afford to wait more halogai stood on the steps of the high temple facing outward to protect krispos and his comrades as they had when hed been crowned at the top of the steps gnatios stood waiting the patriarch looked almost imperially splendid in his blue boots and pearlencrusted robe of clothofgold and blue mere priests in less magnificent raiment swung thuribles on either side of him krispos nose twitched as he caught a whiff of the sweet smoke that wafted from them when he and dara started to climb the low broad stairs he held her hand tightly he wanted not the slightest risk of her falling not when she was pregnant the wedding party followed behind them servants flung the last handsful of gold coins into the crowd gnatios bowed when krispos reached the top step but did not prostrate himself the temple was after all his primary domain krispos returned the bow but less deeply to show he in fact held superior rank even here gnatios said allow me to lead you within your majesty he and his acolytes turned to enter the narthex the last time krispos had gone in there it was for barsymes to robe him in the coronation regalia a moment he said now holding up a hand gnatios stopped and turned back a small frown on his face is something wrong no not at all i just want to speak to the people before we go on the ecumenical patriarchs frown grew deeper your doing so is not a planned part of the ceremony your majesty no eh that didnt bother you when you asked me to speak before you would crown me krispos kept his tone light but he was sure he was glaring at gnatios the patriarch had tried to ruin him then to make him sound like a bumbler in front of the people of the city the most critical and fickle audience in the world now gnatios could only bow in acquiescence what pleases the avtokrator has the force of law he murmured krispos looked out to the packed forecourt and held up his hands people of videssos he called then again people of videssos little by little they gave him quiet he waited until it had grown still enough for everyone to hear people of videssos this is a happy day for two reasons not only am i to be wed today cheers and applause drowned him out he smiled and let them run their course when they were through he resumed not only that but today before you all i can also name my new sevastos the crowd remained quiet but suddenly the quiet became alert electric a new high minister was serious business the more with a new as yet littleknown and childless emperor on the throne into that expectant hush krispos said i give you as sevastos my foster brother the noble mavros may his highness be merciful the people called as if with one voice krispos blinked he hadnt thought there would be a special cry for the proclamation of a sevastos he was beginning to suspect videssian ceremonial had a special cry or ritual for everything grinning enormously mavros waved to show himself to the crowd krispos nudged him say something he whispered who me mavros whispered back at krispos nod the new sevastos waved again this time for quiet when he got it or at least enough of it to speak through he said the good god willing i will do as well in my office as our new avtokrator does in his thank you all as the crowd cheered mavros lowered his voice and told krispos now its on your shoulders your majesty if you start going astray i have every excuse to do the same thing oh to the ice with you krispos said he dipped his head to gnatios shall we get on with it certainly your majesty by all means gnatios expression reminded krispos the delay had not been his idea in the first place without another word he strode into the high temple as krispos followed him into the narthex his eyes needed a moment to adjust to the dimmer light the antechamber was the least splendid portion of the high temple it was merely magnificent on the far wall a mosaic depicted phos as a beardless youth a shepherd guarding his flock against wolves that fled tails between their legs back to their darkrobed master skotos the evil gods face was full of chilling hate other mosaics set into the ceiling showed those whom skotos blandishments had seduced the souls of the lost stood frozen into eternal ice demons with outstretched black wings and mouths full of horrid fangs tormented the damned in ingenious ways not an inch of the high temple was without its ornament even the marble lintel of the doorway into the narthex was covered with reliefs phos sun stood in the center its rays nourishing a whole forest of broadtoothed pointed leaves that had been carved in intricate repeating interlaced patterns krispos paused to glance over to a spot not far from the doors there by torchlight barsymes had invested him with the leggings and kilt the tunic and cape and the red boots that were all part of the imperial coronation regalia the boots had been tight anthimos feet turned out to be smaller than krispos krispos was still wearing tight boots though the cordwainers promised him pairs cut to his measure any day now gnatios took a couple of steps before he noticed krispos had stopped the patriarch turned back and asked shall we get on with it he did such an exquisite job of keeping irony from his voice that it was all the more ironic for being less so unable to take offense no matter how much he wanted to krispos followed gnatios out of the narthex and into the main chamber of the high temple seated within were the high secular lords and soldiers of videssos and their ladies as well as the leading prelates and abbots of the city they all rose to salute the avtokrator and patriarch the nobles rich robes brightly dyed shot through with gold and silver thread and encrusted with gems hardly less glittering than those that adorned the soft flesh and sparkled in the hair of their wives and consorts would irresistibly have drawn the eye to them in any other setting in the world within the high temple they did not dominate they had to struggle to be noticed even the benches from which the lords and ladies rose were works of art in themselves they were blond oak waxed to shine almost as brightly as the sun and inset with ebony and red red sandalwood with semiprecious stones and with mother of pearl that caught and brightened every ray of light indeed the huge interior of the high temple seemed awash with light as was only fitting for a building dedicated to phos here krispos had read in a chronicle that dealt in part with the raising of the temple the immaterial became material had he seen the phrase in some provincial town far from the capital he never would have understood it in videssos the city the example lay before him silver foil and gold leaf worked together with the mother of pearl to reflect light softly into every corner of the high temple illuminating with an almost shadowless light the mossagatefaced columns that supported the buildings four wings looking down krispos could see himself reflected in the polished golden marble of the floor more marble this white as snow gleamed on the interior walls of the temple together with sheets of turquoise and low in the east and west rose quartz and ruddy sardonyx it reproduced indoors the brilliance and beauty of phos sky viewing the sky led the eye imperceptibly upward to the twin semidomes where mosaics commemorated holy men who had been great in the service of phos and from those semidomes it was impossible not to look farther yet up and up and up into the great central dome overhead from which phos himself surveyed his worshipers the base of the dome was pierced by dozens of windows sunlight streamed through them and coruscated off the walls below the beams seemed to separate the dome from the rest of the temple below the first time krispos saw it hed wondered if it really was linked to the building it surmounted or if as felt more likely it floated up there by itself suspended perhaps from a chain that led straight up into the heavens down from the heavens then through the shifting sunbeams phos gazed upon the mere mortals who had gathered in his temple the phos portrayed in the dome was no smiling youth he was mature bearded his long face stern and somber his eyes the first time krispos had gone into the high temple to worship not long after he came to videssos the city he had almost cringed from those eyes large and omniscient they seemed to see straight through him that was proper for the phos in the dome was judge rather than shepherd in the long spidery fingers of his left hand he held to his chest a bound volume wherein all of good and evil was inscribed a man could but hope that good outweighed the other if not eternity in the ice awaited for while this phos was just krispos could not imagine him merciful the tesserae that surrounded the gods head and shoulders in the dome were glass filmed with gold and set at slightly varying angles whenever the light shifted or whenever an observer below moved different tiny tiles gleamed forth adding to the spiritual solemnity of the depiction as it always did tearing his eyes away from phos face cost krispos a distinct effort of will temples throughout the empire of videssos held in their central domes images modeled on the one in the high temple krispos had seen several none held a fraction of the brooding majesty the severe nobility of this archetype here the god had truly inspired those who portrayed him even after krispos looked to the great silver slab of the altar that stood below the center of the dome he felt phos gaze pressing down on him with almost physical force not even sight of the patriarchal throne of carven ivory behind the altar a breathtaking work of art in its own right could bring krispos fully back to himself not while everyone stood in silent awe waiting for the ceremony to proceed then gnatios raised his hands to the god in the dome and to the god beyond the dome and beyond the sky we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind he intoned by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor krispos repeated phos creed along with the ecumenical patriarch so did everyone else in the high temple beside him he heard daras clear soprano his hand tightened on hers she squeezed back out of the corner of his eye he saw her smile gnatios lowered his hands the assembled grandees seated themselves krispos felt their gaze on him too but in a way different from phos they were still wondering what sort of avtokrator he would make the good god already knew but left to krispos the working out of his fate gnatios waited for quiet then said what had been in krispos thoughts the eyes of all the city are on us today today we see joined in marriage the avtokrator krispos and the empress dara may phos bless their union and make it long happy and fruitful the patriarch began to pray again now and then pausing for responses from krispos and dara krispos had memorized some of his replies for the longset language of the liturgy was growing apart from the tongue spoken in the streets of the city gnatios delivered a traditional wedding sermon touching on the virtues that helped make a good marriage then the patriarch said are the two of you prepared to cleave to these virtues and to each other so long as you both may live yes krispos said and then again louder so that people besides himself and dara could hear yes yes dara agreed not loudly but firmly as they spoke the words that bound them together mavros set a wreath of roses and myrtle on krispos head one of daras attendants did the same for her behold them decked in the crowns of marriage gnatios shouted before the eyes of the entire city they are shown to be man and wife the grandees and their ladies rose from their benches to applaud krispos hardly heard them he cared only about dara who was looking back at him with that same intent expression although it was no part of the ceremony he took her in his arms he smelled the sweet fragrance of her marriage crown as she held him tightly the cheers got louder and more sincere someone shouted bawdy advice thou conquerest krispos someone else yelled in a tone of voice altogether different from the usual solemn acclamation many heirs krispos another wit bawled iakovitzes came up to krispos the noble was short and had to stand on tiptoe to put his mouth near krispos ear the ring you idiot he hissed perhaps because he had no interest whatever in women he was immune to the joy of the marriage ceremony and cared only that it be correctly accomplished krispos had forgotten the ring and was so relieved to be reminded of this that he took no notice of how iakovitzes spoke to him for that matter iakovitzes relished playing the gadfly no matter whom he was talking to krispos had the ring in a tiny pouch he wore on the inside of his belt so it would not show he freed the heavy gold band and slipped it onto daras left index finger she hugged him with renewed strength before the eyes of the whole city they are wed gnatios proclaimed now let the people of the city see the happy pair with the patriarch at their side krispos and dara walked down the aisle by which they had approached the altar through the narthex and out onto the top of the stairway the crowd in the forecourt cheered as they came down the steps it was a smaller crowd now even though the wedding attendants had fresh full bags in their hands they would not fling gold but figs and nuts fertility symbols from time out of mind even the often dour halogai were grinning as they formed up around the wedding party geirrod the first of the northerners to acknowledge krispos as emperor told him do not fail me majesty i have big bet on how many times tonight dara squawked in indignation krispos own humor was earthier but he said how do you hope to settle that by the good god its something only the empress and i will ever know majesty you served in the palaces before you ruled them geirrod said his gray eyes knowing was there anything servants could not learn when they needed to not that krispos said then stopped suddenly unsure he was right at least i hope not that huh was all geirrod said giving his guardsman the last word krispos paraded with his new bride and their companions back the way they had come even without expectations of more money a fair crowd still lined the streets and filled the plaza of palamas the folk of the city loved spectacle almost as well as largess after the plaza the calm of the palace quarter came as a relief most of the halogai departed for their barracks only the troops assigned to guard the imperial residence accompanied the wedding party there save for krispos and dara everyone stopped at the bottom of the steps they pelted the newlywed couple with leftover figs and gave krispos more lewd advice he endured that with the good humor a new groom is supposed to show when he didnt feel like waiting any longer he slid his arm round daras waist led by mavros the groomsmen and bridesmaids whooped krispos stuck his nose in the air and turned away from them drawing dara with him they whooped louder than ever the happy shouts of the wedding party followed dara and him down the hall to the bedchamber the doors were closed he opened them and found that the servants had turned down the bedcovers and left a jar of wine and two cups on the night table by the bed smiling he closed the doors and barred them dara turned her back on him would you unfasten me please the maidservant took half an hour getting me into his gown it has enough hooks and eyelets and whathaveyou for a jail not something youd wear i hope i can get you out of it faster than half an hour krispos said he did but not as fast as he might have the more hooks he undid the more attention his hands paid to the soft skin he was revealing and the less to the fasteners that remained finally the job was done dara turned to him they kissed for a long time when at last they broke apart she ruefully looked down at herself every pearl every gem every metal thread on that robe of yours has stamped itself into me she complained and what will you do about that he asked a corner of her mouth quirked upward lets see if i can keep it from happening again her disrobing of him also proceeded more slowly than it might have but he did not mind the two of them hung their crowns of marriage on the bedposts for luck then lay down together krispos caressed daras breasts lowered his mouth to one of them she stirred but not altogether in pleasure be gentle if you can she said theyre sore are they under the fine skin he could see a new tracery of blue veins he touched her again as carefully as he could another sign youre carrying a child i dont have much doubt not anymore she said all those nuts and figs did a better job than they know he said straightfaced dara started to nod then snorted and poked him in the ribs he grabbed her and held her close to keep her from doing it again they did not separate not until they were both spent then his breath still coming quick krispos reached for the wine jar and said shall we see what they gave us to keep us going why not dara answered pour a cup for me too please thick and golden the wine gurgled out of the jar krispos recognized the sweet heady bouquet this is that vaspurakaner vintage from petronas cellars he said when anthimos broke his ambitious uncles power hed confiscated all of petronas lands his money his horses and his wines krispos had drunk this one before he raised the cup to his lips as good as i remember it dara sipped raised an eyebrow yes thats quite finesweet and tart at the same time she drank again krispos held his cup high to you your majesty and to you your majesty dara answered returning his salute with vigorso much that a few drops flew over the rim and splashed on the bedclothes as she looked at the spreading stain she started to laugh whats funny krispos said i was just thinking that this time no one will expect to find a spot of blood on the sheet after my first night with anthimos skombros marched in peeled that sheet off the bedhe almost dumped me out to get itthen took it outside and waved it about everyone cheered but it was a ritual i could have done without as if i were a piece of raw meat checked to make sure i hadnt spoiled ah skombros krispos said the fat eunuch had been anthimos vestiarios before petronas got krispos the post an emperors chamberlain was in a uniquely good position to influence him and petronas had wanted no one but himself influencing anthimos and so skombros had gone from the imperial residence to a bare monastery cell krispos wondered if petronas had ever thought the same fate could befall him i liked you better than skombros as vestiarios dara said with a sidelong look im glad you did krispos answered mildly all the same he understood why imperial chamberlains were most of them eunuchs and was not sorry his own vestiarios followed that rule since dara had cheated for him how could he be sure she would never cheat against him he glanced toward his empress wondering again whether the child she carried was his or anthimos if even she could not say how would he ever know he shook his head doubts at the very beginning of a marriage did not bode well for contentment to come he tried to put them aside if ever a husband had given his wife reason to be unfaithful he told himself anthimos had provoked dara with his orgies and his endless parade of paramours as long as he treated her well himself she should have no reason to stray he took her in his arms again so soon she said startled but not displeased here let me set my wine down first she giggled as his weight pressed her to the bed i hope your haloga bet high so do i krispos said then her lips silenced him krispos woke yawned stretched and rolled over onto his back dara was sitting up in bed beside him by the look of her shed been awake for some time krispos sat up too he glanced at where sunbeams hit the far wall phos he exclaimed what hour is it anyway somewhere in the fourth id saymore than halfway to noon dara told him the videssians gave twelve hours to the day and another twelve to the night reckoning them from sunrise and sunset respectively dara gave him a quizzical look what do you suppose you were doing last night that left you so tired i cant imagine krispos said only partly in irony hed grown up a peasant after all and what labor was more exhausting than farming yet hed risen with the sun every day on the other hand hed gone to bed with the sun too and hed been up considerably later than that the night before yawning again he got up ambled over to the bureau to put on some drawers then opened a tall wardrobe picked out a robe and pulled it on over his head dara watched him bemusedly he was reaching for a pair of red boots when she asked have you forgotten you have a vestiarios to help you with such things he paused as a matter of fact i did he said sheepishly that was foolish of me wasnt it but its also foolish for barsymes to help me just because im avtokrator i didnt need his help before as if to defy custom he tugged on his own boots its also foolish not to let barsymes do his job which is to serve you dara said if you dont allow him to perform his proper function then he has none is that what you want no krispos admitted but having done entirely without service most of his life and having given it first as groom in iakovitzes and petronas stables then as anthimos vestiarios he still felt odd about receiving it dara a western nobles daughter had no such qualms she reached for a green cord that hung by her side of the bed and pulled down on it a couple of rooms away a bell tinkled moments later a maidservant tried to open the doors to the imperial bedchambers theyre still locked your majesties she said krispos walked over and lifted the bar come in verina he said thank you your majesty the serving maid stared at him in surprise and no little indignation youre dressed she blurted what are you doing being dressed he did not turn around to see the itoldyouso look in daras eyes but he was sure it was there im sorry verina he said mildly i wont let it happen again a scarlet bellpull dangled next to his side of the bed he pulled it this bell was easier to hearthe vestiarios chamber the chamber that had until recently been his was next door to the bedchamber barsymes long pale face grew longer when he saw krispos your majesty he said making the title into one of reproach im sorry krispos said again though he ruled the empire of videssos he wondered if he was truly master of the palaces even if i did dress myself im sure im no cook will you be less angry at me after you escort me to breakfast the vestiarios mouth twitched it could have been a smile possible a trifle your majesty if youll come with me krispos followed barsymes out of the bedchamber ill join you soon dara said she was standing nude in front of her wardrobe chattering with verina about which gown she should wear today barsymes eyes never went her way not all eunuchs were immune from desire even if they lacked the capacity to satisfy it krispos wondered whether the vestiarios felt no stirring or was just a discreetly excellent servant he knew he could never ask barsymes fussed over seating him in a small dining room and how would you care to break your fast this day your majesty a big hot bowl of porridge a chunk of bread and some honey and a couple of rashers of bacon would do me very well krispos said that was the sort of hearty breakfast hed had back in his home village when times were good times hadnt been good often enough sometimes breakfast had been a small bowl of porridge sometimes nothing at all as you wish your majesty barsymes said tonelessly though phestos may be disappointed at having nothing more elaborate to prepare ah krispos said anthimos had gloried in the exotic hed thought his own more mundane tastes would be a relief to everyone but if phestos wanted a challenge tell him to make the goat seethed in fermented fish sauce and leeks tonight then barsymes nodded a good choice dara came in asked for a stewed muskmelon the vestiarios went to take her request and krispos to the cook with a wry smile she patted her belly i just hope it stays down the past couple of days ive hardly wanted to look at food you have to eat krispos said i know it full well my stomachs the one thats not convinced before long barsymes brought in the food krispos happily dug in and finished his own breakfast while dara picked at her melon when barsymes saw krispos was done he whisked away his dishes and set in front of him a silver tray full of scrolls the mornings correspondence your majesty all right krispos said without enthusiasm anthimos he knew would have pitched a fit at the idea of handling business before noonor after noon for that matter but krispos had impressed on his servants that he intended to be a working avtokrator this was his reward for their taking him at his word he pawed through the proposals petitions and reports hoping to begin with something moderately interesting when he found a letter still sealed his eyebrows rose how had the secretaries who scribbled away in the wings that flanked the grand courtroom let it slip past them unopened then he exclaimed in pleasure dara gave him a curious look you dont usually sound so gleeful when you go over those parchments its a letter from tanilis he said then he remembered that for a variety of reasons hed told dara little about tanilis so he added shes mavros mother you know she and mavros were both kind to me when i went there with iakovitzes a few years ago im glad to hear from her oh all right dara took another bite of muskmelon krispos supposed that hearing tanilis describedtruthfullyas mavros mother made her picture the noblewomanmost untruthfullyas plump comfortable and middleaged though she had to be nearly forty now krispos was sure tanilis retained all the elegant sculpted beauty shed had when he knew her he began to read aloud the lady tanilis to his imperial majesty krispos avtokrator of the videssians my deepest congratulations on your accession to the throne and on your marriage to the empress dara may your reign be long and prosperous then his glance happened to stray to the date above the salutation by the good god he said softly and sketched phos suncircle above his heart what is it dara asked he passed her the letter see for yourself he pointed to the date for a moment it meant nothing to her he watched her eyes widen she made the sunsign too thats the day before you took the throne she whispered so it is he said nodding tanilissees things when i was in opsikion she foresaw that i might become emperor by then i was iakovitzes spatharioshis aide a couple of years before id been a farmer laboring in the field i thought id already risen as high as i could some days he could still be surprised he was avtokrator this was one of them he reached across the table and took daras hand a brief squeeze reminded him this was no dream she gave the letter back to him read it out loud if you dont mind of course he found his place and resumed may your reign be long and prosperous my gratitude for your naming mavros sevastos he broke off again if she knew the rest no reason she wouldnt know that dara pointed out i suppose not here ill go on for your naming mavros sevastos i am sure he will serve you to the best of his ability one favor i would beg of you in regard to my son should he ever desire to lead troops against the northern barbarians i pray that you tell him no while he may win glory and acclaim in that pursuit i fear he will not have the enjoyment of them farewell and may phos bless you always krispos set down the parchment i dont know that mavros ever would want to go out on campaign but if he does telling him no wont be easy he made a troubled sound with tongue and teeth not even after this daras finger found the relevant passage in the letter surely he knows his mothers powers would he risk defying them ive known mavros a good many years now krispos said all i can say is that hell do as he pleases no matter who or what gets defied in the doing the lord with the great and good mind willing the matter wont ever come up tanilis didnt say it was certain thats true dara agreed but krispos knewand knew also dara knewthe matter might very well arise having overthrown the khagan of kubrat on videssos northern frontier an adventurer called harvas blackrobe and his band of haloga mercenaries had begun raiding the empire as well the generals on the border had been having little luck with them before too long someone would have to drive them back where they belonged one of the palace eunuchs stuck his head into the dining chamber what is it tyrovitzes krispos asked the abbot pyrrhos is outside the residence your majesty tyrovitzes said puffing a littlehe was as fat as barsymes was lean he wants to speak with you at once and will not speak with anyone else for your ears alone he insists does he krispos frowned he found pyrrhos narrow piety harsh and oppressive but the abbot was no ones fool very well fetch him in ill hear him tyrovitzes bowed as deeply as his rotund frame would permit then hurried away he soon returned with pyrrhos the abbot bowed low to dara then prostrated himself before krispos he did not seek to rise but stayed on his belly i abase myself before you your majesty the fault is mine and let my head answer for it if that be your will what fault krispos said testily holy sir will you please get up and talk sense pyrrhos rose though a graybeard he was limber as a youth a kinder reward of the asceticism that also thinned his face to almost skeletal leanness and left his eyes dark burning coals as i told your majesty the fault is mine he said through some error whether accidental or otherwise i am investigating the count of the monks in the monastery dedicated to the memory of the holy skirios may have been inaccurate last night it was surely one too low this morning we do indeed have a runaway monk and who might this runaway be krispos inquired though he was sickly certain he knew the answer without having to ask no trivial disappearance would make the abbot hotfoot it to the imperial residence with the news pyrrhos saw his certainty and gave a grim nod aye your majesty it is as you fearpetronas has escaped ii trying to meet bad news with equanimity krispos said i dont think hes going to be very pleased with me only after the words were out of his mouth did he realize what an understatement that was petronas had virtually ruled the empire for a decade and more while his nephew anthimos reveled he had raised krispos to the post of vestiarios finally anthimos worried lest his uncle supplant him on the throne a worry abetted by krispos and dara clapped him into the monastery for good krispos had thought dara said bitterly while all the eyes of the city were on us yesterday petronas took the chance to get out krispos knew she was just echoing gnatios words but what she said raised echoes in his own mind echoes of suspicion hed wondered why gnatios had suddenly become so obliging about the wedding now maybe he knew the patriarch did keep harping on that didnt he he and petronas are cousins too and if anyone could arrange to have a monk taken from his monastery without the abbots knowledge who better than gnatios no one better your majesty pyrrhos said following krispos line of thought his sharpcurved nose fierce eyes and shaven head made him resemble a bird of prey tyrovitzes krispos shouted when the fat eunuch reappeared krispos told him take a squad of halogai and fetch gnatios here at once no matter what hes doing your majesty tyrovitzes said at krispos answering glare he gulped and said yes your majesty tyrovitzes had hardly left before krispos shouted longinos as soon as that eunuch responded krispos said go to captain thvari take all the halogai save enough to guard me here take whatever other troops are in the city and start a search maybe petronas has gone to ground inside the walls petronas longinos said staring yes hes escaped curse him krispos answered impatiently the chamberlain started to go then krispos had an afterthought if thvari does use our own troops along with the northerners have him make sure he puts more halogai than videssians in each party i know his men are loyal as you say your majesty longionos bowed deeply and departed he was scarcely gone when krispos yelled barsymes the vestiarios might have been waiting right outside he came in almost at once go to the house of trokoundos the wizard and bring him here if you please certainly your majesty i suppose youll want him to interrogate gnatios barsymes said calmly at krispos expression of surprise he went on you have not kept your voice down you know your majesty krispos thought about that no i suppose i havent go get me trokoundos now if you please if gnatios did have a hand in petronas escape he pounded a clenched fist down on the tabletop if thats so well have a new ecumenical patriarch before the day is out your pardon majesty but perhaps not so quickly as that pyrrhos said you may of course remove a prelate as you wish but the naming of his successor lies in the hands of a synod of clerics to whom you submit a list of three candidates for their formal selection you understand that all that rigmarole would just delay your own choice krispos said pyrrhos bowed your majesty is gracious all the same however observances must be fulfilled to ensure the validity of any patriarchal enthronement if gnatios helped petronas get away he deserves worse than being deposed dara said some time with the torturers might be a fit answer for his treason well worry about that later krispos said with peasant patience he settled down to see whether gnatios or trokoundos would be brought to the imperial residence first when pyrrhos began to look restive he sent him back to his monastery sitting quietly he kept on waiting how can you be so easy about this demanded dara who was pacing back and forth nothing would change if i fussed he said dara snorted and kept pacing rather to krispos surprise tyrovitzes party fetched back gnatios before barsymes arrived with trokoundos your majesty what is the meaning of this the patriarch said indignantly after the eunuch chamberlain escorted him into krispos presence i find it humiliating to be seized in the street like some low footpad and fetched here with no more consideration for my feelings than such a criminal would receive wheres petronas gnatios krispos asked in a voice like iron why in the monastery sacred to the holy skirios gnatios eyebrows rose or are you telling me he is not if you are i have no idea where he is the patriarch sounded surprised and curious just as he would if he were innocent but krispos knew he had no small rhetorical talents sounding innocent was childs play for him while all the eyes of the city were on us yesterday gnatios petronas was spirited out of the monastery to be blunt i know you have scant love for me do you wonder that i have doubts about you your majesty i can see that you might gnatios smiled his most engaging smile but after all your majesty you know where i was yesterday i could hardly have helped petronas escape at the same time as i was performing the wedding ceremony for you and your new empress he smiled again this time at dara she stared stonily back his smile faded no but you could have planned and arranged a rescue krispos said will you take oath on your fear of skotos ice that you had no part of any sort in petronas getting out of the monastery your majesty i will swear any oath you wish gnatios answered at once just then krispos saw barsymes standing in the hall with a short spare man who shaved his head like a priest but wore a red tunic and green trousers he carried a bulging carpetbag your majesty trokoundos said the mage started a proskynesis but krispos waved for him not to bother how may i serve you your majesty he asked straightening his voice was deep and rich the voice to be expected of a man a head taller and twice as wide through the shoulders most holy sir i will require no oath of you at all krispos said to gnatios you might throw away your soul for the sake of advantage in this world and that would be very sad instead i will ask you the same questions you have already heard but with this wizard standing by to make sure you speak the truth i will need a little while to ready myself your majesty trokoundos said i have here some of the things i may use if your vestiarios spoke accurately about your requirements he began taking mirrors candles and stoppered glass vials of various sizes and colors out of the carpetbag gnatios watched him prepare with indignation but no visible fear your majesty i will even submit to this outrage but i must inform you that i protest it he said surely you cannot imagine that i would violate my oath i can dara said krispos took a different line i can imagine many things most holy sir he told the patriarch i can even imagine giving you over to the torturers to find out what i must know a mage i think will hurt your body and your pride less but i can go the other way if youd rather as you will your majesty gnatios said so boldly that krispos wondered if he was indeed innocent the patriarch added my thanks for showing consideration for me at least to the extent you have just stay right there if you would most holy sir trokoundos said gnatios nodded regally as the mage set up a mirror on a jointed stand a few feet in front of him between mirror and patriarch trokoundos lit a candle he opened a couple of his vials and shook powder from them onto the flame which changed color and sent up a large cloud of surprisingly sweetsmelling smoke muttering to himself trokoundos set up another mirror a few feet behind gnatios and slightly to one side this one faced the one hed set up before he fussily adjusted the two squares of polished silver until gnatios face reflected from the first was visible in the second then he lit another candle between the second mirror and gnatios back he sprinkled different powders over this flame whose smoke proved as noxious as the others had been pleasant coughing a little the mage said go ahead your majesty ask what you will thank you krispos turned to the patriarch most holy sir did you help petronas escape from the monastery dedicated to the holy skirios he watched gnatios lips shape the word no but did not hear him speak it at the same time the patriarchs second reflection the one in the mirror behind him loudly and clearly said yes gnatios jerked as if stung krispos asked how did you do it he thought the patriarch tried to say i had nothing to do with it the reflection answered for him i sent in a monk who rather resembled him to take his place while he was at solitary prayer and to stay into the evening then last night i sent a priest who asked for the substituted monk by his proper name and brought him out of the monastery once more what is the name of this monk krispos demanded this time gnatios stood mute his reflection answered for him nonetheless harmosounos krispos nodded to trokoundos this is an excellent magic the wizards heavylidded eyes lit up gnatios shifted from foot to foot awaiting the next question where did petronas plan to go krispos asked him i do not know he answered out of his own mouth a moment your majesty trokoundos said sharply he fiddled with the mirrors again he sought to move enough to shift his image from the second mirror dont play such games again most holy sir i promise you would regret it krispos told gnatios now i will ask once more where did petronas plan to go i do not know gnatios repeated this time strangely krispos heard the words both straight from him and from the mirror at his back he glanced toward trokoundos he speaks the truth your majesty the wizard said i was afraid that was what that meant krispos said lets try something else then answer me this most holy sir you being kinsman to petronas where would you go in his boots gnatios plainly tried to lie again his lips moved but no sound came out of his mouth instead his doubly reflected image replied petronas greatest estates are in the westlands between the towns of garsavra and resaina there he would find the most support for any bid to take the crown you expect him to do that eh krispos said the answer to that question was so obvious krispos did not expect gnatios to bother giving it aloud and indeed the patriarch stayed silent but under trokoundos spell his second image spoke for him dont you expect it your majesty krispos chuckle was dry well yes as a matter of fact he turned to trokoundos im in your debt once more it seems trokoundos waved that away im happy to do what i can for you your majesty your warning saved me from anthimos wrath a couple of years ago and your wizardry let me live through the enchantment with which petronas would have killed me otherwise krispos said dont be shy when you name your fee for today your majesty people have accused me of many things but never of being shy about my fees trokoundos said whether anxious over his fate or simply resentful at being forgotten for me moment gnatios burst out what will you do with me your majesty a good question krispos said musingly if helping to set up a rival emperor isnt treason what is shall i put your head on the milestone as a warning to others gnatios id rather you didnt the patriarch answered coolly enough to win krispos reluctant admiration i think you should krispos dara said gnatios winced as she went on what does a traitor deserve but the axe what would petronas do to you and to me and to our child ifphos prevent ithe beat you gnatios missed very little though he could not have known of daras pregnancy before she mentioned it he used it at once saying your majesty would you slay the man who performed your marriage ceremony and so made your heir legitimate why not dara shot back when part of the reason you married us was to draw attention away from the holy skirios monastery so you could loose petronas against us the patriarch winced again i dont think ill kill you now krispos said gnatios looked delighted dara disappointed krispos went on i do cast you down from the patriarchal throne in your place i intend to propose the name of the abbot pyrrhos gnatios winced a third time id almost rather you killed me if afterwards you named in my place someone not a fanatic i can trust the clerics of his faction if i thought i could trust one from yours id take you up on that i did say almost your majesty the patriarch reminded him quickly so you did heres what i will do till the synod names pyrrhos i will send you to the monastery of the holy skirios there you will be under his hand as abbot that should be enough to keep you out of mischief for the time being krispos watched gnatios open his mouth to speak think twice if you are about to say again that youd rather be dead most holy sirno holy sir for you are but a monk now i just may oblige you gnatios glared at him but said nothing krispos turned to tyrovitzes you heard what i ordered the eunuch nodded good take this monk to the monastery then and tell the abbot he is not to leave no matter what happens take the halogai with you as you go too to make sure the man doesnt get stolen on the way as you say your majesty tyrovitzes nodded to gnatios if you will come with me holy sir unlike krispos tyrovitzes adjusted to changing honorifics without having to think twice still in his patriarch robe gnatios followed the chamberlain away i wish youd slain him dara said he may still have some use alive krispos said besides i dont think hell be going anywhere not now he and pyrrhos have despised each other for years now that hes in pyrrhos clutches hell be locked up tighter and watched better than if he was in prisonand fed worse too id wager he sighed all this would be much easier if i really believed the soldiers would turn up petronas still inside the city if they dont krispos stood thinking for a while trying to work out what he would have to do to hunt down petronas loose in the countryside i fear they wont dara said so do i krispos told her petronas was both clever and nervy the only flaw krispos had ever noted in him was a streak of vanity because he could do so much he thought he could do anything some time in the monastery might even have cured him of that krispos reflected gloomily you should proclaim him outlaw dara said a price on his head will make folk more likely to betray him to you aye ill do that krispos said ill also send a troop of cavalry out to the estates that used to be his though anthimos took them over i expect most of the men on them will still be people petronas chose and they may still be loyal to him be careful of the officer you choose to command that troop dara warned you wont want anyone who served under him youre right krispos said but petronas had headed the imperial army while his nephew frittered away the days that meant every videssian officer had served under him at least indirectly the commanders in the city had sworn oaths of loyalty to krispos those in the field were sending in written pledges a couple arrived every day how much would such pledges mean when measured against years of allegiance to a longtime leader krispos was convinced oaths and pledges were only as reliable as the men who gave them he wished hed had time to learn more about his officers before facing a challenge like this as is the way of such things wishing failed to furnish him the time he needed he sighed again ill pick as carefully as i can days passed the search of the city failed to yield any trace of petronas at krispos order scribes calloused their fingers writing scores of copies of a proclamation that branded petronas outlaw rebel and renegade monk they posted them in the plaza of palamas in the lesser square called the forum of the ox in the forecourts to the high temple and at each of the gates in videssos the citys walls before long dozens of people claimed to have seen petronas so far as krispos could tell no one really had imperial couriers galloped east and west from the city with more copies of the proclamation a cavalry troop also galloped west other couriers took ship to carry word of petronas escape to coastal towns more quickly than horses could reach them despite the worry that gnawed at him krispos carried on with the routine business of the empire indeed he threw himself into it the busier he was the less chance he had to notice petronas was still free he also wasted no time in organizing the synod that would ratify his choice of pyrrhos to succeed gnatios as ecumencial patriarch that was connected to petronas disappearance but gave krispos satisfaction nonetheless on gnatios at least he could take proper vengeance yet even the synod proved more complicated than hed expected as custom required he summoned to it abbots and highranking priests from the capital as well as the prelates of the larger suburbs on both sides of the cattlecrossing the strait that separated videssos the city from its western provinces having summoned them he assumed the rest of the process would be a formality after all as avtokrator he headed the ecclesiastical hierarchy no less than he did the state but many of the prelates who gathered at his command in the chapel in the palace quarter owed their own appointments to gnatios were of his moderate theological bent and did not take kindly to choosing the head of the more zealous faction to replace him may it please your majesty said savianos prelate of the western suburb known simply as across because it lay directly opposite videssos the city but the abbot pyrrhos holy though he is is also a man of harsh and severe temper perhaps not ideally suited to administering all aspects of ecclesiastical affairs by the way savianos bushy eyebrows twitched he would have said a good deal more than that had he dared talking to his fellow clerics he probably had said a good deal more than that krispos said politely i have after all submitted three names to this holy synod he and all the clerics knew hed done so only because the law required it of him moreover hed taken no chances with his other two candidates savianos understood that too oh aye your majesty traianos and rhepordenes are very pious he said now his eyebrows leapt instead of twitching the two clerics one the prelate of the provincial town of develtos the other an abbot in the semidesert far southwest were fanatical enough to make even pyrrhos seem mild by comparison never having known discipline the holy savianos may fear it more than is warranted observed a priest named lournes one of pyrrhos backers the experience though novel should prove salutary to the ice with you savianos snapped you are the one who will know the ice lournes retorted the clerics on either side yelled and shook their fists at those on the other krispos had seen little of prelates till now save in purely ceremonial roles away from such ceremony he discovered they seemed men like any others if louder than most he listened for a little while then slammed the flat of his hand down on the table in front of him into sudden quiet he said holy sirs i didnt think id need the halogai to keep you from one anothers throats the hierarchs looked briefly shamefaced he went on if you reckon the holy pyrrhos a heretic or an enemy of the faith do your duty vote him down and give the blue boots to one of the other men ive offered you if not make that plain with your vote as well may it please your majesty savianos said my questions about the holy pyrrhos do not pertain to his orthodoxy though i love him not i will confess he is most perfectly orthodox i only fear that he will not recognize as orthodox anyone who fails to share his beliefs to the last jot and tittle that is as it should be said visandos an abbot who supported pyrrhos the truth being by definition unique any deviation from it is unacceptable savianos shot back the principle of theological economy grants latitude of opinion on issues not relating directly to the destination of ones soul as you know perfectly well no issue is unrelated to the destination of ones soul visandos said the ecclesiastics started yelling louder than ever krispos whacked the table again silence came more slowly this time but he eventually won it he said holy sirs you have more wisdom than i in these matters but i did not summon you here to discuss them gnatios has shown himself a traitor to me i need a patriarch i can rely on will you give him to me since even savianos had admitted pyrrhos was orthodox the result of the synod was a foregone conclusion and since no cleric cared to risk the avtokrators wrath the vote for pyrrhos was unanimous the priests and abbots began arguing all over again though as they filed out of the chapel as savianos rose to depart he told krispos majesty i pray that you always recall we did this only at your bidding why do you think i will regret it krispos said savianos did not reply but his eyebrows were eloquent in spite of the prelates forebodings krispos remained convinced he had done a good days work but his satisfaction lasted only until he finished the walk from the chapel to the imperial residence there he found an imperial courier waiting for him the mans face was drawn with fatigue and pain a bloodstained bandage wrapped his left shoulder looking at him krispos wondered where disaster had struck now the last time a courier had waited for him like this it was with word that harvas blackrobes savage followers had destroyed the village where hed grown up and that his sister brotherinlaw and two nieces were gone forever did this man bring more bad news from the north or had things gone wrong in the west youd best tell me krispos said quietly the courier saluted like a soldier setting his clenched right fist over his heart aye your majesty the troops you sent to petronas estateswell sir they found him there and their captain and most of the men he paused shook his head and went on as he had to they went over to him sir a few fled that night i heard what happened from one of those we were being pursued we separated to try to make sure one of us got to you with the news i see im the first sir im sorry krispos did his best to straighten his face he hadnt realized hed let his dismay show thank you for staying loyal and bringing it to me he paused to let the courier give his name im called themistios your majesty the fellow said saluting again im in your debt themistios first find yourself a healerpriest and have that shoulder seen to krispos pulled a threeleafed tablet from the pouch on his belt he used a stylus to write an order then he drew out the imperial sunburst seal and pushed it into the wax below what he had written he closed the tablet handing it to themistios take this to the treasury theyll give you a pound of gold and if anyone tries to keep you from getting it find out his name and give it to me he wont try twice i promise themistios bowed i was afraid my head might answer for bringing you bad news your majesty i didnt expect to be rewarded for it why not krispos said how soon good news comes makes no difference good news takes care of itself but the sooner i hear of anything bad the longer i have to do something about it now go find a healerpriest as i told you you look as if youre about to fall over where you stand themistios saluted once more and hurried away one of the halogai with krispos asked now that you know where petronas is majesty and now you have longer to do something about it what will you do krispos had always admired the big fairhaired barbarians most unvidessian way of coming straight to the point he did his best to match it i aim to go out and fight him vagn vagn and the rest of the guardsmen shouted approval raising their axes high vagn said while you were still vestiarios majesty i told you you thought like a haloga i am glad to see you do not change now that you are avtokrator the other northerners loudly agreed forgetting krispos imperial dignity they pounded him on the back and boasted of how they would hack their way through whatever puny forces petronas managed to gather and how they would chop the rebel himself into pieces small enough for dogs to eat small enough for baby dogs vagn declared grandly for puppies straight from bitches teats for as long as he listened to them krispos grinned and buoyed by their ferocity almost believed disposing of petronas would be as easy as they thought but his smile was gone by the time he got to the top of the stairs that led into the imperial residence barsymes stood behind krispos back fumbling with unfamiliar catches there he said at last you look most martial your majesty i do dont i krispos sounded surprised even to himself his shoulders tightened to bear the weight of the mail shirt the vestiarios had just finished fastening he suspected hed ache by the time he took it off he had fought before against kubrati raiders but hed never worn armor and such armor his was no ordinary mail shirt even in the pale light that sifted through the alabaster ceiling panels of the imperial residence its gilding made it gleam and sparkle when the avtokrator of the videssians went on campaign with his troops no one could doubt for an instant who was in command he set his conical helmet on his head fiddled with it until it fit comfortably over his ears the helmet was gilded too with a real gold circlet soldered around it at about the level of the top of his forehead his scabbard and sword belt were also gilded as was the hilt of the sword about the only things he had that were not gilded were the swords blade his red boots and the stout spear in his right hand hed carried that spear with him when he walked from his native village to videssos the city along with a lucky goldpiece he wore on a chain round his neck it was all he had left of the place where hed grown up dara threw her arms around him through the mail and the padding beneath it he could not feel her body he hugged her too gently so as not to hurt her come back soon and safe she saidthe same wish women always send with their men who ride to war ill come back soon enough he answered ill have to with summer almost gone the fighting season wont last much longer i only hope ill be able to beat petronas before the rains come and turn the roads to glue i wish you werent going at all dara said so do i krispos still had a peasant farmers distaste for soldiering and the destruction it brought but the soldiers will perform better under my eye than they would otherwise better than they would under some general who might decide to turn his coat krispos meant the officers of the regiment he would lead out were all of them young and ambitious men who would rise faster under a young emperor weeding rebels from the army than they could hope to if an old soldier with old cronies wore the crown krispos hoped that would keep them loyal he avoided thinking about his likely fate if it didnt dara understood that too the good god keep you may that prayer fly from your mouth to phos ear krispos walked down the hall toward the doorway as he passed one of the many imperial portraits that hung on the walls he paused for a moment the longdead emperor stavrakios was shown wearing much the same gear krispos had on blade naked in his hand stavrakios looked like a soldier in fact he looked like one of the veterans who had taught krispos what he knew of war measuring himself against that tough ready countenance he felt like a fraud fraud or not though he had to do his best he walked on pausing in the doorway to let his eyes get used to the bright sunshine outsideand to take a handkerchief from his belt pouch to wipe sweat from his face in videssos the citys humid summer heat chain mail was a good substitute for a bathhouse steam room a company of halogai two hundred men strong saluted with their axes as krispos appeared they were fully armored too and sweating worse than he was he wished he could have brought the whole regiment of northerners to the westlands with him he knew they were loyal but he had to leave a garrison he could trust in the city or it might not be his when he returned a groom led progress to the foot of the steps the big bay gelding stood quietly as krispos lifted his left foot into the stirrups and swung aboard he waved to the halogai to the harbor of kontoskalion he called touching his heels to progress flanks the horse moved forward at a walk the imperial guards formed up around krispos people cheered as the emperor and his halogai paraded through the plaza of palamas and onto middle street this time they turned south off the thoroughfare the sound of the sea never absent in videssos the city grew steadily louder in krispos ears when he first came to the capital hed needed some little while to get used to the endless murmur of waves and thenslap against stone now he wondered how he would adjust to true quiet once more another crowd waited by the docks gawking at the videssian troops drawn up on foot there sailors were loading their horses onto big beamy transports for the trip to the west side of the cattlecrossing every so often a sharp curse cut through the lowvoiced muttering of the crowd off to one side doing thenbest to look inconspicuous were trokoundos and a couple of other wizards along with the waiting soldiers stood the new patriarch pyrrhos he raised his hands in benediction as he saw krispos approach the soldiers stiffened to attention and saluted the noise from the crowd got louder because the horses did not care that the emperor had come the sailors coaxing them onto and along the gangplanks did not care either the halogai in front of krispos moved aside to let him ride up to the ecumenical patriarch leaning down from the saddle he told pyrrhos im sorry we had to rush the ceremony of your investiture the other day most holy sir what with trying to deal with petronas and everything else i know i didnt have time to do it properly pyrrhos waved aside the apology the synod that chose me was well and truly made your majesty he said so in the eyes of phos i have been properly chosen next to that the pomp of a ceremony matters not at all indeed i am just as well pleased not to have endured it only so thoroughgoing an ascetic as pyrrhos could have expressed such an unvidessian sentiment krispos thought to most imperials ceremony was as vital as breath krispos said will you bless me and my warriors now most holy sir i shall bless you and pray for your victory against the rebel pyrrhos proclaimed loud enough for the soldiers and city folk to hear more softly for krispos ears alone he went on i first blessed you twenty years ago on the platform in kubrat i shall not change my mind now you and iakovitzes krispos said remembering the noble had gone north to ransom the farmers the kubratoi had stolen pyrrhos and a kubrati shaman were there to make sure phos and the nomads false gods heard the bargain aye the patriarch touched the head of his staff a gilded sphere as big as a fist to krispos shoulder raising his voice he declared the avtokrator of the videssians is the good gods viceregent on earth whoso opposes him opposes the will of phos thou conquerest krispos thou conquerest people and soldiers shouted together krispos waved in acknowledgment glad pyrrhos was unreservedly on his side of course if petronas ended up beating him that would only prove phos will had been that he lose and then pyrrhos would serve a new master or if he refused it would be from distaste at petronas way of life not because petronas had vanquished krispos determining phos will could be a subtle art krispos did not intend that pyrrhos would have to weigh such subtleties he aimed to beat petronas not to be beaten he rode down the dock to the suncircle the ship that would carry him across to the westlands the captain a short thickset man named nikoulitzas and his sailors came to attention and saluted as krispos drew near when he dismounted a groom hurried forward to take charge of progress and lead the horse aboard once on the suncircle progress snorted and rolled his eyes not much caring for the gently shifting planks under his feet krispos did not much care for them either hed never been on a ship before he told his stomach to behave itself the imperial dignity would not survive hanging over the rail and giving the fish his breakfast after a few more internal mutterings his stomach decided to obey nikoulitzas was very tan but years of sun and sea spray had bleached his hair almost as light as a halogas saluting again he said we are ready to sail when you give the word your majesty then sail krispos said soonest begun soonest done aye your majesty nikoulitzas shouted orders the suncircles crew cast off lines along with its sail the ship had half a dozen oars on each side for getting into and out of harbors the sailors dug in at them that changed the motion of the suncircle and progress snorted again and laid his ears back krispos spoke soothingly to the horseand to his stomach he fed progress a couple of dried apricots the horse ate them then peered at his hands for more nothing was wrong with his digestion at any rate the voyage over the cattlecrossing took less than half an hour the suncircle beached itself a little north of the western suburb called across none of videssos the citys suburbs had docks of their own lest they compete with the capital for trade the sailors took out a section of rail and ran out the gangplank from the suncircles gunwale to the sand leading progress by the rein krispos walked down to the beach his feet and the horses hooves echoed on the planks the rest of the transports went aground to either side of the suncircle some halogai had sailed on krispos ship those who had not hurried up to join their countrymen and form a protective ring around him the videssian troops by contrast paid more attention to recovering their horses the afternoon was well along before the regimental commander rode up to krispos and announced we are ready to advance your majesty onward then sarkis krispos said sarkis saluted aye your majesty he shouted orders to his men his videssian had a slight throaty accent that along with his wide face thick beard and imperious promontory of a nose said he was from vaspurakan so were a good many of his troopersthe mountain land bred fine fighting men a small strain of vaspurakaner blood also flowed in krispos veins or so his father had always said that was one of the reasons krispos had chosen sarkis regiment another was that the princesfor so every vaspurakaner reckoned himself were heretics in videssian eyes and found fault themselves with the imperial version of phos faith as outsiders in videssos they like the halogai had little reason to favor an oldline noble like petronasor so krispos hoped scouts trotted ahead of the main line of soldiers still surrounded by the halogai krispos rode along near the middle of that line muledrawn baggage wagons rattled along behind him followed by the rearguard the cattlecrossing and its beach vanished as they moved west down a dirt road toward petronas lands from the road krispos could see farms and farming villages as far as his eyes reached the western coastal lowlands held perhaps the most fertile soil in all the empire after a while krispos dismounted stepped into a field and dug his hand deeps in to the rich black earth he felt of it smelled it tasted it and shook his head by the good god he said as much to himself as to any of his companions if id worked soil like this nothing could have made me leave it had the soil of his native village been half this good he and his fellows there could easily have grown enough to meet the tax bill that forced him to seek his fortune in the city on the other hand had the soil there been better the tax bill undoubtedly would have been worse videssos tax collectors let nothing slip through their fingers a few farmers and a fair number of small boys stayed in the fields to gape at the soldiers and avtokrator as they went by more did what krispos would have done had he worn their sandals they turned and fled soldiers did not always plunder rape and kill but the danger of it was too great to be taken lightly as the crimson ball of the sun neared the western horizon the army camped in a field of clover not far from a grove of fragrant orange trees cookfires drew moths and the bats and nightjars that preyed on them krispos had ordered that he be fed the same as any soldier he stood in line for hard cheese harder bread a cup of rough red wine and bowl of stew made from smoked pork garlic and onions the cook who ladled out the stew looked nervous begging your pardon your majesty but im afraid this isnt so fine as what youre used to krispos laughed at him the gravys thicker than what i grew up with by the good god and theres more in the kettle here too he spooned out a piece of pork and chewed thoughtfully my mother would have thrown in some thyme i think if she had it otherwise i cant complain hes an army cook your majesty one of the videssian cavalrymen said you expect him to know what hes doing everyone who heard jeered at the cook krispos finished quickly and held out his bowl for a second helping that seemed to make the luckless fellow sweating over his pots a little happier three mornings later as the army drew near a small town or large village called patrodoton one of the scouts came riding back at a gallop he spoke briefly to sarkis who led him to krispos youd best hear this yourself your majesty the general said at krispos nod the scout said a couple of the farmers up ahead warned me theres already soldiers in that town did they krispos clicked his tongue between his teeth cant expect petronas just to sit back and let us do as we like sarkis remarked no i suppose not i wish we could krispos thought for a few seconds he asked the scout did these farmers say how many men were there the scout shook his head cant be too many though i figure or wed have some idea they were around before this i think youre right krispos turned to sarkis excellent sir what if we take a couple of companies of our horsemen here and he spent a couple of minutes explaining what he had in mind but for one broken tooth in front sarkis smile was even and very white his closed fist thumped against his mail shirt over his heart as he saluted krispos your majesty i think i just may enjoy serving under you at the generals command the panpipers blew halt sarkis chose his two best company commanders and gave them their orders they grinned too like sarkis and krispos they were young enough to enjoy cleverness for its own sake before long their two contingents trotted down the road toward patrodoton the men rode along in loose order as if they had not a care in the world the rest of the army settled down to wait after a bit sarkis ordered them into a defensive position with the halogai in the center blocking the road and the remaining videssian cavalry on either wing glancing apologetically over at krispos the general said we ought to be ready in case it goes wrong krispos nodded by all means both tanilis and petronas had taught him not to take success for granted but hed never led large numbers of troops before he didnt automatically know the right way to insure against mischance that was why he had sarkis along he was glad the general had prudence to go with his dash waiting stretched the soldiers drank wine gnawed bread sang songs and told each other lies krispos stroked his beard and worried then one of the halogai pointed southwest in the direction of patrodoton krispos saw the dust rising over the roadway a good many men were heading this way the halogai raised their axes to the ready the videssians were first and foremost archers they quickly strung their bows set arrows to them and made sure sabers were loose in their scabbards but one of sarkis two picked company commanders a small lean fellow named zeugmas rode in front of the oncoming horsemen his wave was full of exuberance weve got em he shouted come see krispos touched his heels to progress flanks the horse started forward thvari and several other halogai stepped close together to keep krispos from advancing let me through he said angrily the northerners captain shook his head no majesty not by yourself not when it could be a trap i thought you were my guards not my jailers krispos said thvari and the others stood implacable krispos sighed in his younger days he hadnt wanted to be a soldier but if he had taken up sword and spear no one would have kept him from risking his life now that he wanted to go into action the halogai would not let him he sighed again struck by the absurdity of it but could only yield as you wish gentlemen will you come with me thvari saluted aye majesty we come accompanied by a squad of halogainot that theyll do me much good if the bowmen shoot a volley at me he thought krispos went out to see what the companies hed sent out had accomplished the troopers didnt seem to find that cowardly they yelled and grinned and wavedand laughed at the glum disarmed riders in their midst there you see krispos told thvari its safe enough thvaris broad shoulders went up and down in a slow deliberate shrug we did not know your duty is to rule majesty ours is to guard shamed by the reproach in the captains voice krispos had to nod then zeugmas came up couldnt have worked better your majesty he said happily we bagged the lot of em and didnt lose a man doing it just like you said we rode on in cursing you for a bloody usurper and everything else we could think of and their leaderthat sourfaced bastard with the thick mustaches over there his names physakisfigured wed come to join the rebels too seeing as we had twice his numbers he was glad to see us he posted us with his men and didnt take any precautions we just passed the word along made sure we got the drop on em all at the same time andwell here we are wonderful krispos found himself grinning too he was no professional soldier but his stratagem had taken in a man who was he pointed to physakis bring him here lets see what he knows at zeugmas orders a couple of troopers made the rebel officer dismount and marched him over to krispos he peered up at krispos from under lowered brows your majesty he mumbled as zeugmas had said his mustaches were luxuriant krispos could hardly see his lips move when he spoke you didnt call me majesty before you got caught krispos said what shall i do with you now whatever you want of course physakis answered he did indeed look sour not krispos judged from fear but more as if his stomach pained him if i decide your parole is good ill send you north to serve against harvas blackrobe and his cutthroats krispos said physakis brightened he must have expected to meet the axe traitors deserved with the threat harvas posed though krispos could not afford to rid himself of every officer who chose petronas you have mages with you then physakis asked aye krispos contented himself with the bare word hed almost gone west without sorcerous aid because of the passions that filled men in combat battle magic was notoriously unreliable but petronas had tried before to slay him with sorcery he wanted protection close at hand if anthimos uncle tried again wizards were also useful for such noncombat tasks as testing the sincerity of paroles and oaths the troopers took physakis back to trokoundos and his comrades one by one the rest of the captured officers and underofficers of the troop followed him the common soldiers were another matter krispos did not merely want their pledge to fight him no more he wanted them to take service with him when he put that to them most agreed at once so long as they had leadership and food they cared little as to which side they were on a few stubbornly loyal to petronas refused as physakis had before them they waited nervously for krispos to decree their fate take their horses their mail shirts and all their weapons but one dagger each he told his own men then let them go i dont think theyll be able to do us much harm after that leave us our money too majesty one of them called krispos shook his head you earned it by opposing me but youve shown yourselves to be honest men youll find the chance to make more while his soldiers disarmed those of krispos men who refused to go over to him the wizards listened to the rest of the troopers from patrodoton give their oaths of allegiance when that ceremony was done trokoundos approached krispos a squad of halogai followed along with three increasingly unhappylooking videssians trokoundos pointed to them each in turn these three majesty swore falsely i am sorry to say while they granted you their pledges in their hearts they still intended to betray you i might have guessed that would happen krispos said he turned to the halogai strip them give them a dozen lashes well laid on and send them on their way naked such traitors are worse than honest foes aye majesty said narvikka the leader of the squad one of the videssians tried to bolt the halogai grabbed him before he could even break out of their circle they drove tent pegs into the ground tied the three captives to them facedown and swung the whip the troopers shrieks punctuated its harsh flat cracks when the strokes were done the halogai cut the men loose and let them stagger away that night the wind began to blow from the northwest it swept away the hot humid air that had hung over the coastal lowlands and had made travel in armor an even worse torment than usual when krispos came out of his tent the next morning he saw dirty gray clouds stacked along the northern horizon he frowned back in his village fall was on the way when those clouds started piling up over the paristrian mountains and with fall came the fall rains that turned dirt roads to quagmires theyd be early if they started so soon he didnt realize hed spoken aloud until sarkis who was emerging from the tent next to his nodded and answered aye so they would majesty and wouldnt we have a jolly time trying to run petronas down when were all squelching through mush krispos spat rejecting sarkis words as if the officer had invoked skotos sarkis laughed but they both knew it was no joke krispos said well have to push harder thats all the lord with the great and good mind willing i want to bring petronas to bay now while hes still on the run i dont want him to have the winter to get in touch with all his old cronies and build up his strength sensible sarkis nodded aye sensible majesty come next year youll have harvas blackrobe to worry about you wont want to split time between petronas and him exactly krispos estimation of sarkis went up a notch not many soldiers worried about harvas or about the northern frontier in general as much as he did then he wondered if sarkis was agreeing with his concern just to curry favor being avtokrator meant making an unending string of such judgments he hadnt expected that he didnt care for it either he lined up for breakfast taking a thick slice of bread and a handful of salted olives he spat out the last olive pit from atop progress his soldiers drove toward petronas estates as fast as they could the suddenly milder weather helped keep men and horses fresh but every time krispos looked northward over his shoulder he saw more clouds building up he could not even urge the troops to better speed not unless he wanted to leave the halogai in the cavalrys dust he could grumble and he did nor were his spirits lifted when an imperial courier caught up with the army from behind that only reminded him he could have been going faster the rolledup parchment the rider delivered was sealed with skyblue wax from the patriarch eh krispos said to the courier did he give you the gist of it people who sent messages sometimes did to make sure that what they had to say got through even if their written words were lost but the courier shook his head no your majesty all right ill see for myself krispos broke the seal florid salutations and greetings from pyrrhos took up half the sheet krispos skipped over them looking for meat at last he found it two chunks gnatios was still immured in the monastery where he had begun to compile a chronicle to help pass the time and pyrrhos had seen fit to depose an abbot and two prelates for false doctrines and another abbot for refusing to acknowledge his authority krispos rubbed the side of his head with his hand hed expected pyrrhos to be contentious why should he be surprised now to have the man prove him right is there a reply majesty the courier asked he took out a waxed tablet and stylus yes krispos paused to order his thoughts then said avtokrator krispos to the patriarch pyrrhos greetings i hope you will keep peace among the priests and monks prelates and abbots of the temples with a rebel in the field and an enemy on our border we have no need for more strife thats all let me hear it if you would the courier read the message back at krispos nod he closed the tablet he carried a stick of sealing wax someone not far away had a torch going easier to bring fire along than to start it fresh every night the soldier fetched the torch in a moment melted wax dripped down onto the closed tablet while the wax was still soft krispos sealed it with the imperial sunburst the courier saluted and rode away because of his complete success at patrodoton krispos gained another day and a half to advance unopposed he knew he was nearing petronas estates he also knew that was fortunate rain began to fall toward evening of the first day out of patrodoton and showed no sign of letting up during the night at first the rain was welcome for it kept down the choking clouds of dust the horses would otherwise have raised but as the next day wore on and the rain kept coming krispos felt progress begin to work to pick up his feet and heard the horses hooves pull loose from the thickening mud with wet sucking sounds in the fields farmers worked like men possessed as they battled to get in their crops before the rains ruined them they were even too frantic to be afraid of krispos army remembering the desperation the folk of his village had felt once or twice because of early fall rains he knew what they were going through and wished them well just after noon on the second day of the rains krispos and his soldiers came to the eriza river a fairsize stream that ran south into the arandos a wooden bridge should have spanned the eriza in spite of the rain the bridge was burned peering across to the western bank krispos made out patrolling riders in spite of the rain they saw him and his men too they shook their fists and shouted insults krispos could barely hear through the rain and across a hundred years of water one cry though he made out clearly petronas avtokrator rage ripped through him give them a volley he barked to sarkis the generals bushy eyebrows came together above his nose as he frowned with the bows we have the range isnt short and well get our bowstrings wet when we shoot he said if they have men on this side of the river too that could leave us in a nasty spot reluctantly krispos nodded a company then he said just something to shut their mouths aye why not sarkis rode down the line to the troopers zeugmas led krispos watched zeugmas object as the regimental commander had watched sarkis talk him round the horsemen in zeugmas company quickly strung their bows plucked arrows from quivers and let fly some tried second shots a few third then fast as theyd taken them out they put away their bowstrings to protect them from the rain on the far side of the eriza the jeers abruptly turned to cries of alarm and pain krispos saw one man slide from the saddle the rest set spur to their horses and drew away from the riverbank a couple of petronas troopers shot back an arrow buried itself in the mud not far from krispos another clattered off a halogas axe no one on this side of the river seemed hurt we cant cross here krispos said not unless we want to swim sarkis agreed watching the brown waters of the eriza foam creamily against the pilings of the burned bridge the regimental commander was not downhearted the farmers hereabouts will know where the fords are i expect so they will krispos said hed known all the best places to cross the streams near his old village but wed best not waste time finding one this rivers going to start rising and its big enough that if it does we wont be able to cross anywhere the peasants hereabouts were stolid serious people altogether unlike the clever magpie men who called videssos the city home the sight of gold in krispos palm quickly turned them voluble though aye lord theres a good place to ford half a league north of here there is by the dead elm tree a farmer said and theres another not so good rather more than that southward where the eriza takes a little jog if you know what i mean my thanks krispos gave the peasant two goldpieces to his embarrassment the fellow clumsily prostrated himself in the mud get up you fool ten years ago i was just a farmer myself working a field not near so fine as this one the peasant scrambled to his feet filthy and dripping his eyes puzzled youwere a farmer lord how could you be a farmer you are avtokrator krispos gave it up he would only be sure of staying avtokrator if he got across the eriza he turned progress away from the farmer his captains who had gathered round to hear his exchange with the man were already shouting orders north half a league to a dead elm tree they squelched along by the river moving more slowly than they would have when the weather was good normally a local landmark like a dead elm would have been easy to find in the rain they almost rode past it krispos urged progress into the river the water rose to the horses belly before he was a quarter of the way across this isnt as easy as that peasant made it out to be he said so it isnt sarkis pointed across to the western bank of the river horsemen with bows and lances waited there more came trotting up while he and krispos watched we outnumber them krispos said without conviction so we do sarkis sounded unhappy too he pointed out what krispos had also seen we cant bring our numbers to bear though not by way of a narrow ford where numbers count they have more than we do they knew where this ford was krispos said thinking aloud as soon as we came to the bridge they started gathering here sarkis nodded mournfully theyre probably at the other one as well the one where the eriza jogs curse these early rains krispos snarled just have to hunt up some more farmers sarkis said sooner or later well find a ford thats unguarded once were across we may be able to roll up the rebels all along the river the regimental commander was not one to stay downcast long krispos spirits lifted more slowly the rain that splashed against his face and trickled through his beard did nothing to improve his mood if the river keeps rising there wont be any fords no matter what we learn from the farmers true enough sarkis said but if we cant get at them for a while they cant get at us either though krispos nodded that thought consoled him less than it did sarkis as was fitting and proper the regimental commander thought like a soldier as avtokrator krispos had to achieve a wider vision all the empire of videssos was his by right any part that did not obey his will diminished his rule in an odd way diminished him personally well find a ford sarkis said finding one that petronas men were not covering took two days and wore krispos patience to rags at last though squad by squad his troopers began making their way across the eriza though the peasant whod told of the ford swore it was an easy one the horses had to fight to move forward against the rainswollen stream the halogai waited with krispos when they crossed they would hang onto the tails of the last cavalry companys horses the eriza might well have swept away a man who tried that ford afoot they found the fall rains funny in our country majesty rain is for the end of spring and for summer vagn said the rest of the northerners around krispos chorused agreement no wonder so many of you come south he said aye thats the way of it majesty vagn said to a haloga even the weather in kubrat would seem good having spent several years in kubrat krispos found that prospect appalling it gave him a measure of how harsh life in halogaland had to beand a new worry he asked with harvas blackrobe and his mercenaries holding kubrat does that mean more halogai might come south to settle there it could majesty vagn said after a thoughtful pause that would bear hard on videssos were it so yes was all krispos answered he already knew he could not rely on all his videssian soldiers against petronas when he took the field against harvas would he be able to trust his own haloga guards one thing at a time he told himself after he dealt with petronas almost all the rankandfile troopers in videssian service would rally to him especially if he campaigned against a foreign foe your majesty someone called your majesty here krispos answered the halogai who had been about to cross the eriza turned back and formed up around him weapons ready that unthinking protective move told him more plainly than any oaths that these were loyal troops the man who asked for krispos proved to be an imperial courier who sat soaked and bedraggled atop a blowing horse i have a dispatch from the sevastos mavros your majesty he said holding out a tube of waxed and oiled leather if you like i can give you the news it bears i must tell you it is not good let me hear it and i will judge krispos said wondering how bad it would be it was bad enough he saw to make the courier nervous speak by the good god i know you only bring news you dont cause it thank you your majesty even in the rain the courier licked his lips before he went on and when he did the word he gave was worse than any krispos had imagined majesty harvas and his raiders have sacked the town of develtos iii krispos noticed he was grinding his teeth he made himself stop all the same he felt pulled apart how was he supposed to deal with petronas if harvas blackrobe invaded the empire and how could he deal with harvas if petronas clung to his revolt majesty the courier said when he was some time silent what is your will majesty a good question krispos thought he laughed harshly my will is that harvas go to skotos ice and petronas with him neither of them seems as interested in my will as you do though worse luck for me taking the liberty the courier dared not sarkis asked what will you do majesty krispos pondered that while the rain muttered down all around not the least part of his pondering was sarkis himself if he left the regimental commander here by the eriza alone would he stay loyal or desert to petronas if he did go over all the westlands save perhaps the suburbs across from videssos the city would be lost but if krispos gave his attention solely to overthrowing petronas how much of the empire would harvas ravage while he was doing it he realized that was but a different phrasing for the unpalatable questions hed asked himself before as if he had no doubt sarkis would remain trueas if the notion that sarkis could do otherwise had never crossed his mindhe said ill go back to the city i can best deal with harvas from there now that weve pushed over the eriza i want you to go after petronas with everything you have if you can seize him this winter few rewards would be big enough the regimental commanders eyes were dark and fathomless as twin pools reflecting the midnight sky nevertheless krispos thought he saw a faint light in them as if a star were shining on those midnight pools saluting sarkis said you may rely on me your majesty i do krispos said simply he wished he did not have to he hoped sarkis did not know that but suspectedhalf feared the vaspurakaner soldier was clever enough to grasp it thvari said my men will escort you back to the city majesty a squad will do krispos said i want the rest of you to stay with sarkis and help him run petronas to earth but thvari shook his head we are your guardsmen majesty we took oath by our gods to ward your body ward it we shall our duty is to you not to videssos the eunuchs in the palace think they have the right to tell the avtokrator what to do krispos said his voice somewhere between amusement and chagrin do you claim it too thvari the haloga captain folded his arms across his broad chest in this majesty aye think youyou travel a land in revolt a squad even a troop is not enough to assure your safety krispos saw thvari would not yield as you wish he said reflecting that the longer he held the throne the less absolute his power looked as it happened he and the halogai met not a single foeman on their long muddy slog back to videssos the city they did see one fellow though who plainly took them for enemies a monk going west on muleback the hood of his blue robe drawn up over his shaven pate to protect him from the rain he kicked his mount into a stifflegged trot and rode far around the oncoming soldiers before he dared return to the highway the halogai snickered at the monks fear with delicate irony krispos asked bold captain thvari do you think a squad of your heroes would have been enough to save me from that desperado thvari refused to be baited by the look of him majesty belike he would have set on a mere squad krispos had to laugh the northerner went on more seriously besides whos to say that if you had only the squad you mightnt have come across a whole horde of petronas rogues the gods delight in sending woe to folk who scant their safety no man outwits his fate but it may entrap him before his time i know why that monk turned aside from us krispos said for fear of having to argue theology with you few halogai turn to phos but not for the priests lack of trying thvari said your god suits you of the empire and our gods suit us krispos remained convinced the northerners gods were false but could not deny the quality of the men who followed them he and his guards reached the suburbs across from the imperial city two days later the courier had preceded them boats were waiting to take them over the cattlecrossing the short trip left krispos greenfaced and gulping for the northerly winds that brought the fall rains had also turned the strait choppy he sketched the suncircle over his heart when he was back on dry land through the thick gray rain clouds though phos sun could not be seen long faces greeted him when he entered the imperial residence cheer up he said the world hasnt ended he tapped the message tube the courier had brought him i know losing develtos is a hard blow but i think i have a way around it or at least a way to keep harvas quiet until ive settled petronas very good your majesty i am pleased to hear it but barsymes did not seem pleased nor did his features lighten well krispos told himself thats just his wayhe never looks happy then the vestiarios said majesty i fear the evil news does not stop at develtos krispos stiffened just when he could hope hed solved one problem another came along to throw him back again youd better tell me he said heavily i hear and obey majesty no doubt you can comprehend that the most holy pyrrhos elevation to the patriarchate entailed some confusion for the monastery dedicated to the memory of the holy skirios so forceful an abbot as pyrrhos i daresay would not have suffered others there to gain or exercise much authority thus no one it appears paid close enough attention to the comings and goings of the monks in fine your majesty the former patriarch gnatios is nowhere to be found krispos grunted as if hed taken a blow in the belly all at once he remembered the westbound monk whod been so skittish on seeing him and the halogai he had no way of knowing whether that was gnatios but the fellow had been going where gnatios if free was likeliest to gotoward land petronas controlled he said that aloud adding so now petronas will have a patriarch of his own to crown him properly and to call pyrrhos appointment illegal that does seem probable barsymes agreed he dipped his head to krispos for one new to the throneindeed to the city and its intriguesyou show a distinct gift for such maneuvers its what id do were i in petronas boots krispos said shrugging indeed well petronas is no mean schemer so you have not contradicted me i know that only too well from whom do you think i learned krispos thought for a while then went on when you go barsymes send in a secretary ill draft a proclamation of outlawry against gnatios and offer a reward for his capture or death i suppose i should also have pyrrhos condemn him on behalf of the temples the ecumenical patriarch has already seen to that your majesty barsymes said yesterday he issued an anathema against gnatios and read it publicly at the high temple it was quite a vituperative document i must say even for one of that sort some of the phrases that stick in the mind are perverter of the patriarchate spiritual leper and viper vilely hissing at the altar they never were fond of each other krispos observed barsymes let one eyebrow rise in understated appreciation for the understatement sighing krispos continued trouble is gnatios will just fling his own anathemas right back at pyrrhos so neither set will end up accomplishing anything pyrrhos will appear first and he does control the ecclesiastical hierarchy and preach from the high temple his words should carry the greater weight barsymes said thats true krispos said the thought consoled him a little as it was the only consolation hed had for the last several days he cherished it as long as he could the general agapetos rubbed a raw new pink scar that puckered his right cheek in size and placement it almost matched an old pale one on the other side of his face he looked relieved to be reporting his failure in a chamber off the grand courtroom rather than from a prison cell to an unsympathetic jailer by the good god majesty i still dont know how the bugger got past me to develtos with so many men he said his deep voice querulous i dont know how he took the place so quick either that puzzles me too krispos said hed been through develtos a cheerless gray fortress town that helped ward the road between the capital and the eastern port of opsikion its walls had seemed forbiddingly tall and solid i hear magic toppled one of the towers and let the savages in iakovitzes said agapetos snorted thats always the excuse of those who run first and fastest they lie as fast as they run too if battle magic worked even a quarter of the time wizards would fight wars and soldiers could go home and tend their gardens as far as i know the only ones who got out of develtos alive were the ones who ran first and fastest mavros put in all the rest are dead aye thats so agapetos said the halogai are bloodthirsty devils and this harvas strikes me as downright vicious still and all my lads were keeping the raiders to their side of the frontier then somehow he slid a whole army past us maybe it was magic your majesty i dont see how else he could have done it may the ice take me if i lie ive heard that claimed of harvas before krispos said i never really believed it whenever a man has great good fortune people naturally think hes a mage but now i do begin to wonder the halogai slew all the priests in the city its said mavros observed if harvas is a wizard he is not one who works by the power of phos of course a heathen haloga doesnt work magic by the power of phos iakovitzes said and if the savages were killing everyone in the city i doubt theyd have bothered to spare anyone just because he was wearing a blue robe would you he lifted an elegantly arched eyebrow mavros knew better than to take him seriously im sorry excellent sir but i must confess that never having sacked a town i really couldnt say a little of iakovitzes sarcasm was bracing more than a little had a way of disrupting things not wanting that to happen now krispos said the real question is what to do next if i fight petronas and harvas at the same time i split my forces and cant concentrate on either one but if i neglect one and just fight the other the one i ignore has free rein are you wondering why you ever wanted to be avtokrator in the first place iakovitzes asked with malicious relish i didnt particularly want to be avtokrator krispos retorted but letting anthimos go ahead and kill me didnt look all that good either youre going to have to buy time with one of your foes so you can crush the other one krispos mavros said if you hadnt already been at war with petronas i could have led a fresh force out from the city and joined agapetos against harvas as it was i didnt dare in case you were defeated in the westlands and needed aid im glad you stayed here krispos said quickly remembering tanilis letter he went on it galls me but i fear youre right and it galls me worse that the one ill have to buy off is harvas petronas paid him to invade kubrat so i know he takes gold and once ive beaten petronaswhy then the good god willing master harvas may just have to give that gold back among other things if he thinks ill ever forget develtos or forgive hes mistaken still youre making the right choice iakovitzes said nodding vigorously you cant afford to treat with petronas that would be as much as recognizing him as your equal a reigning avtokrator has no equals inside videssos but paying off a foreign prince whos made a nuisance of himselfwhy it happens all the time krispos glanced to mavros who also nodded agapetos said aye majesty settle the civil war first once the whole empire is behind you then you can have another go at harvas when the time is ripe how much did petronas pay harvas to bring his murderers south into kubrat krispos asked fifty pounds of goldthirtysix hundred goldpieces iakovitzes answered at once then you can offer him up to twice that much if you have to and buy me a years peace with him krispos said i trust youll be able to get him to settle for less though being the able dickerer you are iakovitzes glared at him i was afraid you were leading up to that youre the best envoy i have krispos said how many embassies to the folk of the north have you headed we first met in kubrat remember i still wear that goldpiece you gave the old khagan omurtag when you were ransoming the lot of kidnapped peasants i was part of so you know what you need to do and i know i can rely on you if it were a mission to the kubrat that was or to khatrish or even thatagush id say aye without thinking twice though all those lands are bloody barbarous iakovtizes said slowly harvas now harvas is something else i tell you frankly krisposyour majestyhe alarms me he wants more than just plunder he wants slaughter and maybe more than that harvas alarms me too krispos admitted if you think youre going into danger iakovtizes i wont send you no ill go iakovtizes ran a hand through his graying hair after all what could he do for one thing he may have to send an embassy here one fine day and i knowand hed knowyoud avenge any harm that came to me and for another im coming to pay him tribute lots of tribute how could i making him angry doing that mavros leered at the short feisty noble if anyone could manage iakovitzes youre the man ah your highness iakovitzes said in a tone of sweet regret were you not suddenly become second lord in all the land be assured i would tell you precisely what sort of cocky impertinent jumpedup little snipsnap bastard son of a snake and a cuckoo you really are by the time he finished he was shouting redfaced his eyes bulging kind and gracious as always krispos told him doing his best not to laugh you too eh iakovitzes growled well youd just better watch out your majesty as best i can tell i can call you anything i bloody well please for a while and not worry a bit about lese majeste because if you send me to the chap with the axe you cant send me to harvas that depends on where i tell him to cut krispos said iakovitzes grabbed his crotch in mock horror just then barsymes brought in a fresh jar of wine and a plate of smoked octopus tentacles the eunuch looked down his long nose at iakovitzes there are not many men to whom i would say this excellent sir but i suspect you would be as much a scandal without your stones as with them why thank you iakovitzes said which made even the imperturbable vestiarios blink krispos raised his cup in salute so long as iakovitzes had his tongue he was armed and dangerous iakovitzes set out on his mission to harvas a few days later krispos promptly put him in a back corner of his mind what with the state of the roads during the fall rains and the blizzards that would follow them he did not expect the noble to be back before spring of more immediate concern was sarkis continuing campaign against petronas by his dispatches the regimental commander was making progress but at a snails pace thanks to the weather the rains were still falling when he reached the first of petronas estates drove off to westward the cavalry who sought to oppose us he wrote then attempted to fire the villa and outbuildings we had taken too wet for a truly satisfactory job but no one will be able to use them for a good long while yet when krispos was a youth the world in winter had seemed to contract to no more than his village and the fields around it even as avtokrator something similar happened though news came in from all over the empire everything beyond videssos the city seemed dim and distant as if seen through thick fog not least because of that he paid more attention to the people closest to him by midwinters day dara was visibly pregnant though not in the thick robes she wore to the amphitheater to watch the skits that celebrated the suns swing back toward the north midwinters day was a time of license a couple of the pantomime shows lewdly speculated on what daras relationship with krispos had been before anthimos died krispos laughed even when the jokes on him werent funny after looking angry at first dara went along though she said some of those socalled clowns should be horsewhipped through the plaza of palamas its midwinters day krispos said as if that explained everything to him it did some of the servants had started a bonfire in front of the steps that led into the imperial residence it still blazed brightly when the imperial party returned from the amphitheater krispos dismounted from progress he tossed the reins to a groom then holding the crown on his head with one hand he dashed toward the fire sprang into the air burn ill luck he shouted as he flew over the flames a moment later he heard more running feet burn ill luck dara called her jump barely carried her across the fire she staggered when she landed she might have fallen had krispos not reached out a quick hand to steady her that was foolish he said angry now himself why have you been traveling in a litter the past month but to keep you from wearing yourself out or hurting yourself then you go and risk it alland for what holiday hijinks she pulled away from him im not made of pottery you know i wont shatter if you look at me sideways and besides she lowered her voice what with petronas gnatios and harvas blackrobe dont you think more ill luck is out there than one alone can easily burn away his anger melted as the snow had around the campfire aye thats so he put an arm round her shoulder but i wish youd be more careful she shook him off he saw hed somehow annoyed her again then she said is that for my sake or just on account of the child in my belly for both he answered honestly her eyes stayed narrowed as she studied him he said come on now have you seen me building any minnow ponds she blinked then found herself laughing no i suppose not minnows had been a euphemism anthimos used for one of the last of his debauched schemesone of the few times anthimos bothered with euphemism krispos thought dara went on after living with such worries so long do you wonder that i have trouble trusting by way of answer he put his arm around her again this time she let it stay they walked up the steps and down the hallway together when they got to their bedchamber she closed and barred the doors behind them at his quizzical look she said you were the one who was talking about it being midwinters day they wasted no time undressing and sliding under the blankets though bricklined ducts under the floor brought warm air from a central furnace the bedchamber was still chilly krispos hand traced the small bulge rising around daras navel her mouth twisted into a peculiar expression half pride half pout i liked myself better flatbellied she said i like you fine the way you are to prove what he said krispos let his hand linger she scowled ferociously did you like me throwing up every morning and every other afternoon im not doing that as often now the good god be praised im glad youre not krispos said i he stopped under his palm somethingfluttered rolled twisted he could not find the right word wonder in his voice he asked was that the baby dara nodded ive felt him she always called the child to come him moving for a week or ten days now thats the hardest wiggle yet though im not surprised you noticed it what does it feel like to you he asked all at once more curious than aroused he pressed lightly on her belly hoping the baby inside would stir again its rather like dara frowned shook her head i started to say it felt like gas like what would happen if i ate too much cucumber and octopus salad it did when he first started moving but these bigger squirmings dont feel like anything if you know what i mean youd understand if you were a woman yes i suppose i would but since im not i have to ask foolish questions as if on cue the baby moved again krispos hugged dara close we did that he exclaimed before he recalled he might not have had anything to do with it at all if dara remembered that too she gave no sign we may have started it she said tartly but im the one who has to do the rest of the work oh hush the feel of daras warm smooth body pressed against his own reminded krispos why they were in bed together he rolled her onto her back as they joined he looked down at her and said since youre complaining ill do the work tonight fair enough she said her eyes glowing in the lamplight we wont be able to do it this way too much longer anyhow someone coming between us you might say so lets she paused her breath going short for a moment enjoy it while we can oh yes he said oh yes the message iakovitzes had sent out well before midwinters day arrived several weeks after the festival was over all the same krispos was glad to have it harvas wants to take the tribute weve been haggling over how much his is not simple haloga greed he fights for every copper like a prawnseller in the city not a prawn to be had here worse lucknothing but bloody mutton and bloody beef by the lord with the great and good mind majesty he nearly frightens me he is very fierce and very clever but i give as good as i get i think yours in frigid resignation from the blizzards of pliskavos krispos smiled as he rolled up the parchment he could easily summon a picture of iakovitzes sharp tongue carving strips off a barbarous warlord too slowwitted to realize hed been insulted then krispos read the letter again if harvas blackrobe was cleverand everything krispos knew of him pointed that wayiakovitzes acid barbs might sink deep he closed the letter once more and tied a ribbon around it iakovitzes had been treating with barbarians for close to thirty yearsfor as long as krispos had been alive hed know not to go too far what had been a quiet winter in matters ecclesiastical heated up when pyrrhos abruptly expelled four priests from their temples seeing the blunt announcement in with the rest of the paperwork krispos summoned the patriarch whats all this in aid of he asked tapping the parchment i thought i told you i wanted quiet in the temples so you did majesty but without true doctrine and fidelity what value has mere quiet pyrrhos as krispos had long known was not one to compromise the patriarch went on as you will note in my memorandum there i had reason in each case bryones of the temple of the holy nestorios was heard to preach that you were a false avtokrator and i a false patriarch cant have that krispos agreed he wished gnatios had never gotten out of his monastic cell not only did he confer legitimacy on petronas revolt but as patriarchinexile he also provided a focus for clerics who found pyrrhos strict interpretation of ecclesiastical law and custom unbearable to continue the patriarch said ticking off the errant priests transgressions on his fingers norikos of the temple of the holy thelalaios flagrantly cohabited with a woman an abuse apparently long tolerated thanks to the laxness that prevailed under gnatios the priest loutzoulos had the habit of wearing robes with silk in the weave vestments entirely too luxurious for one of his station and savianos pyrrhos voice sank in horror to a hoarse whisper savianos has espoused the balancer heresy has he krispos remembered savianos speaking out against pyrrhos nomination as patriarch he was sure pyrrhos had not forgotten either how do you know he asked wondering how vindictive pyrrhos was more than a little he suspected by his own words i shall convict him majesty pyrrhos said in his sermons he has declared that skotos darkens phos radiant glory how could this be so unless the good god and the master of evil he spat in renunciation of skotos stand equally matched in the eternal balance imperial orthodoxy preached that in the end phos was sure to vanquish skotos the eastern lands of khatrish and thatagush also worshiped phos but their priests maintained no man could know whether good or evil would triumph in the endthus their concept of the balance krispos knew the balance had its attractions even for some videssian theologians but he asked are you sure thats the only meaning you can put on what savianos said pyrrhos eyes glittered dangerously name another not for the first time krispos wished his formal education went farther than reading and writing adding and subtracting maybe it was just a fancy way of saying there is still evil in the world phos hasnt won yet you know given the sad state of sinfulness i see all around me i am but too aware of that pyrrhos shook his head no majesty i fear savianos speech cannot be interpreted so innocently when a man of that stripe admires skotos strength his remarks must have a sinister import suppose a priest who had always supported you spoke in the same way krispos said what would you do then upbraid him chastise him and expel him pyrrhos said at once evil is evil no matter from whose lips it comes may the lord with the great and good mind guard against it he drew the suncircle over his heart krispos also signed himself he studied the ecumenical patriarch he had created at last reluctantly he decided he had to believe pyrrhos the patriarch was narrow aye but within his limits just sighing krispos said very well then most holy sir act as you think best i shall your majesty i assure you these four are but the snowcovered tip of a mountain of corruption they are the ones who shine most brightly when phos sun lights their misdeeds but their glitter shall not blind me to the rest of the mountain either now wait one moment if you please krispos said hastily holding up his hand i did not name you to your office to have you spread chaos through the temples what is the function of the patriarch but to root out sin where he finds it pyrrhos said if you think some other duty comes before it then cast me down now he bowed his head to show his acceptance of that imperial prerogative krispos realized that in pyrrhos he had at last found someone more stubborn than he was seeing that he also realized he had been naive to hope the greater responsibilities of the patriarchate would temper pyrrhos pious obstinacy and finally he understood that since he could not afford to oust pyrrhos from the blue bootsno other man hastily set in place could serve as much of a counterweight to gnatioshe was stuck with him for the time being as i told you most holy sir you must act as you think best he said but i pray you remember also the what had savianos called it the principle of theological economy where the principle applies majesty rest assured that i shall pyrrhos said i must warn you though its application is less sweeping than some would claim no krispos thought pyrrhos was not a man to yield much ground he gave a sharp short nod to show the audience was over pyrrhos prostrated himselfwhatever his flaws disrespect for the imperial office was not one of themand departed as soon as he was gone krispos shouted for a jar of wine looking at a map of the empire krispos observed im just glad harvas murderers decided to withdraw after they took develtos if theyd pressed on they could have reached the sailors sea and cut the eastern provinces in half yes that would have spilled the chamber pot into the soup wouldnt it mavros said as is though youre still going to have to restore the town you know ive already begun to take care of it krispos said ive sent word out through the city guilds that the fisc will pay double the usual daily rate for potters and plasterers and tilemakers and carpenters and stonecutters and what have you willing to go to develtos for the summer from what the guildmasters say well have enough volunteers to make the place a going concern again by fall the guilds are the best way to get the people youll need mavros agreed labor in videssos the city was as minutely regulated as everything else the guildmasters reported to the eparch of the city as if they were government functionaries themselves mavros pursed his lips then went on stonecutters aye theyll need more than a few of those considering what happened to develtos wall yes krispos said somberly the reports from survivors of the attack and later witnesses told how one whole side of the fortifications had been blasted down most likely by magic afterwards harvas northern mercenaries swarmed into the stunned town and began their massacre till now i thought battle magic was supposed to be a waste of time that it didnt work well with folk all keyed up to fight i thought the same thing mavros said i talked with your friend trokoundos and a couple of other mages from what they say the spell that knocked over the wall wasnt battle magic strictly speaking harvas or whoever did it must have spirited his soldiers past the frontier and got them to develtos with no one the wiser that made the sorcery a lot easier because the garrison wasnt expecting attack and didnt get into that excited state until the stones came crashing down onto them which was too late krispos said mavros nodded krispos added the next question is how did harvas get his army over the border like that mavros had no answer neither did anyone else krispos knew trokoundos had interrogated agapetos with the same double mirror arrangement hed used on gnatios even sorcerously prodded the general had no idea how harvas men eluded his maybe magic had played a part there too but nobody could be sure krispos said by the good god i hope harvas and his murderers cant spring out of nowhere in front of videssos the city and smash through the walls here the imperial capitals walls were far stronger than those of a provincial town like develtos so much so that no foreign foe had ever taken the city nor had any videssians save by treachery harvas blackrobe though was looking like a foe of an uncommon sort now well have wizards ever on the alert here mavros said taking us by surprise wont be as easy as it was in develtos and surprise the mages say was the main reason he succeeded there yes yes krispos still fretted maybe that was because he was so new on the throne he thought with more experience he might have a better sense of just how dangerous harvas truly was all the same like any sensible man he preferred to be ready for a threat that wasnt there than to ignore one that was he said i wish petronas wouldnt have picked now to rebel if he gave up id be happy to let him keep his head harvas worries me more even after youre buying harvas off especially after im buying harvas off krispos plucked at his thick curly beard men snapped his fingers in sudden decision ill even tell petronas as much in writing if he and gnatios will come back to the monastery i wont take any measures against them he raised his voice to call for a secretary before the scribe arrived mavros asked and if he says no then he says no how am i worse off mavros considered then judiciously pursed his lips put that way i dont suppose you are when the secretary came in he set down his tablet and stylus so he could prostrate himself before krispos krispos waited impatiently till the man had got to his feet and taken up his writing tools once more he had given up on telling underlings not to bother with the proskynesis all it did was make them uneasy he was the avtokrator and the proskynesis was the way they were accustomed to showing the avtokrator their respect after he was done dictating krispos said let me hear that once more please the secretary read him his words he glanced over at mavros the sevastos nodded krispos said good enough give me a fair copy of that on parchment ill want it today the scribe bowed and hurried away krispos rose stretched all that talking has made me thirsty what do you say to a cup of wine i generally say yes and any excuse will do nicely mavros answered grinning are you telling me your poor voice is too worn and threadbare to call barsymes ill do it for you then no wait krispos said lets scandalize him and get it ourselves he knew it was a tiny rebellion against the stifling ceremony that hedged him round but even a tiny rebellion was better than none mavros rolled his eyes the foundations of the state may crumble not least because he had trouble taking things seriously himself he sympathized with his foster brothers efforts to keep some of his humanity intact chuckling like a couple of small boys sneaking out to play at night avtokrator and the sevastos tiptoed down the hall toward the larder they even stopped chuckling as they sneaked past the chamber where barsymes was directing a cleaning crew the vestiarios back was to them he did not notice them go by the cleaners needed his direction for thick dust lay over the furnishings inside the chamber and the redglazed tile that covered its floor and walls the red room was only usedindeed was only openedwhen the empress was with child the baby krispos heir if it was a boywould be born there i wonder if its mine he thought for the thousandth time for the thousandth time he told himself it did not matterand tried to make himself believe it the wine successfully gained and successfully drunk helped him shove the unanswerable question to the back of his mind once more he picked up the jar another cup he asked mavros thank you that would be lovely barsymes stalked into the larder while krispos was still pouring the eunuchs long smooth disapproving face got longer and more disapproving your majesty you have servants precisely for the purpose of serving you had he sounded angry krispos would have gotten angry in return but he only sounded sad absurdly krispos felt guilty then he was angry angry at his own feeling of guilt youd like to wipe my arse for me too wouldnt you he snarled the vestiarios said nothing did not even change his expression krispos felt his own face go hot with shame barsymes and the other chamberlains had wiped his arse for him and tended all his other needs no matter how ignoble a couple of summers before when he lay paralyzed from petronas wizardry he hung his head im sorry he mumbled many men would not have remembered barsymes said evenly i see you do can we bargain your majesty if your need to be free of us grows so pressing from time to time will you tolerate us more readily the rest of the time on account of these occasional escapes i think so krispos said then i will essay not to be aggrieved when i see you occasionally serving yourself and i hope you will remain sanguine when i and the rest of your servants perform our office bowing barsymes withdrew once the vestiarios was gone mavros said who rules here you or him i notice you lowered your voice before you asked me that krispos said laughing is it for fear hell hear mavros laughed too but soon sobered there have been vestiarioi who controlled affairs far beyond the palaces skombros for one me for another krispos reminded him i havent seen any of that from barsymes the lord with the great and good mind be praised as long as he runs the palace hes content to let me have the rest of the empire generous of him mavros emptied his cup and picked up the jar of wine im going to pour myself another can i do the same for you that way hell have nothing with which to be offended krispos held out his own cup go right ahead the imperial courier sat gratefully in front of a roaring fire outside mixed sleet and rain poured down krispos knew that meant spring was getting closer given a choice between snow and this horrible stuff he would have preferred snow instead he would get weeks of slush and glare ice and mud the courier undid his waterproof message pouch and handed krispos a rolled parchment here you are your majesty even had the fellows face not warned krispos that petronas was not about to come back to his monastery the parchment would have done the job by itself it was bound with a scarlet ribbon and sealed with scarlet wax into which had been pressed a sunburst signet it was not the imperial sealkrispos wore that on the middle finger of his right handbut it was an imperial seal he says no does he krispos asked the courier set down the goblet of hot wine laced with cinnamon from which hed been drinking aye majesty that much i can tell you i havent seen the actual message though lets see how he says no then krispos cracked the sealing wax slid the ribbon off the parchment and unrolled it he recognized petronas firm bold script at oncehis rival had responded to him in person the response sounded like petronas too petronas in an overbearing mood avtokrator of the videssians petronas son of agarenos avtokrator brother of rhaptes avtokrator uncle to anthimos avtokrator crowned without duress by the true most holy ecumenical patriarch of the videssians gnatios to the baseborn rebel tyrant and usurper krispos greetings krispos found reading easier if he did it aloud in a low voice he didnt realize the courier was listening until the man remarked i guess he wouldnt say you aye after a start like that would he doesnt seem likely krispos read on i know that advice is a good and goodly thing i have after all read the books of the learned ancients and phos holy scriptures but at the same time i reckon that this condition obtains when matters may be remedied but when the times themselves are dangerous and drive one into the worst and most terrible circumstances then i think advice is no longer so useful this is most true of advice from you impious and murderous wretch for not only did you conspire to confine me unjustly in a monastery but you also pitilessly slew my nephew the avtokrator that by the way is not so krispos put in for the couriers benefit he resumed so accursed enemy do not urge me to deliver my life into your hands once more you will not persuade me i too am a man with a sword at my belt and i will struggle against one who has sought to lay my family low for either i shall regain the imperial glory and furnish you murderer a full requital or i shall perish and gain freedom from a disgusting and unholy tyranny the couriers eyes were wide by the time krispos rolled up the parchment once more thats the fanciest nastiest no i ever heard your majesty me too krispos shook his head i didnt really think hed say yes a pity you and your comrades got drenched carrying the letters there and back again but it was worth a try oh aye majesty the courier said ive done my soldiering time fighting against makuran on the vaspurakaner frontier anything you can try to keep from having a war is worth doing yes but krispos had begun to wonder just how true that was hed certainly believed it back in his days at the farming village now though he was sure he would have to fight petronas just as petronas could not trust him he knew a victory by his former patron would only bring him to a quick end or more likely a slow one and he would have to fight a war against harvas blackrobe though he paid harvas tribute for the moment that was only buying time not solving the problem if he let a wild wolf like harvas run loose on his border more peasants who wanted nothing but peace would be slaughtered or ruined than if he fought to keep them safe he also knew the ones who were ruined and the loved ones of those slaughtered in his war would never understand that he wouldnt have himself back in the days before he wore a crown thats why the empire needs an emperor he said to himself to see farther and wider than the peasants can aye majesty phos grant that you do the courier said krispos sketched the suncircle over his heart hoping the good god would hear the fellows words the rains dragged on in spite of them krispos sent out couriers ordering his forces to assemble at videssos the city and in the westlands spies reported that petronas were also mustering troops krispos was glumly certain petronas had spies of his own he did his best to confuse them shuttling companies back and forth and using regimental standards for companies and the other way round thanks to the civil war his strength in the north and east were less than it should have been thus he breathed a long sigh of relief when iakovitzes wrote harvas has agreed to a years truce at the highest price you would suffer me to pay him by the lord with the great and good mind majesty i would sooner gallop a tenmile steeplechase with a galloping case of the piles than chaffer again with that blackrobed bandit i told him as much in so many words he laughed his laugh majesty is not a pleasant thing skotos might laugh so to greet a damned soul newcome to the ice never shall i be so glad as the day i leave his court to return to the city phos be praised that day will come soon when krispos showed mavros the letter the sevastos whistled softly weve both seen iakovitzes furious often enough but i dont think i ever heard him sound frightened before harvas has done it to him krispos said its been building all winter just one more sign we should be fighting harvas now may the ice take petronas for keeping me from what truly needs doing we settle him this year mavros said after that harvas will have his turn so he will krispos glanced outside the sky was still cloudy but held patches of blue before long we can move on petronas one thing at a time i learned on the farm if you try to do a lot of things at once you end up botching all of them mavros glanced at him mobile features sly perhaps videssos should draw its emperors from the peasantry more often where would a man like anthimos have learned such a simple lesson a man like anthimos wouldnt have learned it on the farm either hed have been one of the kindand there are plenty of them the good god knowswho go hungry at the end of winter because they havent raised enough to carry them through till spring or because they were careless with their storage pits and let half their grain spoil youre probably right mavros said ive always thought krispos never found out what his foster brother had always thought barsymes came into the chamber and said forgive me your majesty but her majesty the empress must see you at once ill come as soon as im done with mavros here krispos said this is not a matter that will wait on your convenience your majesty barsymes said ive sent for the midwife the krispos found his mouth hanging open he made himself shut it then tried again to speak the midwife the babys not due for another month so her majesty said barsymes smile was always wintry but now like the weather it held a promise of spring the baby i fear is not listening mavros clapped krispos on the shoulder may phos grant you a son yes krispos said absently how was he supposed to stick to his onethingatatime dictum if events kept getting ahead of him with some effort he figured out the one thing he was supposed to do next he turned to barsymes take me to dara come with me the vestiarios said they walked down the hall together as they neared the imperial bedchamber krispos saw a serving maid mopping up a puddle the roof stayed sound all winter he said puzzled and its not even raining now nor is that rain barsymes answered her majestys bag of waters broke there krispos remembered births back in his old village no wonder you called the midwife exactly so your majesty fear notthekla has been at her trade more than twenty years she is the finest midwife in the city were it otherwise i should have sent for someone else i assure you barsymes stopped outside the bedchamber door i will leave you here until i come to take her majesty to the red room krispos went in he expected to find dara lying in bed but instead she was pacing up and down i thought i would wait longer she said id felt my womb tightening more often than usual the last couple of days but i didnt think anything of it then she laughed it was very strangeit was as if i was making water and couldnt stop myself and after i was done dripping now i know why they call them labor pains no sooner had she finished speaking than another one took her her face grew closed secret and intent her hands found krispos arms and squeezed hard when the pain passed she said i can tolerate that but my labors just begun im afraid krispos how much worse will they get krispos helplessly spread his hands feeling foolish and useless and male he had no idea how bad labor pains gothow could he he remembered village women shrieking as they gave birth but that did not seem likely to reassure dara he said women are meant to bear children it wont be worse than you can take what do you know she snapped youre a man since he had just told himself the same thing he shut up nothing he said was apt to be right so he leaned over her swollen belly to hug her that was a better idea they waited together after a while a pain gripped dara she clenched her teeth and rode it out once it had passed though she lay down she twisted back and forth trying to find a comfortable position with her abdomen enormous and labor upon her there were no comfortable positions to find another pain washed over her and another and another krispos wished he could do something more useful than hold her hand and make reassuring noises but he had no idea what that something might be some time laterhe had no idea how longsomeone tapped on the bedchamber door krispos got up from the bed to open it barsymes stood there with a handsome middleaged woman whose short hair was so black krispos was sure it was dyed she wore a plain cheap linen dress the vestiarios said your majesty the midwife thekla thekla had a nononsense air about her that krispos liked she did not waste time with a proskynesis but pushed past krispos to dara and how are we today dearie she asked i dont know about you but im bloody awful dara said unoffended thekla laughed your waters broke right are the pangs coming closer together yes and theyre getting harder too theyre supposed to dearie thats how the baby comes out after all thekla said just then daras face twisted as another pain began thekla reached under daras robes to feel how tight her belly grew nodding in satisfaction she told dara youre doing fine then she turned to barsymes i dont want her walking to the red room shes too far along for that go fetch the litter aye mistress barsymes hurried away krispos judged theklas skill by the unquestioning obedience she won from the vestiarios barsymes and a couple of the other chamberlains soon returned put the edge of the litter right next to the side of the bed thekla directed now dearie you just slide over go easy go easythere thats fine all right lads off we go with her the eunuchs faces red but step steady carried the empress out the door down the hall and to the red room krispos followed when he got to the entrance of the red room thekla said firmly you wait outside if you please your majesty i want to be with her krispos said you wait outside your majesty thekla repeated this time the midwifes words carried the snap of command krispos said i am the avtokrator i give orders here why should i stay out thekla set hands on hips because your most imperial majesty sir you are a pesttaken man thats why krispos stared at her no one had spoken to him like that since he wore the crown and not for a while before then either in slightly more reasonable tones thekla went on and because its womans work your majesty look before this is done your wife is liable to shit and piss and puke maybe all three at once shes sure to scream likely a lot and ill have my hands deeper inside her than you ever dreamed of being do you really want to watch it is not customary your majesty barsymes said for him that settled the matter krispos yielded phos be with you he called to dara who was carefully wiggling from the litter to the bed in the red room she started to smile at him but a pain caught her and turned the expression to a grimace here your majesty come with me barsymes said soothingly come sit down and wait ill bring you some wine it will help ease your worry krispos let himself be led away as hed told mavros he ruled the empire but his servants ruled the palaces he drank the wine barsymes set before him without noticing if it was white or red tart or sweet then he simply sat barsymes brought in a game board and pieces would your majesty care to play he asked it might help pass the time no not now thank you krispos laugh was ragged besides barsymes youd have a hard time losing gracefully today for my mind wouldnt be on the board if you notice how i lose majesty then i dont do so gracefully enough the vestiarios said he seemed chagrined krispos noted as if he thought he had failed in the quest for perfect service esteemed sir just let me be if you would krispos said barsymes bowed and withdrew time crawled by krispos watched a sunbeam slide across the floor and start to climb the far wall a servant came in to light lamps krispos only noticed him after he was gone he was not close to the red room barsymes clever as usual had made sure of that moreover the door to the birthing chamber was closed whatever cries and groans dara made for a long time he did not hear them but as the lamps flickering light grew brighter than the failing day she shrieked with such anguish that he sprang from his chair and dashed down the hall thekla was indeed a veteran of her trade she knew who pounded on that door and why nothing to worry about your majesty she called i was just turning the babys head a little so itll pass through more easily the babe has dark hair a lot of it wont be too much longer now he stood outside the door clenching and unclenching his fists against petronas or harvas he could have charged home at the head of his troops here he could do nothingas thekla had said this was womans work waiting seemed harder to bear than battle dara made a noise he had never heard before part grunt part squeal a sound of ultimate effort again he heard thekla say hold your breath as long as you can dearieit helps the push that sound burst from dara once more again thekla urged yes thats the way krispos heard dara gasp strainand then exclaim in excitement your majesty you have a son thekla said loudly a moment later the high thin furious cry of a newborn baby filled krispos ears he tried the door it was locked were not ready for you yet your majesty thekla said annoyance and amusement mixed in her voice she still has the afterbirth to pass youll see the lad soon enough i promise what will you call him phostis krispos answered he heard dara say the name inside the red room too sudden tears stung his eyes he wished his father had lived to see a grandson named for him a few minutes later thekla opened the door the lamplight showed her dress splashed with bloodno wonder she hadnt worn anything fancy krispos realized then thekla held out to him his newborn son and all such thoughts vanished from his mind the baby was swaddled in a blanket of soft lambs wool five fingers on each hand five toes on each foot thekla said a little on the scrawny side maybe but thats to be expected when a child comes early the midwife fell silent when she saw krispos wasnt listening he peered down at phostis red wrinkled little face part of that was the awe any new father feels on holding his firstborn for the first time part though was something else something colder he searched those tiny newformed features trying to see in them either anthimos smooth smiling good looks or his own rather craggier appearance so far as he could tell the baby looked like neither of its possible fathers phostis eyes seemed shaped like daras with the inner corner of each lid folding down very slightly when he said that out loud thekla laughed no law says a boy child cant favor his mother your majesty she said speaking of which shell want another look at the baby too i expect and maybe a first try at nursing him she stepped aside to let krispos go into the red room the chamber stank thekla had meant her warning krispos did not care how are you he asked dara who was still lying on the bed on which she had given birth she looked pale and utterly exhausted her hair soaked with sweat hung limply but she managed a worn smile and held out her hands for phostis krispos gave her the baby he doesnt weigh anything dara exclaimed krispos nodded his arms hardly noticed phostis was gone he saw dara giving phostis the same careful scrutiny he had no doubt for the same reason he said i think he looks like you daras eyes went wary as she glanced at him he smiled back though he wondered if he would ever be sure who phostis father really was as he had so often before he told himself it did not matter as he had so often before he almost made himself believe it hold him again will you dara said phostis squalled at being passed back and forth krispos clumsily rocked him in his arms dara unfastened her dress and tugged it off one shoulder to bare a breast ill take him now lets see if this will make him happy phostis rooted found the nipple and began to suck he likes them krispos said i dont blame himi like them too dara snorted then she said ask the kitchen to send me supper would you krispos im hungry now though i wouldnt have believed it if youd told me i would be you havent eaten for quite a while krispos said as he hurried off to do what dara had asked he paused and thanked thekla my pleasure your majesty the midwife said phos grant that the empress and your son do well no reason she shouldnt and hes not too small to thrive id say chamberlains and maidservants congratulated krispos on having a son as he walked to the kitchens he wondered how they knew a baby girls cry would have sounded the same as phostis but palace servants had their own kind of magic the moment krispos walked through the door a grinning cook pressed into his hands a tray with a jar of wine some bread and a covered silver dish on it for your lady the fellow said krispos carried the tray to dara himself barsymes saw him and said not a word when he got back to the red room he helped her sit up and poured wine for her he poured for himself as well the cook had thoughtfully set two goblets on the tray he raised his to phostis he said to our son dara agreed that was not quite what krispos had said but he drank her toast dara attacked her mealit proved to be roast kid in fermented fish sauce and garlicas if shed had nothing for days krispos watched her eat and watched phostis who was dozing on the bed next to her turn his head from side to side thekla had been right for a baby phostis did have a lot of hair krispos stood up and reached out a gentle hand to touch it it was soft and fine as goose down phostis squirmed krispos took his hand away dara sopped up the last of the sauce with the heel of her bread she finished her wine and set the goblet down with a sigh that helped she said a bath and about a month of sleep and ill benot good as new but close enough she sighed again thekla says its better for a baby to nurse with his own mother the first few days so i wont get that sleep right away afterward though a wet nurse can get up with him when he howls ive been thinking krispos said in an abstracted tone that showed hed hardly heard what she said what about she asked cautiously without seeming to notice what she did she moved closer to phostis as if to protect him i think we ought to declare the baby coavtokrator even before i go out on campaign against petronas he answered it will let the whole empire know i intend my family to hold this throne for a long time daras face lit up yes lets do that she said at once even more gently than krispos had she touched phostis head murmuring sleep well my tiny emperor then after a little while she added i was afraid you were thinking something else krispos shook his head even since hed known dara was pregnant hed also known hed have to act as if her child was surely his now that the boy was born he would not stint if anything he would make a show of favoring him to make sure no one else had any doubtsor at least any public doubtsabout phostis paternity what he did was everyones affair what he thought was his own iv barsymes carried a mediumsize silver box and a folded sheet of parchment in to krispos the vestiarios looked puzzled and a bit worried the halogai just found this on the steps your majesty as they do not read they asked me what the parchment said i saw it had your name on the outside so i brought it here thank you krispos said then he frowned what do you mean the halogai found it on the steps who brought it there i dont know your majesty neither do the guardsmen from what they say it wasnt there one moment and was the next magic krispos said he stared suspiciously at the box after almost killing him once by sorcery did petronas think he would fall into the trap again if so he would be disappointed send someone for trokoundos barsymes until he tells me its all right that box will stay closed no doubt you are wise your majesty i shall send someone directly krispos even wondered if unfolding the parchment was safe he grew impatient waiting for trokoundos to come though and opened it up nothing lethal or sorcerousnothing at allhappened when he did the note inscribed within was written in a crabbed antique hand though it was not signed it could only have come from harvas blackrobe it read i accept your purchase of a years peace with gold your envoy has left my court and wends his way homeward i believe you will find him much improved on account of that which is enclosed herewith when trokoundos arrived krispos showed him the parchment and explained his own suspicions the mage nodded quite right your majesty if that box hides sorcery be sure i shall bring it to light he set to work with powders and jars of brightcolored liquids after a few minutes one of the liquids suddenly went from blue to red trokoundos grunted ha there is magic here your majesty he made quick passes all the while chanting under his breath krispos watched the red liquid turn blue again he asked does that mean the spell is gone it should your majesty but trokoundos did not sound sure he explained the only spell i detected was one of preservation such as some fancy fruiterers use to let rich clients have their wares fresh but out of season forgive me but i cannot imagine how such a spell could be harmful in any way whether it was or not though i have dispersed it then nothing should happen if i open the box krispos persisted nothing should trokoundos took out more sorcerous apparatus if anything does i am prepared to meet it good krispos flipped the catch that held the box shut as he did so trokoundos stepped up to protect him from whatever was inside he opened the lid inside the box was a curiously curved piece of meat bloody at the thick end trokoundos brows came together at the anticlimax what is that he demanded krispos needed a minute to recognize it too but he had butchered a good many cows and sheep and goats in his farming days this was too small to have come from a cow but a sheep had one much like it its a tongue he said then horror ran through him as he remembered the note that had accompanied this gift itsiakovitzes tongue he choked out he slammed the lid shut turned his head and vomited on the fine mosaic floor near the south end of videssos the citys wall was a broad field where soldiers often exercised several regiments of horsemen lancers and archers both were drawn up in formation there their banners rippled in the spring breeze they saluted as krispos and agapetos rode past in review krispos was saying draw out whatever garrison troops you think the towns can spare if theyre men whod be any good in the field the kubrati nomads always liked to play the raidandrun game now itll be our turn if harvas thinks he can sell us peace at the price of maiming an ambassador well teach him different the way i see it hes stolen a hundred pounds of gold well take it back from his land aye majesty agapetos said but what happens if one of my raiding bands comes up against too many men for them to handle then pull back krispos told him your job is to keep harvas and his cutthroats too busy in their own country to come down into the empire i wont be able to send you much support not until petronas is beaten after that the whole army will move to the northern frontier but until then youre on your own aye majesty i shall do as you require agapetos saluted then raised his right arm high trumpets brayed brassily pipes skirled and drums thuttered the cavalry regiments rolled forward krispos knew they were good troops agapetos was a good soldier too videssian generals made a study of the art of war and learned scores of tricks for gaining the most with the smallest expenditure of manpower then why am i worried krispos asked himself maybe it was because the competent serious videssian soldiers had not faced warriors like harvas halogai before maybe it was because competent serious agapetos had already let harvas trick him once and maybe krispos thought its for no reason at all no matter how well he acts the part harvas isnt skotos come again he can be beaten in the end even skotos will be beaten then why am i worried he asked again angry at himself he yanked progress head around sharply enough to draw a reproachful snort from the horse he rode back to the city at a fast trot he knew he should already have been in the westlands moving against petronas but for harvas latest outrage that campaign would have begun a fortnight before krispos rode not to the palaces but to the sorcerers collegium north of the palace quarter iakovitzes had reached the capital the night before more dead than alive the empires most skillful healerpriests taught at the collegium passing on their art to each new generation in turn the desperately ill came there too in hope of cures no one less skilled could give iakovitzes fell into the latter group how is he krispos demanded of damasos the head of the healing faculty the skin under damasos eyes was smudged with fatigue part of the price a healerpriest paid for his gift majesty he began and then paused to yawn your pardon majesty i think he may yet recover majesty we are at last to the point where we may attempt the healing of the wound itself hes been here most of a day now krispos said why havent you done anything before this we have done a great deal majesty damasos said stiffly he was of middle height and middle years his pate tan his untrimmed beard going gray he continued weve had to do a great deal much of it in conjunction with sorcerers who are not healers for added to this mutilation was something i have never before encountered and pray to the good god i never see again a spell specifically intended to thwart healing first discovering and then defeating that spell has occupied us up to this time a spell against healing krispos felt queasy the very idea was an abomination worse than the torture harvas had inflicted on iakovitzes who could conceive such a wicked thing for too long we did not majesty damasos said even after we realized what we faced we needed no small space of time to overcome the wizardry whoever set it on the wound bound it with the power of the victims blood making it doubly hard to banish it was in effect a deliberate perversion of my own ritual tired though he was damasos set his jaw in outrage krispos asked you are ready to heal now you say at the healerpriests nod he went on take me to iakovitzes i would see him healed as best he may be he also wanted iakovitzes to see him to know how guilty he felt for sending him on an embassy about which hed had misgivings he gasped when damasos ushered him into iakovitzes chamber the little noble usually so plump and dapper was thin ragged and filthy krispos coughed at the foul odor that rose from him not just that of a body long unwashed but worse a ripe stench like rotting meat yellow pus dribbled from the corner of his mouth his eyes were wide and blank with fever those blank eyes slid past krispos without recognizing him a healerpriest sat beside the bed where iakovitzes thrashed four beefy attendants stood close by damasos spoke to the priest are you ready nazares aye holy sir nazares glance rested on krispos for a moment when krispos showed no sign of leaving the healerpriest shrugged and nodded to the attendants commence lads two of the men seized iakovitzes arms a third grabbed his head to pull down his lower jaw then wedged a stout stick padded with cloth between his teeth iakovitzes had not seemed aware of his surroundings till then but the instant the stick touched his lips he began to struggle like a man possessed letting out bloodcurdling shrieks and a string of gurgles that tried to be words poor fellow damasos whispered to krispos in his delirium he must think were about to cut him again krispos nails bit into his palms in spite of the battle iakovitzes put up the fourth attendant forced a metal gag into his mouth of the sort horse doctors used to hold an animals jaws apart so they could trim its teeth when the gag was in place nazares reached into iakovitzes forcibly opened mouth seeing krispos still watching the healerpriest explained for proper healing i must touch the wound itself krispos started to answer then saw nazares was dropping into a healers trance we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor the priest repeated the creed again and again using it to distract his conscious mind and to concentrate his will solely on the task of healing before him as always krispos felt awed to watch a healerpriest at work he could tell just when nazares began to heal by the way the man suddenly went rigid iakovitzes continued to moan and kick but he could have burst into flames without turning nazares from his purpose almost as if lightning were in the air krispos felt the current of healing as it passed from nazares to iakovitzes then all at once iakovitzes quit struggling krispos took a step forward in alarm afraid his onetime patrons heart had given out but iakovitzes continued to breathe and nazares continued to heal had something been wrong the healerpriest surely would have sensed it at last nazares withdrew his hand he wiped pussmeared fingers on his robe the attendant removed the gag from iakovitzes mouth krispos saw the noble was in full possession of his senses again now when he moved in the grip of the two men who held him they let him go he bowed low to the healerpriest then made a series of yammering noises after a moment he realized no one could understand him he signed for something to write with one of the attendants brought him a waxed wooden tablet and stylus he scribbled and handed the tablet to nazares what are you all standing around for nazares read his voice slow and dragging from the crushing fatigue that followed healing take me to the bathsi stink like a latrine i could use some food too about a years worth krispos could not help smilingiakovitzes might never speak an intelligible word again but he still sounded like himself then iakovitzes wrote some more and handed the tablet to him next time send someone else sobered he nodded saying i know gold and honor will never give you back what you have lost iakovitzes but what they can give you will have id better i earned them iakovitzes wrote he felt inside his mouth with his fingers poking and prodding then let out a soft grunt of wonder and bowed again to nazares he scrawled again then handed the healerpriest the tablet holy sir the wound feels as if it happened years ago only the memory is yet green nazares read behind the brassy front iakovitzes habitually assumed krispos saw the terror that still lived in his eyes an attendant touched iakovitzes on the arm he flinched then scowled at himself and dipped his head in apology to the man excellent sir i just wanted to tell you i would take you to a bathhouse now if you like the attendant said theres one close by the sorcerers collegium here iakovitzes tried to speak scowled again and nodded before he left with the attendant though krispos said a moment iakovitzes please i want to ask you something iakovitzes paused krispos went on by the messages you sent me you and harvas traded barbs all winter long what did you finally say that made him dothatto you the noble flinched again this time from his own thoughts but he bent over the tablet and wrote out his reply he gave it to krispos when he was done i didnt even intend to insult him worse luck wed settled on a price for the years truce and were swearing oaths to secure it harvas would not swear by the spirits kubratistyle nor would he take oath by the haloga gods of his followers swear by phos then i told hima truce is no truce without oaths as any child knows better i had told him to go swive his mother i think in a voice like thunder he cried out that name shall never be in my mouth again nor in yours either and then the writing stopped there but krispos knew what had happened then he sketched the sunsign over his heart iakovitzes did the same krispos promised well avenge you avenge this ive just sent out a force under agapetos to harry harvas land when im done with petronas harvas will face the whole army again iakovitzes tried to reply with spoken words again he had to stop in frustration he nodded instead held up one finger while he pointed to the west then two while he pointed northeastward he nodded again to show he approved of krispos course krispos was glad of that while iakovitzes had helped him form his priorities the winter before he could hardly have blamed the noble for changing his mind after what had befallen him that he hadnt helped convince krispos he was on the right course iakovitzes turned to the attendant and mimed scrubbing himself the man led him out of the chamber i am in your debt krispos said to nazares nonsense the healerpriest waved his words away i praise the good god that i was able to end iakovitzes agony i only regret his injury is such that it will continue to trouble him greatly despite being healed and the charm set on the wound to keep from healing it that was most wicked your majesty i know krispos opened the waxed tablet and read again the words that had cost iakovitzes his tongue no man unwilling to say phos name or even to hear it was likely to be good if only harvas were as inept as he was evil krispos thought and if only petronas would disappear and if only pyrrhos would grow mild and if only i could be certain im phostis father and if only i could rule by thinking if only even in early spring the coastal lowlands were hot and sticky the roads were still moist enough though that armies on the march kicked up only a little dustas good a reason as any for campaigning in the spring krispos thought as he trotted along on progress toward the eriza river the army in whose midst he traveled was the biggest he had ever seen more than ten thousand men had sarkis captured or killed petronas over the winter this new round of civil war would not have been needed by keeping anthimos uncle from gaining ground though the vaspurakaner soldier had managed the next best thing hed convinced the generals of the local provinces that krispos was the better bet those generals and their troopers rode with the force from videssos the city now krispos saw the inevitable host of farmers busy in their fields on either side of the road though the force with which he traveled was far larger than the one that had fought petronas the previous fall fewer farmers fled he took that for a good sign they know well keep good order he remarked to trokoundos who rode nearby peasants shouldnt fear soldiers this far before harvest they have little to steal anyhow trokoundos said they know that too and take courage from it youve been drinking sour wine this morning krispos said a trifle startled such cynicism was worthy of iakovitzes maybe so trokoundos said we also have supplies for the army well arranged this being territory that stayed loyal to you well see how the men behave when we enter country that had been under petronas hand oh aye well do a bit of plundering if our supply train has trouble said mammianos one of the provincial generals who had at last cast his lot with krispos he was in his midfifties and quite round but a fine horseman for all that but well do a bit of fighting too which makes up for a lot krispos started to say nothing could make plundering his own people right he kept the words to himself if folk farther westward worked for his rival and against him they and their fields became fair targets for his soldierspetronas men he was sure would not hold back if they reached territory he controlled either way the empire and the fisc would suffer when he did speak aloud he said civil war as if it were a curse aye the times are hard mammianos agreed theres but one thing worse than fighting a civil war and thats losing it krispos nodded two days later he and his army forded the erizathe ruined bridges were yet to be rebuilt this time the crossing was unopposed though krispos found himself looking back over his shoulder lest some imperial courier come riding up with word of a new disaster but no couriers appeared that in itself buoyed krispos spirits he began seeing traces of the fighting sarkis had done the previous winter wrecked villages fields standing idle and unplanted the shells of burnedout buildings peasants on this side of the eriza those who were left fled his soldiers as if they were so many demons the land began to rise toward the westlands rugged central plateau the rich deep black earth of the lowlands grew thinner dustier grayer because of the early season the countryside was still bright green but krispos knew the sun would bake it dry long before summer was done in the lowlands they sometimes raised two crops a year on the central plateau they were lucky to get one broad stretches of land were better suited to grazing cattle than growing crops krispos advance stopped being a walkover about halfway between the eriza and the town of resaina he had started to wonder if petronas would ever stand and right then all at once the scouts who rode ahead of his army came pelting back toward the main body of men he watched them turn to shoot arrows back over their shoulders then saw other horsemen pursuing them those must be petronas men he exclaimed pointing only by the way they attacked his own cavalry could he be sure their gear was identical to what his own forces used one more hazard of civil war that hadnt occurred to him he thought uneasily aye by the good god those are the rebels mammianos said a whole bloody great lot of them too he turned his head to shout orders to the musicians whose calls set the army in motion as martial music blared out and units hurried from column to line of battle mammianos sped them into place with bellowed commands faster there the ice take you heres the fight weve been waiting for the chance to smash the stinking traitor once for all come on deploy deploy deploy the fat general showed more energy in a couple of minutes than he had used all through the campaign thus far so much more that krispos stared at him in surprise the curses he kept calling down on petronas head and the spleen with which he hurled them forth were also something new when mammianos paused to draw breath krispos said general forgive me for ever having doubted your loyalty mammianos eyes were shrewd in your boots majesty id doubt my own shadow if it wasnt in front of me may i speak frankly i hope you will aye you seem to mammianos said judiciously i know i didnt lend you much aid last fall no but you didnt aid petronas either for which im grateful as well you might be truth to tell i was sitting tight i wont apologize for it either if youd stolen the throne without deserving it petronas wouldve made quick hash of you likely i would have joined him afterward too the empire doesnt need a weakling avtokrator now but since you did well enough against him and since most of the decrees youve issued have made sense mammianos clapped his hands together in savage glee ill help you nail the whoresons hide to the wall instead put me on the shelf will he on the shelf krispos echoed perplexed but youre the general of a province that usually needs a general about as much as a lizard needs a bathtub mammianos interrupted i was with petronas when he invaded vaspurakan a couple of years ago i told him to his face he didnt have the wherewithal to push the makuraners out i told him the same back at the palaces krispos said whatd he do to you mammianos asked he tried to kill me krispos shivered remembering petronas sorcerous assault he almost did too mammianos grunted he told me that if i didnt want to fight hed send me someplace where i wouldnt have to which is how i got stuck in the lowlands where nothing ever happens except now it has and i get a chance to pay the bastard back he shook his fist at petronas horsemen youll get yours you lice krispos watched the oncoming soldiers too his military eye was still unpracticed but he thought his rivals army was about the size of his own his lips skinned back from his teeth that was only likely to make the battle more expensive but less decisive a blue banner with gold sunburst flew above the center of petronas force a twin to the one a standardbearer carried not far from krispos he shook his head this sort of fight was worse than confusing it was as if he battled himself in a mirror a great shout rose from his men krispos krispos avtokrator petronas men shouted back crying out the name of their commander krispos drew his sword he was no skilled soldier but had learned that did not always matter in the confusion of the battlefield a company of halogai the sharpened edges of their axe blades glittering in the spring sunshine formed up in front of him to try to make sure he did no fighting in any case hed given up arguing with them he knew he might see action in spite of them not even a captain of guardsmen could always outguess combat arrows flew in beautiful deadly arcs men fell from their saddles some thrashed and tried to rise others lay still horses fell too crushing riders beneath them animals and men screamed together more horses wounded but not felled ran wild carrying the soldiers on them out of the fight and injecting chaos into their comrades neat ranks the two lines closed with each other now here and there men thrust with light lances and slashed with sabers rather than shooting arrows at one another the din of shouts and shrieks drumming hooves and clashing metal was deafening peering this way and that krispos could see no great advantage for either side he looked across the line toward that other imperial banner with a small shock he recognized petronas partly by the gilded armor and red boots his rival also wore more by the arrogant ease with which anthimos uncle sat his horse petronas saw him too though they were a couple of hundred yards apart krispos felt their eyes lock petronas swung his sword down straight at krispos he and the men around him spurred their mounts forward krispos dug his roweled heels into progress flanks the big bay gelding squealed in pain and fury and bounded ahead the halogai though were waiting for krispos one big man after another grabbed at progress reins at his bridle at the rest of his trappings let me through curse you krispos raged no majesty no the northerners yelled back we will settle the rebel for you petronas and his companions were very close now he had no haloga guards but the men who rode with him had to be his closest retainers the bravest and most loyal of his host sabers upraised and gleaming lances poised and ready they crashed into the ranks of the imperial bodyguards for all the tales he had heard krispos had never actually seen the halogai fight before their first couple of ranks simply went down bowled over by their foes horses or speared before they were close enough to swing their axes but petronas men fell too their chain mail might have been linen for all it did to keep those great axes from their flesh their horses which wore no armor suffered worse the axes abbatoir workers used to slaughter beeves were shorter lighter and less keen than the ones in the northerners strong hands one wellplaced blow dropped any horse in its tracks another usually sufficed for its rider a barricade of flesh some dead some writhing quickly formed between krispos men and petronas the halogai hacked over it petronas mounted men kept trying to bull their way through the ranks of the guardsmen thinned krispos found himself ever closer to the fighting front now the halogai battling for survival themselves could not keep him away and there was petronas red smeared his saber no one had told him he was too precious to risk krispos spurred progress toward him with warriors instinct petronas head whipped round he snarled at krispos blocked his cut and returned one that clattered off krispos helmet they cursed each other the same words in both their mouths thief bandit bastard robber whoreson more halogai still stood than petronas companions shouting krispos name they surged toward the rebel petronas was too old a soldier to stay and be slaughtered along with those of his guards who yet lived he pulled back pausing only to shake his fist one last time at krispos krispos answered with a twofingered gesture hed learned on the streets of videssos the city the center had held krispos looked round to see how the rest of the battle was doing it still hung in the balance his own line sagged a little on the left petronas on the right neither commander had enough troops to pull some out of line and exploit his small advantage without the risk of giving his foe a bigger one and so men hacked and thrust and hit and swore and bled all to keep matters exactly as they had been before the battle started that tore at krispos to his way of thinking if war had any purpose whatsoever it was to make change quick and decisive such suffering with nothing to show for it seemed a cruel waste but when he said as much to mammianos the general shook his head petronas has to go through you before he can move on the capital a drawn fight gains him nothing this is the first real test of fighting skill and loyalty for your men a draw for you is near as good as a win because you show the empire you match him in those things given that and given that you hold videssos the city i like your chances pretty well reluctantly krispos nodded mammianos cool good sense was something he tried to cultivate in himself applying it to this wholesale production of human agony before him though took more selfpossession than he could easily find he started to tell that to mammianos but mammianos was not listening like a farmer who scents a change in the wind at harvesttime and fears for his crop the general peered to the left somethings happened there he said certainty in his voice krispos also stared leftward he needed longer than mammianos to recognize a new clumping of men at the wing to hear the new shouts of alarm and fury and a moment later triumph the sweat that dripped from the end of his nose suddenly went cold someones turned traitor aye mammianos packed a world of meaning into a single word he bellowed for a courier and started a series of frantic orders to plug the gap then he broke off and looked again as if against his will a grin of disbelief stretched itself over his fat face by the good god he said softly its one of theirs going over to us since he felt it himself krispos understood mammianos surprise hed feared the reliability of his own troops not petronas but sure enough a sizable sectionmore than a company perhaps as much as a regimentof petronas army was now shouting krispos and the defectors did more than shout they turned on the men to their immediate right the men who held the rightmost position in petronas line beset by them as well as by krispos own supporters the flank guards broke and fled in wild confusion mammianos amazement did not paralyze him for long though hed done nothing to force the break in petronas line he knew how to exploit it once it was there he sent the left wing of krispos army around petronas shattered right seeking to roll up the whole rebel army but petronas also knew his business he did not try to salvage a battle already lost instead he dropped a thin line back from the stump of his armys broken right wing preventing krispos men from surrounding too many more of his own his forces gave ground all along their line now but nowhere except on the far right did they yield to panic they were beaten but remained an army breaking off combat a little at a time they retreated west toward resaina krispos wanted to press the pursuit hard but still did not feel sure enough of himself as battlefield commander to override mammianos who kept the army under tight control the bulk of petronas troops escaped to the camp they had occupied before they came out to fight leaving krispos men in possession of the field healerpriests went from man to wounded man first at a run then at a walk and finally at a drunken shamble as the exhaustion of their trade took its toll on them more mundane leeches men who worked without the aid of magic saw to soldiers with minor wounds here sewing up a cut there splashing an astringent lotion onto flesh lacerated when chain mail was driven through padding and leather undertunic alike and krispos surrounded not only by the surviving halogai of the imperial guard but also by most of sarkis cavalry regiment approached the troopers whose defection had cost petronas the fight he and all his men stayed ready for anything petronas was devious enough to throw away a battle to set up an assassination the leader of the units that had changed sides saw krispos coming he rode toward him krispos had the odd feeling hed seen the fellow before though he was sure he had not the middleage officer plainly a noble was short and slim with a narrow face a thin arched nose and a neat beard the color of his iron helmet he set his right fist over his heart in salute to krispos your majesty he said his voice was a resonant tenor my thanks for your aid there excellent sir krispos said he wondered how big a reward the officer would want for it i fear i dont know your name i am rhisoulphos the fellow said as if krispos ought to know who rhisoulphos was after a moment he did youre daras father he blurted no wonder the man looked familiar your daughter takes after you excellent sir so ive been told rhisoulphos let out a short bark of laughter i daresay she wears the face better than i do though mammianos studied daras father then said what was the avtokrators kinsman by marriage doing in the ranks of the avtokrators foes suspicion made his tone harsh krispos leaned forward in his saddle to hear how rhisoulphos would reply the noble dipped his head first to mammianos then to krispos please recall that until anthimos walked the bridge between light and ice i was also petronas kinsman by marriage and after anthimos did die rhisoulphos looked krispos full in the face i was not sure what sort of arrangement you had with my daughter your majesty sometimes krispos also wondered what sort of arrangement he had with dara he said you have a grandson who will be emperor excellent sir that remained true no matter who phostis father was he thought he felt like giving his head a wry shake but was too well schooled to reveal himself so in front of rhisoulphos he saw he had said the right thing rhisoulphos eyes so like daras with their slightly folded inner lids softened his fatherinlaw said so i heard and it set me thinking what would that boy be if petronas won the throne the only answer i saw was an obstacle and a danger to him i showed petronas none of my thoughts of course i pledged him my loyalty again and again loudly and rather stupidly a nice touch mammianos said his eyes slid toward krispos krispos read them without difficulty if rhisoulphos could befool petronas he was a man who needed watching krispos had already worked that out for himself now though he could only acknowledge rhisoulphos aid our first meeting was well timed excellent sir he said after petronas is beaten i will show you all the honor the avtokrators fatherinlaw deserves rhisoulphos bowed in the saddle i will do my best to earn that honor on the field your majesty i know my soldiers will support meand you im sure they will krispos said resolving to use rhisoulphos men but not to trust them with any truly vital task until petronas was no longer a threat now perhaps you will join my other advisors as we plan how to take advantage of what weve won with your help i am at your service your majesty rhisoulphos slid down from his horse and walked over to the imperial tent seeing that krispos did not object the halogai in front of the entrance bowed and let him pass krispos also dismounted grunting and wheezing with effort so did mammianos along with rhisoulphos sarkis and trokoundos the mage waited inside the tent for krispos they rose and bowed when he came in a fine fight your majesty sarkis said enthusiastically one more like it and well smash this rebellion to bloody bits the rest of the soldiers loudly agreed even trokoundos nodded i dont want another battle not if i can help it krispos said the other men in the tent stared at him he continued if i can i want to make petronas give up without more fighting everyone who falls in the civil war on my side or his could have fought for me against harvas the fewer who fall then the better admirable your majesty mammianos rumbled how do you propose to bring it off his expression said he did not think krispos could krispos spoke for several minutes by the time he was done he saw rhisoulphos and sarkis running absentminded fingers through their beards as they thought finally rhisoulphos said it might work at that so it might sarkis said he grinned at krispos i wasnt wrong your majestyyou are a lively man to serve under we have a saying in vaspurakan about your kindsneaky as a prince out to sleep with another mans princess everyone in the tent laughed i have a princess of my own thank you krispos said which won him an approving glance from rhisoulphos his own mirth soon faded though he remembered the days when dara had not been his and how the two of them had both done some sneaking to be able to sleep with each other sarkis vaspurakaner saying held teeth the officer did not know about mammianos yawn almost split his head in two lets get on with it he said the emperors scheme has to move tonight if it moves at all and afterward i aim to sleep if the scheme doesnt come offmaybe even if it doeswell have more fighting in the morning and i for one am not so young as i used to be i need rests between rounds in battle as in other things sad but true said rhisoulphos who was within a few years of the fat generals age he yawned too less cavernously go get some of your scouts sarkis krispos said theyre the proper men for the plan sarkis saluted and hurried away along with the rest of his companions krispos stepped outside the tent to await his return a couple of halogai stayed almost within arms length of him their axes at the ready their eyes never leaving rhisoulphos he must have known they were watching him and why but gave no sign krispos admired his sangfroid a few minutes later sarkis returned with fifteen or twenty soldiers all young and unmarried as you asked he told krispos they dont care if they live or die the scouts thought that was very funny their teeth gleamed whitely in their dirty faces as they chuckled krispos realized that what sarkis had said was literally true for most of them they did not believe in the possibility of their own deaths not down deep had he been so foolish himself ten or twelve years before he probably had heres what i want you to do he said and the scouts drew closer to listen i want you to get into petronas camp tonight when everything there is still in disorder i dont care whether you pretend to be his soldiers or you take off your armor and make as if youre farmers from around here whatever you do you need to get among his men i dont order this of you anyone who doesnt care to risk it may leave now no one left what do we do once were in there majesty one of the scouts asked the light from the campfires played up the glitter of excitement in his eyes to him it was all a game krispos thought he breathed a prayer to phos that the youngster would come through safe heres what he answered remind petronas soldiers that i offered him amnesty and tell them they can have it too for the asking if they dont wait too long tell them ill give them three days after that well attack again and well treat any we capture as enemies the young men looked at one another sneaky as a prince out to sleep with another mans princess one of them said with a strong vaspurakaner accent as sarkis had he sounded admiring when they saw krispos was done the scouts scattered krispos watched them slip out of camp heading west some rode out armed and armored others left on foot wearing kneelength linen tunics and sandals mammianos watched them go too after the last one was gone he turned to krispos and asked now what now krispos said picking a phrase more likely in barsymes mouth than his own we await developments the flood of deserters hed hoped for did not materialize a few riders came over from the rebel camp but petronas cavalry pickets stayed alert and aggressive if theyd given up on the chief they followed they showed no sign of it to krispos relief all his own scouts managed to return safely he would have felt dreadful sacrificing them without gaining the advantage hed expected on the third day after hed sent them out he began readying his forces for an attack on the morrow since i warned petronas men i cant make myself out a liar now he told mammianos no your majesty mammianos agreed mournfully i might wish though that you hadnt been so exact since petronas must know were coming who can guess what sort of mischief hell have waiting for us without words his round face said you wouldnt be in this mess if youd listened to me krispos did not need to be reminded of that thinking to save lives hed probably cost videssosand his own side in particulara good many men instead as he sought his tent that evening he told himself that he had generals along for a reason and kicked himself for ignoring mammianos sage advice to pursue his own scheme thanks to his worry he took awhile to fall asleep once slumber took him he slept soundly he had long since learned to ignore the usual run of camp noises the commotion that woke him was nothing usual he grabbed sword and shield and clapped a helmet on his head before he peered out through the tentflap to see what was going on his first thought was that petronas had decided to beat him to the punch with a night attack but while the noise outside was tremendous it was not the din of battle it sounds like a festival he said more than a little indignant geirrod and vagn stood guard in front of his tent they turned to look at him good youre up majesty geirrod said wed have roused you any time now had the clamor not done it for us two of petronas best generals just came into camp did they krispos said softly well by the good god just then mammianos came out of his tent which was next to krispos krispos felt like putting his thumbs in his ears twiddling his fingers and sticking out his tongue at the fat general instead he simply waited for mammianos to notice him the generals own guards must have given him the news he glanced over toward the imperial tent and saw krispos there slowly and deliberately he came to attention and saluted a moment later as if deciding that was not enough he doffed his helm as well krispos waved back then asked the guards who are these generals anyway vlases and dardaparos their names are majesty geirrod said to krispos they were only names he said have them fetched here what they can tell me of petronas and his army will be beyond price as the haloga walked off to do his bidding krispos waved mammianos over he was sure his general would know everything worth knowing about them guards brought up the pair of deserters within a couple of minutes one officer was tall and thickset though muscular rather than fat like mammianos he proved to be vlases dardaparos on the other hand was small skinny and bowlegged from a lifetime spent in the saddle by looks he might have been father to some of sarkis scouts he and his comrade both went down in proskynesis before krispos touching their foreheads to the ground majesty they said together krispos let them stay prostrate a beat longer than he would have with men he fully trusted after he told them to rise he asked how long ago did you last give petronas imperial honors dardaparos spoke for both of them earlier this evening but we came here trusting your amnesty your majesty well serve you as loyally as ever we served him theres a fine promise mammianos growled does it mean youll desert the avtokrator just when he needs you most surely not mammianos krispos said smoothly seeing dardaparos and vlases stiffen to them he added and my promise is goodyoull not be harmed tell me though what made you decide to come over to me now majesty we decided youd likely win with us or without us vlases answered his voice made krispos blink it was a high sweet tenor as surprising from such a big man as trokoundos bass from a small one he went on petronas said you were nothing but a jumpedup stable boy begging your pardon your majesty the campaign youve run against him showed us different though dardaparos nodded aye thats how it was your majesty any time an able man holds videssos the city a rebels in deep from the getgo youre abler than we thought when we first picked petronas we were wrong and own it now krispos drew mammianos to one side what do you think he asked quietly im inclined to believe them mammianos sounded as if he regretted his inclination if theyd told you they couldnt stand the idea of being traitors any more or some such highsounding tripe id keep em under guardin irons too most likely but ive known both of em for years and they have a keenhoned sense of where their interest lies thats about as i saw it krispos walked back over to the generals very well excellent sirs i welcome you to my cause now tell me how you think petronas will dispose his forces to meet the attack i intend to make tomorrow he wont dispose them so well with us gone dardaparos said at once krispos had no idea how good a general he was but he certainly had a high officers sense of selfworth likely he wont krispos said he found himself yawning enormously excellent sirs on second thought im going to leave the rest of your questioning to mammianos here and i hope you will forgive me but i intend to keep you under guard until after the fighting is done tomorrow i dont know what harm you could do me there but id sooner not find out spoken like a sensible man your majesty vlases said you may welcome us but you have no reason to trust us by the lord with the great and good mind well give you reason soon enough he stooped found a twig and started drawing in the dirt grunting with the effort it cost him mammianos also stooped krispos watched for a few minutes as vlases laid out petronas plans then yawned again even more widely than before by the time he sought his cot though hed learned enough to decide that the movements he and mammianos had already devised would still serve his aims they would that is if vlases and dardaparos spoke the truth he suddenly realized he could find out if they did he sprang from bed once more shouting for trokoundos the mage appeared shortly dapper as ever krispos explained what he wanted aye the twomirror trick will tell whether they lie trokoundos said but it may not tell you everything you need to know it wont tell you what changes petronas has made in his plans because they deserted and it wont tell whether he encouraged them to go over to you maybe so subtly they dont even grasp it themselves just for the sake of putting you in confusion and doubt like this i cant believe that theyre two of his best men but krispos sounded unsure even to himself petronas was a master of the game of glove within glove within glove hed twisted anthimos round his finger for years if he wanted to manipulate a couple of his generals krispos was convinced he could angrily krispos shook his head a fine state of affairs when even learning the truth could not tell him whether to change his plans or keep them find out what you can he told trokoundos once trokoundos had gone krispos lay down again now though sleep was slower coming and after krispos eyes closed and his breathing grew deep and regular he dreamed he followed petronas down a path that twisted back on itself until petronas was following him after a night of such dreams waking to the certainty of morning was a relief krispos found himself looking forward to battle in a way he never had before for good or ill battle would yield but one outcome not the endlessly entrapping webs of possibility through which he had struggled in the darkness as krispos gnawed a hard roll and drank sour wine from a leather jack trokoundos came up to report so far as dardaparos and vlases know theyre honest traitors at any rate good krispos said trokoundos duty done departed leaving krispos to chew on his phrasing honest traitors the words could have come straight from his near nightmare scrambling up into progress saddle gave him the same feeling of release hed known on waking the feeling that something definite was about to happen the haloga guardsmen had to stay tight around him to keep him from spurring ahead of the army to the scouts who led its advance before the day was very old those scouts began trading arrows with the ones petronas had sent out petronas men drew back they were far in advance of their own army while krispos main body of troops trotted on close behind his scouting parties had he not already known where petronas force lay the retreating scouts would have led him to it petronas camp was in the middle of a broad scrubby pasture placed so no one could take it unawares the rebels forces stood in line of battle half a mile in front of their tents and pavilions petronas imperial banner flapped defiantly at the center of their line mammianos glanced at krispos as we set it up aye krispos said i think well keep him too busy to cut us in half he showed his teeth in what was almost a smile wed better thats true enough mammianos half grunted half chuckled he yelled to the army musicians horns drums and pipes sent companies of horsemen galloping from the second rank to either wing as they bore down on petronas force the rebels were also moving forward the momentum of horse and rider played a vital part in mounted warfare petronas had musicians of his own their martial blare shifted his deployments to match krispos good krispos said hes dancing to our tune for a change hed most feared petronas trying to smash through his armys deliberately weakened center nowhe hopedthe fight would be on his terms arrows flew so did war cries the rebels still acclaimed petronas along with krispos name his men had others to hurl at their foesthose of rhisoulphos vlases and dardaparos they also shouted one thing more amnesty we spare those who yield the armies collided first at the wings saber and lance took over for the bow despite defections petronas men fought fiercely krispos bit his lip as he watched his own troops held in place the treachery hed looked for simply was not there when he complained of that mammianos said cant be helped your majesty but arent you glad to be worrying over the loyalty of the other fellows army and not your own yes as a matter of fact krispos said only last fall hed wondered if any videssian soldiers at all would cleave to him only days before hed wondered if his army would hold together through combat now petronas bowels were the ones that griped at each collision of men amazing what a victory could do krispos thought the fight ground on thanks to rhisoulphos defection krispos had more men in it than petronas rhisoulphos men were not in a hotly engaged part of the linethey held the middle of the right wing but their presence freed up other warriors for the attack the men on the extreme right of petronas line found themselves first outnumbered then outflanked they bent back that was not enough to save them krispos horsemen scenting victory folded round them like a wolfs jaws closing on a tasty gobbet of meat petronas men were brave and loyal for half an hour and more they fought desperately selling themselves dear for their comrades sake but flesh and blood will only bear so much soldiers began casting swords and lances to the ground and raising their hands in token of surrender once the yielding startedand once petronas men saw that as promised those who yielded were not butcheredit ran from the end of petronas line toward the middle the line shook like a man with an ague shouting krispos warriors pressed hard all at once petronas army broke into fragments some men fled the field singly and in small groups more sometimes whole companies at a time threw down their weapons and surrendered a hard core of perhaps three thousand men petronas firmest followers withdrew in a body toward hill country that corrugated the horizon toward the northwest after them krispos cried in high excitement pounding his fist against mammianos armored shoulder dont let a one of them get away aye majesty mammianos shouted for couriers and stabbed his finger out toward petronas retreating soldiers he roared orders that properly carried out would have bagged every fugitive somehow though the pursuit did not quite come off some of krispos men rode after petronas hard core of strength but others were still busy accepting surrenders or relieving of their portable property soldiers who had surrendered still others made for petronas camp which lay before them tempting as a naked woman with an inviting smile and so petronas followers though in a running fight all the way reached the hills and set up a rear guard to hold the gap through which they fled by the time the column that had given chase to petronas returned emptyhanded night was falling krispos swore when he found out they had failed by the lord with the great and good mind id like to send the fools who stopped to plunder straight to the ice he raged and if you did youd have hardly more men left than those who escaped with petronas sarkis said they should have chased petronas first and plundered later krispos said sarkis answered with a shrug common soldiers dont grow rich on army pay your majesty theyre lucky to hold their own if they see the chance to steal something worth stealing theyre going to do it and think your majesty mammianos added soothingly had everyone gone after petronas who would have protected you if his men decided all at once to remember their allegiance i should have gone after petronas myself krispos said but then he let the matter drop what was done was done no matter how he complained he could not bring back an opportunity lost that did not mean he forgot he filed the failure away in his mind resolving not to let it happen again with any army of his any way you look at it majesty we won quite a victory mammianos said heres a great haul of prisoners petronas camp taken ill not deny it krispos said hed hoped to win the whole war today not just a battle but as hed just reminded himself one took what one got he was not so meanspirited as to forget that he undid his tin canteen from his belt raised it then swigged a big gulp of the rough wine the army drank to victory he shouted everyone who heard himwhich meant a good part of the armyturned at the sound of his voice in a moment bedlam filled the camp to victory soldiers roared some like krispos toasted it others capered round campfires filled with triumph or simple relief at being alive and others the crueler few taunted the prisoners they had taken the former followers of petronas disarmed now dared not reply from taunts some of the ruffians moved on to roughing up their captives krispos did not care to think about how far their ingenuity might take them if he gave them free rein hand on sword hilt he stalked toward the nastiest of the little games nearby without his asking halogai formed up around him narvikka said aye majesty theres a deal of us in you i tink you look like a man about to go killing mad thats how i feel krispos grabbed the shoulder of a trooper who had been amusing himself by stomping on a prisoners toes the man whirled round angrily when his sport was interrupted the curse in his mouth died unspoken quickly shaking with fear he prostrated himself krispos waited till he was flat on his belly then kicked him in the ribs pain shot up his legthe fellow wore chain mail by the way he twisted and grabbed at himself he felt the kick too through links leather and padding krispos said is that how you give amnesty tormenting a man who cant fight back nno majesty the fellow got out justhaving a little fun is all maybe you were i dont think he was krispos kicked the trooper again not quite so hard this time the man grunted but otherwise bore it without flinching krispos drew back his foot and asked or do you enjoy it when i do this answer me no majesty overbearing while on top the soldier shrank in on himself when confronted with power greater than his petty share all right then if you ever want to get mercy or deserve it youd best give it when you can now get out of here the soldier scrambled to his feet and fled krispos glared around hurting a man whos yielded especially one whos promised amnesty is skotos work the next trooper whos caught at it gets stripes and dismissal without pay does everyone understand if anybody had doubts he kept them to himself in the face of krispos anger the camp went from boisterous to solemn and quiet in moments into that sudden silence the fellow hed rescued said phos bless you your majesty that was done like an avtokrator aye several halogai rumbled agreement if i have the job i should live up to it krispos glanced over at the prisoner why did you fight against me in the first place i come from petronas estates he is my master he was always good to me i figured hed be good for the empire he studied krispos his head cocked to one side i still reckon that might be so but looks to me now like hes not the only one i hope not krispos wondered how many men throughout the empire of videssos could run it capably if they somehow found themselves on the throne hed never had that thought before more than a few he decided a little bemused but he was the one with the job and he aimed to keep it what is it majesty narvikka asked by the furrow of your brow id guess a weighty thought not really laughing krispos explained narvikka said bethink yourself on your good fortune majesty of all those mightbe avtokrators only petronas wears the red boots in your despite even petronas is one man too many in them krispos turned to go back to his tent then stopped a grin of pure mischief slowly spread over his face i know just how to get him out of them too his voice rose trokoundos the mage hurried over to him how may i serve your majesty he asked bowing krispos told trokoundos what he needed then said anxiously this isnt battle magic is it trokoundos heavylidded eyes half closed as he considered at last he said it shouldnt be and even if petronas person is warded as its sure to be who would think of protecting his boots his smile was a slyer version of krispos the more so as we wont do them a bit of harm so we wont krispos said but the lord with the great and good mind willing well do some to petronas v petronas as was his habit woke soon after dawn his back and shoulders ached too many years of sleeping soft in videssos the cityaye and even when he took the fieldleft him unused to making do with a single blanket for a bedroll at that he was luckier than most of the men who still clove to him for he had a tent to shelter him from the nighttime chill theirs were lost booty now for the army that followed krispos krispos petronas mouthed the name making it into a curse he cursed himself too for he had first taken krispos into his own household then introduced him into anthimos hed never imagined krispos influence with his nephew could rival his owntill the day he found himself his head shorn cast into the monastery of the holy skirios he ran a hand through his hair only now most of a year after hed slipped out of the monastery did he have a proper mans growth once more hed never imagined krispos would dare seize the throne or that krispos could govern once he had iteveryone hed been sure would flock to his own banner but it had not happened so petronas cursed himself again for putting that fat fool of a mammianos in a place that had proven so important and with that fat fool krispos had beaten him twice now and by the good god petronas had never imagined that just how badly hed underestimated krispos and krispos knack for getting other people to do what he needed was only now sinking in when it was on the very edge of being too late petronas clenched a fist no by phos not too late he said out loud he pissed in a chamber potlikely the last of those left to his armythen decked himself in the full imperial regalia seeing him in the raiment rightfully his could only hearten his men he told himself he stooped to go out through the tent flap and walked over to his horse which was tied nearby he sprang onto the beasts back with a surge of pridehe might be nearing sixty but he could still ride he smiled maliciously to think of gnatios who quivered atop anything bigger than a mule but as petronas rode through the camp his smile faded years of gauging armies tempers made him worry about this one the men were restive and discouraged he did not like the way they refused to meet his eye when a soldier did look his way he liked the fellows stare even less by the ice what are you gaping at he snarled the trooper looked apprehensive at being singled out bbegging your pardon your majesty but why did you don black boots to wear with your fine robe and crown are you mad petronas took his left foot from the stirrup and kicked his leg up and down this boots as red as a mans arse after a week in the saddle begging your pardon again majesty but it looks black to me so does the right one siruh sire may the ice take me if i lie are you telling me i dont know red when i see it petronas asked dangerously he looked down at his boots they were both a most satisfactory crimson the exact imperial shade petronas had seen it worn by his father by his brother and by his nephew it was as familiar to him as the back of his hand more familiar than his own face for sometimes he did not see a mirror for weeks at a stretch instead of answering him directly the trooper turned to his mates tell his majesty lads are those boots red or are they black theyre black the soldiers said in one voice now it was petronas turn to stare at them he could not doubt they meant what they said one man added seems an unchancy thing to me wearing a private citizens boots with all that fancy imperial gear another said aye theres no good omen in that several troopers drew phos suncircle over their hearts petronas glanced at his boots again they still looked red to him if his men did not see them sohe shivered that omen seemed bad to him too as if he had no right to the imperial throne he clenched his teeth against the idea that phos had turned away from him and toward that accursed upstart krispos the moment his rivals name entered his mind he knew phos was not the one who had arranged the omen he shouted for his wizard skeparnas when the mage did not appear at once he shouted again louder this time skeparnas skeparnas picked his way through the soldiers he was a tall thin man with a long lean face a beard waxed to a point and the longest fingers petronas had ever seen how may i serve you your majesty what color are my boots petronas demanded hed seldom seen skeparnas taken aback but now the wizard blinked and drew back half a step to me your majesty they look red he said cautiously to me too petronas said but before the words were out of his mouth the soldiers all around set up a clamor insisting they were black shut up he roared at them to skeparnas he went on more quietly i think krispos magicked them the stinking son of a spotted snake ahh skeparnas leaned forward like a tower tilting after an earthquake yes that would be a clever ploy wouldnt it his hands writhed in quick passes those spidery fingers seemed almost to knot themselves together suddenly petronas soldiers called out theyre red now your majesty there you see petronas said triumphantly a lovely spell most marvelously subtle skeparnas said with a connoisseurs appreciation not only did it have no hold on you it was also made to be invisible to anyone who perceived it with a mages eye thus perhaps delaying its discovery and allowing it to work the maximum amount of confusion very fornicating lovely petronas snapped he raised his voice to address his men you see my heroes theres no omen here this was just more of krispos vile work aiming to make you think somethings wrong when its not just a cheap miserable trick not worth fretting over he waited hoping for an answering cheer it did not come determinedly though he rode through the army as if it had he waved to the men making his horse rear and caracole how do we know those boots werent really black till the mage spelled em red again one soldier asked another as he came by he rode on but keeping his face still after that was as hard as if hed taken a lance in the guts trokoundos staggered then steadied himself theyve broken the spell he gasped by the good god i could do with a cup of wine greasy sweat covered his finedrawn features krispos poured with his own hand how much good do you think its done no way to guess trokoundos said gasping again after hed drained the cup at a single long draft you know how it is majesty if the soldiers are truly strong for petronas theyll stay with him come what may if theyre wavering the least little thing could seem a bad omen to em aye more and more krispos was coming to believe the art of leading men was a kind of magic though not one sorcerers studied what folk thought of a ruler oftentimes seemed more important than what he really was shall i try the spell again this afternoon majesty or maybe tomorrow morning trokoundos asked after some thought krispos shook his head that would make them sure it was our sorcery i think if it only happens the once they cant be certain quite what it is as you wish of course trokoundos said what then im going to let petronas stew in his own juice for a couple of days krispos answered when i do hit him again ill hit hard people who know this country have already told me of other passes through the hills and he doesnt have enough men to cover them all if he stays where he is i can leave enough men here to keep him from bursting out onto the plain again while i take the rest around to hit him from behind what if he flees if he flees now after losing to me twice hes mine krispos said then its just a matter of running him to earth while petronashe hopedstewed krispos spent the next few days catching up on the dispatches that never stopped coming from the capital he approved a commercial treaty with khatrish scribbled minor changes on an inheritance law before he affixed his seal to it commuted one death sentence where the evidence looked flimsy and let another stand he wrote to mavros of his second victory then read through his foster brothers gossipy reports of doings in videssos the city from them and from daras occasional shorter notes he gathered that phostis while still small was doing well that filled him with sober satisfaction whether a baby lived to grow up was always a roll of the dice mavros also forwarded dispatches from the war against harvas blackrobe krispos read and reread those agapetos preemptive attack had bogged down but he still stood on enemy soil maybe krispos thought the peasants near the northern border would be able to get in a crop in peace other documents also came from the city krispos began to dread opening the ones sealed with skyblue wax every time he did he read that pyrrhos had deposed another priest or abbot for infractions that seemed ever more trivial casting a man from his temple for trimming his beard too close for instance left krispos shaking his head he wrote a series of increasingly blunt notes to the patriarch urging pyrrhos to show restraint but restraint did not seem to be part of pyrrhos vocabulary letters of protest also came to krispos from ousted clerics from clerics afraid they would be ousted and from delegations of prominent citizens from several towns seeking protection for their local priests more and more krispos wished he could have retained gnatios as ecumenical patriarch hed never imagined that one of his strongest allies could become one of his greatest embarrassments and yet pyrrhos remained zealous in his behalf with petronas and gnatios still to worry about krispos put off a decision on his rigorist patriarch he sent a holding force under sarkis against the pass through which petronas had fled then led the rest of the army north and west through another gap to get behind his rival his part of the army was just entering that second pass when a courier from sarkis galloped up on a blowing foamspattered horse the man was panting as hard as if hed done all that running himself majesty he called rejoice majesty were through youre through krispos stared at him sarkis forced the pass you mean that was good luck past all expectation petronas knew how to find defensive positions a handful of determined men could have held the pass for days so long as they were not outflanked but the courier said looks like petronas armys gone bellyup the lord sarkis told me to tell you some have fled more are yielding themselves up the fight isnt in em anymore majesty by the good god krispos said softly he wondered what partif anythe magic hed suggested had played have to ask some prisoners he told himself before more urgent concerns drove the matter from his mind whats become of petronas then has he surrendered no majesty no sign of him nor of gnatios either the lord sarkis urges speed on you to help round up as many flying soldiers as we may yes krispos turned to thvari the captain of his haloga guards will you and your men ride pack horses brave sir to help us move the faster thvari spoke to the guardsmen in their own slow rolling speech they shouted back grinning and waving their axes aye thvari said unnecessarily he added we would not miss being in at the kill good krispos called orders to the army musicians the long column briefly halted the baggagetrain handlers shifted burdens on their animals freeing up enough to accommodate the halogai they waved away soldiers who wanted to help men without their longpracticed skill at lashing and unlashing bundles would only have slowed them down the musicians blew at the trot the army started forward again the halogai were no horsemen but most managed to stay on their mounts and keep them headed in the right direction that was plenty krispos thought if they needed to fight they would dismount where do you think petronas will go if his army has broken up krispos asked mammianos the fat general tugged at his beard as he thought some failed rebels might flee to makuran but i cant see petronas as catspaw for the king of kings hed sooner leap off a cliff i think he might do that anyway your majesty to keep you from gloating over him i wouldnt gloat krispos said mammianos studied him mmm maybe not but he would if he caught you and we always reckon others from ourselves likeliest though petronasll try and hole himself up somewhere do what he can against you let me think theres an old fortress not too far from here place calledwhat in the name of the ice is the place called antigonos thats what it is thats as good a guess as any and better than most well head there then krispos said do you know the way i expect i could find it but youll have men who could do it quicker ill tell you that a few questions called to the soldiers showed krispos that mammianos was right with a couple of locally raised men in the lead the army pounded toward antigonos krispos spent a while worrying what to do if petronas was not in the fortress then he stopped worrying his column was heading in the right direction to cut off fugitives anyhow the riders ran into several bands from petronas disintegrating army none included the rival emperor none of his men admitted knowing where he had gone from what they said he and some of his closest followers had simply disappeared the morning before leaving the rest of the men to fend for themselves one trooper said bitterly if id known the buggerd run like that i never would have followed him petronas thinks of his own neck first mammianos said remembering his own dealings with anthimos uncle krispos nodded he and his men reached the fortress of antigonos a little before sunset the fortress perched atop a tall hill and surveyed the surrounding countryside like a vulture peering out from a branch on top of a high tree the ironfaced wooden gate was slammed shut a thin column of cooksmoke rose into the sky from the citadel somebodys home krispos said i wonder who beside him mammianos barked laughter krispos turned to the musicians blow parley the call rang out several times before anyone appeared on the wall to answer it will you yield krispos called a minor magic of trokoundos projecting his voice beyond bowshot i still offer amnesty to soldiers and safe passage back to the monastery for petronas and gnatios ill never trust myself to you wretch shouted the man on the wall krispos started slightly to recognize petronas voice it too carried well krispos thought ive known he had a mage along since he broke the spell on his boots he touched the amulet he wore with his lucky goldpiece petronas used wizards for purposes darker than extending the range of his voice without trokoundos by him krispos would have feared to confront his foe so closely i could have ordered you killed the moment i took the throne krispos wondered if he should have done just that shrugging to himself he went on i have no special yen for your blood only pledge youll live quietly among the monks and let me get on with running the empire my empire petronas roared your empire is that fortress youre huddling in krispos said the rest of videssos acknowledges meand my patriarch if he was stuck with pyrrhos he thought he ought to get some use out of him even if only to make petronas writhe in his cage to the ice with your patriarch the phosdrunk fanatic krispos smiled for once he and petronas agreed on something he had no intention of letting his rival know it he said youre walled up as tightly here as you would be in the monastery of the holy skirios how do you propose to get away you might as well give up and go back to the monastery never petronas stamped down off the wall his curses remained audible he must have noticed that and signaled to his magician for they cut off in the middle of a foul word krispos nodded to trokoundos who chanted a brief spell when krispos spoke again a moment later his voice had only its usual power once more he wont be easy to pry out of there not without a siege train which we dont have with us mammianos agreed not unless we can starve him out anyway rhisoulphos stood close by looking up at the spot on the wall that petronas had just vacated he shook his head at mammianos words he has supplies for months in there he spent the winter strengthening the place against the chance that the war would turn against him smart of him mammianos also glanced toward the fortress of antigonos aye hes near as clever as he thinks he is well send for a siege train by the good god and sit round the fortress till it gets here krispos said if petronas wants to play at being avtokrator inside till the rams start pounding on the walls thats all right with me your sitting here may be just what he wants trokoundos said remember that he tried once to slay you by sorcery such an effort would be all the easier to repeat with you close by weve just seen his mage is still with him i cant very well leave before hes taken not if i intend to leave men of mine behind here krispos said mammianos and rhisoulphos both saluted him then looked at each other as if taken by surprise mammianos said majesty you may not be trained to command but you have a gift for it as may be krispos did not show how pleased he was he turned to trokoundos i trust you have me better warded than i was that night oh indeed the protections i gave you then were the hasty sort one uses in an emergency i thank the lord with the great and good mind that they sufficed but since you gained the throne i and my colleagues have hedged you round with far more apotropaic incantations with what krispos wanted to see if the wizard could repeat himself without tripping over his tongue but trokoundos chose to explain instead protective spells i believe they will serve with magecraft one is seldom as sure as one would like come to that we arent sure petronas and his wizard will attack me krispos said he will your majesty rhisoulphos said positively what other chance in all the world has he now to become avtokrator put that way krispos clicked his tongue between his teeth aye likely he will here i stay even so trokoundos will keep me safe what he did not mention was his fear that if he returned to videssos the city petronas might suborn some soldiers and get free once more maybe mammianos said hopefully he hasnt had the chance to fill the cisterns in there too full summers hereabouts are hot and dry with luck his men will get thirsty soon and make him yield maybe but krispos doubted it hed seen that petronas could be matched as a combat soldier for keeping an army in supplies though he had few peers if hed taken refuge in the fortress of antigonos he was ready to stand siege there krispos ringed his own army round the base of the fortress hill he staged mock attacks by night and day seeking to wear down the defenders trokoundos wore himself into exhaustion casting one protective spell after another over krispos and over the army as a whole that petronas mage bided his time only made trokoundos certain the stroke would be deadly when it came the siege dragged on the healerpriests were much busier with cases of dysentery than with wounds a letter let krispos know that a train of rams and catapults had set out from videssos the city for antigonos behind a whitepainted shield of truce a captain approached the fortress and read the letter in a loud voice finishing beware rebels your hour of justice approaches petronas men jeered him from the walls trokoundos redoubled his precautions festooning krispos with charms and amulets until their chains seemed heavier than chain mail how am i supposed to sleep wearing all this krispos complained the ones that dont gouge my back gouge my chest with a look of martyred patience trokoundos said your majesty petronas must know he cannot hope to last long once the siege engines arrive therefore he will surely try to strike you down before that time we must be ready not only will i be ready ill be stoopshouldered as well krispos said trokoundos martyred look did not change krispos threw his hands in the air and walked off clanking as he went but that night alone at last in his tent he tossed and turned until a sharppointed amethyst crystal on one of his new amulets stabbed him just above his right shoulder blade he swore and clapped his other hand to the injury when he took it away his palm was wet with blood that fornicating does it he snarled he threw aside the light silk coverlet and jumped to his feet he took off the offending chain and flung it on the floor it knocked over one of the other charms that ringed the bed like a fortress wall finally breathing hard krispos lay down again maybe petronas wizard will pick tonight to try to kill me he muttered but one piece more or less shouldnt matter much and if he does get me at least ill die sound asleep what with his fury naturally he had trouble drifting off even after the chain was gone he tossed and turned dozed and half woke his shoulder still hurt too some time toward morning a tiny crunch made him open his eyes yet again he was frowning even as he came fully awake the crunch had sounded very close as if it was inside the tent a servant who disturbed him in the middle of the nightespecially the middle of this miserable nightwould regret the day he was born but the man crouching not three paces away was no servant of his he was all in blackeven his face was blacked likely with charcoal his right hand held a long knife and under one of his black boots lay the crushed remains of one of trokoundos charms had he not trod on it krispos would never have known he was there until that knife slid between his ribs or across his throat the knifemans dark face twisted in dismay as he saw krispos wake krispos face twisted too the assassin sprang toward him krispos flung his coverlet in the fellows face and shouted as loud as he could outside the tent his haloga guard also cried out while the assassin was clawing free of the coverlet krispos seized his knife arm with both hands his foe kicked him in the shin hard enough to make his teeth click together in anguish he tried to knee the knifeman in the crotch the fellow twisted to one side and took the blow on the point of his hip with a sudden wrench he tried to break krispos grip on his wrist but krispos had wrestled since before his beard came in he hung on grimly the assassin could do what he pleased so long as he did not get that dagger free thunnk the abrupt sound of blade biting into flesh filled krispos ears and seemed to fill the whole tent hot blood sprayed his belly the assassin convulsed in his arms a latrine stench said the mans bowels had let go the knife dropped from his hands he crumpled to the ground majesty vagn cried horror on his face as he saw krispos spattered with blood are you hale majesty if my legs not broken yes krispos said giving it a gingerly try the pain did not get worse so he supposed hed taken no real damage he looked down at the knifeman and at the spreading pool of blood he whistled softly by the good god vagn you almost cut him in two instead of warming to the praise the haloga hung his head he thrust his dripping axe into krispos hands kill me now majesty i beg you for i failed to ward you from this this his videssian failed him to show what he meant he bent down and spat in the dead assassins face kill me i beg you krispos saw he meant it ill do no such thing he said then i have no honor vagn drew himself up absolute determination on his face since you do not grant me this boon i shall slay myself no you krispos stopped before he called vagn an idiot filled with shame as he was the northerner would only bear up under insults like a man bearing up under archery and would think he deserved each wound he took krispos tried to get the shock of battling the assassin out of his mind tried to think clearly the harsh haloga notion of honor served him well most of the time now he had to find a way around it he said if you didnt ward me who did the knifeman lies dead at your feet i didnt kill him vagn shook his head it means nothing never should he have come into this tent you were at the front he must have got in at the back under the canvas krispos looked at the assassins contorted body he thought about what it must have taken even dressed in clothes that left him part of the night to come down from the fortress and sneak through the enemy camp to its very heart in his own way he was a brave man vagn spat again he was a skulking murderer and should have had worse and slower than i gave him please majesty i beg once more slay me that i may die clean no curse it krispos said vagn turned and walked to the tent flap if he left krispos was sure he would never return alive he said quickly here wait i know what ill doill give you a chance to redeem yourself in your own eyes in no way can i do that vagn declared hear me out krispos said when vagn took another step toward the flap he snapped i order you to listen reluctantly the haloga stopped krispos went on heres what id have you do first take this mans head then unarmored if you like carry it up to the gates of antigonos and leave it there to show petronas the fate his assassin earned will that give you back your honor vagn was some time silent which only made the growing hubbub outside the imperial tent seem louder then with a grunt the haloga chopped at the knifemans neck the roof of the tent was too low to let him take big full swings with his ax so the beheading required several strokes krispos turned away from the gory job he threw on a robe and went out to show the army he was still alive the men whom his outcry had aroused shouted furiously when he told how the assassin had crept into his tent he was just finishing the tale when vagn emerged holding the mans head by the hair the soldiers let out such a lusty cheer that the guardsman blinked in surprise their approval seemed to reach him where krispos had not as the cheering went on and on he stood taller and straighten without a word he began to tramp toward the fortress of antigonos wait krispos called do it by daylight so petronas can see just what gift you bring him aye vagn said after a moments thought i will wait he set down the assassins head lightly prodding it with his foot so will he the joke struck krispos as being in poor taste but he was glad to hear the haloga make it trokoundos plucked at krispos sleeve we were right in guessing petronas aimed to treacherously slay you he said wrong only in his choice of stealth over sorcery but had we relied on his using stealth he surely would have tried with magic i suppose so krispos said and as for that you can cheer up without your magecraft id be a dead man right now what do you mean trokoundos scratched his shaven head after all petronas did but send a simple knifeman against you i know but if the fellow hadnt stepped on one of those charms you insisted on scattering everywhere i never would have woke up in time to yell happy to be of service your majesty trokoundos said in a strangled voice then he saw how hard krispos face was set against laughter he allowed himself a dry chuckle or two but still maintained his dignity too bad for him krispos thought he laughed out loud when the siege train reached the fortress of antigonos krispos watched the soldiers on the walls watching his artisans assemble the frames for stonethrowing engines the sheds that would protect the men who swung rams against stones or boiling oil from above the assassins head still lay outside the gate petronas men had let vagn come and go by now even the flies had tired of it as soon as the first catapult was done the craftsmen who had built it recruited a squad of common soldiers to drag up a large stone and set it in the leathern sling at the end of the machines throwing arm winches creaked as the crew tightened the ropes that gave the catapult its hurling power the throwing arm jerked forward the catapult bucked the stone flew through the air it crashed against the wall of the fortress with a noise like thunder the soldiers began to haul another rock into place krispos sent a runner to the engines crew with a single word wait then one of his men advanced toward the fortress with a whitepainted shield of truce after some shouting back and forth petronas came up to the battlements what do you want of me he called to krispos or rather toward krispos banner as at the last parley his wizard amplified his voice to carry so far trokoundos stood by krispos to perform the same service for him i want you to take a good look around petronas look carefullyi give you this last chance to yield and save your life see the engines all around the rams and stonethrowers will pound down your walls while the dartshooters pick off your men from farmer than they can shoot back petronas shook his fist i told you i would never yield to you look around krispos said again youre a soldier petronas look around and see what chance you have of holding out i tell you this once we breach your wallsand we will well show no mercy to you or anyone else maybe he thought petronas men would force him to give up even if he did not want to but petronas led his tiny empire still he made a slow circuit of the wall then returned at last to the spot from which he had set out i see the engines he said by his tone he might have been discussing the heat of the day what will you do petronas krispos asked petronas did not answer not with words he scrambled up from the walkway to the wall itself and stood there for most of a minute looking out at the broad expanse of land that so unaccountably he did not rule then slowly and deliberately with the same care he gave to everything he did he dove off inside and outside the fortress of antigonos men cried out in dismay but when some of krispos soldiers rushed toward the crumpled shape at the base of the wall petronas men shot at them the truce is still good krispos shouted we wont hurt him further by the good godwell save him if we can theres a foolish promise mammianos observed better to put him out of his misery and have done i daresay thats what hed want krispos realized he was right the pledge though was enough to give the rebels an excuse to hold their fire when his own men did nothing but crowd round petronas krispos thought they were only showing their share of mammianos rough wisdom then a sweating panting trooper ran up to him and gasped out majesty he landed on his head poor sod of itself krispos hand shaped the suncircle over his heart the war is over he said he did not know what to feel relief yes that so dangerous a foe was gone but petronas had also raised him high in his own household and then in anthimos that had been in petronas interest too but krispos could not help remembering it could not help remembering the years in which he and petronas had worked together to manage anthimos he sketched the sunsign again i would have let him live he murmured as much to himself as to the men around him he gave you his answer to that mammianos said krispos had to nod without their leader petronas men felt the urge to save their lives the strong gate to the fortress of antigonos opened a soldier came out with a shield of truce the rest of the garrison filed slowly after him krispos sent in troopers to make antigonos his own once more the gleam of a shaven pate caught his eye he smiled not altogether kindly to his bodyguards he said fetch me gnatios now in sandals and a simple blue monks robe rather than the patriarchal regalia krispos would have bet hed had inside the fortress gnatios looked small frail and frightened between the two burly halogai who marched him away from his fellows he cast himself down on the ground in front of krispos may your majestys will be done with me he said not lifting his face from the dust get up holy sir krispos said as gnatios rose he went on you would have done better to keep faith with me you would still wear the blue boots now not pyrrhos a spark of malicious amusement flared in gnatios eyes from all ive heard majesty your patriarch has not succeeded in delighting you hes not betrayed me either krispos said coldly gnatios wilted again what will you do with me your majesty his voice was tiny taking your head here and now would likely cause me more scandal than youre worth i think ill bring you back to the city recantsay in the amphitheater with enough people watching so you cant go back on your word againand publicly recognize pyrrhos as patriarch and for all of me you can live out the rest of your days in the monastery of the holy skirios gnatios bowed in submission krispos had been sure he would pyrrhos now pyrrhos would have gone to the headsman singing hymns before he changed his views by the breadth of a fingernail paring that made him stronger than gnatios krispos was less ready to say it made him better it certainly made him harder to work with if ever youre outside the monastery without written leave from me and pyrrhos both gnatios youll meet the man with the axe then and there krispos warned that walls me up for life gnatios said a last faint protest likely it does krispos folded his arms he was ready to summon an executioner at another word from gnatios gnatios saw that he bit his lip till a bead of blood showed at the corner of his mouth but he nodded take him away krispos told the halogai while youre about it put him in irons gnatios made an indignant noise krispos ignored it continuing hes already escaped once so id sooner not give him another chance then he turned to gnatios holy sir i pledged i would not harm you i said nothing of your dignity i can see why gnatios said resentfully a chopped dignity grows back better than a chopped neck krispos said remember that soon enough youll be back at your chronicle there is that krispos was amused to see gnatios brighten at the thought political priest and born intriguer though he was he was also a true scholar he went off with the halogai without another word of complaint krispos scanned the men still emerging from the fortress of antigonos when at last they stopped coming he frowned he walked toward them halogai fell in around him wheres petronas wizard he demanded the men looked around among themselves then back toward the fortress skeparnas one said with a shrug i thought he was with us but he doesnt seem to be others spoke up in agreement i want him krispos said he wondered if he looked as savagely eager as he felt petronas wizard had cost him a season of lying in bed limp as a dead fish only trokoundos countermagic kept the fellow from taking his life sorcery that aimed at causing death was a capital offense when krispos summoned him trokoundos studied with narrowed eyes the group of ragged none too clean men who had come out of the fortress he might be hiding in plain sight he explained to krispos using another mans semblance to keep from being seen the mage took out two coins the one in my left hand is gilded lead when i touch it against the true goldpiece in my right hand while reciting the proper spell by the law of similarity other counterfeits will also be exposed he began to chant then touched the two coins false and true together a couple of mens hair suddenly went from black to gray which made the halogai round krispos guffaw but other than that no ones features changed he is not here trokoundos said he frowned his eyes suddenly doubtful i do not think he is here he touched the coins of gold and lead against each other once more and held them in his closed fist now he used a new chant harsh and sonorous insisting demanding by the good god krispos whispered in the crowd of soldiers and others who had come out of the fortress one mans features were running like wax over a fire before his eyes the fellow grew taller leaner trokoundos let out a hoarse shout of triumph the disguised wizards face worked horribly as he realized he was discovered his talonlike fingers stabbed at trokoundos the smaller mage groaned and staggered goldpiece and lead counterfeit fell to the ground but trokoundos too was a master mage had he been less anthimos would never have chosen him as instructor in the sorcerous arts he braced himself against empty air and fought back a moment later skeparnas bent as if under a heavy weight the sorcerers duel caught up both menthey were so perfectly matched that neither could work great harm unless the other blundered neither had any thought for his surroundings each of necessity focused solely on his foe krispos shoved his halogai toward skeparnas capture or slay that man the imperial guardsmen obeyed without question or hesitation they were almost upon the wizard before he knew they were there he started to send a spell their way but in tearing his attention from trokoundos he left himself vulnerable to the other mages sorcery he was screaming as he turned and tried to run the axes of the halogai rose and fell the scream abruptly died trokoundos lurched like a drunken man wine someone i beg he croaked krispos undid his own canteen and passed it to the mage trokoundos drained it dry he sank to his knees then to his haunches worried krispos sat beside him he had to lean close to hear trokoundos whisper now i understand what getting caught in an avalanche must be like are you all right krispos asked what do you need a new carcass for starters with visible effort trokoundos drew up the corners of his mouth he was strong as a plow mule was skeparnas had the northerners not distracted him well your majesty let me just say im glad they did so am i krispos glanced over to skeparnas body the rest of the men from the fortress had pulled back as if the wizard were dead of plague i think we can guess his conscience was troubling him he didnt seem anxious to meet you did he trokoundos smile though still strained seemed more firmly attached to his face now he got to his feet waving off krispos effort to help trokoundos gaze also went to skeparnas sprawled corpse he wearily shook his head aye your majesty im very glad the halogai distracted him krispos looked over the cattlecrossing east to videssos the city behind its seawalls nearly as massive as the great double rampart that shielded its landward side the city reared on seven hills gilded spheres atop the spires of innumerable temples to phos shone under the warm summer sun as if they were so many tiny suns themselves as he climbed down into the imperial barge that would carry him across the strait to the capital krispos thought im going home the notion still felt strange to him hed needed many years in videssos the city before it rather than the village from which he sprang seemed his right and proper place in the world but his dwelling was there his wife his child probably his child at any ratecertainly his heir sure as sure that all made home the rowers dug in the barge glided through the light chop of the cattlecrossing toward the city krispos was so happy to see it draw near that he ignored his stomachs misgivings over being at sea the barge drew to a halt in front of the westernmost gate in the seawall the gate closest to the palaces the two valves swung open just as the barge arrived by now krispos had come to expect imperial ceremonial to operate so smoothly the barge captain waved to his sailors they tied up the barge set a gangplank in place then turned and nodded to krispos he strode up the plank and into the city along with some of his palace servitors a delegation of nobles awaited krispos within the gate they prostrated themselves before him shouting thou conquerest krispos avtokrator for once he thought bemused the ancient acclamation was literally true thou conquerest his greeters cried again as they rose among them he saw iakovitzes clad in bright silks impeccably groomed the noble looked himself again though he was no longer plump but he perforce stood mute while his companions cried out praise for the emperor the unfairness of that tore at krispos he beckoned to iakovitzes giving him favor in the eyes of his fellows iakovitzes chest puffed out with pride as he came up to krispos and bowed before him now the small war the needful war is done krispos said now we can start the greater fight and give you the vengeance you deserve by the lord with the great and good mind i pledge again that you will have it hed thought that would give the nobles and servants another chance to cheer instead they stood silently as if bereft of their tongues as iakovitzes iakovitzes himself unhooked from his belt a tablet ornamented with enamelwork and precious stones his stylus looked to be made of gold when the noble opened the tablet krispos nose told him the wax was perfumed maimed iakovitzes might be but hed adapted to his injury with panache he wrote quickly then you havent heard your majesty how could you not have heard what krispos said when hed read the words several people guessed what he meant and started to answer but iakovitzes waved them to silence his stylus raced over the wax with tiny slithery sounds when he was done he handed the tablet to krispos about ten days ago agapetos was heavily defeated north of imbros mavros gathered what force he could and set out to avenge the loss krispos stared at the tablet as if the words on it had betrayed him the good god knows enough couriers brought me dispatches from the city while i was in the westlands set against this news every word they carried was so much gossip and fiddlefaddle so why was i not told his gaze fastened on barsymes the vestiarios face went pale as milk but majesty he quavered the sevastos assured me he was keeping you fully informed before he departed for the frontier and promised to continue doing so while on campaign i dont believe you krispos said why would he do anything so he groped for a word so foolhardy but that was hardly out of his mouth before he saw an answer his foster brother had known krispos did not want him to go out of the city to fight but not why if mavros thought krispos doubted his courage or ability he might well have wanted to win a victory just to prove him wrong and he would have to do it secretly to keep krispos from stopping him but krispos knew mavros was able and bravewould he have named him sevastos otherwise what he feared was for his foster brothers safety tanilis was not the sort to send idle warnings the taste of triumph turned bitter in his mouth he turned and dashed back through the seawall gate ignoring the startled cries that rose behind him the captain and crew of the imperial barge gaped to see him reappear he ignored their surprise too row back across the cattlecrossing fast as you can he told the captain order mammianos to ready the whole army to cross to this side as fast as boats can bring it here tell him i intend to move north against harvas the instant the whole force is here do you have all that ithink so your majesty stammering a little the barge captain repeated his orders krispos nodded curtly the captain bawled orders to his men they cast off the ropes that held the barge next to the wall then backed oars as if it were a fighting galley the imperial barge pivoted almost in its own length then streaked toward the westlands krispos stood back barsymes stood in the gateway what of the celebratory procession down middle street tomorrow your majesty he said what of the festival of thanksgiving at the high temple what of the distribution of largess to the people cancel everything krispos snapped after a moment he reconsidered no go on and pay out the largessthatll keep the city folk happy enough for a while but with the northern frontier coming to pieces i dont think we have much to celebrate as you wish your majesty barsymes said with a sorrowful bow he lived for ceremonial what will you do with your brief time in the city then talk with my generals krispos saidthe first thing that entered his mind he went on see dara for a bit not only did he miss her he knew he had to stay on good terms with her the more so now that her father was with him as something close to an afterthought he added ill see phostis too very well your majesty now barsymes sounded as if all was very well with no chance for a child of his own the eunuch doted on phostis as your generals are still on the far side of the cattlecrossing shall i conduct you to the imperial residence in the meantime good enough krispos smiled at the vestiarios unflagging efficiency barsymes waved a dozen parasolbearersthe imperial numberlined up in front of krispos he followed the colorful silk canopies toward the grove of cherry trees that surrounded his private chambersnot he thought that anything having to do with the emperors person was what would be reckoned private for anyone else the halogai outside the residence sprang to attention when they saw the parasolbearers majesty they shouted your brothers fought bravely battling the rebel krispos said grins split the northerners faces hear how he speaks in our style one said krispos grinned too glad theyd noticed he climbed the steps and strode into the imperial residence barsymes bustled past him let me fetch the nurse your majesty with your son he hurried down the hall calling for the woman she came out of a doorway phostis was in her arms she squeaked when she saw krispos your majesty we hadnt looked for you so soon but come see what a fine lad your sons gotten to be she held out the baby invitingly krispos took him the bit of practice hed had holding phostis before he went on campaign came back to him he had a good deal more to hold now he lifted the baby up close to his face as he always did he tried to decide whom phostis resembled as if deliberately to keep him in the dark phostis still looked like his motherand like himself his features seemed far more distinctly his own than they had when he was newborn he did have his mothers eyes thoughand his grandfathers phostis was looking at krispos too without recognition but with interest when his eyes met krispos he smiled delighted krispos smiled back see how he takes to you the nurse crooned isnt that sweet the babys face scrunched up in fierce concentration krispos felt the arm he had under phostis bottom grow warm and damp he handed him back to the nurse i think hes made a mess a moment later any possible doubt left him they have a habit of doing that the nurse said krispos nodded with a farm upbringing he was intimately familiar with messes of every variety the nurse went on ill clean him up i expect you want to see your lady anyhow yes krispos said i dont think ill be in the city very long that did not surprise the nurse but then shed known about the disaster near imbros longer than he had barsymes said her majesty will be at the needle this time of day he led krispos past the portrait of stavrakios krispos wondered how the tough old avtokrator would have judged his first war the sewing room had a fine northfacing window dara sat by it bent close to her work the tapestry on which she labored might not be finished in her lifetime when one day it was it would hang in the grand courtroom she knew sober pride that the finest embroiderers in the city judged her skill great enough to merit inclusion in such a project she did not notice the door open behind her only when krispos stepped between her and the window and made the light change did she look up even after that she needed a moment to return from the peacock whose shining feathers spread wider with each stitch she took its beautiful work krispos said she heard the praise in his voice nodded without false modesty it was going well today i thought she jabbed needle into linen set the tapestry aside and got to her feet which doesnt mean i cant put it down to hail a conqueror smiling now she squeezed him hard enough to make the air whoosh from his lungs then tilted her face up for a kiss aye one victory won he said after a bit his hands lingered not wanting to draw away from her he saw that pleased her but saw also by the way her eyebrows lowered slightly and pinched together that she was not altogether content he thought he knew why his tone roughened but also i learn just now a loss in the north to balance it that further sobered her yes she said then after a pause she asked how do you mean you just now learn surely mavros sent word on to you of what had happened to agapetos not a whisper of it krispos said angrily nor that he aimed to take the field himself i think he hid it from me on purpose because he knew id forbid him on account of his mothers letter id forgotten that daras eyes went wide what will you do then go after him andi hoperescue him from his folly krispos scowled irritated as much with himself as with mavros i wish id flatout told him what tanilis wrote but i was afraid hed sally forth then just to prove he wouldnt let her run his life and so i didnt spell things outand hes sallied forth anyhow he misliked that it had the air of the working out of some malign fate he drew the suncircle over his heart to turn aside the evil omen dara also signed herself she said not all foretelling is truth for which the lord with the great and good mind be praised who could bear to live knowing that someone less man the good god knew what was to come maybe tanilis felt a mothers fear and made too much of it now that i have phostis i know how that can be maybe but krispos did not believe it tanilis had called him majesty when only a madman could have imagined he would ever dwell in the imperial residence wearing imperial robes only a madmanor one who saw true have you further need for my services majesties barsymes asked krispos and dara their eyes on each other shook their heads at the same time then if you will excuse me the vestiarios bowed his way out no sooner had he gone than dara demanded and how many willing pretty country girls kept your bed warm while you were away in the westlands it might have been a joke she kept her tone light but krispos did not think it was after being married to anthimos dara could hardly be blamed for doubting his fidelity when he was not under her eyemaybe even when he was after a little thought he answered do you think id be stupid enough to do anything like that when your father was in camp with me for most of the campaign no i suppose not she said judiciously she set hands on hips and looked up as she had to do to meet his eyes you slept alone then all the time you were away from the city i said so prove it krispos let a long exasperated breath hiss out how am i supposed to in the middle of his sentence he saw a way four quick steps took him to the door he slammed and barred it as quickly he returned to her side and took her in his arms his lips came down on hers some while later she said get off me will you not only is the floor hard its cold and i expect i have the marks of mosaic tiles on my backside too krispos sat back on his haunches dara drew one leg up past him and rolled away he said yes as a matter of feet you do i thought as much she said darkly but in spite of herself she could not contrive to sound annoyed i hadnt looked for your proof to be sovehement that krispos raised an eyebrow after going without for so long that was just the beginning of my proof braggart she said before her eyes left his face then her brows also lifted what have we here smiling she reached out a hand to discover what they had there that too rose to the occasion before they began again she said can the second part of your proof wait till we go to the bedchamber it would be more comfortable there so it would krispos said why not an advantage of the imperial robes was that they slid offand now onquickly and easily their principal disadvantage became obvious when the weather got cold peasants sensibly labored in tunics and trousers krispos shivered when he thought of rounding up sheep in winter with an icy wind whistling up a robe and howling around his private parts that was not a worry at the moment serving maids grinned as krispos and dara headed for the bedchamber hand in hand krispos carefully took no notice of the grins he had begun to resign himself to the prospect of a life led with scant privacy that had been easy for anthimos whod owned no inhibitions of any sort it could still sometimes unnerve krispos he wondered if the servants kept count when he was behind a closed door again such trivial concerns vanished he doffed his robe a second time then helped dara off with hers they lay down together this time they made slower less driven love kissing caressing joining together and then separating once more to spin it out and make it last as the afterglow faded krispos said i think ill bring your father along with me when i take the army north beside him dara laughed you neednt do it for my sake i couldnt hope for more or better proof than youve given me or could i her hand lazily toyed with him shall we see what comes up i think youll have to get your comeuppance another time he said she snorted gave him an almost painful squeeze then sat up abruptly she was serious as i think on it having my father with you might be a good idea if he stayed here in the city while you were away he could forget on whose head the crown properly belongs i can see that krispos said hes an able man and able too to keep his own counsel maybe that comes of his living by the western frontier from all ive seen its rare among folk here in the city people here show off what they know to make themselves seem important youve always been able to keep secret what needs keeping dara said krispos nodded the very bed in which they lay testified to that dara went on why are you surprised others can do the same i didnt say that krispos paused to put what he felt into words it was easier for me because people looked down at me for so long they didnt take me seriously for a long time i dont think petronas took me seriously until the siege train came up to antigonos but hed known your father for years and your father managed to keep his trust till the instant he came over to me hes always held things to himself dara said he can be surprising i believe you krispos did not want rhisoulphos to surprise him the more he thought about it the more keeping his fatherinlaw under his eye seemed a good idea he let out a long sigh whats the matter dara asked in some concern youre not usually one to be sad afterward im notnot about that i just wish i could have more than moments stolen now and again when i didnt have to fret about every single thing that went on in the palaces and in the city and in the empire and in all the lands that touch on the empire and in all the lands that touch on those lands too by the good god krispos added remembering that the first hed heard of harvas blackrobe was when his raiders ravaged thatagush far to the northeast of videssian territory dara said you could do as anthimos did and simply not fret about things look where that got anthimosaye and the empire too krispos said no im made so i have to fret over anything i know of that needs fretting over and over things you dont know but wish you could find out dara said krispos wry chuckle acknowledged the hit think how much grief i could have saved everyone if id known gnatios was going to help petronas escape from his monastery as it worked out in the end id even have saved petronas grief dara shook her head no he lived for power not for the trappings but for the thing itself you saw that you would have let him live on as a monk but hed sooner have diedand he did krispos thought about it and decided she was right if hed given me the same choice id have yielded up my hair and forgotten the world even though that means giving up women as well dara asked slyly she slid her thigh over till it brushed against his he blinked at her which of us missed the other more i dont know that we missed each other at all strikes me as a good sign we have to live with each other more pleasant if were able to enjoy it something to that krispos admitted he took stock of himself if you wait just a bit longer i might manage another round of proof might you indeed dara got up on hands and knees bent her head over him maybe i can help speed that wait along maybe you can oh yes he reached out to stroke her her curls twisted round his fingers like black snakes later he lay back and watched the bedchamber grow shadowy as afternoon slid toward evening hunger eventually overcame his lassitude he started to reach up to the scarlet bellpull then stopped and got into his robe first he was not anthimos after all moving just as slowly dara also dressed what will you do after supper she asked once hed told barsymes what he wanted spend the night staring at maps with my generals krispos said to please her he tried to sound glum but he looked forward not to the campaign that lay ahead but to the planning that went into it hed never seen a map before he came to videssos the city that there could be pictures of the world fascinated him establishing on one of those pictures where he would be day by day gave him a truly imperial feeling of power think what you could be doing instead dara said if you think so you flatter me he told her im surprised i can walk she stuck out her tongue at him he laughed despite the hard news that began it this had not been a bad day vi krispos shaded his eyes with a hand as he looked northward the horizon ahead was still smooth he sighed and shook his head when i start seeing the mountains ill know im close to the country where i grew up he said close also to where the trouble is sarkis observed aye krispos brief nostalgia deepened to true pain and anger the summer before harvas raiders had gone through the village where hed grown up his sister her husband and their two girls had still lived in the village no one lived there now ungreased wheels squeakedsometimes screamedas supply wagons rattled along horses mules and men afoot kicked up choking clouds of dust soldiers sang and joked why not krispos thought theyre still in their own country if they sang as they came home again he would have done something worth remembering sarkis said the riders we sent ahead toward mavros army should get back to us in the next couple of days then well know how things stand theyll get back to us in a couple of days if alls gone well and mavros has pressed forward mammianos said if hes taken a reverse they wont have had so far to travel to meet up with him so theyll be back sooner but none of themmammianos sarkis or krisposexpected the riders to begin coming back that afternoon the third of their march out from videssos the city yet come back they did with horses driven to bloodymouthed exhaustion and with faces grim and drawn and behind them first by ones and twos then in larger groups came the shattered remains of mavros army krispos ordered an early halt for his troops as evening neared advancing farther would have been like trying to make headway against a strongflowing stream a stream though did not infect with fear the men who moved against it seeing what had befallen their fellows krispos soldiers warily eyed every lengthening shadow as if screaming northern warriors might erupt from it at any moment while the armys healerpriests did what they could for the wounded krispos and his generals questioned haler survivors trying to sift fragments of order from catastrophe not much was to be found a young lieutenant named zernes told the tale as well as anyone majesty they caught us by surprise they waited in the brush along either side of the road south of imbros and hit us as we passed them by by the good god mammianos exploded didnt you have scouts out he muttered something into his beard about puppies who imagined they were generals the scouts were out zernes insisted they were by the lord with the great and good mind the sevastos knew he was not fully trained to command and left all such details to his officers they might not have been so many stavrakioi come again but they knew their craft the scouts found nothing mammianos wheezed laughter at the lieutenants youthful indiscretion krispos had ears only for the long string of past tenses the man used the sevastos knew he left these details where is mavros now majesty on that i cannot take oath zernes said carefully but i do not think he was one of the people lucky enough to break free from the trap and from what we saw the halogai wasted time with few prisoners may he bask in phos light forevermore mammianos said he sketched the sunsign over his breast mechanically krispos did the same the young officers words seemed to reach him from far away even with the foreboding hed had since he learned mavros was on campaign he could not believe his foster brother dead mavros had been always at his side for years had fought anthimos with him had been first to acknowledge him as avtokrator how could he be gone then he found another question a worse one because it dealt with the living how was he to tell tanilis while he grappled with that mammianos asked zernes were you pursued or dont you know having fled so fast no foes afoot could keep up with you the lieutenant bristled as he set a hand to the hilt of his saber he forced himself to ease there was no pursuit excellent sir he said icily aye we were mauled but we hurt the northerners too when they broke off with us they headed back toward the mountains not south on our tails something mammianos grunted what of imbros then excellent sir that i could not say for we never reached imbros zernes answered but since agapetos was beaten north of the town and we to the south i fear the worst thank you lieutenant you may go krispos said trying to make himself function in the face of disaster first mavros throwing his life away now imbros almost surely lost imbros the only city hed ever known till he left his village and came south to the capital hed sometimes sold pigs there and thought it a very grand place though the whole town was not much larger than the plaza of palamas in videssos the city what do we do now your majesty mammianos asked we go on krispos said what other choice have we as the army advanced scouts not only examined stands of brush and other places that might hold an ambushthey also shot arrows into them some of the lesser mages who served under trokoundos rode with the scouting parties to sniff out sorcerous concealments they found none as zernes said harvas army had headed back to its northern home after crushing mavros flocks of ravens and vultures and crows disturbed from thenfeasting rose into the air like black clouds when krispos men came to that dolorous field the birds circled overhead screeching and cawing resentfully burial parties krispos ordered it will cost us the rest of the day mammianos said let it i dont think well catch them on this side of the frontier anyhow krispos said mammianos nodded and passed the command along as the soldiers began their grim task a twist of breeze brought krispos the battlefield stench worse than he had ever smelled it before he coughed and shook his head he walked the field despite the stench to see if he could find mavros body he could not tell it by robes or fine armor harvas men had stayed long enough to loot after several days of hot sun and carrion birds no corpse was easy to identify he saw several that might have been his foster brother but was sure of none the soldiers were quiet in camp that night so quiet that krispos wondered if pausing to bury mavros dead had been wise a sudden attack might well have broken them but the night passed peacefully when morning came priests led the men in prayers of greeting to phos newrisen sun perhaps heartened by that they seemed in better spirits than they had before before the morning was very old a pair of scouts came galloping back to the main body of men they rode straight to krispos saluting one said majesty ahead is something you must see what is it krispos asked the scout spat in the dust of the roadway as if to show his rejection of skotos i wont dirty my tongue with the words to tell you your majesty my eyes have been soiled let my mouth stay clean his comrade nodded vigorously neither would say more krispos traded glances with his officers after a moment he nodded and urged progress forward the halogai of the imperial guard came with him so did trokoundos the wizard muttered to himself choosing charms and readying them in advance against need how far is it krispos asked the scouts round this bend in the road here your majesty answered the horseman who had spoken before just past these oaks while the fellow was not watching krispos made sure his saber was loose in its scabbard a troop of guardsmen pushed ahead of him as the party swung past the trees even so from atop his horse he could see well enough first he noticed only the bodies a hundred or so and that their gear proclaimed them to be videssian soldiers then he saw that each mans hands had been tied behind his back the dead soldiers feet were toward him so he needed a few seconds more than he might have otherwise for his eyes to travel beyond the bodies to the neat pyramid of heads that lay beyond them you see your majesty said the scout who liked to talk i see krispos answered i see helpless prisoners butchered for the sport of it he clutched progress reins so hard his knuckles whitened butchered aye that is well said majesty krispos had never heard a haloga recoil from war and its consequences now geirrod did without prompting the guardsman explained why where is the honor where even is the rightness in using captives so this is the work of one more used to slaying cattle than men its of a piece with what weve seen from harvas and those who follow him krispos hesitated before he went on but what he had to say needed saying sooner or later most of those who follow harvas come out of halogaland will you have qualms about fighting them the guardsmen shouted angrily geirrod said majesty we knew this we talked among ourselves aye we did on how such a fight might be swapping axe strokes with our own kind but no man who could slaughter so or stand by to see others slaying is kin of mine the other northerners shouted again this time in loud agreement shall we start burying this lot majesty the scout asked krispos slowly shook his head no let the whole army see them and with them the sort of foe we fight he knew he was running a risk the massacred prisoners had been set in the road to terrify and his men were none too steady after listening to the survivors from mavros force but he thoughthe hoped this coldblooded killing would raise in all his soldiers the same fury he and the halogai felt a few minutes later the head of the long column rounded that bend in the road krispos gave the guards quick orders they formed up in the roadway and directed the leading horsemen off the track and onto the grass and shrubs that grew alongside some of the troopers began to argue until they saw krispos with the halogai also waving them off he watch closely as his men came upon the grisly warning harvas had left behind they all stared horror filled their faces as was only natural but on most outrage soon ousted it some soldiers swore others sketched the sunsign not a few did both at once their eyes swung from the bodiesand from that ghastly pyramid beyond themto krispos he raised his voice this is the enemy we have loose in our land shall we run back to videssos the city now with our tails between our legs and let him do as he likes in the northlands no the word came deep and determined from many throats at once like the growl of some enormous wolf krispos wished harvas could have heard it soon enough in effect he would krispos set clenched right fist over his heart to salute his soldiers he stayed by the slain videssians until the last wagon jounced past the troops from the middle and back of the column had an idea of what lay ahead of them if armies traveled at the speed of whispers they could cross the empire in a day and a night but knowing and seeing were not the same company by company men stared at the sorry spectaclefirst even knowing in disbelief then with evergrowing anger now we may bury them krispos said when everyone had seen theyve given us their last service by showing what our enemy is like he saluted the dead men before he rode on to retake his place in the advance the mood in camp that night was savage no speech krispos made could have inspired his troops like the fete of their fellows hoping against hope he asked his generals is there any chance well catch up with harvas men on our side of the mountains mammianos plucked at his beard as he examined the map hard to say theyre footsoldiers so we move faster than they do but they have some days start on us too much depends on whats happened at imbros sarkis added if the garrison there still holds firm that might helpdelay the raiders retreat i think imbros still stands krispos said if it had fallen wouldnt we be seeing fugitives from the sack the way we did from mavros army even now a day after he knew the worst he found himself forgetting his foster brother was dead only to be brought up short every so often when he was reminded of it as if he had taken a wound he thought and the injured part pained him every time he tried to use it rhisoulphos said my best guess is that youre right your majesty there are always refugees from a city that falls the lucky the old sometimes the young if an enemy has more mercy than harvas looks to own his mouth tightened as he went on that weve seen no one from imbros at all tells me its people are still safe behind their wall he waved to a plan of the town it seems well enough fortified its like your holding rhisoulphos mammianos said on the border we still need our walls some of the towns in the lowlands in the west though where they havent seen war for a couple of hundred years theyve knocked most of em down and used the stone for houses fools rhisoulphos said succinctly krispos turned the talk back to the issue at hand suppose we find harvas men or some of them still besieging imbros whats the best way to hurt them then pray to phos the lord who made the princes first that we catch them so your majesty sarkis said the strange epithet he used for the good god made krispos recall his vaspurakaner blood he went on if we do theyll be smashed between our hammer and an anvil of the garrison may it be so krispos said all the generals murmured in agreement pragmatic as usual rhisoulphos had the last word one way or the other well know for certain in a couple of days half a day south of imbros the land began to look familiar to krispos that was as far as hed ever traveled back in the days before he set out for videssos the city he took it as a signal to order the army to full battle alert that brought less change than it might have under other circumstances for the men had kept themselves ready to fight since theyd seen the slaughtered prisoners scouts darted ahead to sniff out the enemy when they returned their news brought a sober smile to krispos face for theyd spied hundreds perhaps thousands of people outside imbros what could that be save harvas besieging force he exulted we have them trumpets shouted krispos army knew what that meant knew what it had to mean the videssian soldiers thoroughgoing professionals the lot of them waved their lances and yowled like so many horse nomads off the steppes of pardraya against a foe like harvas even professionals grew eager to fight smooth with long practice the troops swung themselves from column to line of battle forward cried horns and drums the army surged ahead wild and irresistible as the sea officers shouted warning men to keep horses fresh for combat we have them krispos said again he drew his saber and brandished it over his head mammianos stared a trifle goggleeyed at the ferocity the soldiers displayed aye majesty if harvas truly did sit down in front of imbros we just may id not reckoned him so foolish the generals words set off a warning bell in krispos mind harvas had shown himself cruel and vicious never yet so far as krispos could see had he been foolish counting on his stupidity now struck krispos as dangerous he said as much to mammianos the fat general looked thoughtful i see what you mean majesty maybe he wants us to come haring along so he can serve us as he did mavros if we miss an ambush just what im thinking krispos said he called to the musicians soldiers cursed and shouted when at a walk rang out krispos yelled for trokoundos when the mage rode up he told him i want you out in front of the army if you cant sense sorcerous screening for an ambush no one can as may be so your majesty trokoundos answered soberly harvas has uncommonand unpleasantmagical skill nevertheless i shall do what i can for you he clucked to his horse using reins and his boot heels to urge the animal into a trot with the rest of the army walking he was soon up among the scouts the advance continued though more slowly than before no cunningly hidden sorcerous pit yawned in the roadway no hordes of halogai charged roaring from the shelter of brush or trees the only damage was to the fields the army trampled as it moved ahead in line of battle looking off to left and right krispos saw ruined villages and suspected few farmers were left to work those fields in any case a gray smudge on the northern horizon light against the green woods and purple mountains behind it imbros wall now it was krispos turn to yowl he turned to mammianos and showed his teeth like a wolf were here excellent sir in spite of all our worries by the good god so we are mammianos glanced first to krispos then to the musicians krispos nodded at the trot gentlemen mammianos said the musicians passed along the command the soldiers cheered imbros drew nearer krispos saw in the distance the people outside the walls that his scouts had reported his wolfs grin grew wide but then slipped from his face why did harvas men simply hold their position if he saw them surely they had seen him but no one around the walls moved nor did anyone seem to be on those walls up ahead with the scouts trokoundos suddenly wheeled his horse and galloped back toward krispos he was shouting something over the noise any moving army makes krispos needed a few seconds to hear what it was dead theyre all dead who whos dead troopers yelled at the wizard krispos echoed them for a heady moment he imagined disease had struck down harvas host where they stood they deserved nothing better he thought with somber glee but trokoundos answered the folk of imbros all piteously slain he reined in leaned down onto his horses neck and wept without shame or restraint krispos spurred his horse forward after trokoundos warning after the way the wizard usually so selfcontrolled had broken down he thought he was braced for the worst he needed only moments to discover how little he had imagined what the worst might be the people of imbros were not merely slain they had been impaled thousands of themmen women and childreneach on his own separate stake the stakes were uniformly black all the way to the ground with old dried blood the soldiers who advanced with krispos stared in disbelieving horror at the spectacle harvas had left behind for them they were no strangers to dealing out death some of them perhaps were no strangers to massacre on the sordid but human scale of the butchered prisoners farther south but at imbros the size of the massacre was enough to daunt even a monster of a man sarkis swatted at the flies that rose in buzzing clouds from the swollen stinking corpses well your majesty now we know why no fugitives came south from imbros to warn us of its fall he said no one was able to flee this cant be everyone who lived in imbros krispos protested he knew his heart was speaking not his mind he could see how many people squatted on their stakes in a ghastly parody of alertness in a way though he was proven right as the army made its way through the neat concentric rows of bodies to imbros wall the men soon discovered how harvas warriors had entered the city the northern quadrant of those walls was cast down in ruins down to the very ground like develtos trokoundos said his eyes were red tears still tracked his cheeks he held his voice steady by force of will like a man controlling a restive horse like develtos save that they must have been hurried there here they had the time to do their proper job when krispos entered imbros he found what had befallen the rest of the folk who had dwelt there they lay dead in the streets the town had been burned over their heads after they fell mostly men in here id say mammianos observed and lookheres a mail shirt that missed getting stolen these must have been the ones who tried to fight back once they were gone looks like harvas had his filthy fun with everyone else aye krispos said calmly discussing the hows and whys of wholesale slaughter as he went through its aftermath struck him as grotesque but if he was to understandas well as an ordinary man could ever grasp such destructionwhat else were he and his followers to do he walked the dead streets of the murdered city trokoundos at his side and a troop of halogai all around him to protect against anything that might lurk there yet the northerners peered every which way their pale eyes wide they muttered to themselves in their own tongue at last narvikka asked majesty why all thisthis making into nothing to sack a town to despoil a town is all very well but for what purpose did our cousins slay this town and then cast the corpse onto the fire id hoped you could tell me krispos said the guardsman as was the haloga way had stripped the problem to its core war for loot war for belief war for territory made sense to krispos but what reason could lie behind war for the sake of utter devastation narvikka made a sign with his fingershad he been a videssian krispos guessed he would have drawn the suncircle over his heart that guard said majesty i cannot fathom the minds of the men who fought here that they are of my folk raises only shame in me renegades and outlawed men would not act so much less warriors from honest holdings other northerners nodded but they did act so krispos said every time he breathed he took in the miasma of dead flesh and old smoke he let his feet lead him through imbros even after so many years away they seemed to remember how the bigger streets ran before long he found himself in the central market square looking across it toward the temple once hed thought that temple the grandest building hed ever seen now he knew it was but a provincial imitation of phos high temple in videssos the city and not a particularly impressive one either but even fireravaged as it was now it still raised memories in him memories of awe and faith and belief those memories clashed terribly with the row of impaled bodies in front of the temple the first hed seen inside imbros who had received that treatment rather than the quicker cleaner death of axe or sword or fire what with the stains of blood and smoke he needed a moment to realize those victims all wore the blue robe he sketched the sunsign so did trokoundos beside him did i not hear they were savage to priests in develtos as well the wizard asked quietly aye so they were krispos boots clicked on flagstones as he walked across the square toward the temple he stepped around a couple of corpses of the ordinary crumpled sort by now numb with the scale of the butchery here he found them hardly more than obstacles in his path but what the priests had suffered penetrated even that numbness though some days dead their bodies still gave mute testimony to those special torments as if impalement were insufficient anguish some had had their manhood cut away other their guts stretched along the ground for the carrion birds still others their beardsand their facesburned away krispos turned his back on them then made himself look their way once more may phos take their souls into the light so may it be trokoundos said but skotos seems to have had his way with their bodies together he and krispos spat krispos said all this ground will have to be blessed before we can rebuild who would want to live here otherwise after this he nodded to himself ill suspend taxes for the new folk i move in and keep them off for a while to try another way to make people want to stay once theyve come spoken like an emperor trokoundos said spoken like a man who wants imbros to be a living city again soon krispos said impatiently its a bulwark against whoever raids down from kubrat and in peacetime its the main market town for the land near the mountains and now majesty trokoundos said will you pause to bury the dead here no krispos said impatient still i want to come to grips with harvas as soon as i can he glanced toward the sun which stood low in the westdays were shorter now than they had been while he laid siege to petronas again he cursed the time hed had to spend in civil war theres not a lot of summer left to waste no denying that your majesty trokoundos said but he let the word hang krispos had no trouble finishing for him but harvas knows that too aye im all too sure he does im all too sure he has some deviltry brewing too just waiting for us i trust my soldiers to match his as for magichow strong can harvas be trokoundos lips twisted in a grin that seemed gayer than it was i expect your majesty that before too long i shall find out more eager for fighting than any army krispos had known his force stormed north up the highway after harvas raiders imbros was their cry the name of the murdered city was never far from their lips the paristrian mountains towered against the northern horizon now the highest peaks still snowcovered even in later summer some of the men from the western lowlands exclaimed at them to krispos they werenot old friends for he remembered the kind of weather that blew over them through half the year but a presence to which he was accustomed all the same everything hereabouts seemed familiar from the quality of the light paler and grayer than it was in videssos the city to the fields of ripening wheat and barley and oatsworked now only by the few farmers lucky enough to have escaped harvas men to the way little tracks ran off the highway now to the east now to the west krispos pulled progress out of the line of march when he came to one of those roads he stared west along it for a long time his mind ranging farther than his eyes could reach what is it majesty geirrod asked at last he had to speak twice before krispos heard him my village lies down this road krispos answered or rather it did harvas bandits went through here last year he shook his head when i left i hoped id come back with money in my belt pouch i never dreamed it would be as avtokrator or that the people i grew up with wouldnt be here to greet me the world is as it is majesty not always as we dream it will be too true well enough time wasted here krispos tapped progress flanks with his heels the big bay gelding walked then went into a trot that soon brought krispos back to his proper place in the column the road ran straight up toward the gap in the mountains past empty fields past stands of oak and maple and pine past a small chuckling stream and as the ground grew higher past more and more outcroppings of cold gray stone though krispos had not seen it since he was perhaps nine years old the gray landscape seemed eerily familiar he and his parents and sisters had come down this road after iakovitzes ransomed them and hundreds of other videssian peasants from captivity in kubrat he must have been keyed up almost to fever pitch then for fear the kubratoi would change their minds and swoop down again for everything on that journey remained as vivid in his mind as if hed lived it yesterday the way water splashed from that clump of rocks in the stream had not changed at all in the two decades since save that frogs had perched on them then the mountains themselves ive always been happier to see them getting smaller krispos thought they were not getting smaller now worse luck krispos peered up and ahead now he could see the opening of the pass that led to kubrat agapetos got through with less force than i have he thought i will too when he said that aloud mammianos grunted aye agapetos got through but he couldnt maintain himself north of the mountains and harvas beat him again on this side then came down first on imbros and then onto mavros army strikes me hes been able to defeat us in detail if you know what i mean are you telling me i shouldnt attack krispos asked scowling after all hes done to us how can i halt now the image of thousands of bodies each gruesomely buggered by its own stake shoved itself forward in his mind with it came a new vision that of hundreds of men matteroffactly cutting and sharpening those stakes how could they have kept to their work knowing what the stakes would be used for even kubratoi would have gagged on such cruelty he thought and halogai judging by long experience with the imperial guards were harsh but rarely vicious what made harvas men so different mammianos reply brought him back to the hereandnow all im saying your majesty is that harvas strikes me as dangerous enough to need hitting with everything the empire has the more i see the more i think that what we have with us is strong aye but is it strong enough by the good god mammianos i aim to find out krispos said mammianos bowed his head in submission he could suggest but when the avtokrator decided his lot was to obey or to mutiny krispos thought but mammianos had seen plenty of better chances than this for mutiny his disagreement with krispos lay in how best to hurt harvas not whether to the army camped just out of bowshot of the foothills that night peering north in the darkness krispos saw the slopes of the mountains ahead dimly illuminated by orange flickering light he summoned mammianos and pointed does that mean what i think bide a moment majesty while the campfire glare leaves my eyes like krispos mammianos stood with his back to the imperial camp at last he said aye it does theyre encamped there waiting for us forcing the pass wont be easy krispos said no it wont the general agreed all kinds of things can go wrong when you try to barge through a defended pass a holding force at the narrowest part will plug it up while they roll rocks down from either side or maybe come charging down from ambushthatd be easy for harvas buggers because theyre footsoldiers perhaps i should have listened to you before krispos said aye majesty perhaps you should mammianos saidas close to criticism of the emperor as he would let himself come krispos plucked at his beard he could not pull back not having come so far not having seen imbros not unless he wanted to forfeit the armys faith in him forevermore going blindly forward though was a recipe for disaster if he had some idea of what lay ahead he whistled to one of his guardsmen fetch me trokoundos he said the wizard was yawning when he arrived but cast off sleepiness like an old tunic when krispos explained what he wanted he nodded thoughtfully i know a scrying spell that should serve your majesty one subtle enough that no barbarian mage no mage not formally trained should even be able to detect it let alone counteract it against petronas it would not have sufficed for skeparnas was my match near enough but against harvas it should do very well however strong in magic he may be he is bound to be unschooled if you will excuse me when trokoundos returned he held in his hand a bronze bracelet haloga workmanship he explained as he showed it to krispos i found it outside of imbros i think we may take it as proven that one of harvas raiders lost it by the law of contagion it is still bonded to its onetime owner a bond we may now use to our advantage spare the lecture sir mage mammianos said so long as you learn what we need to know i care not how you do it very well trokoundos said stiffly he held the bracelet out at arms length toward the north then started a slow soft chant the chant went on and on krispos was beginning to get both worried and annoyed when trokoundos finally lowered the bracelet as he turned the campfire shadowed the lines of puzzlement on his face let me try again with a variant of the spell perhaps the owner of the bracelet was slain nonetheless it remains affiliated albeit more loosely with the army as a whole he began to chant once more krispos could not tell any difference between this version of the spell and the other but was willing to believe it was there but he found no difference in the result after some time trokoundos halted in baffled frustration majesty he said so far as i can tell by my sorcery theres no one at all up ahead what thats absurd krispos said we can see the fires they could be a bluff your majesty mammianos put in you dont believe that krispos said no your majesty i dont but it could be so i tell you what though ill send out a couple of scouts theyll come back with what we need to know good do it krispos said aye do it trokoundos agreed by the good god excellent sir i hope it is a bluff ahead as you say the alternative is believing that harvas has a renegade videssian mage in his service and after imbros i would sooner not believe that the wizard made a sour face decisively shook his head no it cant be id have sensed that my spell was being masked i didnt have that feeling only the emptiness id get if there truly were no men ahead the scouts slipped out of camp they looked to be ideal soldiers for their task had krispos met them on the streets of videssos the city he would have unhesitatingly guessed they were thieves small lithe and wary they carried only daggers and vanished into the night without a sound yawning krispos said wake me as soon as they get back worn though he was he did not sleep well thoughts of imbros would not leave his mind or worse his dreams he was relieved when a guardsman came in to rouse him and tell him the scouts had returned a thin crescent moon had risen in the east dawn was not far away the scoutsthere were three of themprostrated themselves before him get up get up he said impatiently what did you see a whole great lot of halogai your majesty one of them answered in a flat upcountry accent like the one krispos had had before he came to videssos the city the other two scouts nodded to confirm his words he went on and you know how the pass jogs westward so you cant see all the way up it from here just past the jog theyve gone and built themselves a breastwork be nasty getting past there your majesty their armys real then krispos said more than a little surprised trokoundos would not be pleased to learn his sorcery had gone astray majesty we sneaked close enough to smell the shit in their slit trenches the scout answered you dont get a whole lot realer than that krispos laughed true enough two goldpieces to each of you for your courage now go get what rest you can the scouts saluted and hurried off toward their tents krispos thought about going back to bed too decided not to bother better to watch the sun come up than to toss and turn and think about stakes the eastern rim of the sky grew gray then the pale bluishwhite that seems to stretch the eye to some infinite distance then pink when the sun crawled above the horizon krispos bowed to it as if to phos himself recited the creed and spat between his feet to show he rejected skotos most of the time he hardly thought about that part of the ritual not now imbros reminded him of what he was rejecting the camp stirred with the sun at first slowly blindly like a plants silent striving toward light but then with greater purpose as horns rang out to rout sleepers from tents and prod them into the routine of another day they lined up with bowls in front of cookpots where barley porridge bubbled gnawed at hard bread cheese and onions gulped wine under the watchful eyes of underofficers who made sure they did not gulp too much and tended to their horses so the animals would also be ready for the days work ahead krispos went back to his tent and armed himself he swung himself up onto progress and rode over to the musicians at his command they played assemble the troopers gathered before them krispos raised a hand for silence and waited until he had it soldiers of videssos he said hoping everyone could hear him the enemy waits for us ahead youve seen the kind of foe he is how he loves to slay those who cant fight back a low growl ran through the army krispos went on now we can pay harvas back for everything for the slaughters in develtos last year and imbros now and for agapetos men and mavros too will we turn aside no the men roared never then forward and fight bravely krispos drew his saber and held it high overhead the soldiers whooped and cheered they were eager to fight krispos needed no fancy turns of phrase to inspire them today that was as wellhe knew anthimos for instance had been a far better speaker than he would ever be he owned neither the gift nor the inclination for wrapping around his ideas of the flights of fancy that videssian rhetoric demanded his only gift such as it was was for plain thoughts plainly spoken as the army left camp krispos told sarkis well want plenty of scouts out in front of us and farther ahead than usual its taken care of your majesty the vaspurakaner officer said with a small tight smile the country ahead reminds me all too much of the land where i grew up you soon learn to check out a pass before you send everyone through or you die young he chuckled i suppose over the generations it improves the breed dismount some of those scouts too krispos said as a new worry struck him well want to spy out the sides of the pass not just the bottom and they cant very well do that very well from horseback he stopped flustered so much for plain thoughts plainly spoken you know what i mean aye your majesty its taken care of sarkis repeated he sketched a salute for one who came so late to soldiering youve learned a good deal have i told you of the saying of my people sneaky as a prince krispos cut him off yes you have he knew he was rude but he was also nervous the scouts had just followed the western jog of the pass and disappeared from sight he clucked to progress leaned forward in the saddle and urged the gelding up to a fast trot with the pressure of knees and heels then he rounded that jog himself the breastwork of turf and stones and brush and whatever else had been handy stood a few hundred yards ahead blocking the narrowest part of the pass behind it krispos saw at last the warriors who had ravaged the empire so savagely the big fierce fairhaired men saw him too or the imperial banner that floated near him they jeered and brandished weapons no krispos saw harvas men were holding up stout stakes carved to a point at both endsimpaling stakes fury filled him rage more perfect and absolute than any he had ever known he wanted to slay with his own sword every marauder in front of him only a wild charge by all his men seemed a bearable second best he filled his lungs to cry out the order but something cold and calculating dwelt within him too something that would not let him give way to impulse no matter how tempting he thought again and shouted arrows bowstrings thrummed as the videssian archers went to work from horseback instead of their stakes the halogai lifted yardwide shields of wood to turn aside the shafts they were not bowmen they could not reply here and there all along the enemy line men crumpled or lurched backward clutching at their wounds and shrieking but the raiders wore mail shirts and helms even shafts that slipped between shields and over the rampart were no sure kills and however steeped in wickedness they might have been harvas followers were not cowards the archery stung them it could do no more by the time he saw that krispos had full control of himself once more can we flank them out he demanded of mammianos its steep broken ground to either side of that breastwork the general answered better going for foot than for horse still worth a try i suppose and the cheapest way to go about it if we can get in their rear theyre done for despite his doubts the general yelled orders couriers dashed off to relay them to the soldiers on both wings several companies peeled off to try the rough terrain on the flanks harvas halogai rushed men up the slopes of the pass to head them off the northerners had known what they were about when they built their barricade they had walled off all the ground worth fighting on the horses of their videssian foes had to pick their way forward step by step afoot harvas men were rather more agile but they too scrambled stumbled and often fell some did not get up again now that the foe was away from cover and concerned more with his footing than his shield he grew more vulnerable to archery but the videssians could not simply shoot their way to victory they had to force the northerners from their ground and at close quarters the footsoldiers gave as good as they got or better saber and light lance against axe and slashing sword krispos watched his men battle the halogai who followed harvas sudden pain made him wonder if he was wounded until he realized he had his lip tight between his teeth with a distinct effort of will he made himself relax a moment later the pain returned this time he ignored it for all the encouragement he shouted for all the courage the videssian cavalry displayed the terrain proved too rugged for them to advance against determined foes krispos wished harvas northerners were less brave than his own guardsmen they did not seem so he watched a haloga with a lance driven deep into his side hack from the saddle the man who had skewered him before he too toppled no help for it mammianos bawled in his ear if we want em well have to go through em not around we want em krispos said mammianos nodded and turned to the musicians they raised horns and pipes to their lips poised sticks over drums the wild notes of the charge echoed brassily from the boulders that studded both slopes of the pass the videssians in the front rank raised a cheer and spurred toward the breastwork that barred their way north the front was too narrow for more than a fraction of the imperial army to engage the enemy at once rhisoulphos who led the regiments just behind the van shouted for his troops to hold up a gap opened between them and the men ahead when krispos looked back and saw that gap his own suspicions about his fatherinlaw and daras warning came together in a hard certainty of treason he slapped a courier on the shoulder fetch me rhisoulphos at once if he wont come either drag him here or kill him the rider stared then set spurs to his horse with an angry squeal the beast bounded away krispos fist gripped the hilt of his saber as tightly as if that were rhisoulphos neck leave the head of the army to face harvas howling killers by itself would he krispos was so sure rhisoulphos would not willingly accompany his courier that when his fatherinlaw did ride up to him the best he could do was splutter by the good god what are you playing at giving our troops room to retreat in of course your majesty rhisoulphos answered if he was a traitor he did it marvelously well so what i already know hes good at that krispos thought but rhisoulphos went on its a standard ploy when fighting halogai your majesty feigning a withdrawal will often lure them out of their position so we can wheel about and take them while theyre in disorder krispos glanced over at mammianos the fat general nodded oh krispos said good enough his ears were hot but his helmet covered them so no one could see the flame the videssians at the barriers slashed and thrust at harvas men who chopped at them and their horses both the shrieks and oaths dinned through the pass then above them rose a long mournful call the horsemen wheeled their mounts and broke off combat the northerners screamed abuse in their own language in the speech of the kubratoi and in broken videssian a couple of men started to scramble over the breastwork to pursue the retreating imperials their own comrades dragged them back by main force oh a plague on them mammianos said when he saw that why cant they make it easy for us thats better discipline than they usually show rhisoulphos said the military manuals claim that tactic hardly ever fails against the northerners i dont think harvas shows up in the military manuals krispos said one corner of rhisoulphos mouth twitched upward i suspect youre right your majesty he pointed but there he stands whether hes in the manuals or not krispos eyes followed rhisoulphos finger of course that tall figure behind the enemy line had to be harvas blackrobe none of his followers was garbed in similar style despite the chieftains sobriquet krispos had looked for someone gaudily clada ruler needed to stand out from his subjects so harvas did but by virtue of plainness rather than splendor had his hooded robe been blue rather than black he could have passed for a videssian priest regardless of how he dressed no doubt he led halogai heavily ran here and there at his bidding doing their best to ignore the weight of mail on their shoulders and when harvas raised his armsthose wide black sleeves flapped like vultures wingsthe northerners held their places for halogai that was the more remarkable mammianos glowered at the northerners as if their good order personally affronted him with a wheezy sigh he said if they wont come out after us well have to get in there nose to nose with them and drive them away the words plainly tasted bad in his mouth getting in there nose to nose was not a style of fighting upon which the subtle imperials looked kindly but when subtlety failed brute force remained as captains dressed their lines and troopers reached over their shoulders to see how many arrows their quivers held the fierce notes of the charge rang out once more the videssians thundered toward the breastwork ahead krispos they shouted and imbros harvas raised his arms this time he pointed not toward his soldiers or their rampart but up the slope of the pass not far from krispos trokoundos reeled in the saddle call the men back majesty he cried clinging to his seat more by determination than anything else call them back krispos and his generals stared at the mage by the good god why should i krispos demanded angrily battle magic trokoundos croaked the roar of boulders bounding downslope drowned him out because he was looking at trokoundos krispos did not see the first great stones leap free of the ground on which they had placidly rested for years perhaps for centuries that night one of the soldiers who had seen them said you ever watch a rabbit thats all of a sudden spooked by a hound thats what those rocks were doing except they didnt jump every which way they came down on us the noise the boulders made as they crashed into the videssian cavalrymen was the noise that might have come from a smithy in the instant a giant stepped on it horses went down as if scythed pitching riders off their backs the beasts behind them could not stop fast enough and crashed into them and into the stones that only made the chaos worse the men and horses of the very foremost ranks were almost upon the breastwork when the avalanche began soldiers turned their heads to gape at what had happened to their comrades some drew rein in consternation other pressed on toward the barricade now the halogai howling with ferocious glee swarmed over it to meet them the imperials at the head of the charge fought back desperately no one could come to their aid through the writhing tangle behind them krispos watched and cursed and slammed a fist against his thigh as harvas northerners overwhelmed his men one by one harvas raised his arms and pointed again more boulders sprang from their proper places and crashed down on the videssian armys van make them stop krispos screamed to trokoundos i wish i could the wizards face was haggard his eyes wild he shouldnt be able to do this the stress the excitement of combat weaken magics grip even if the sorceries are readied in advance ive tried counterspellsthey go awry as they should what can we do then majesty i have not the power to stand against harvas not even with my colleagues here trokoundos sounded as if admitting that cost him physical pain perhaps with more mages masters from the sorcerers collegium he may yet be defeated but not now krispos said no majesty not now he screened his encamped army so i could not detect it he works battle magic so strong and unexpected that it almost broke me when he unleashed it majesty a good many years have passed since i owned myself daunted by any sorcerer but today harvas daunts me ahead at the barricade almost all the videssians were down they and the crushed soldiers behind them blocked the armys way forward krispos glance slid to the slopes of the pass who could guess how many more boulders needed only harvas sorcerous command to smash into the imperials or what other magics harvas had waiting we retreat krispos said tasting gall good for you your majesty mammianos said startled krispos turned in the saddle to stare at him good for you the fat general repeated knowing when to cut your losses is a big part of this business i feared youd order us to press on regardless and turn a defeat into a disaster its already a disaster krispos said even as the call to retreat rang mournfully through the pass mammianos shook his head no majesty were still in decent order theres no panic and the men will be ready to fight another daywell maybe another season but if that hewitch ahead does much more to us theyll turn tail every time they see his ruffians whether hes with em or not cold comfort but bettera bit betterthan none krispos own halogai closed around him as rearguard while the army withdrew from the pass if the northerners wanted to slay him and go over to their countrymen they would never have a better chance the imperial guardsmen looked back only to shake fists at videssos foes and yet in a way the guards were the least of krispos worries his eyes like those of so many others with him kept sliding up the sides of the pass while he wondered whether more great stones would smash men and horses to jelly if harvas had time to ready stones through the whole length of the pass disaster great enough to satisfy even mammianos criteria might yet befall the army somehow retreat did not become rout the boulders on the slopes held their places at last those slopes grew lower and farther apart as the pass opened out into the country below the mountains back to our old campsite mammianos asked why not krispos said bitterly that way we can pretend today never happenedthose of us who are still alive at any rate mammianos tried to console him we cant do these little tricks without losses seems we cant even do them with losses krispos said to which the general only grunted by way of reply any camp is joyless after a defeat wounded men scream round winners tents too but they and their comrades who come through whole know they have accomplished what they set out to do losers enjoy no such consolation not only have they suffered they have suffered and failed failure krispos remembered made petronas army break up he ordered stronger sentry detachments posted south of the camp than to the north the officers to whom he gave the command did not remark on it but nodded knowingly as they saw to carrying it out krispos walked to the outskirts of the camp where badly wounded men lay waiting for healerpriests to attend to them the soldiers not too far gone in their own anguish saluted him and tried to smile which made him feel worse than he had before but he made sure he saw all of them and spoke to as many as he could before he went back to his own tent darkness had fallen by then krispos wanted nothing more than to sleep to forget about the days misfortunes if only for a few hours but a duty harder even than visiting the wounded lay ahead of him hed kept putting off writing to tanilis of mavros death hed hoped to be able to say he had avenged it now that hope had vanishedand how much in any case would it have mattered to her her only son was gone krispos inked his pen and sat staring at the blank parchment in front of him how to begin krispos avtokrator of the videssians to the excellent and noble lady tanilis greetings thus far formula took him but no farther he needed the smooth phrases that came naturally to anyone who had the rhetorical training that went with a proper education he did not have them and would not entrust this letter to a secretary majesty geirrods deep voice came from outside the tent what is it krispos put down the pen with a strange mixture of relief and guilt the guardsmans reply warned him he had known relief too soon a matter of honor majesty the last haloga to speak of honor in that tone of voice had been vagn talking about killing himself krispos ducked out through the tent flap in a hurry whats touched your honor geirrod he asked not my honor alone your majesty but the honor of all my folk who take your gold geirrod said krispos was tall for a videssian he still had to look up at geirrod as the stern northerner went on i am chosen to stand for all of us since i was first to bow before you as lord so you were krispos agreed and i honor you for that do you doubt it geirrod shook his massive head exasperated krispos snapped then how have i failed youaye and all the other halogai too by not sending us forth in combat this day against those who follow harvas and holding us back despite what we told you on the road south of imbros geirrod said it struck many among us as a slur as a token you lack trust in us better we fare home to halogaland than carry our axes where we may not blood them videssians delight in having troops for show we took oath to fight for you majesty not to look grand in your processions if you truly think i held you back for fear you would betray me blood your axe now geirrod not without second thoughtsthe halogai could be grimly literalkrispos bent his head and waited when no blow came he straightened up and looked at geirrod again since you do not think so how can you have lost any honor on account of me the guardsman stiffened to attention majesty you speak sooth i see this cannot be so i shall say as much to my countrymen any who doubt me may measure their doubt against this he hefted his axe good enough krispos said tell them also that i didnt send them forward because i hoped i could clear the halogai harvas halogai i meanaway from the barricade with archery if it had worked we would have won the fight without costing ourselves too dear geirrod let out a loud snort you may think partway as we halogai do majesty but i see that at bottom youre a videssian after all as it should be i guess cant be helped come what may but a fight has worth for its own sweet sake the time for reckoning up the cost is afterward not before as you say geirrod to krispos the northerners words were insanely reckless he knew the halogai knew most videssians thought as he did and also knew the halogai reckoned imperials overcautious at best in war at worst simply dull the halogai fought for the red joy of it not to gain advantage that he supposed was why no videssians served a northern chieftain as bodyguards nor likely ever would as he went back into the tent geirrod resumed his post outside evidently satisfied with their exchange krispos allowed himself the luxury of a long quiet sigh he hadnt lied to geirrod not quite but he had entertained doubts about the halogai but by asking geirrod if he believed his countrymen were held back from fear of treachery krispos had taken the onus off himself the next time he faced harvas men though he did not think he would have to hold back his guardsmen he sat down at the little folding table that served him for a desk in the field parchment and pen were where hed left them when geirrod called but for the salutation the parchment remained blank krispos sighed again he wished trokoundos knew a spell to make unpleasant letters write themselves but that probably went beyond sorcery into outandout miracleworking after one more sigh krispos inked the pen again as was his habit he plunged straight ahead with what he had to say my lady while i was fighting petronas in the westlands mavros heard agapetos had been beaten and took an army north from videssos the city to stop harvas blackrobe from moving farther forward i grieve to have to tell you that as you foresaw your son was also beaten and was killed setting down the words brought back to him afresh the loss of his foster brother he studied what hed written was it too bald he decided it was not tanilis approved of straightforward truth and in any case he thought she might well already know mavros was dead being who and what she was he thought for a while before he wrote more i loved mavros as if he were my brother by birth i would have kept him from attacking harvas if id known that was in his mind but he hid it from me till too late you will know better than i do that going ahead no matter what was always his way he spread fine sand over the letter to dry the ink then he turned over the parchment and wrote on the reverse the excellent and noble lady tanilis on her estate outside opsikion he sanded those words dry too then rolled the letter up into a small tube with them on the outside after tying it shut he let several large drops of sealing wax fall across the ribbon that closed it while the wax was still soft he pressed his signet into it he stared at the imperial sunburst for a long time it remained as perfect as if his armies had won three great victories instead of being thrashed three times running and seeing a city sacked and its populace destroyed he stuck his head out of the tent to call for a courier as the fellow stuffed the letter into a waterproof tube krispos promised himself that before the war with harvas was done the empire would again become as whole and complete as its seal he was glad hed made the vow but would have felt easier about it had he been surer he could bring it to pass vii videssos the city mourned along with the mourning came no little fear not since the wild days three centuries before when the khamorth tribes swarmed off the steppes of pardraya to carve kubrat khatrish and thatagush from the empire of videssos had the folk of the capital felt threatened from the north people act as if were going to be besieged tomorrow krispos complained to iakovitzes a few days after hed returned to the city harvas killers are on their own side of the paristrian mountains theyll likely stay there till spring iakovitzes scribbled in his tablet and passed it to krispos not even harvas is wizard enough to stop the fall rains he pointed upward cocking a hand behind his ear krispos nodded raindrops were drumming on the roof last year i cursed the rains when they came early because they kept me from going after petronas now i bless mem because they keep harvas out of the empire iakovitzes took back the tablet and wrote some more phos closes his ears to curses and blessing both as far as weather goes he hears too many of each no doubt youre right krispos said it doesnt stop people from sending them up though and harvas being a couple of hundred miles from here doesnt stop people from looking north over their shoulders every time they hear a loud noise in the next street it wont last iakovitzes wrote with confident cynicism remember city folk are fickle pyrrhos will give them something new to think about soon enough krispos winced dont remind me more than ever he wished gnatios had stayed loyal to him gnatios was politician as well as priest which made him pliable pyrrhos chose a course and pursued it with all the power he hadand as ecumenical patriarch he had more power perhaps than anyone save krispos he also cared not a copper whether the course he chose raised the hackles of every other ecclesiastic in the empire sometimes krispos thought he aimed at just that whether he did or not he was accomplishing it ive known him longer than you have if youll remember iakovitzes wrote after all hes my cousin he doesnt approve of me either of course he doesnt approve of anything much as youll have noticed he made the throaty noise he used for laughter no wonder he doesnt approve of you krispos laughed too iakovitzes sybaritic habits and unending pursuit of handsome youths did not endear him to his stern ascetic cousin krispos went on i notice you havent slowed down either if anything youre squiring more lads around than ever krispos wondered if after his mutilation iakovitzes had plunged so deeply back into the world of the senses to remind himself he was still alive the noble made that throaty noise again backward your majesty he wrote these days they squire me krispos started to laugh once more too but stopped when he saw iakovitzes face by the good god you mean it he said slowly but howwhy you know i mean you no disrespect excellent sir but youve baffled me iakovitzes wrote one word in big letters unique grinning he pointed to himself then wrote again where else would they find the like and like it they do he leered at krispos krispos did not quite know whether to laugh some more or to be revolted barsymes came in and saved him from his dilemma i have here a petition for your majesty the vestiarios said holding out a folded piece of parchment it is from the monk gnatios nothing in his voice showed that gnatios had ever held high rank speak of him and he pops up krispos observed he took the parchment from barsymes the eunuch bowed his way out krispos glanced toward iakovitzes as he opened the petition do you want to hear this at iakovitzes nod krispos read aloud the humble sinful and repentant monk gnatios to his radiant and imperial majesty krispos avtokrator of the videssians greetings he snorted likes to lay it on thick doesnt he hes a courtier iakovitzes wrote which seemed to say everything he thought necessary krispos resumed i beg leave to request the inestimable privilege of a brief interruption in my sojourn in the monastery dedicated to the memory of the holy skirios so that i might enjoy the boon of your presence and acquaint you with the results of certain of my historical researches these having been resumed at your behest as the said results reflections of antiquity though they be also appear of significance in the empires current condition he put down the parchment whew if i have trouble understanding his request why should i expect his historical researches whatever those are to make any better sense gnatios is no ones fool iakovitzes wrote i know that krispos said so why does he take me for one this must be some sort of scheme to have him escape again hed pop up all over the countryside till we caught him again hed preach against pyrrhos and do his best to raise a schism among the priests with harvas to worry about trouble in the temples is the last thing i need that can lead to civil war you wont hear him iakovitzes wrote no by the lord with the great and good mind krispos raised his voice barsymes fetch me pen and ink please when he had the writing tools he scrawled i forbid itk at the bottom of gnatios petition using letters even bolder than the ones iakovitzes had employed to call himself unique then he folded the parchment and handed it to barsymes see that this is delivered back to the monk gnatios he made gnatios title deliberately dismissive it shall be done your majesty the vestiarios said thank you barsymes as the eunuch chamberlain started to leave krispos added when youre done with that could you bring me something from the kitchen i dont much care what but i feel like a snack you too excellent sir iakovitzes nodded and some wine if you would esteemed sir he wrote holding up his tablet so barsymes could read it before long the vestiarios carried in a silver tray with a jar of wine two cups and a covered serving dish when he lifted the cover savory steam rose quails cooked in a sauce of cheese garlic and oregano your majesty i hope they will do fine krispos assured him he attacked his little bird with gusto and finished it in a few bites iakovitzes made slower going of his quail he had to cut the meat into very small pieces and he washed down each little mouthful by tilting back his head and taking a swallow of wine without a tongue he could not push food around inside his mouth or move it toward his throat here though as in other things he evidently managed for hed regained most of the weight his ordeal had taken from him as the noble sucked the last scrap of meat from a leg bone krispos raised his cup in salute im glad to see you doing so well he said im glad to see myself doing so well too iakovitzes wrote krispos snorted they drank together dara straightened her face pale a maidservant wiped the empress mouth and chin with a damp cloth then stooped to pick up the basin at her feet and carry it away i wish i just had morning sickness dara said wearily but i seem to be vomiting any time of the day or night krispos handed her a cup of wine here get the taste out of your mouth dara took a small cautious sip she cocked her head and waited gauging the wines effect on her stomach when the first swallow sat well she drank more she said maybe i should have nursed phostis myself after all the midwives say its harder for a nursing mother to conceive ive heard that krispos said i dont know whether its so whether or not i hope youre better soon so do i dara rolled her eyes but if i do with this baby as i did with phostis ill keep on puking for the next two months oh i hope not but krispos knew he would keep a close eye on the date daras morning sickness stopped and on the day the baby was born he did not doubt her not really though hed been in videssos the city only a couple of days between the campaigns against petronas and harvas he and shed been anything but idle during that little while and her sickness had begun about the right length of time after itno use reckoning by her courses which were still disrupted after phostis birth but hed watched the days all the same dara had cheated with him which meant she might cheat against him he thought that unlikely but avtokrators who ignored the unlikely did not reign long dara said phostis sat up by himself yesterday so his nurse told me krispos did his best to sound pleased try as he would he had trouble warming to phostis he could not help wondering if he was raising a cuckoos chick if this next child is a boy he said to himself and in thinking how much he would enjoy raising it he discovered he was sure it was his dara changed the subject how are the tax revenues looking from the westlands pretty well from the island of kalavria from the peninsula of opsikion from the lands right around the city pretty well from the north krispos did not need to go on only carrion birds found anything worth picking over anywhere near the paristrian mountains will we have enough to fight harvas next spring dara asked she was a generals daughter she knew armies needed money and everything it bought as much as they needed men the logothetes in the treasury say we should krispos answered and with petronas gone at last well be able to bring all our soldiers to bear against him he shook his head how i wish we could have done that this year we might have saved imbros phos be praised that the empire is united now that might have been a mime show cue the eunuch longinos came bustling into the room moving so fast that sweat beaded his fat beardless face majesty he gasped theres word of rioting around the high temple majesty krispos got up and glared at him so fiercely that the eunuch flinched back in alarm with an effort he took hold of his temper tell me about it he said save the news itself your majesty i know no more longinos quavered a soldier carried the report here ive brought it to you fast as i could you did right longinos thank you krispos said in control of himself again take me to this soldier ill hear what he has to say for myself the eunuch turned and left as krispos followed him out the door dara spoke one word pyrrhos that thought had crossed my mind yes krispos said over his shoulder he trotted down the hall after longinos when krispos came out of the imperial residence the soldier prostrated himself then quickly got to his feet he looked like a man who had been caught in a riot his tunic was torn the crown of his widebrimmed hat had been caved in his nose was bloody and a bruise purpled his right cheekbone by the good god man what happened krispos said the man shook his head and ran a sleeve under his nose the ice take me if i know your majesty i was goin along mindin my own business when this crowd boiled out of the forecourt to the high temple they was all screamin and whalin each other with whatever they had handy then they lit into me i still dont have no notion of what its all about but i figured you got to hear of it straightaway so i came here he wiped his nose again im grateful krispos said give me your name if you would im tzouroulos your majesty file closer in mammianos commandselymbrios is captain of my company youre file leader now tzouroulos and youll have a reward you can spend too krispos turned to the halogai who had listened to the exchange with interest vagn go to hmm rhisoulphos regiment in the barracks get them over to the high temple as fast as they can march tell them its riot duty not combatif they start slaying people out of hand the whole citys liable to go up in smoke aye majesty rhisoulphos regiment it is vagn saluted and jogged away his long fair braid flapped against his back at every step he took krispos said to longinos after we get order backby the good gods mercy we willill also want to speak with the most holy ecumenical patriarch pyrrhos to see if he can shed some light on what might have touched off this fighting be so good esteemed sir as to draft for my signature a formal summons for him to come to the grand courtroom and explain himself of course your majesty directly to the grand courtroom you say not here no riots round the temples are a serious business i want to remind pyrrhos just how dim a view i take of them making my inquiries in the courtroom should help him understand that very well your majesty lips moving as he tasted phrases longinos went back into the imperial residence krispos stared east and north toward the high temple the residence and the other buildings of the palace quarter hid its great dome and the gilded spheres that topped its spires but arson often went with riot he did not see the black column of smoke he feared it was the rainy season after all he thought hopefully even if it was only drizzling today walls and fences would still be damp he went inside longinos approached him with the summons he read it over nodded and signed and sealed it the chamberlain took the parchment away krispos waited and worried he knew hed given the proper orders but even the imperial power had limits he needed others to turn those orders into reality the sun was low in the west when a messenger came from rhisoulphos with word that the disturbances had been quelled aye the fellow said cheerfully we broke some heads the city folk dont have the gear to stand against us and besides they keep on fighting each other civilians he finished with a sneer ill want to see some prisoners so i can find out what got these civilians started krispos said we have some the messenger agreed theyre sending them back to the jail in the government office building on middle street ill go there then krispos said glad of something he could do but he could not simply walk over to the big red granite building as any private citizen might before he set out from the imperial residence he required a squad of halogai and the dozen parasolbearers gathering the retinue took awhile so that by the time he set out he needed torchbearers too one of the palace eunuchs must have sent word ahead of his procession for the warders and soldiers at the government offices were ready when he arrived they escorted him to a chamber on the ground level one floor above the cells as soon as he was settled two warders hauled in a captive whose hands were chained in front of him on your belly before his majesty they growled he went to his knees then awkwardly finished the prostration one of the warders said majesty this here is a certain koprisianos he tried to smash in a troopers skull he did wouldve done it too your majesty cept the bastard was wearing a helmet koprisianos said thickly he had an engagingly ugly face though now his up was swollen and split and a couple of teeth looked to be freshly gone never mind that krispos said i want to know what started the fighting in the first place so do i koprisianos said all i know is somebody hit me i turned around and hit him backat least i think it was him lots of people were running by just then all of em screaming about heretics and skotoslovers and phos knows what all else i was giving as good as i got till some stupid soldier broke a spearshaft over my head after that next thing i know is i wake up here oh krispos turned to the warders take him away he just looks to have found himself in the middle of a brawl and enjoyed it bring me people who saw the riot start or who made it start if you can find any wholl admit to that i want to get to the bottom of how it began yes your majesty the warders said together one of them added come on you as they led away koprisianos they were gone for some time before they returned with an older man who wore the tattered remnants of what had been a fine robe this here is a certain mindes he was captured inside the forecourt to the high temple on your belly you mindes performed the proskynesis with the smoothness of a man who had done it before may it please your majesty i have the privilege of serving as senior secretary to the ypologothete gripas he said as he rose a midlevel treasury official krispos thought he said having men sworn to uphold the state captured rioting pleases me not at all mindes how did you come to disgrace yourself that way only because i wanted to hear the most holy patriarch pyrrhos preach your majesty mindes said his words always inspire me and he was particularly vigorous today he spoke of the need for holy zeal in routing out the influence of skotos from every part of our lives and from our city as a whole even some priests he said had tolerated evil too long did he krispos said with a sinking feeling aye your majesty he did and a great deal of truth in what he said too mindes drew the sunsign as well as he could with his hands chained he went on people talked about the sermon afterward as they often do while leaving the high temple several priests notorious for their laxness were named then someone claimed skotos could also profit from too much rigor in the holy hierarchy someone else took that as a deliberate insult against pyrrhos and mindes chains clanked as he shrugged and your own part in this was purely innocent krispos asked purely your majesty mindes said the picture of candor one of the wanders coughed dryly when captured your majesty he was carrying five belt pouches not counting the one on his own belt a treasury official indeed krispos said the warders laughed mindes looked innocentwith the smoothness of a man who has done it before krispos thought he said all right take him back to his cell and bring me someone else who was there at the start of things the next man told essentially the same story just to be sure krispos had one more summoned and heard the tale over again then he went back to the imperial residence and spent the night pondering what to do with pyrrhos ordering the patriarch to wear a muzzle at all times struck him as a good idea but he suspected pyrrhos would find some theological justification for disobeying he might not you know dara said when he mentioned his conceit out loud he might take it for some wonderful new style of asceticism and try to enforce it on the whole clergy she chuckled so did krispos but only for a moment knowing pyrrhos there was always the chance dara was right the grand courtroom was heated by the same kind of system of ducts under the floor that the imperial residence used it was far larger than any room in the residence though the ducts kept ones feet warm but not much more krispos throne stood on a platform a mans height above the floor not even his feet were warm some of the courtiers who flanked the double row of columns that led up to the throne shivered in their robes the haloga guards were warmthey wore trousers back in his old village krispos would have been wearing trousers too he cursed fashion then smiled as he imagined barsymes face if hed proposed coming to the grand courtroom in anything but the scarlet robe custom decreed the smile went away when pyrrhos appeared at the far end of the hall the patriarch advanced toward the throne with the steady stride of a much younger man he was entitled to vestments of blue silk and clothofgold vestments almost as rich as the imperial raiment all he wore though was a monks simple blue robe now soaked and dark as he drew near krispos heard his feet squelching in his blue boots he refused to acknowledge the rain by covering himself against it he prostrated himself before krispos waiting with his forehead on the ground till given leave to rise how may i serve your majesty he asked he did not hesitate to meet krispos eye if this conscience troubled him he concealed it perfectly krispos did not think it did unlike most videssians pyrrhos had no use for dissembling most holy sir we are not pleased with you krispos said in the formal tone hed practiced for occasions such as this he stifled a grin of pleasure at remembering to use the firstperson plural how so your majesty pyrrhos said in my simple way i have striven only to speak the truth and how can the truth displease any man who has no reason to fear it krispos clamped his teeth together he might have known this would not be easy pyrrhos wore righteousness like chain mail krispos answered stirring up quarrels within the temples serves neither them nor the empire as a whole the more so as harvas blackrobe alone will profit if we fight among ourselves your majesty i have no intention of stirring up dissent pyrrhos said i merely aim to purify the temples of the unacceptable practices that have entered over years of lax discipline what krispos wanted to do was scream not now you cursed idiot instead he said since these practices you dont approve of have been a long time growing maybe youd be wiser to ease them out of the ground instead of jerking them up by the roots no your majesty pyrrhos said firmly these are the webs skotos spins the tiny errors that grow larger more flagrant month by month year by year until at last utter wickedness and depravity become acceptable i tell you your majesty thanks to gnatios and his ilk videssos the city is a place where the dark god roams free he spat on the polished marble floor and traced the suncircle over the sodden wool above his heart several courtiers imitated the pious gesture some looked fearfully toward krispos wondering how he dared ask the patriarch to restrain his attack on evil but krispos said you are wrong most holy sir his voice was hard and certain that certainty made pyrrhos eyes widen slightly he was more used to hearing it in his own voice than from another krispos said no doubt skotos sneaks about in videssos the city as he does all through the world but i have seen a city where he roamed free i see imbros still in my dreams exactly so your majesty it is to prevent videssos the city from suffering the fate of imbros that i strive the evil within us given time will devour us unless to use your phrase we root it out now the evil harvas blackrobe loves will devour us right now unless we root it out krispos said how do you propose to minister to the soul of an impaled corpse most holy sir think which victory is more urgent at the moment pyrrhos thought krispos gave him credit for it at length the patriarch said you have your concerns majesty but i have mine as well he sounded troubled as if he had not expected krispos to make him admit even so much if i see evil and do nothing to rid the world of it i myself have done that evil i cannot pass it by in silence not without consigning my soul to the eternal ice not even if other men men of good standing in the temples fail to see anything evil in it krispos persisted do you say that anyone who disagrees with you in any way will spend eternity in the ice i would not go so far as that your majesty pyrrhos said though by the look in his eyes he wanted to reluctantly he continued the principle of theological economy does apply to certain beliefs that cannot be proven actively pernicious then while we are at war with harvas stretch it as wide as you can if you did not go out of your way to make enemies in the temples most holy sir you would find many who might be your friends but think again now and answer me truly can you see stretching economy to fit harvas or his deeds again pyrrhos paused for honest thought no he admitted the word expressionless as much as he wanted to keep his face straight he looked like a man who suspected too late hed been cheated at dice he bowed stiffly let it be as you say your majesty i shall essay to practice economy where i can for so long as this harvas remains in arms against us one or two courtiers burst into applause amazed and impressed that krispos had wrung any concession from pyrrhos krispos was amazed and impressed too but did not let on he also noted the qualifying phrases the patriarch used to keep those concessions as small as possible he said excellent most holy sir i knew i could rely on you the patriarch bowed again even more like an automaton than before he started to prostrate himself once more so he could leave the imperial presence krispos held up a hand before you go most holy sir a question did the monk gnatios ask leave of you to come out of his monastery not long ago why so he did your majestyand in proper form too pyrrhos added grudgingly i rejected the petition even so of course no matter what reasons he gives for wishing to come forth no doubt he mainly seeks to work mischief as you say most holy sir i thought the same pyrrhos face twisted for a moment he seemed about to smile in the end as befit his abstemious temperament he contented himself with a sharp short nod he performed the proskynesis rose and backed away from the throne until he was far enough from it to turn his back on krispos without giving offense no sooner had he gone than a servitor with a rag scurried out to wipe up the rainwater that had dripped from his robe krispos surveyed the grand courtroom with a broad benign smile the courtiers were not shouting thou conquerest krispos at him but he knew hed won a victory just the same phostis rolled from belly to back from back to belly the baby started to roll over one more time krispos grabbed him before he went off the edge of the bed dont do that he said youre too smart to be a farmer arent you too smart to be a farmer dara echoed puzzled the only way a farmer ever learns anything is to hit himself in the head krispos explained he held phostis close to his face the baby reached out grabbed a double handful of beard and yanked ow krispos said he carefully worked phostis left hand free then the rightby which time the left was tangled in his beard again after another try he was able to put down the baby phostis promptly tried to roll off the bed krispos caught him again i told you not to do that he said why dont babies listen youre very gentle with him dara said i think thats good especially considering she let her voice trail away not much point to whacking him till hes big enough to understand what hes being whacked for krispos said deliberately choosing to misunderstand considering he might be another mans son dara had started to say she wondered too then phostis refused to give either of them much in the way of clues the baby tried to roll off the bed once more this time he almost made it krispos snagged him by an ankle and dragged him back youre not supposed to do that he said phostis laughed at him he thought being rescued was a fine game im glad youll be here the winter long dara said hell get a chance to know you now when you were out on campaign the whole summer hed forgotten you by the time you came back again i know part of krispos wanted to keep phostis by him every hour of the day and night to leave the child if not krispos himself no doubt they were father and son another part of him wanted nothing to do with the boy the result was an uneasy blend of feelings that grew only more complicated as day followed day the baby started to fuss jamming fingers into his mouth hes cutting a tooth poor dear little one dara said hes probably getting hungry too ill ring for the wet nurse she tugged the green bell cord that rang back in the maidservants quarters a minute later someone tapped politely on the bedchamber door when krispos opened it he found not the wet nurse but barsymes standing there the vestiarios bowed i have a letter for you thank you esteemed sir krispos took the sealed parchment from him just then the wet nurse came bustling down the hall she smiled at krispos as she brushed past him and hurried over to the baby who was still crying who sent the letter dara asked as the wet nurse took phostis from her krispos did not need to open it to answer he had recognized the seal recognized the elegantly precise script that named him the addressee tanilis he said you remembermavros mother yes of course dara turned to the wet nurse iliana could you carry him someplace else for a bit please anthimos had been good at acting as if servants did not exist when that suited him dara had more trouble doing so and krispos more stillhed had no servants till he was an adult diana left barsymes perfect servitor that he was had already disappeared dara said read it to me will you certainly krispos broke the seal slid off the ribbon around the letter unrolled the parchment tanilis to his imperial majesty krispos avtokrator of the videssians greetings i thank you for your sympathy as you say my son died as he lived going straight ahead without hesitating to look to either side of the road the closeness of the image to the way mavros army had actually been caught made krispos pause and reminded him how tanilis saw more than met the ordinary mans eye he collected himself and read on i have no doubt you did all you could to keep him from his folly but no one in the end can be saved from himself and his will therein lies the deadly danger of harvas blackrobe for having known the good he has forsaken it for evil would i were a man to face him in the field though i know he is mightier than i but perhaps i shall meet him even so phos grant it may be and may the good god bless you your empress and your sons farewell dara seized on one word of the letter sons krispos checked so she wrote dara sketched the suncircle over her heart she does see true you say she always has krispos reached out to set a hand on daras belly the child did not show yet not even when she was naked certainly not when she wore the warm robes approaching winter required what shall we name him youre too practical for mei hadnt looked so far ahead as dara frowned in thought the faintest of lines came out on her forehead and at the corners of her mouth they hadnt been there when krispos first came to the imperial residence as vestiarios she was the same age as he near enough her aging minor though it was reminded him he also grew no younger she said you named phostis if this truly is a son shall we call him evripos after my fathers father evripos krispos plucked at his beard as he considered good enough thats settled then another son dara drew the sunsign again a pity mavros had none of his mothers gift her eyes went to the letter krispos was still holding aye he never showed a sign of it that i saw if hed had it he wouldnt have gone out from the city i know he didnt fear for himself he was wild to be a soldier when i met him krispos smiled remembering mavros hacking at bushes as they rode from tanilis villa into opsikion but he never would have taken a whole army into danger no doubt youre right dara hesitated then asked have you thought about appointing a new sevastos i expect ill get around to it one of these days the matter seemed less urgent to krispos than it had when hed named mavros to the post now that no rebel was moving against him he had less need to act in two places at the same time and thus less need for so powerful a minister thinking out loud he went on most likely id pick iakovitzes hes served me well and he knows both the city and the wider world oh dara nodded yes he would make a good choice the words were commonplace something in the way she said them made him glance sharply at her did you have someone else in mind she was swarthy enough to make her flush hard to spot but he saw it her voice became elaborately casual not that so much but my father was curious to learn if you were thinking of someone in particular was he he was curious to learn if i was thinking of him in particular you mean yes i suppose i do that flush grew deeper im sure he meant nothing out of ordinary by asking no doubt tell him this for me dara tell him i think he might make a good sevastos if only i could trust him with my back turned as things are now i dont know that i can and his sneaking questions through you doesnt make me think any better of him or am i wrong to be on my guard dara bit her lip krispos said never mind you dont have to answer that question puts you in an impossible spot you already know my father is an ambitious man dara said i will pass on to him what youve told me id be grateful if you would krispos let it go at that pushing dara too hard was more likely to force her away than to bind her to him to give himself something impersonal to do he read through tanilis letter again he wished she could face harvas in the field if anyone could best him she might be that person not only would her gifts of foreknowledge warn her of his ploys but the loss hed inflicted on her would focus her sorcerous skill against him as a burning glass focused the rays of the sun then krispos put the letter aside from what hed seen thus far unhappily no videssian wizard could face harvas blackrobe in the field that left krispos a cruel dilemma how was he to overcome harvas halogai if the evil mages magic worked and his own did not posing the question was easy finding an answer anywhere this side of catastrophe up till now had been impossible trokoundos looked harassed every time krispos had seen him this fall and winter hed looked harassed krispos understood that as much as he could afford to he even sympathized with trokoundos he kept summoning the wizard to ask him about harvas and trokoundos had no miracles to report your majesty ever since i returned from the campaign the sorcerers collegium has hummed like a hive of bees trying to unravel the secrets behind harvas spells trokoundos said ive had myself examined under sorcery and drugs to make sure my recall of what i witnessed was perfectly exact in the hope that some other mage given access to my observations might find the answer that has eluded me but he spread his hands all your bees have made no honey krispos finished for him no your majesty we have not we are used to reckoning ourselves the finest wizards in the world oh maybe in mashiz the king of kings of makuran has a stable to match us but that a solitary barbarian mage should have the power to baffle us trokoundos heavylidded eyes flashed angrily being beaten so ate at his pride you have no idea then how he does what he does krispos asked i did not quite say that what makes his magic effective is easy enough to divine he is very strong strength may accrue to any man of any nationeven perhaps such strength as his but he also possesses technique refined beyond any we can match here in videssos the city how he acquired that and how we may meet it well an answer there will go far toward piecing the puzzle together but we have none krispos said not too long ago i got a note from our dear friend gnatios he claims he has your answers all tied up with a scarlet ribbon of course he would claim dung was cherries if he thought he saw a coppers worth of advantage in it hes a trimmer aye but hes no fool trokoundos said seriously echoing iakovitzes what answer did he give by the lord with the great and good mind ill seize whatever i can find now he gave none krispos said he just claimed he had one as best i could tell his main aim was escaping the monastery he thinks i forget the trouble hes caused me if he hadnt got petronas loose i could have turned on harvas close to half a year sooner would you have won on account of that trokoundos asked up till this instant id thought so krispos answered if i couldnt beat him then with the full power of videssos behind me how may i hope to next spring or are you telling me i shouldnt go forth at all should i wait here in the city and stand siege no better to meet harvas as far from videssos the city as you may how much good did walls do either develtos or imbros none at all krispos started to say something more then stopped appalled and stared at trokoundos videssos the citys walls were incomparably greater than those of the two provincial towns imagining them breached was almost more than krispos could do that was not quite the mental image that dismayed him winter was the quiet time of year on the farm the time when people would do minor repairs and get ready for the busyness that would return with spring in his minds eye he saw harvas halogai sitting round their hearths some with skins of ale others with their feet up and every last one of them sharpening stakes sharpening stakes sharpening stakes of itself his anus tightened what is it your majesty trokoundos asked for a moment there you lookedfrightened and frightening at the same time i believe it krispos was glad hed had no mirror in which to watch his features change this i vow trokoundos well meet harvas as far from videssos the city as we can progress paced down middle street at a slow walk beside the big bay gelding eight servants tramped along with the imperial litter their breath the horses and krispos rose in white steaming clouds at every exhalation the city was white too white with newfallen snow over his imperial robes krispos wore a coat of soft supple otter furs he still shivered hed lost track of his nose a while before dara had a brazier inside the litter krispos hoped it did her some good only the haloga guardsmen who marched ahead of and behind krispos and his lady literally took winter in their stride marched indeed was not the right word they strutted their heads thrown back chests thrust forward backs as resolutely straight as the columns that supported the colonnades running along either side of middle street their breath fairly burst from their nostrils they took in great gulps of the air krispos reluctantly sipped this was the climate they were made for narvikka turned his head back wat a fine morning he boomed the rest of the northerners nodded some of them wore braids like vagns tied tight with crimson cords these bobbed like horses tails to emphasize their agreement krispos shivered again inside the litter dara sneezed he didnt like that with her pregnant he wanted nothing out of the ordinary the small procession turned north off middle street toward the high temple when they arrived one of the halogai held progress head while krispos dismounted the litterbearers and all but two of the guardsmen stayed outside with the horse the pair who accompanied krispos and dara into the temple had diced for the privilegeand lost halogai cared nothing for hymns and prayers to phos a priest bowed low when he saw krispos will you sit close by the altar as usual your majesty he asked no krispos answered today i think ill hear the service from the imperial niche as you will of course your majesty the priest could not keep a note of surprise from his voice but recovered quickly bowing again he said the stairway is at the far end of the narthex there yes i know thank you holy sir one haloga fell in in front of krispos and dara the other behind them both guards held axes at the ready though the service was still an hour away and the narthex deserted but for themselves the avtokrator and empress and a few priests as she went up the stairs dara complained id much rather stay down on the main level inside the niche you have trouble seeing out through the grillwork youre too far away anyhow and half the time you cant hear what the patriarch is saying i know krispos climbed the last stair and walked forward into the imperial niche the blond oak benches there were bedecked with even more precious stones than those on which less exalted worshipers sat motherofpearl and gleaming silver ornamented the floralpatterned grillwork krispos stood by it for a moment he said i can see well enough and pyrrhos is loud enough so i wont have trouble hearing him i want to find out what goes on when im not at the temple the kind of things pyrrhos says when im not here to listen spies would do that just as well dara said reasonably its not the same if i dont hear it myself krispos didnt know why it wasnt the sameprobably because hed been emperor for less than a year and a half and still wanted to do as much as he could for himself come to that pyrrhos was not the sort to change his words because krispos was in the audience you just want to play spy dara said his grin was sheepish maybe youre right but id feel even more foolish going down now than i would staying daras eyes rolled heavenward but she stopped arguing down below worshipers filed into their places when they all rose krispos and dara stood too the patriarch was approaching the altar we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind by thy grace our protector watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor pyrrhos declaimed everyone recited with him everyone save the two halogai in the niche who stood as silent and unmovingand probably as boredas if they were statuary more prayers followed phos creed then came a series of hymns sung by the congregation and by a chorus of monks who stood against one wall may phos hear our entreaties and the music of our hearts pyrrhos said as the last echoes died away in the dome far above his head may it be so the worshipers responded then at the patriarchs gesture they sank back onto their benches dara let out a small sigh of relief as she sat pyrrhos paused to gather his thoughts before he began to preach i shall begin today by considering the thirtieth chapter of phos holy scriptures he said if you understand the commands the good god has given all hereafter will be for the best wellbeing and suffering the one for the just the other for the wicked then in the end shall skotos cease to flourish while those of good life shall reap the promised reward and bask forevermore in the blessed light of the lord with the great and good mind again in the fortysixth chapter we read but he who rejects phos he is a creature of skotos who in the sight of the evil one is best and yet again in the fiftyfirst he who seeks to destroy for whatever cause he is a son of the creator of evil and an evildoer to mankind righteousness do i call to me to bring good reward how do we apply these teachings that the vicious foe who prowls our borders is wicked is plain to all yet note how perfectly the holy scriptures set forth his sin he is a destroyer an evildoer to mankind a son of the creator of evil and one who gives no thought to the commands of the good god and indeed one day the eternal ice shall be his home may it be soon may it be soon krispos said beside him dara nodded a low mutter also rose from the congregation below pyrrhos went on aye with harvas blackrobe and the savage barbarians who follow him the recognition of what is good and what evil comes easily enough would that skotos knew no guises more seductive but the dark god is a trickster and a liar constantly seeking to ensnare and deceive men into thinking they do good when in fact their acts lead only toward the ice what shall we say for example the patriarch loaded his voice with scorn of priests and prelates who make false statements for their own advantage or who condone the sins of others or who remain in concord with those who condone the sins of others hes whipping gnatios again dara said so he is krispos said trouble is hes using gnatios to whip all the priests in the whole hierarchy who dont spend every free moment mortifying their flesh and i told him not to do that now he wished he was down by the altar he could rise up in righteous wrath and denounce the patriarch on the spot and wouldnt that make a scandal to resound all through the empire he laughed a little enjoying the idea the laughter left his lips as pyrrhos repeated what shall we say of these men who have blinded themselves to phos sacred words by the lord with the great and good mind here is my answer a man of such nature no longer deserves the appellation of priest he is rather a wild animal an evil scoundrel a sinful heretic a whore one who does not deserve and is not worthy to wear a blue robe he will spend all eternity in the ice with his true master skotos his tears of lamentation shall freeze to his cheeksand who would deny this is his just desert the patriarch sounded grimly pleased at the prospect he went on this is why we root out misbelievers when and where we find them for a priest who errs in his faith condemns not only himself to skotos clutches but gives over his flock as well thus a misbelieving priest is doubly damned and doubly damnable and must not be suffered to survive much less to preach krispos did not like the buzz of approval that rose to the imperial niche religious strife was meat and drink to the folk of videssos the city pyrrhos might have promised to exercise economy but the promise went too much against his nature for him to keep it he was a controversialist born ill have to get rid of him krispos said though saying it aloud made him wince pyrrhos had given him his start in the city driven by some mystic vision the thenabbot had taken him to iakovitzes thus starting the train of events that led to the throne but now that krispos was on the throne how could he afford a patriarch who kept doing his best to turn videssos upside down with whom would you replace him dara asked krispos shook his head he had no idea pyrrhos was finishing his sermon as you prepare to leave the temple and return to the world offer up a prayer to the avtokrator of the videssians that he may lead us to victory against all who threaten the empire that only made krispos feel worse pyrrhos remained solidly behind him but the patriarch threatened the empire too krispos had tried to tell him so every way he knew how pyrrhos had not listenedmore accurately had refused to hear as soon as krispos could decide on a suitable replacement it would be back to the monastery for the zealous cleric the congregation recited phos creed a last time to mark the end of the service this liturgy is accomplished pyrrhos declared go now and may each of you walk in phos light forevermore may it be so the worshipers said they rose from their benches and began filing out to the narthex krispos and dara also rose the halogai behind them unfroze from immobility one of the northerners muttered something in his own tongue to the other the second guardsman started to grin until he saw krispos watching him his face congealed into soldierly immobility laughing at the ceremony krispos guessed he wished the halogai would see the truth of phos on the other hand an avtokrator who proselytized too vigorously was liable to see the size of his bodyguard shrink the halogai preceded the imperial couple down the stairs the men and women in the narthex bowed low as krispos emerged no proskynesis was required not here this was phos precinct first flanked by watchful guardsmen fore and aft krispos and dara went out to the forecourt with a flourish the chief litterbearer opened the door to the conveyance so dara could slip in narvikka came over to hold progress head krispos had his left foot in the stirrup when somebody not far away shouted youll go to the ice with the lax priest you follow too much pickiness will send you to the ice blemmyas for condemning those who dont deserve it someone else shouted back liar blemmyas shouted whos a liar fist smacked flesh with a meaty thwock in an instant people all over the forecourt were screaming and cursing and pounding and kicking at one another wan sunlight sparkled off the sharpened edge of a knife dig up pyrrhos bones someone yelled the ice that walked krispos spine had nothing to do with chilly weatherdigging up somebodys bones was the call to riot in the city a stone whizzed past his head another clattered off the side of daras litter she let out a muffled shriek krispos sprang into the saddle give me your axe he shouted to narvikka the haloga stared then handed him the weapon good krispos said you you you and you he pointed to guardsmen stay here and help the bearers keep the empress litter safe the rest of you follow me try not to kill but dont let yourselves get hurt either he spurred progress toward the center of the forecourt the halogai gaped then cheered and plunged after him the axe was an impossible weapon to swing from horsebacktoo long too heavy balanced altogether wrong had progress not been an extraordinarily steady mount krispos first wild swipe would have pitched him out of the saddle as it was he missed the man at whom hed aimed the flat of the axehead crashed into the side of a nearby mans head the fellow staggered as if drunk then went down go back to your homes stop fighting krispos yelled again and again behind him the armored halogai were happily felling anyone rash enough to come near them or too slow to get out of the way from the cries of anguish that rose into the sky krispos suspected they werent paying much heed to his urge of caution the riot though was murdered before it had truly been born people in the forecourt broke and ran they were too afraid of the fearsome northerners to remember why they had been battling one another that suited krispos well enough he held the axe across his knees as he brought progress to a halt when he looked back he saw about what hed expected several men and a woman down and unmoving the halogai were busy slitting belt pouches krispos looked the other way things could have got very sticky had they not waded into the crowd in his wake from the top of the steps priests peered down in dismay at the blood that splashed the snow in the forecourt under that snow old blood still stained the flagstones from the last riot pyrrhos had inspired enough was enough krispos thought he leaned down from the saddle and returned narvikkas axe to him maybe one day i show you what to do with it the haloga said with a sly smile krispos ears heated that stroke had looked as awkward as it felt then he pointed to a couple of corpses take their heads he said well set them at the foot of the milestone with a big placard that says rioters the good god willing people will see them and think twice aye majesty narvikka went about his grisly task with no more concern than if hed been slaughtering swine he glanced over to krispos when he was done you go at them like a northern man it needed doing besides if i hadnt the fighting just would have spread and gotten worse that was a most unhalogalike notion to the northerners fighting that spread was better not worse krispos rode the few steps to the litter the bearers saluted one of them had a cut on his forehead and a blackened eye he grinned at krispos thanks to you majesty we were only at the edge of things they plumb stopped noticing us when you charged into the middle of em good thats what i had in mind krispos leaned down and spoke into the small window set into the litter door are you all right im fine dara answered at once i was in the safest place in the whole forecourt after all the safest place as long as the bearers didnt run away krispos thought well they didnt dara went on im just glad you came through safe he could hear that she meant it hed worried about her too this was not the fiery sort of love about which lute players sang in wineshops this marriage of convenience between them all the same bit by bit he was coming to see it was a kind of love too lets get back to the palaces he said the litterbearers stooped grunted and lifted the halogai fell into place narvikka swaggered along holding by their beards the two heads hed taken city folk either stared at the gruesome trophies or turned away in horror narvikka had fought to defend the emperor whose gold hed taken and had enjoyed every moment of it how krispos wondered uncomfortably did that make him different from the halogai who followed harvas the only answer he found was that narvikkas violence was under the control of the state and was used to protect it not to destroy that satisfied him but not altogether harvas could trumpet the same claim for his conquests no matter how vicious they were the difference was harvas lied a petition for you your majesty barsymes said ill read it krispos said resignedly petitions to the avtokrator poured in from all over the empire most of them he did not need to see he had a logothete in aid of requests who dealt with those but even the winter slowdown did not keep them from coming into the city and the logothete could not handle everything he unrolled the parchment his nostrils twitched as if at the smell of bad fish why didnt you tell me it was from gnatios shall i discard it then krispos was tempted to say yes but had second thoughts as long as its in my hands i may as well read it through not the smallest part in his decision was gnatios beautifully legible script the humble monk gnatios to his imperial majesty krispos avtokrator of the videssians greetings krispos nodded to himselfgone were the fawning phrases of gnatios first letter having seen they did no good the former patriarch was wise enough to discard them they were not his proper style anyhow krispos read on again your majesty i beg the boon of an audience with you i am painfully aware that you have no reason to trust me and indeed every reason to mistrust me but i write nonetheless not so much for my own sake as for the sake of the empire of videssos whose interest i have at heart regardless of who holds the throne that might even be true krispos thought he imagined gnatios scribbling in the scriptorium or in his own monastic cell pausing to seek out the telling phrase that would make krispos relent or at least read further hed succeeded in the latter if not in the former krispos eyes kept moving down the parchment let me speak plainly your majesty gnatios wrote the cause of videssos present crisis is rooted three hundred years in the past in the theological controversies that followed the invasions off the pardrayan steppe the invasions that raped away the lands now known as thatagush khatrish and kubrat as a result you will need to consider those controversies and their consequences in contemplating combat against harvas blackrobe the jingling alliteration though very much the vogue in sophisticated videssian circles only irritated krispos so did gnatios confident as a result of course the past shaped the present krispos enjoyed histories and chronicles for exactly that reason but if gnatios claimed the empires current problems were in fact three hundred years old he also needed to say why he thought so and he did not krispos tried to find his reasons for holding back two quickly came to mind one was that the deposed patriarch was lying the other was that he thought he had the truth but feared to set it down on parchment lest krispos use it and keep him mewed up in the monastery all the same if that was what troubled him he was naivekrispos could send him back to the monastery of the holy skirios after hearing what he had to say as easily as he could after reading his words gnatios was many things krispos thought but hardly naive most likely that meant he was lying bring me pen and ink please barsymes krispos said when the eunuch returned he took them and wrote i still forbid your release krispos avtokrator he gave the parchment to barsymes arrange to have this returned to the holy sir if you would certainly your majesty shall i reject out of hand any further petitions from him no krispos said after thinking it over ill read them i dont have to do anything about them after all barsymes dipped his head and carried the petition away krispos whistled between his teeth gnatios was everything pyrrhos was not he was smooth suave rational and tolerant he was also pliable and devious krispos had taken great and malicious glee in confining him to the monastery of the holy skirios for a second time after petronas rebellion failed now he wondered whether gnatios had learned enough humility in the monastery to serve as patriarch once more when that occurred to him he also wondered whether hed lost his own mind the monastery had changed petronas not at all save only to fill him with a brooding desire for vengeance if pyrrhos was intolerable on the patriarch throne what would gnatios be but intolerable in some different way surely it would be better to replace pyrrhos with an amiable nonentity the priestly equivalent of barley porridge yet somehow the idea of restoring gnatios once planted would not go away krispos got up still whistling and went to the sewing room to ask dara what she thought of it she jabbed her needle into the linen fabric on her lap and stared up at him i can see why you want pyrrhos out she said but gnatios has kept trying to wreck you ever since you took the crown i know krispos said but petronas is dead so gnatios has no reasonwell less reasonfor treachery now he made anthimos a good patriarch you should have struck off his head when he surrendered at antigonos then your own wouldnt be filled with this moonshine now krispos sighed no doubt youre right his petitions are probably moonshine too what petitions dara asked after krispos explained her lip curled in a noblewomans sneer if he knows so much about these vast secrets hes keeping let him tell them theyd have to be vast indeed to earn him his way out of his cell by the good god so they would krispos bent down to kiss dara ill summon him and hear him out if he has nothing i can send him back to the monastery for good even thats better than he deserves dara did not sound quite happy at having her sarcasm taken literally remember where youd be remember where wed all be she patted her belly if hed had his way ill never forget it krispos promised he made a wry face but i also remember what iakovitzes told me and trokoundos too that gnatios is no ones fool i dont have to like him i dont have to trust him but i have the bad feeling that i may need him dara stabbed her needle into the cloth again i dont like it i dont either krispos raised his voice to call for barsymes when the eunuch came into the sewing room he said esteemed sir im sorry but ive changed my mind i think id best talk or rather listen to gnatios after all very well your majesty i shall see to it at once barsymes could make his voice toneless as well as sexless but krispos had now had years to learn to read it he found no disapproval there more than anything else that convinced him he was doing the right thing viii freezing rain pelted down gnatios shivered in his blue robe as he walked up to the imperial residence the troop halogai who surrounded himkrispos was taking no chances on any schemes the expatriarch might have hatchedbore the nasty weather with the resigned air of men who had been through worse krispos met gnatios just inside the entranceway to the residence wet and dripping gnatios prostrated himself on the chilly marble floor your majesty is most gracious to receive me he said through chattering teeth rise holy sir rise gnatios looked bedraggled enough to make krispos feel guilty lets get you dry and warm then ill hear what you have to say at his nod a chamberlain brought towels and furs to swaddle gnatios krispos led gnatios down the hall and into a chamber fitted out for audiences gnatios step was sure but then krispos remembered hed been here many times before iakovitzes waited inside the chamber he rose and bowed as krispos led in the former patriarch krispos said since i intend to name iakovitzes as sevastos to succeed mavros i thought he should hear you along with me gnatios bowed to iakovitzes congratulations your highness if i may anticipate your coming into your new office he murmured iakovitzes stylus raced over wax he held up what hed written so krispos and gnatios both could read it never mind the fancy talk if you know how to hurt harvas tell us if you dont go back to your bleeding cell thats how it is holy sir krispos agreed i am aware of it i assure you gnatios said for once his clever rather foxy features were altogether serious in truth i do not know how to hurt him but i think i know whowhat may be the better wordhe is i rely on your majestys honor to judge the value of that im glad you do since you have no other choice save silence krispos said now sit holy sir and tell me your tale thank you your majesty gnatios perched on a chair krispos sat down beside iakovitzes on the couch that faced it gnatios said as i have written this tale begins three hundred years ago go on krispos said he was glad he had iakovitzes with him hed enjoyed the histories and chronicles hed read but the noble was a truly educated man hed know if gnatios tried to sneak something past gnatios said surely you know your majesty of the empires time of troubles when the barbarians poured in all along our northern and eastern frontiers and stole so many lands from us i should krispos said the kubratoi kidnapped me when i was a boy and i aided iakovitzes in his diplomatic dealings with khatrish some years ago i know less of thatagush and worry about it less too since its borders dont touch ours aye we deal with them as nations now like videssos if neither so old nor so mighty gnatios said but it was not always so we had ruled for hundreds of years the provinces they invaded wethe empire of videssoshad a comfortable world then save for makuran we knew no other nations only tribes on the pardrayan steppe and in frigid halogaland we were sure phos favored us for how could mere tribes do us harm iakovitzes scribbled then held up his tablet we found out we did indeed gnatios said soberly within ten years of the borders being breached a third of videssos territory was gone the barbarians rode where they would for once past the frontier they found no forces to resist them videssos the city was besieged skopentzana fell skopentzana krispos frowned thats no city i ever heard of wondering if gnatios had invented the place he glanced toward iakovitzes but iakovitzes wrote its ruins now it lies in whats thatagush these days and the folk there still have but scant use for towns in its day though it was a great city maybe next greatest in the empire after videssos in no way were more than two towns ahead of it shall i go on gnatios asked when he saw krispos had finished reading at krispos nod he did as i said skopentzana fell from what the few survivors wrote afterward the sack was fearsome with all the usual pillage and slaughter and rape magnified by the size of the city and because no one had imagined such a fate could befall him till the day among the men who got free was the prelate of the city one rhavas krispos sketched the suncircle over his heart the good god must have kept him safe under other circumstances your majesty i might agree with you as iswell may i digress briefly the whole business so for has seemed pretty pointless krispos said so how am i to know when you wander off the track the story gnatios spun was interesting enoughthe man had a gift for wordsbut seemed altogether unconnected to harvas blackrobe if he could do no better krispos thought hed stay in his monastery till he was ninety i hope to weave my threads together into a whole garment majesty gnatios said whole cloth you mean iakovitzes wrote but krispos waved for gnatios to go on thank you your majesty i know you have no special training in theology but you must be able to see that a catastrophe like the invasion off the steppes brought crisis to the ecclesiastical hierarchy we had believedcomfortably againthat just as we went from triumph to triumph in the world so phos could not help but triumph in the universe as a whole that remains our orthodoxy to this day gnatios sketched the sunsign but it was sorely tested in those times for you see now so many folk made the acquaintance of misfortune and outright evil that they began to doubt phos power out of this eventually arose the balancer heresy which still holds sway in khatrish and thatagushaye and even in agder by halogaland which though still videssian by blood has its own king but worse than that heresy arose as well as i said rhavas escaped the sack of skopentzana krispos eyebrows rose worse came from the man who was prelate of an important city it did your majesty rhavas i gather was connected not too distantly to the imperial house of the time but earned his position by ability not through his blood he might have been ecumenical patriarch had skopentzana not fallen and he might have been a great one but when he made his way to videssos the city he was changed he had seen too much of evil when the khamorth took skopentzana he concluded skotos was mightier than phos even iakovitzes whose piety ran thin drew the sunsign when he heard that krispos said how did the priests of the time take to that with poor grace as you might expect pyrrhos reply would have been fierce and full of horror gnatios let understatement do the same job krispos found he preferred gnatios way the scholarly monk went on rhavas though was become as great a zealot for the dark god as he had been for phos he preached his new doctrine to all who would listen first in the temples and then in the streets after the patriarch of the day banned him from the pulpit now krispos was interested in spite of himself they didnt let that go on did they the thought of videssos the city filled with worshipers of evil filled him with dread no they didnt gnatios said but because rhavas was well connected they had to try him publicly in an ecclesiastical court which meant he had the privilege of defending himself against the charges they lodged and because he was ablewell no he was more than able he was brilliant ive read his defense your majesty it frightens me it must have frightened the prelates of the day too for they sentenced him to death i ask you again holy sirhow does this apply to the trouble were in now if this rhavas is three centuries dead then evil as he may have become your majesty i am not at all sure rhavas is three centuries dead gnatios said heavily i am not sure he is dead at all he laughed when the court sentenced him and told them they had not the power to be his death he was left in his cell for the night to brood on his misbelief and on the crimes he had committed in the belief they furthered his gods ends guards came the next morning to take him to the headsman and found the cell empty the lock had not been tampered with there were no tunnels but rhavas was gone magic krispos said the small hairs on his forearms and the back of his neck prickled erect no doubt you are right your majesty but because of the nature of rhavas offense the cell was warded by the finest sorcerers of the day afterward they all took oath their wards were undisturbed yet rhavas was gone iakovitzes bent over his tablet he held it up to show what he had written youre saying this rhavas is harvas arent you he screwed up his face to show what he thought of that but then he lowered the tablet so he could see it himself when he raised it again he pointed with his stylus to each name in turn for a moment krispos had no idea what he was driving at harvas was an ordinary haloga name rhavas an ordinary videssian one but was it coincidence that both of them were formed from the same letters the renewed prickle of alarm he felt told him no gnatios stared at the two names as if hed never seen them before his eyes flicked from one to the other then back again i didnt notice he breathed iakovitzes set the tablet in his lap so he could write he passed it to krispos who read it aloud no wonder he wouldnt swear by phos iakovitzes believed too then but if were battling a a threehundredyearold wizard krispos faltered how do we how can we hope to beat him your majesty i do not know i was hoping you could tell me gnatios said his voice held no irony krispos was the avtokrator defeating foreign foes came with the job iakovitzes wrote again if we do face an undying wizard who worships skotos and hates everything phos stands for why hasnt he troubled videssos long before now that made krispos doubt again but gnatios answered how do we know he has not by the lord with the great and good mind your highness the empire has suffered its full share of disasters over the years how many of them might rhavas have caused or made worse our ignorance of the force behind the misfortune fails to prove the force did not exist holy sir i thinki fearyou are right krispos said only a manor whatever this rhavas or harvas was after so long who loved skotos could have inflicted such brutal savagery on imbros and only a man who had studied sorcery for three centuries could have so baffled a clever welltrained mage like trokoundos the pieces fit as neatly as those of a wooden puzzle but krispos cringed from the shape they made gnatios said now do with me as you will your majesty i know you have no reason to love me nor truth to tell have i any to love you but this tale needed telling for the empires sake not for yours or mine how peculiar iakovitzes wrote i thought him a man completely without integrity shows you cant rely on adverbs i suppose er yes krispos handed the tablet back to iakovitzes when gnatios saw he would not be invited to read iakovitzes comment one eyebrow arched krispos ignored it he was thinking hard at last he said holy sir this deserves a reward as you well know being out of the monastery even if but for a brief while is reward in itself gnatios raised that eyebrow again how ever did you arrange for the most holy ecumenical patriarch of the videssians gnatios put irony in his voice with a scalpel not a shovel to acquiesce in my release thats right we both had to agree to it didnt we krispos grinned sheepishly as a matter of fact holy sir i forgot to ask him and i gather an imperial summons for you was enough to overawe your abbot evidently so gnatios paused before continuing the most holy patriarch will not be pleased with you for having enlarged me so thats all right i havent been pleased with him for some time only after the words were out of his mouth did krispos wonder how impolitic it was for him to run down the incumbent patriarch to a former holder of the office not even gnatios eyebrow stirred krispos admired that gnatios chose his words with evident care exactly how great a reward did your majesty contemplate iakovitzes gobbled gnatios turned his way in surprise krispos by now was used to the nobles strange laugh he felt like laughing himself so you want your old post back do you holy sir i suppose i should feel chagrin at being so obvious but yes your majesty i do to be frank krispos wondered if gnatios was ever frank the idea of that narrow zealots possessing the patriarchal throne makes my blood boil he loves you just as well krispos remarked im aware of that i respect his honesty and sincerity have you not found though your majesty that an honest fanatic poses certain problems of his own krispos wondered how much gnatios knew of pyrrhos summons to the grand courtroom of the riots outside the high temple quite a lot he suspected gnatios might be confined to his monastic cell but krispos was willing to bet he heard every whisper in the city holy sir there is some truth in what you say he admitted he leaned forward as if he were in the marketplace of imbros back in the days when imbros marketplace held lifehaggling over the price of a shoat how can i hope to trust you though after youve betrayed me not once but twice always an interesting question gnatios sighed spreading his hands in front of him your majesty i have no good answer for it i will say that i would be a better patriarch than the one you have now for as long as you take to decide someone else would make a better emperor than the one you have now gnatios bowed his head an argument i cannot counter here is what i will do holy sir from now on you may come and go as you will subject to the wishes of your abbot i daresay youll need something in writing krispos called for pen and parchment wrote rapidly signed and sealed the document and handed it to gnatios i hope youll overlook faults of style and grammar your majesty for this document i would overlook a great deal gnatios said in one sentence that summed up the difference between him and pyrrhos pyrrhos never overlooked anything for any reason if you find anything more in your histories be sure to let me know at once krispos said gnatios understood the audience was over he prostrated himself rose and started for the door barsymes met him there the vestiarios asked shall the halogai accompany the holy sir back to his monastery no let him go back by himself krispos said he succeeded in surprising his chamberlain no easy feat with a bow of acquiescence and an expression that spoke volumes barsymes led gnatios toward the door of the imperial residence krispos listened to the two sets of footsteps fading down the hall he turned to iakovitzes well what now do you mean what now as in giving gnatios the high temple back or what now as in harvas iakovitzes wrote i dont know krispos said and by the good god i never expected the two questions to be wrapped up with each other he sighed lets talk about the patriarch first pyrrhos must go in the two weeks since krispos went up into the imperial niche at the high temple two more fights had broken out there both of them fortunately small iakovitzes scribbled aye my dear cousins not the most yielding sort is he if you do want gnatios back maybe you can keep him in line by threatening to feed him to the halogai the first time the word treason so much as tiptoes across the back of his twisty little mind something to that krispos remembered how gnatios had cringed from a guardsmans axe the night he seized the empire he looked down at the tablet in his lap then admiringly over to iakovitzes do you know i hear your voice whenever i read what you write your words on wax or parchment capture the very tone of your speech whenever i try to set thoughts down they always seem so stiff and formal how do you do it genius iakovitzes wrote krispos made as if to break the tablet over his head the noble reclaimed it then wrote a good deal more he handed it to krispos if you must have a long answer for one thing i came to writing earlier in life than you and have used it a good deal longer for another this is my voice now shall i be silent merely because i can no longer utter the more or less articulate croaks that most men use for speech i see the answer is no krispos said thinking that iakovitzes was about as unyielding as his cousin pyrrhos refusing to yield to adversity struck him as more admirable than refusing to yield to common sense the thought of iakovitzes adversity led to the one who had caused it now what of harvas bright fear widened iakovitzes eyes then left them as he visibly took a grip on himself he bent over the tablet used the blunt end of his stylus to smooth down the wax and give himself room to write at last he passed krispos his words fight him as best we can what else is there now that we have some notion of what he is perhaps the wizards will better be able to arm themselves against him krispos thumped himself on the forehead with the heel of his hand by the lord with the great and good mind i havent any mind at all gnatios has to tell his tale to trokoundos before the day is through he shouted for barsymes again the vestiarios transcribed his note and took it to a courier for delivery to trokoundos that accomplished krispos leaned back on the couch he had the battered feeling of a man to whom too much had happened too fast if harvas or rhavas or whatever his proper name was had been perfecting his dark sorcery over half a dozen mens lives no wonder hed overcome a mere mortal like trokoundos to the ice with harvas or rhavas or whatever his proper name is he muttered what about pyrrhos iakovitzes wrote you like to poke people with pointy sticks just to see them jump krispos said iakovitzes look of shocked indignation might have convinced someone who hadnt met him more than half a minute before krispos went on i dont wish the ice for pyrrhos i just wish hed go back to his monastery and keep quiet im not even likely to get that worse luck he wont bend the stiffnecked old krispos stopped his mouth hung open his eyes went wide what are you gawping at iakovitzes wrote it had better be phos holy light to account for that idiotic expression youre wearing its the next best thing krispos assured him he raised his voice barsymes are you still there ah good i want you to draft me a note to the most holy patriarch pyrrhos heres what you need to say barsymes stuck his head into the audience chamber the most holy patriarch pyrrhos is here to see you your majesty good he should be done to a turn by now krispos had put off four days of increasingly urgent requests from the patriarch for an audience he turned to iakovitzes mammianos and rhisoulphos excellent and eminent sirs i ask you to bear careful witness to what takes place here today so that you may take oath on it at need the three nobles nodded formally and solemnly mammianos said this had better work the beauty of it is i m no worse off if it doesnt krispos answered now to business i hear pyrrhos coming the patriarch prostrated himself with his usual punctiliousness he glanced at the three highranking men who sat to krispos left but only for a moment his eyes sparked as he swung them back to krispos your majesty i must vehemently protest this recent decision of yours he drew out the note krispos had sent him oh why is that most holy sir pyrrhos jaw set he knew when he was being toyed with with luck he did not know why he ground out because your majesty you have restored to the monk gnatiosthe treacherous wicked monk gnatiosas much liberty as is enjoyed by the other brethren of the monastery dedicated to the sacred memory of the holy skirios moreover you have done so without consulting me plainer than words his face said what he would have answered had krispos consulted him the monk gnatios did a great service for me and for the empire krispos said because of that ive decided to overlook his past failings i havent pyrrhos said this interference in the internal affairs of the temples is unwarranted and intolerable in this special case i judged not and let me remind you that the avtokrator is avtokrator over all the empire cities and farms and temples alike most holy sir i have the right if i choose to use it and i choose to use it here intolerable pyrrhos repeated he drew himself up your majesty if you persist in you pernicious course i have no choice but to submit to you my resignation in protest thereof off to krispos left someone sighed softly he thought it was rhisoulphos it was all the applause he would ever get but it was more than enough im sorry to hear that from you most holy sir he said to pyrrhos just by a hairs breath the patriarch began to relax but krispos was not finished i accept your resignation these gentlemen will attest you offered it of your own free will with no coercion whatsoever iakovitzes mammianos and rhisoulphos nodded formally and solemnly youplanned this pyrrhos said in a ghastly voice he saw everything too late i did not urge you to resign krispos pointed out you did it yourself now that you have done it barsymes will prepare a document for you to sign and if i refuse to set my signature upon it then you have resigned even so as i said holy sir pyrrhos scowled at the abrupt devaluation of his title you resigned of your own accord in front of witnesses that may be smoothest all around i would have removed you if you insisted on staying onyou promised to practice theological economy and tolerate what you could but none of your sermons has shown even one drop of tolerance pyrrhos said i see everything now you will replace me with that panderer to evil gnatios without your knowing it the dark god has taken hold of your heart krispos leaned forward and spat on the floor that to the dark god look at your cousin here holy sir remember what harvas blackrobe did to him would he fall into any trap skotos might lay were it baited with a pretty boy he might pyrrhos said iakovitzes used a twofingered gesture common on the streets of videssos the city pyrrhos gasped krispos wondered when that gesture had last been aimed at a patriarchno an expatriarch he amended iakovitzes wrote furiously and passed his tablet to rhisoulphos rhisoulphos read it cousin the only bait you need is the hope of tormenting everyone who disagrees with you are you sure you have not swallowed it i know i believe the truth thus anyone who holds otherwise embraces falsehood pyrrhos said i see now that that includes those here majesty you may ban me from preaching in the high temple but i shall take my message to the streets of the city now krispos knew pyrrhos was no intriguer a man wiser in the ways of stirring up strife would never have warned what he planned to do krispos said if what you believe is the truth holy sir and if i have fallen into evil how do you explain the vision that bade you help me like a son pyrrhos opened his mouth then closed it again rhisoulphos leaned over to whisper to krispos if nothing else your majesty youve confused him grateful even for so much krispos nodded he told pyrrhos holy sir im going to give you an honor guard of halogai to escort you to the monastery of the holy skirios if you do decide to yell something foolish to the people in the street theyll do what they have to to keep you quiet pyrrhos could not terrify the heathen northerners with threats of skotos ice he could not be intimidated either let them do as they will the monastery of the holy skirios eh mammianos said one eyelid rose men fell im sure the holy sir and gnatios will have a good deal to say to each other having planted his barb the fat general leaned back to enjoy it pyrrhos did not disappoint him the clerics glare was as cold and withering as the fiercest of ice storms mammianos affected not to notice it he went on of course gnatios will have the blue boots back soon enough the good god shall judge between us in the world to come pyrrhos said i rest content with that he turned to krispos phos shall judge you as well your majesty i know krispos answered unlike you holy sir im far from sure of my answers i do the best i can even so pyrrhos surprised him by bowing so the good god would expect of you may your judgment be better in other instances than it is with me now summon your northerners if you feel you must wherever you send me i shall continue to praise phos holy name he sketched the suncircle over his heart in an abstract way krispos respected pyrrhos sincere piety he did not let that respect blind him when pyrrhos departed from the imperial residence he did so under guard iakovitzes nodded approval just because someone sounds humble is no sure reason to trust him he wrote from what ive seen at the throne theres no sure reason to trust anyone to his secret dismay both rhisoulphos and mammianos nodded at that iakovitzes wrote youre learning krispos supposed he was but did not care for the lessons his office taught him for the first time since harvas magic turned back the imperial army on the borders of kubrat trokoundos seemed something more than gloomy i hope you intend to reward gnatios for what he ferreted out he told krispos without it wed still be stumbling around like so many blind men i have a reward in mind yes krispos said at that moment a synod of prelates and abbots was contemplating gnatios name for the patriarchate once more along with those of two other men whom the assembled clerics knew they had better ignore now that you know more of harvas will he be easier to defeat knowing a bear has teeth your majesty doesnt take those teeth away trokoundos said at krispos disappointed look he went on still since we know where he grew them perhaps we can do something more about them perhaps such as krispos asked eagerly its a fair guess majesty that if he follows skotos and draws his power from the dark god his spells will invert the usages with which were familiar that may make them easier to meet than if he say truly clove to the haloga gods or the demons and spirits the steppe nomads revere magic from the nomads or the northerners can come at you from any direction if you know what i mean i think so krispos said but if their mages or shamans or what have you can invoke their gods and demons and have magic work does that make those gods and demons as true as phos and skotos trokoundos tugged thoughtfully at his ear majesty i think thats a question better suited to the patriarchs wisdom or that of an ecumenical synod than to one who aspires to nothing more than competent wizardry as you wish in any case it takes us off the track you know the direction from which harvas spells will come you say so i believe your majesty this aids us to a point but only to a point harvas strength and skill must still be overcome the one i have already seen is formidable as for the other three centuries ago it sufficed to free him from a warded cell he can only have refined it in all the years since that he remains alive to torment us proves he has refined it what shall we do then krispos asked hed hoped having a handle on harvas would give the mages of videssos the means to defeat him with minimal risk to themselves or to the empire but hed long since found that things in the real world had a way of being less simple and less easy than in storytellers tales this looked like another lesson from that school trokoundos words confirmed his own thoughts the best we can your majesty and pray to the lord with the great and good mind that it be enough bad weather settled in not long before midwinters day blizzard after blizzard roared into videssos the city from the northwest off the videssian sea on midwinters day itself the snow blew so hard and quick that even krispos with the best seat in the amphitheater made out little of the skits performed on the track before him the people in the upper reaches of the huge oval stadium could have discerned only drifting white the final troupe of mimes changed its act at the last minute they came out carrying canes and tapped their way through their routine as if theyd all suddenly been stricken blind on the spine of the amphitheater krispos laughed loudly so did many in his entourage and in the first few rows of seats around the track everyone else must have wondered what was funnywhich was just the point the mimes were making krispos laughed even more when he worked that out on the way back to the palaces after the show in the amphitheater was done he leaped over a bonfire to burn away misfortune for the coming year that fire was but one of many that blazed each midwinters day this year though the goodluck bonfires brought misfortune with them whipped by winter gales two got out of control and ignited nearby buildings now krispos saw through swirling snow the smudges of smoke hed feared during the religious riots pyrrhos had caused the snow did little to slow the flames firefighting teams dashed through the city with hand pumps to shoot water from fountains and ponds with axes and sledgehammers to knock down homes and shops to build firebreaks krispos had no great hope for them when fire got loose it usually pleased itself not any man the teams amazed him they succeeded in stopping one of the fires before it had eaten more than a block of buildings the other blaze by luck had started near the city wall it burned what it could then came to the open space inside the barrier and died for lack of fuel krispos presented a pound of gold to the head of the team that beat the first fire a middleage fellow with a fine head of silver hair and a matteroffact competence that suggested years as a soldier nobles and logothetes in the grand courtroom applauded the man whose name was thokyodes along with this reward from the grateful state krispos said i also give you ten goldpieces from my private purse more applause rose thokyodes clenched his right fist over his heart in salutehe was a veteran then thank you your majesty he said pleased but far from obsequious maybe youll use one of those ten on a potion to make your eyebrows grow back faster krispos said soft enough that only he and the team leader heard not a bit put out thokyodes laughed and ran the palm of his hand across his forehead aye i do look strange without em dont i they got singed right off me he made no effort to keep his voice down fighting fires is just like fighting any other foe the closer you get the better you do you did the city a great service krispos said couldntve done it without my crew by your leave your majesty ill share this with all of them thokyodes held up the sack of goldpieces its your money now to do with as you please krispos said the applause that rang out this time was unrehearsed sincere and startled few of the courtiers men who had far more than this fireman would have been as generous and they knew it krispos wondered if he would have matched the man had fate led him to an ordinary job instead of the throne he hoped so but admitted to himself that he was not sure i think you would have dara said when he wondered again later in the day this time aloud this ill tell youharvas wouldnt harvas harvas would have stood next to the fire with his cheeks puffed out to blow it along krispos smiled at his conceit a moment later the smile blew out he sketched phos suncircle by the good god how do i know his magic didnt help the blazes spread you dont but if you start seeing him under our bed whenever anything goes wrong youll have your head down there all the time because we dont need harvas to know misfortune thats true krispos said you have good sense his smile came back this time full of gratitude harvas was quite bad enough without a fearful imagination making him worse dara said i do try its nice that you notice i remember when she stopped without telling krispos what she remembered when it had to do with anthimos then krispos did not blame her for steering away from that time it had not been happy for her but that meant several years of her life the ones before krispos became vestiarios were almost blank to him which occasionally led to awkward pauses like this one he wondered if every second husband and second wife endured them probably he thought it would have been more awkward yet had her marriage to anthimos been a good one a lot more awkward he realized with an inward chuckle because then she would not have told him anthimos intended to kill him cant get much more awkward than that he muttered under his breath than what dara asked nevermind whenever fat longinos burst in on him on the dead run krispos braced for trouble the chamberlain to his disappointment did not disappoint him majesty longinos gasped wiping his brow with a silken kerchiefonly a fat eunuch could have been sweaty after so trivial an exertion it was freezing outside and not a great deal warmer inside the imperial residence majesty the most holy patriarch pyrrhosim sorry your majesty i mean the monk pyrrhosis preaching against you in the street is he by the good god krispos sprang up from his desk so quickly that a couple of tax registers fluttered to the floor he let them lie there so pyrrhos indignation at being removed from the patriarchal throne really had overcome his longtime loyalty had it whats he saying hes spewing forth a great vomit of scandal your majesty over ah over your ah your relationship with her majesty the empress dara before you ah rose to the imperial dignity longinos sounded indignant for his masters sake though he had known krispos and dara were lovers long before they were man and wife is he krispos said again hell spew forth his lifes blood before im through with him longinos eyes went large with dismay oh no your majesty to cut down one but lately so high in the temples one still with many backers whobegging your pardon your majestydeem him more holy than the present wearer of the blue boots your majesty it would mean more blood than pyrrhos alone it would mean riots hed found the word he needed to stop krispos in his tracks dividing the citydividing the empireagainst itself was the one thing krispos could not afford but he said as if arguing with himself i cant afford to let pyrrhos defame me either if that nonsense goes on for long itll bring some wouldbe usurper out of the woodwork sure as sure indeed your majesty longinos said were you ten years on the throne rather than twonot even twoyou might let him rant confident he would be ignored as it is aye as it is people will listen to him theyll take him seriously too thanks to his piety krispos snorted as if anyone could take pyrrhos any way but seriously ive hardly seen him smile in all the years ive known him the somber old he stopped laughing out loud when he could speak again he asked where is pyrrhos giving this harangue of his in the forum of the ox your majesty longinos said all right he should be easy enough to find there now esteemed sir this is what i want you to do he spoke for several minutes finishing do you think you should have something in writing from me to make sure my orders get carried out yes that would be best longinos looked half amused half scandalized krispos wrote quickly and handed him the scrap of parchment the eunuch read it over shook his head then visibly pulled himself together i shall have this delivered immediately your majesty see that you do krispos said longinos hurried away calling for a courier krispos prided himself on not wasting time so he reviewed another tax document before he ambled out to the entrance to the imperial residence the halogai there stood to stiff attention as you were lads he told them were going for a walk where are your parasolbearers then majesty geirrod asked theyd just get in the way today krispos said the halogai stirred at that a couple of them ran fingers down the edges of their axeblades to make sure the weapons were sharp one must have found a tiny nick for he took out a whetstone and went to work with it when he checked again the axe passed his test he put away the stone where to majesty geirrod said the forum of the ox krispos answered lightly seems the holy pyrrhos isnt taking kindly to not being patriarch any more hes saying some rather rude things about me there the halogai stirred again this time in anticipation you want us to curb his tongue for him eh said the one who had sharpened his axe he examined his edge anew as if to make certain it could bite through a holy mans neck but krispos said no no i dont aim to harm the holy sir just to shut him up better you should kill him geirrod said then hell not trouble you ever again the rest of the guardsmen nodded krispos wished he could view the world with the ferocious simplicity the halogai used in videssos though few things were as simple as they seemed without answering geirrod krispos strode down the stairs the northerners came after him surrounding him to hold potential assassins at bay the forum of the ox was a mile and half perhaps two miles east down middle street from the palace quarter krispos walked briskly to keep warm he was glad of his escort as he passed through the plaza of palamas as usual the halogai marched in a way that said they would trample anyone who did not get clear crowds melted before them as if by magic he hurried down middle street he wanted to catch pyrrhos in the act of preaching against him whatever punishment he might mete out after the fact no matter how savage would not have the effect he wanted making a martyr out of the prelate was the last thing he had in mind a few hundred yards past the government office building middle street jogged to the south the forum of the ox lay not far ahead krispos sped up till he was almost trotting to have pyrrhos get away from him now would be unbearably frustrating he hoped again that his orders had gone through on time in ancient days the forum of the ox had been videssos the citys chief cattle market it was still an important trading center for goods bulkier more mundane and less expensive than those sold in the plaza of palamas livestock grain cheap pottery and olive oil people here stared at krispos escort before they got out of the way in the plaza of palamas close by the palaces they were used to seeing the avtokrator he was a much less frequent visitor in this poorer part of the city a quick glance around the square showed him what he sought a knot of men and women gathered around a man in a blue monks robe the monkeven across the square krispos recognized pyrrhos tall thin frame and lean facestood on a barrel or box or stone that raised him head and shoulders above his audience krispos pointed over there the halogai nodded they moved on pyrrhos with the directness of a pack of wolves advancing on a wisent pyrrhos was a trained orator long before he reached the rear edge of the crowd that listened to the cleric krispos could hear what he was saying so could half the people in the forum of the ox he must have learned his corruption from the master he formerly served for surely depravity was the name by which anthimos was better known yet in his own way krispos outdid anthimos in vice first seducing the previous avtokrators wife then using her against her husband to climb over his dead body to the throne how willhow canphos bless our efforts with such a man inhabiting the palaces pyrrhos must have seen krispos and his bodyguards approach but he did not pause in his address krispos already knew he had courage pyrrhos also did not suddenly break off his speech to point out to his audience that the adulterous monster he had been denouncing was here that in his sandals krispos might have tried if he truly aimed to overthrow someone but pyrrhos did not deviate from what he had decided to say his mind was made up which left no room in it for change krispos folded his arms to listen pyrrhos continued his harangue as if the avtokrator were not there he paid even less attention to the squad of firemen who dashed into the forum of the ox others round the square glanced up in some alarm at the sight of the men armed with halogastyle axes and with a hand pump carried by two men who were sweating even in the chill of winter especially after the close escape on midwinters day fire was a constant fear in the city but the fire team made straight for the crowd round the gesticulating monk make way the fire captain shouted people tumbled away from the crew wheres the fire somebody yelled right here thokyodes yelled back leastways i got orders to put out this incendiary here he waved to his crew one of them swung the pump handle up and down the other turned his hose toward pyrrhos cold water from the hand pumps wooden tub gushed forth the people nearest pyrrhos stampeded away from him cursing and spluttering as they went pyrrhos himself tried to speak on through his drenching but started to sneeze whether he wanted to or not the fire team kept hosing him down until the tub was empty then thokyodes looked over to krispos shall we fill er up again your majesty pyrrhos looked as if a little more would drown him no thats fine thokyodes thank you krispos said i think hes been cooled down very nicely cooled downahhehooam i pyrrhos shouted water dripped from his beard and from the end of his nose nay ive justahhehoobegun to speak the truth about our imperial adulterer now hear me people of videssos go home and dry off holy sir someone called not unkindly youll take a flux on the lungs if you go on like this aye your tales as soggy as your robe anyhow someone else said a woman added save the fire in your belly to warm yourself no the crew just doused that fire a man said he chuckled at his own wit pyrrhos had lived all his adult life in monasteries or attached to one temple or another he was used to respect from the laity not gibesnot even gibes kindly meant but worse than those gibes was the laughter that sprang from so many throats at the spectacle of a furious drenched shivering holy man standing on his perchit was an overturned box krispos sawtrying to keep on with his denunciation through teeth that chattered loud as the wooden finger cymbals vaspurakaner dancers used to clack out their rhythm he might have stood up against being ignored because they preached the virtues of a way of life more austere than most folk would willingly embrace monks were often ignored but laughter he could not endure glaring at the crowd in general and krispos in particular he awkwardly scrambled down from his box and stalked away a fresh sneezing spasm robbed even his departure of dignity phos with you drippy pyrrhos a man with a loud voice yelled after him new laughter rang out pyrrhos back already stiff jerked as if someone had stuck a knife into him drippy pyrrhos good old drippy pyrrhos the crowd sang his departure turned to headlong retreat by the time he reached the edge of the forum of the ox he was all but running geirrod turned to krispos hell love you no better for this majesty the guardsman said make a man out a fool and hell reckon himself at feud with you no less than if youd slashed him with sword hes already at feud with me and with everyone else who wont think and do just as he does krispos answered now though the good god willing people wont take him so seriously the holy pyrrhosuntil lately the most holy pyrrhoswas someone whose notions youd respect but how much attention would you pay to good old drippy pyrrhos ahh now i see it geirrod said slowly youve poisoned his word he spoke in his own language to his fellow northerners their deep voices rose and fell their eyes swung toward krispos geirrod said who but a videssian would think to slay a man with laughter the other halogai nodded solemnly a few feet away thokyodes gestured to his crew the two men who had hauled the pump around now set it down with grunts of relief the rest leaned on their fire axes save for one who strolled off toward a fellow selling roasted chickpeas thokyodes caught krispos eye when krispos did not look away the fire captain came over to him well your majesty i hope we put out some trouble for you there he said thokyodes was videssian and by his accent a city man he required no explanations to understand what krispos had planned i think you did krispos said youll be rewarded for it too i thank you thokyodes said briskly he did not try to protest his own unworthiness business was business krispos raised his voice and called out all right folks the show is over for today the crowd that had been listening to pyrrhos rapidly melted away a few people averted their faces as they went by krispos as if they did not want him to know they had been anywhere near someone who preached against him more though went off chattering happily as far as they were concerned pyrrhos harangue and krispos response to it might have been arranged only for their amusement city folk were like that krispos thought with a touch of exasperation by the time he and the halogai got back to the palaces winters short day was almost done longinos looked ready to burst from curiosity when krispos came into the imperial residence your majesty surely you didnt treat pyrrhos as if he were a fire that needed putting out krispos broke in oh but i did esteemed sir he explained how thokyodes and his crew had hosed down the cleric finishing most of the people who saw it got a good laugh out of it like the fire captain longinos caught on in a hurry hard to take a laughingstock seriously eh your majesty just so esteemed sir i remembered how much trouble petronas had trying to get rid of skombros when he was vestiarios no matter how plainly he showed anthimos that skombros was a scoundrel anthimos stood by him but when he arranged to have skombros laughed at he was out of the palaces within a week ah yes skombros longinos murmured by his voice he might have forgotten that the eunuch who was once petronas rival as the chief power behind anthimos throne had ever existed krispos was undeceived longinos went on the good god willing your majesty pyrrhos will have been dealt with as ah thoroughly as skombros was krispos sketched the sunsign may it be so ironshod hooves clattered on cobblestones chain mail jingled eyes to the right an officer bawled as the regiment rode past the reviewing stand the lead troopers looked over to krispos and saluted he put his fist over his heart in return the crowd that lined both sides of middle street cheered the soldiers most of them in videssos the city for the first time grinned at the cheers and went back to gaping at the wonders of the imperial capital awed expressions aside the young men from the westlands central plateau looked like solid troops well mounted and in good spirits despite the long grueling slog that had at last brought them here to the city a raindrop splashed off krispos cheek then another and another the soldiers riding by reached up to tug the hoods of their surcoats lower on their foreheads some spectators opened umbrellas other retreated under the colonnades that flanked the thoroughfare when the last horse had trotted past krispos stepped down from the reviewing stand with a sigh of relief by then he was just about as wet as pyrrhos had been after thokyodes turned the pump on him he was glad to mount progress and head back to the imperial residence a brisk toweling a bowl of hot mutton stew and a fresh robe worked wonders for his attitude after all he thought it had been rain not snow winters grip would ease soon when the roads dried the army he was assembling here would move north against harvas he hoped to have seventy thousand men under arms surely the empires full weight backed by the cleverest mages of the sorcerers collegium could overcome one wicked wizard who somehow refused to die barsymes carried away the silver bowl that had held stew he paused in the doorway majesty do i need to remind you that the envoy of the king of kings of makuran has arranged for an audience with you this afternoon i remember krispos said not altogether happily he wished he could forget about videssos great western neighbor the more so as he was concentrating so much of his army against the empires northern foe he had already discovered that wishes availed little in statecraft chihorvshnasp the makuraner envoy was an elegant man of middle years with a long rectangular face deep hollows under his cheekbones and large soulful brown eyes that looked perfectly candid looks krispos knew were not to be trusted when chihorvshnasp performed the proskynesis before him the ambassadors headgear a brimless gray felt hat that looked like nothing so much as a bucket fell from his head and rolled a few feet away that happens every time you come to see me krispos observed so it does your majesty a small indignity of no import between friends chihorvshnasp retrieved the errant hat and replaced it on his head his videssian was excellent only a trace of his native hiss said he was not an educated native of videssos the city he went on i bring you the greetings of his puissant majesty nakhorgan king of kings pious beneficent to whom the god and his prophets four have granted many years and wide domains i am always glad to have the greetings of his puissant majesty krispos said in your next dispatch to mashiz please send him mine chihorvshnasp bowed in his seat he will be honored to receive them he also wishes me to convey to you his hope for your success against the vicious barbarians who assail your northern frontier makuran has suffered inroads from such savages his puissant majesty knows what videssos is enduring now and sympathizes with your pain his puissant majesty is very kind krispos thought he had caught the drift of the conversation he hoped he was wrong unfortunately he was right chihorvshnasp continued i add my hopes to his may your war be successful since you have invested so much of videssos strength in it no doubt you will vanquish your foes without peace with makuran there can be no doubt that some of your armies would have remained in the westlands indeed your decision to commit them speaks well of your confidence in the enduring amity between our two great empires now krispos knew what was coming the only question was how expensive it would prove should i think otherwise he asked not all leaders of videssos have felt as you do chihorvshnasp reminded him only yesterday it seems the sevastokrator petronas launched an unprovoked assault against makuran i opposed that war krispos said i remember and i honor you for it nonetheless you must be aware of what would happen if his puissant majesty nakhorgan king of kings chose this summer to avenge himself for the insult offered to makuran with your forces directed away from your western border our brave horsemen would charge ahead sweeping all before them krispos wanted to bite his lip he held his face still instead youre right of course he said chihorvshnasps irongray eyebrows arched that was not how the game was played krispos went on if his puissant majesty really intended to invade videssos you wouldnt come here to warn me how much does he want for being talked out of it those eyebrows rose again the envoy was an artist with them he said it is an intolerable affront to the god and his prophets four that makuran should remain bereft of the valley that contains the great cities of hanzith and artaz between them the two little vaspurakaner town might have held half as many people as say opsikion makuran may have them back krispos said abandoning with a sentence the valley that was the sole fruit of petronas war of three years before the war petronas had thought would take him all the way to mashiz your majesty is gracious and generous chihorvshnasp said with a small smile with such goodwill all difficulties between nations may yet fall by the wayside and peace and harmony prevail yet his puissant majesty the king of kings nakhorgan remains aggrieved that you love other sovereigns more than him how can you say such a thing krispos cried the picture of shock and dismay no ruler could be dearer to my heart than your master chihorvshnasp sadly shook his head would that his puissant majesty could believe you yet he has seen you fling great sums of gold to this wretch known as harvas blackrobe who rewarded you with nothing but treachery and his puissant majesty the good and true friend of videssos has not known so much as a copper of your great bounty how many coppers would satisfy him krispos askeddryly you paid harvas a hundred pounds of gold not so surely a good and true friend is worth three times as much as a lying barbarian who takes your money and then does as he would have had you never paid him indeed your majesty i reckon that a bargain a bargain krispos clapped a dramatic hand to his forehead i reckon that an outrage his puissant majesty is looking to suck videssos blood and asks us to give him a solid gold straw with which to drink the dickering went on for several days krispos knew he would have to pay nakhorgan more than he had given harvas the king of kings honor demanded it but paying nakhorgan a lot more than he had given harvas went against krispos grain for his part chihorvshnasp haggled more like a rug merchant than a makuraner grandee at last they settled on a hundred fifty pounds of gold goldpieces excellent your majesty chihorvshnasp said when they reached agreement krispos did not think it was excellent hed hoped to get away with something closer to a hundred twentyfive pounds but chihorvshnasp knew too well how badly he needed peace with makuran he said his puissant majesty has an able servant in you you give me credit beyond my worth chihorvshnasp said but his voice had a purr in it like a stroked cats no indeed krispos said i will order the gold sent out today and i shall inform his puissant majesty that it has begun its journey to him looking as pleased with himself as if the hundred fifty pounds of gold were going to him instead of his master chihorvshnasp made his elaborate farewells and departed barsymes krispos called the vestiarios appeared in the doorway prompt and punctual as usual how may i help you your majesty what in skotos cursed name does puissant mean phostis toddled out of the imperial residence on uncertain legs he blinked at the bright spring sunshine then decided he liked it and smiled one of the halogai grinned and pointed the little avtokrator he has teeth half a dozen of them krispos agreed another ones on the way too so hell chew your greaves off if you let him get near you the guardsmen drew back in mock fright laughing all the while phostis charged toward the stairs hed only been able to walk without holding on to something for about a week but he had the hang of it going down stairs was something else again phostis plan was to walk blithely off the first one he came to just to see what would happen krispos caught him before he found out far from feeling rescued phostis squirmed and kicked and squawked in krispos arms arent you the ungrateful one krispos said as he carried the toddler to the bottom of the stairway would you rather id let you smash your silly head by all indications phostis would have preferred exactly that when krispos put him down at the base of the stairs he refused to stay there instead he started to climb back toward the top he had to crawl to do it the risers were too tall for him to raise his little legs from one to the next krispos followed close behind in case ascent turned to sudden and unplanned descent phostis reached the top unscathedthen spun around and tried to jump down krispos caught him again in the entranceway to the residence someone clapped krispos looked up and saw dara bravely done krispos she called mischief in her voice youve saved the heir to the state the halogai bowed as she came out into the sunshine now no robe no matter how flowing could conceal her swelling abdomen krispos looked down at phostis the heir to the state wont live to inherit it unless somebody keeps an eye on him every minute of the day and night as soon as the words were out of his mouth he wondered if dara would take them the wrong way hed lived in videssos the city too long to be unaware that plotting even ahead of the races in the amphitheater was its favorite sport she only smiled and said babies are like that she turned toward the sun and closed her eyes during the winter you think it will never get warm and dry again id like to be a lizard and just stand here and bask but after shed basked for a minute or two her smile faded i always used to wish winter would end as soon as it could now i half want it to last longer the good weather means youll be going out on campaign doesnt it you know it does krispos said unless we get another rainstorm the roads should be dry enough to travel by the end of the week dara nodded i know will you be angry if i tell you im worried no he answered after some thought im worried too he looked north and east he couldnt see much not with the cherry trees that surrounded the imperial residence in such riotous pink bloom but he knew harvas was there waiting for him the knowledge was anything but reassuring i wish you could stay here behind the safety of the citys walls dara said he remembered his awe on the day he first came to videssos the city and saw its massive double ring of fortifications surely even harvas could find no way to overthrow them then he remembered other things as well develtos imbros and trokoundos warning that he should meet harvas as far from the city as he could trokoundos had a way of knowing what he was talking about i dont think theres safety anywhere not while harvas is on the loose he said slowly after a moment dara nodded again he saw how much it cost her phostis wiggled in his arms he set the boy down a haloga took out his dagger undid the sheath from his belt and tossed it near phostis gold inlays ornamented the sheath their glitter drew phostis who picked it up and started chewing on it its brass and leather krispos told him you wont likeit a moment later phostis made a ghastly face and took the sheath out of his mouth a moment after that he started gnawing on it again from behind dara barsymes said here are some proper toys he rolled a little wooden wagon to phostis inside it were two cleverly carved horses phostis picked them up then threw them aside he raised the wagon to his mouth and began to chew on a wheel stick him by a river hell cut down trees like a beaver a haloga said everyone laughed except barsymes who let out an indignant sniff krispos watched phostis playing in the sunshine he suddenly bent down to run a hand through the little boys thick black hair he saw daras eyes widen with surprise he seldom showed phostis physical affection but he knew beyond any possible doubt that even if phostis happened to be anthimos son rather than his own he would far far sooner see him ruling the empire of videssos than harvas blackrobe ix the imperial army was like a city on the march as far as krispos could see in any direction were horses and helmets and spearpoints and wagons they overflowed the road and moved northward on either side yet even in the midst of so many armed men krispos did not feel altogether secure he had gone north with an army before and come back defeated what are our chances trokoundos he asked anxious to be reassured the wizards lips twitched krispos had asked the same question less than an hour before as he had before trokoundos answered were no magic to be used by either side majesty i could hope to ascertain that for you as it is spells yet to be cast befog any magic i might use i assure you though harvas enters this campaign as blind as we do krispos wondered how true that was harvas might have no sorcerous foretelling but hed lived as long as five or six ordinary men on how much of that vast experience could he draw to scent what his foes would do next will we have enough mages to hold him in check there your majesty i can be less certain trokoundos said by the lord with the great and good mind though we now have a better notion of how to try to cope with him thanks to the researches of gnatios thanks to gnatios krispos repeated not altogether happily now instead of a patriarch who backed him absolutely but thought nothing of setting the whole empire ablaze for the sake of perfect orthodoxy he had once more a patriarch who was theologically moderate but not to be trusted out of sightor in it for that matter he hoped the trade would prove worthwhile trokoundos continued when i faced harvas last year i took him for a barbarian wizard puissant butwhy are you laughing your majesty never mind krispos said laughing still go on please ahem well as i say i reckoned harvas blackrobe to be powerful but unschooled now i know this is not the casejust the reverse obtains in fact having now thanks to gnatios a better notion of the sort of magic he employes and having also with me moreand more potentcolleagues i do possess some hope that we shall be able to defend against his onslaughts all the finest mages of the sorcerers collegium rode with the army if trokoundos could but hope to withstand harvas by their combined efforts that in itself spoke volumes about the evil wizards strength they were not volumes krispos cared to read he said can we sorcerously strike back at the northerners who follow harvas your majesty we will try trokoundos said the good god willing we will distract harvas from the magics he might otherwise hurl at us past that i have no great hope because battle so inflames mens passions magic more readily slips aside from them then and is more easily countered that is why battle magic succeeds so seldom save harvas krispos wished the wizard had not tacked on that codicil rhisoulphos rode by at a fast trot why arent you with your regiment krispos called his fatherinlaw reined in and looked around as if wondering who presumed to address him with such familiarity his face cleared when he saw krispos greetings your majesty he said saluting i just gave a courier a note to a friend in the city and now i am indeed returning to my men by your leave he waited for krispos nod then dug his heels into his horses flanks and urged the animal on again krispos followed him with his eyes rhisoulphos did not look back he rode as if in a competition of horsemanship without a single wasted motion hes so smooth krispos said as much to himself as to trokoundos he rides smoothly he talks smoothly he has smooth good looks and smooth good sense but you dont like him trokoundos said it was not a question no i dont i want to i ought to hes daras father after all but with so much smoothness on the top of him who can be sure whats underneath petronas guessed wrong and paid for it too set next to harvas every other worry is a small one i know but i have to keep an eye on the small things too for fear theyll grow while my back was turned i wonder who he was writing to you know trokoundos what i really need is a spell that would give me eyes all around my head and let me stay awake day and night both then id sleep betterexcept i wouldnt sleep would i krispos stopped ive confused myself trokoundos smiled never mind your majesty no wizard can give you what you asked for so theres no point in fretting over it i suppose not fretting over rhisoulphos though is something else again krispos looked ahead once more but the general had vanishedsmoothlyamong the swarms of riders heading north the army did not cover much more ground in a day than a walking man might have when the troopers moved they set a decent pace but getting them moving each morning and getting them into camp every night ate away at the time they were able to spend on the road that had also been true of the forces krispos led against petronas and against harvas the summer before but to a lesser degree one of the things a huge army meant was huge inefficiency thats just the way it goes mammianos said when krispos complained we cant move out in the morning till the slowest soldiers are ready to go if we let quicker regiments just rush on ahead after a few days wed have men strung out over fifty miles the whole point of a big army is to be able to use all the troops youve brought along supplies krispos said as if it were a complete sentence mammianos clapped him on the shoulder majesty unless we crawl north on our hands and knees well manage the quartermasters know how fasthow slow if you likewe travel theyve had practice keeping armies this size in bread i promise you krispos let himself be reassured the videssian bureaucracy had kept the empire running throughout anthimos antic reign and through worse reigns than his in the past avtokrators came ruled and were gone the gray efficient stewards secretaries and logothetes went on forever the army quartermasters belonged to the same breed he wondered what would happen if one day an emperor died and no one succeeded him he suspected the bureaucrats would go on ruling competently if unspectaculariy at least until some important paper needed signing then for want of a signature the whole state would come crashing down he chuckled softly pleased at his foolish conceit the next day the army rode past the field when harvas raiders had beaten and killed mavros the mass graves krispos men had dug afterward still scarred the earth now new grass green and hopeful was spreading over the squares of raw dirt krispos pointed to it like the grass may our victory spring from their defeat from your lips to the ear of phos trokoundos said sketching the sunsign with his right hand he sent krispos a sly look i hadnt thought your majesty had so much of a poet in him poet krispos snorted im no poet just a formerwell a man who used to be a farmer the grass will grow tall over those graves with the bodies of so many brave men manuring the fields the mage nodded soberly thats a less pleasing image but i daresay a truer one they camped three or four miles past the battlefield far enough krispos hoped to keep the troopers from brooding on it as was his habit each evening krispos wrote a brief note to iakovitzes detailing the days progress when he was done he called for a courier a rider came trotting up to the imperial tent hardly a minute later he saluted krispos and said all right your majesty lets have yours too and ill be off for the city he sat his horse with a letsgetonwithit dontwastemytime attitude that made krispos smile that attitude and the blithe cheek of his words left krispos certain he was a city man himself mine too is it eh well sir with whose letter is mine lucky enough to travel its all in the family you might say your majesty yours and your fatherinlaws will go together both in the same pouch will they krispos raised an eyebrow he knew his use of the gesture did not have the flair that chihorvshnasp say put into it but it got the job done and to whom is the eminent rhisoulphos writing just let me look and ill tell you like any man from videssos the city the courier took it for granted that he knew things lesser mortals didnt he opened his leather dispatch pouch and drew out a roll of parchment sealed with enough wax to keep a poor family in candles for a month he had to turn it between his fingers to find out where the address was here we go your majesty its to the most holy patriarch gnatios it is leastways i think hes most holy patriarch this week unless you made him into a monk again while i wasnt looking or maybe into a prawn salad a prawn salad hell end up wishing he was a prawn salad when i get through with him maybe rhisoulphos was writing to gnatios for enlightenment on an abstruse theological point or for some other innocuous reason krispos didnt believe it not for a minute the two of them were both intriguers and he the logical person against whom they would intrigue he plucked at his beard as he thought then turned to one of the halogai who stood guard in front of his tent vagn fetch me trokoundos right away the mage majesty aye i bring him trokoundos was picking at his teeth with a fingernail as he followed vagn to the imperial tent whats toward your majesty this fellow krispos pointed to the courier is carrying a letter from the excellent rhisoulphos to the most holy patriarch gnatios is he indeed no one had to draw pictures for trokoundos are you curious about whats in that letter you might say so yes krispos held out a hand the courier was not a man to be caught napping with a flourish he gave krispos rhisoulphos letter krispos passed it to trokoundos as you see its sealed tighter than a winter grain pit can you get it open and then shut again without breaking the seals hmm an interesting question do you know sometimes these small conjurations are harder than the more grandiose ones im certain i can get the wax off and on again but the first method that springs to mind would surely ruin the writing it sheltersnet what you have in mind unless i miss my guess let me think he proceeded to do just that quite intensely for the next couple of minutes once he brightened then shook his head and sank back into his study at last he nodded you can do it then krispos said i believe so your majesty not a major magic but one that will draw upon the laws of similarity and contagion both and nearly at the same time i presume privacy would be a valuable adjunct to this undertaking what oh yes of course krispos held the tent flap open with his own hands then followed trokoundos inside the wizard said you must have some parchment in here yes laughing krispos pointed to the portable desk where hed just finished his note to iakovitzes several other sheets still curled over one another trokoundos nodded excellent he took one rolling it into a cylinder of about the same diameter as the sealed letter from rhisoulphos to gnatios then he touched the two of them together and squinted at the place where their ends joined ill use the law of similarity in two aspects he explained first in that parchment is similar to parchment and second in that these are two similar cylinders now just a dab of paste to let this one hold its shapecant use ribbon dont you know for it wouldnt be in precisely the right place krispos didnt know but hed already seen that trokoundos liked to lecture as he worked the mage set his new parchment cylinder upright on the desk by the law of contagion things once in contact continue to influence each other after that contact ends thus he held the letter upright in one hand and made slow passes over it with the other chanting all the while sudden as a blink the sealing wax disappeared trokoundos pointed to the parchment cylinder hed made you did it krispos exclaimedthat new cylinder wore a wax coat now every daub and spatter that had been on the letter was there so i did trokoundos said with a touch of smugness i had to make certain my cylinder was no wider than the one rhisoulphos made of his letter that was most important for otherwise the wax would have cracked as it tried to form itself around my piece of parchment he went on explaining but krispos had stopped listening he held out his hand for the letter trokoundos gave it to him he slid off the ribbon unrolled the document and read rhisoulphos to the most holy ecumenical patriarch gnatios greetings as i said in my last letter i think it selfevident that videssos would best be ruled by a man whose blood is of the best not by a parvenu no matter how energetic he paused whats a parvenu somebody able who just came off a farm himself instead of having a greatgreatgrandfather who did it for him trokoundos said oh krispos resumed as you are scion of a noble house yourself most holy sir i am confident you will agree with me and will seize the opportunity to expound this position to the people when the proper circumstances arise what with the uncertainty and danger of the campaign upon which krispos has embarked that moment may come at any time he stopped again trokoundos said nothing treasonous so farquite he could as well be worrying about what happens if you die in battle as over anything else so he could but he sends himself to the ice with his next five words listen it might even be hastened aye thats treason trokoundos said flatly what will you do about it krispos had been thinking about that from the instant hed learned rhisoulphos was corresponding with gnatios now he answered first i want you to seal the letter up again he handed it to trokoundos of course your majesty trokoundos rerolled the letter and put the ribbon around it once more his left hand shaped a quick pass he spoke a lowvoiced word of command the ribbon changed place on the parchment ive returned it to its exact previous position your majesty so the restored wax will fit over it perfectly without waiting for krispos nod the mage held the letter upright the ribbon did not stir evidently the minor magic held it where it belonged trokoundos began the chant he had used before to remove the sealing wax this time though his fingers fluttered downward in his passes rather than up toward the ceiling of the imperial tent again krispos missed the transfer of wax from one parchment to the other one instant it was on the roll that stood on his desk the next back on rhisoulphos letter with a bow trokoundos returned the letter to krispos thanks krispos went back outside the courier was waiting with no sign of impatience the sorcery could not have taken long krispos gave him the letter everythings fine he said smiling go on and deliver this to the patriarch hell be glad to have it the courier saluted just as you say your majesty he clucked to his horse and dug in his heels with a small snort the animal trotted away krispos turned to vagn can you find me hmm half a dozen of your countrymen i need quiet men men who can not only keep their mouths shut but also move quietly i bring them majesty vagn said at once trokoundos sent krispos a curious look he ignored it a few minutes later vagn returned with six more burly blond northerners for all their bulk they moved like hunting cats krispos held the tent flap open brave sirs come in i have a task for you krispos woke at sunrise every day maybe id be able to sleep late if my greatgreatgrandfather were the one whod come off the farm he thought as he put his feet on the ground he listened to the camp stirring to life he was just buckling on his sword belt when shouts of alarm cut through the usual morning drone of chattering men clanking mail and bubbling cookpots he stuck his head outside savoring a long breath of cool fresh air soon enough the day would turn hot and sticky whats going on he asked narvikka who was standing morning guard duty majesty the noble rhisoulphos seems to have disappeared the haloga answered disappeared what do you mean disappeared he is not in his tent majesty not anywhere about the camp narvikka said stolidly thats terrible news what could have happened to him since narvikka only shrugged a musical chain mail shrug krispos hurried over to rhisoulphos tent which lay not far away the tent was surrounded by men and officers all of them agitated krispos strode up to rhisoulphos secondincommand whats happened excellent bagradas your majesty bagradas saluted he was a short pudgy man of about forty who looked and often acted more like a dressmaker than a soldier krispos knew he was one of the two or three best swordsmen in the imperial army that did not keep him from wringing his hands now your wife the lady empress father has been stolen away from us whether by wicked men or dark sorcery i cannot say can harvas magic have reached into our camp may phos prevent it krispos drew the suncircle over his heart so did bagradas truly i hope not your majesty i am inclined to say not for the sentry who guarded rhisoulphos tent was found unconscious this morning by his relief magic might have dealt with the general but would it have needed to lay low his guard as well that seems more like the work of ordinary men you reason like a priest explaining phos holy scriptures krispos said a broad pleased grin spread across bagradas face krispos went on take me to this sentry bagradas led him through the crowd the officers rank and shouts were not enough to clear a path but when krispos raised his voice men stumbled backward out of the way bagradas said your majesty this is the file closer nogeto who had the latenight duty outside the eminent rhisoulphos tent nogeto drew himself to stiff indeed trembling attention tell me what happened to you last night soldier krispos said majesty begging your pardon but everybodys been asking me that and may the ice take me if i know what happened to me one minute i was standing here not thinking real hard the way you do when its late and you know nothings going to go wrong only it did next thing i knew i was lying on the ground with my relief shaking me awake and his eminence the general was gone did somebody sap you no majesty nogeto emphatically shook his head ive been sapped before and i know what its like i dont feel like im fixing to die now the way i would be i just feel like i went to sleep and then got woke up only i couldnt have by the good god i didnt the guards eyes widened with fear sentries who fell asleep at their posts earned the sword and the chopping block hes always been a good soldier your majesty bagradas put in hed not have been chosen to guard the generals tent if he werent is there any reason to think you didnt just fell asleep when you were ah not thinking real hard soldier krispos asked sternly nogeto said majesty for whatever you think its worth just before i he changed tacks just before whatever happened happened i mean i thought i feltoh i dont know i thought i felt a cobweb blow across my face i thought id picked up my hand to brush it away butoh i dont know krispos glanced at bagradas hes not making it up as he stands here your majesty the officer said he said as much before you came will you let a wizard examine you to learn if you speak truly krispos asked nogeto the sentry nodded without hesitation krispos told bagradas take him to trokoundos if hes not lying krispos pursed his lips made a wry face well well just have to look in some other direction thats all aye your majesty who could have done such a vicious evil deed maybe nogeto will be able to give us a clue once trokoundos works on him krispos said meanwhile we have to go on as best we can excellent bagradas do you feel you can lead this regiment until rhisoulphos turns up again whenever that maybe me your majesty oh youre far too generous bagradas realized he might have affected too much humility for he quickly added if you feel i can handle the command i am honored to accept im sure youll lead bravely excellent bagradas good im glad that much is settled then krispos turned to go then stopped as with an afterthought bagradas you know my fatherinlaw and i worked closely together he was helping to manage some rather delicate business for me in the city now that hes disappeared ill have to deal with it myself can you make sure any letters he gets are sent straight on to me before theyre unsealed ill see to it your majesty bagradas promised he spun on his heel and set hands on hips as he glared at the gaggle of men still milling around rhisoulphos tent come on come on you lugs he shouted we still have to ride today whether the eminent sir is here or not get cracking if you please the men moved smartly to obey krispos nodded to himself rhisoulphos had been a canny soldier but the regiment would not suffer under its new leader the army moved out a few minutes later than it might have out not enough to upset even the veteran underofficers who were responsible for keeping their units in good order krispos rode progress up and down the long line of march wherever he went the troopers were buzzing about rhisoulphos disappearance some thought bagradas had got rid of his commander others blamed sorcery others not surprisingly were lewd hell be back in a couple of days all sleepy and with his breeches unbuttoned one fellow guessed oh go on dertallos youve just saying what youd do in his sandals a mate replied if i were in his sandals right now i wouldnt be wearing sandals if you know what i mean dertallos said half a dozen voices barked deep male laughter one slow mile followed another halfway through the day krispos reported that nogeto had been telling the truth he was drugged somehow poor sod the wizard said how very strange krispos answered all right then let him return to duty scouts rode well in advance of the main imperial army with them rode wizards not the journeymen who had accompanied krispos last northern foray but masters for the sorcerers collegium if they could not sniff out a trap no one could if no one could krispos was uneasily aware that trap would close on his army and who then would defend videssos the city his wife his heir and his son to be no one he knew that all too well the farther north the army traveled the fewer the farms krispos saw being worked that tore at him next to harvesttime spring should have been the busiest season of the year with men and oxen in the fields plowing planting and watering but what was the point when raiders might sweep down at any moment many little farming villages stood deserted their former inhabitants fled to ground they hoped safer if somehow he beat harvas krispos knew he would have to import peasants to replace the ones who had ran away or been slain otherwise the whole land would start to go back to wilderness as the paristrian mountains climbed higher into the northern sky men began to peer suspiciously at every clump of brush every stand of elms they passed krispos had known that same feeling the summer before as he approached imbros wondering how and where harvas would strike now that he neared imbros again he knew it again doubly strong about two days south of the murdered city a scout came galloping back to krispos the fellow saluted and said majesty one of the wizards thinks he senses something up ahead he cant tell what hes not even sure its there butmaybe something the scout looked irked at having to report what likely was just a mages vagary the most krispos hoped for though was detecting harvas snares at all expecting them to announce themselves with bells and whistles was too much to ask he turned to the army musicians play form line of battle then hold in place well see whats gong on up ahead as the music rang out and the soldiers began to move krispos reflected that hed be wasting a good part of a days travel if the wizard had discovered nothing more than his overactive imagination but better that than ignoring a true warning and throwing away his army he touched progress flanks with his heels urging the horse forward soon he had pressed ahead of the main body of soldiery a few other riders advanced with himwizards all they knew what a halt had to mean trokoundos waved from atop a gray that trotted with a dancers grace krispos waved back he reined progress in close behind a knot of scouts and sorcerers to his untrained senses the country ahead looked no different from that through which the army had been traveling fieldstoo many of them untendedpunctuated by stands of oak maple elm and fir shadows raced over them keeping time with the fluffy clouds that drifted across the sky it all seemed too lovely too peaceful to have anything to do with harvas whats wrong krispos asked one of the sorcerers a young gangly man whose thin beard imperfectly covered his acne scars bowed and said your majesty im called zaidas i feelnot a wrongness ahead nor even a lack of rightness but ratheroh how best to say itan absence of both rightness and wrongness which could be unusual he cracked his knuckles and peered nervously at the innocentappearing countryside if you dont sense anything who knows whats hiding there is that what youre saying krispos asked zaidas nodded krispos turned to the other mages do you also feel this ah absence no majesty one of them said that does not mean it is not there though despite his youth zaidas has great and unusual sensitivity which is the reason we bade him accompany us what he perceives or fails to perceive may well be genuine zaidas larynx bobbed up and down as he shot his colleague a grateful glance krispos made a sour face may well be cuts no ice sorcerous sirs i could starve hunting a grouse that may well be there how do we find out trokoundos strolled up just then to join the discussion we find out by testing is it not so brothers the other wizards nodded trokoundos went on the lord with the great and good mind willing we may even surprise harvas who should be confident weve noticed nothing trokoundos was an able mage but no general if hes there hell know weve noticed krispos said we dont form line of battle every time a rabbit hops across the road what we have to find out is what is our line of battle moving toward youre right of course your majesty trokoundos shook his head in chagrin then began a technical discussion with the rest of the wizards that lost krispos by the fourth sentence he was beginning to wonder if they would spend the whole morning chattering at one another when trokoundos seemed to remember he was there the mage said your majesty a number of spells could create the illusion of normality ahead we think one is more likely given that harvas could both pervert and amplify its power through blood sacrifice we will try to break through it now assuming it to be the one we guess do it krispos said at once acting against harvas instead of reacting to him felt like a victory in itself the wizards went to work with the practiced efficiency of a squad of soldiers who had fought side by side for years krispos watched trokoundos who smeared his eyelids with an ointment another mage ceremoniously handed him the gall of a cat mixed with the fat of an allwhite hen trokoundos explained it gives the power to see that which others may not he held up a palegreen stone and a goldpiece touched the two of them together chrysolite and gold drive away foolishness and expel fantasies the good god willing behind him the voice of the rest of the wizards rose and fell as some invoked phos while others chanted to bring their building spell to sharper focus a wizard threw a graygreen leaf on a brazier the puff of smoke that arose smelled sweet trokoundos set a small sparkling stone in a copper bowl smashed it to fragments with a silver hammer opal and laurel when used with the proper spell may render a manor with sufficient strength maybe an armyinvisible thus we destroy both and thus we destroy with spell with the last words trokoundos voice rose to a shout his right finger stabbed out toward the peacefullooking landscape ahead for a long moment for more than a moment nothing happened krispos glared at zaidas who was watching the unchanged terrain with the same dejected expression his colleagues bore aye he was very sensitive krispos thoughthe could even detect traps that werent there then the air rippled as if it were the surface of a roughrunning stream krispos blinked and rubbed at his eyes trokoundos raised a fist and shouted in triumph zaidas looked like a man reprieved when the sword was already on its way up and while the landscape to the north did not change when the ripples cleared they revealed a great army of footsoldiers drawn up in battle array across the road across the fields one end of their line anchored by a pond the other by a grove of apple trees they could not have been more than a mile away horns cried out behind krispos drums thumped pipes squealed his men shouted they saw the enemy too then he gave the wizards a formal military salute thank you magical sirs without you we would have blundered straight into them just then harvas men must have realized they were discovered they shouted too not with the disciplined hurrah of videssian troops but loud and long and fierce like so many bloodthirsty wild beasts the sun sparked cheerfully off axe blades helms and mail coats as they surged toward the imperial army krispos turned to the wizards once more magical sirs if its to be battle i suggest you get clear before youre caught in the middle that possibility did not seem to have occurred to some of the sorcerers they scrambled onto horses and mules and rode off with remarkable celerity krispos rode away too back to where the imperial standard snapped in the breeze at the center of the imperial line mammianos greeted him with a salute and a wry grin worried for a minute there that id have to run this battle without you the fat general grunted nice to know you think im of some use krispos answered mammianos grunted again his grin got wider he said aye youre of some use your majesty fair gave me a turn it did when those buggers appeared out of thin air if wed just walked on into them well it could have ruined our whole day thats one way to put it yes krispos grinned too at mammianos sangfroid he ran an eye up and down the videssian line it was as he and his marshals had planned with lancerssome mounted on horses wearing mail of their ownin the front ranks on either wing and archers behind them ready to shoot over their heads into the ranks of the enemy in the center stood the halogai of the imperial guard the guardsmen did not know it but native units on either side had orders to turn on them if they went over to harvas that might suffice to keep the imperial army alive krispos knew it would not save him he drew his saber and scowled at the advancing enemy mammianos spoke to the musicians new calls rang through the air the horsemen on either wing slid forward seeking to envelop harvas front krispos scowled again this time when he noticed how broad that front was he has more men than wed reckoned he said to mammianos aye so he does the general agreed glumly the northerners must have been streaming south from halogaland ever since harvas seized kubrat to them the land and climate look good true true krispos had entertained the same thought himself hed spent several years north of the paristrian mountains after kubrati raiders kidnapped everyone in his village he remembered kubrat as bleak and cold if halogai found it attractive he shivered to think what that said of their homeland then he stopped worrying about halogaland and started worrying about the halogai in front of him harvas men fought with the same disregard for life and limbtheir own or their foesas did the northerners who served videssos they shouted their evil chieftains name as they swung their axes in sweeping arcs of death the imperials shouted too the cry krispos heard most often was a cry for revenge imbros the lines crashed together in bloody collision after moments of that fight even men previously uninitiated into the red brotherhood of war could honestly call themselves veterans a little righting against the northerners went a long way here a lancer spitted a haloga as if to roast him over some huge fire there another haloga crashed to the ground his armor clattering about him as a cleverly aimed arrow found the gap between shield top and helm but harvas men dealt out deadly wounds as well as suffering them here an axeman hewed down first horse and then rider splashing friend and foe alike with gore there yet another northerner already bleeding from a dozen wounds pulled a videssian from the saddle and stabbed him before falling in death in front of krispos the combat was footsoldier against footsoldier haloga against haloga as the warriors who followed harvas met those who had given their allegiance to the avtokrator of the videssians as in any battle where brother met brother that was the fiercest fight of all a war within the greater war the halogai swung and struck and swung again all the while cursing one another for having chosen the wrong side once hatred was too hot even for weapons as two halogai who had been screaming abuse as they fought threw aside axes and shields to batter each other with fists the northerners who had taken videssos gold never wavered krispos knew shame for having doubted them all because theyd sworn they would they battled and bled and died for a land that was not theirs with a courage few of its native sons could match how do we fare krispos shouted to mammianos were holding them the general shouted back from all i can tell thats better than agapetos or mavrosphos keep them in his lightever managed to do if the wizards can keep harvas from buggering us while were looking the other way we may end up celebrating the day instead of cursing it most of the wizards by now clustered behind the imperial line not far from where krispos sat atop progress they gathered in a tight knot around zaidas if any of their number could sense harvas blackrobes next move the young mage was probably the one krispos hoped his skinny shoulders could carry that weight of responsibility even as the thought crossed krispos mind zaidas jerked where he stood he spoke rapidly to his comrades who burst into action krispos noted what they did less closely than he ought have for at that same moment he was afflicted by a deep and venomous itch put any man in armor and he will itch sweat will dry on his skin and he cannot scratch rather than go mad he learns to ignore it krispos could not ignore this itch it was as if cockroaches scrambled over the very core of him of themselves his fingertips scraped against his gilded shirt of mail and he was not alone up and down the videssian line men clawed at themselves forgetting the foes before them harvas warriors were not afflicted in the twinkling of any eye a score of imperial soldiers went down too distracted by their torment even to protect themselves the videssian line wavered ice ran through krispos chilling even his itch for an instant if this went on for long the army would fall apart even as first blood welled from beneath torn nails his head turned toward the wizards led by trokoundos they were incanting frantically those not actually involved in shaping the spell scratched as hard as anyone else the ones who were casting it needed their hands for passes the discipline they required to carry on would have made pyrrhos jealous all at once as if a portcullis had fallen the itching stopped the imperials looked to their weapons again and cut down the halogai who confident they would not be able to resist had thrust forward into their line a cheer for the mages of the sorcerers collegium krispos yelled his soldiers took up the cry and made it ring out over the field from behind the enemy line an answering scream rose a scream of such hatred rage and frustration that for a moment all other war cries videssian and haloga alike tremblingly fell silent that krispos thought was the voice of the manif man he still waswho wanted to rule videssos he shuddered harvas northerners seemed for a moment dismayed at the failure of their dark chieftains magic but with or without harvas they were warriors fierce and bold men who had grown used to winning glory by always crushing their foes in combat they would have been ashamed to be deprived of it now through defeat at the hands of videssians so they fought on giving no quarter and seeking none the videssians had been more hesitant at the start of the fight some had experienced harvas sorcery in the campaigns of the summer before all had heard of it nor had the tales shrunk in the telling only now were they beginning to see beginning to believe their wizards could counter harvas leaving the outcome of the battle to them alone battle against merely mortal foes held only terrors they already knew they pressed against the halogai with renewed spirit krispos realized gnatios had done the empire a great service by discovering harvas nature he hoped for the patriarchs sake that his response to rhisoulphos would prove benign if it was not gnatios would answer for it no matter what aid he had rendered in the fight against harvas a fresh charge from harvas men yanked his mind back to the immediate the halogai seemed to have inhuman endurance to be as strong and uncomplaining as the horses the videssians rode they were roaring again their blue eyes wide and staring their faces bloodcrimson by their set expressions many of them were drunk the imperial guards met their cousins breast to breast defied them to advance a foot as one guard fell another deliberately stepped forward to take his place fewer ranks stood between krispos and the enemy than had been in place when the fight began the shrieks of the wounded began to drown out war cries on both sides some hurt men staggered away from the line clutching at themselves and biting their lips to hold back screams comrades dragged aside others not least so they could reach over them to fight some more healerpriests grayfaced with fatigue did what they could for the most desperately hurt no one helped the horses whose screams were more piteous than those of the soldiers krispos saw surprised how long his shadow had grown he glanced toward the sun it had sunk far down in the west the battle went on still perfectly balanced though night was near neither side showed any sign of giving way krispos had an uneasy vision of the fight coming down to a duel between the last living videssian and his haloga counterpart suddenly the wizards stirred again krispos ground his teeth harvas blackrobe had his own notions of how the battle should end and the strength and will to bring those notions to reality for just an instant krispos sight grew dim as if night had already fallen he rubbed at his eyes nor was he the only videssian to do so but then his vision cleared once more harvas screamed in rage and hate trokoundos walked over to krispos the mage looked as worn as any healerpriest but sober triumph lit his eyes your majesty he tried to draw the night and the darkness that is skotos down upon us we foiled him more easily this time than before that spell is potent but can come from only one direction our strength together sufficed to wall it away the assembled might of the finest wizards of the sorcerers collegium then was more or less a match for harvas blackrobe alone in a way that was encouraging krispos had feared nothing and no one could match harvas but it was also frightening in and of itself for it gave some notion of the might the sorcerer had acquired in the long years since he turned away from phos toward skotos harvas cried out again this time in a tone of command what his dark sorcery had failed to do the axes of his followers might yet accomplish the halogai rushed forward in an allout effort to break the ranks of their foes steady men steady officers shouted from one end of the line to the other it would do krispos thought as a watchword for the empire of videssos the northerners could rage like the sea like videssos the citys sea walls the imperial army would hold them at bay hold them the army did if barely as the haloga surge began to ebb mammianos nudged krispos nows our time to hit back krispos glanced west again the sun was down now the sky where it had set was red as the blood that splashed the battlefield in the gathering gloom above the evening star blazed bright and clear aye krispos said everything we have he turned to the military musicians sound the charge high and sweet and urgent the notes rang through the battle din krispos held his saber high over his head come on he cried will you let yourselves be beaten by a bunch of barbarians who fight on foot and dont know the first thing about horsemanship no yelled every videssian trooper who heard him then show them what we can do the imperials raised a great wordless shout and spurred against harvas men for several minutes the halogai resisted as desperately and as successfully as their foes had not long before then on the imperial left a band of lancers at last broke through their line and got into their rear more followed their voices high and excited in triumph beset from front and rear at once the halogai could not withstand the videssian onslaught they broke and fled northward krispos set spurs to progress the big bay gelding snorted and bounded forward through the thinned ranks of the imperial bodyguards krispos was far from an enthusiastic warrior hed seen war young and from a peasants perspective but now he wanted to strike a blow at the marauders who had done videssos such grievous harm his guardsmen shouted and grabbed for progress bridle trying to hold him back krispos spurred the horse again harder this time all at once quite abruptly no one stood between him and the foe progress pounded toward harvas halogai the videssian horsemen seeing krispos heading toward the fight cheered even harder than they had before a northerner turned to face him the fellow wore a mail shirt that reached down to his knees carried a hacked and battered round wooden shield he was bareheaded if hed ever had a helmet hed lost it in the fighting he still had his axe it was streaked with the brown of drying blood and with fresh red he chopped at progress forelegs the stroke was too quick and missed krispos slashed at the haloga he missed too then progress was past the man krispos never knew whether the northerner escaped or was finished by other videssians battle he had discovered was often like that soon progress caught up with another foe this one did not turn he kept trotting heavily toward the north intent only on escape krispos aimed for the handwide gap between the base of his helmet and the collar of his coat of mail he swung with all his strength his saber clattered off iron the blow jolted him in the saddle the haloga staggered but did not fall his dogged trot went on krispos reined in even a slight taste of battle burned out the desire for more as well that as a youth he had ignored others urgings and refused to become a soldier he thought if this was the best he could do he would have been ravens meat all too quickly up ahead a band of halogai turned at bay buying time for their countrymen to get free now more stars than the evening star shone in the sky black night was near in the darkness and confusion victory could unravel and krispos would sooner lave stepped on a scorpion in the dark than encounter harvas there he looked round for a courier but found none this is what i get for running ahead of the people i need he thought feeling absurdly guilty just then a call he knew sang out loud and insistent hold in place his shoulders sagged with relief mammianos was thinking along with him videssians began pulling up taking off their helmets to wipe their brows those who had come through unhurt started chattering about what a splendid fight it had been a haloga came up beside krispos he gasped and started to raise his saber before he realized the fellow wore the raiment of the imperial guard geirrod looked at him with doubly reproachful eyes majesty you should not leave us we serve to keep you safe i know geirrod will you forgive me if i admit i made a mistake geirrod blinked taken off guard by such quick and abject surrender aye well he said i suppose the man in you threw down the emperor that is not bad he saluted and walked off but krispos knew he had made a mistake he had to be avtokrator first and man second if he threw his life away on a foolish whim far more than he alone would suffer the lesson was hard he hoped one day to learn it thoroughly jubilation ran high in camp that night despite the continuing groans and cries of the wounded from the excitement the men showed they were as excited and overjoyed at their victory as was krispos himself likely for the same reason down deep they must have doubted they could beat harvas now that they had done it once the next time might come easier tonight we feast krispos shouted which only made the camp more joyful cattle were slaughtered as quickly as they could be led up adding further to the blood that drenched the area soon every trooper seemed to have a big gobbet of beef roasting over a fire krispos nostrils twitched at the savory scent which reminded him hed eaten nothing since morning he stood in line to get some meat of his own after hed eaten he met with his generals several of them had men they wanted promoted for bravery on the battlefield well do it right now krispos said that way everyone will be able to applaud them the musicians played assembly the troops packed themselves around the imperial tent one by one krispos called names as the soldiers came forward to be rewarded their commanders shouted out what they had done their comrades cheered lustily whos next krispos whispered a file leader named inkitatos mammianos whispered back file leader inkitatos krispos yelled as loud as he could then again file leader inkitatos inkitatos elbowed his way through the crush to stand on the podium between krispos and mammianos mammianos called to the listening soldiers file leader inkitatos brave and welltrained war horse dashed out the brains of four northerners with blows from its hooves hurrah the men shouted file leader inkitatos i am proud to promote you to troop leader krispos declared the soldiers cheered again grinning krispos added and i promote your horse too the troops whooped and waved and yelled louder than ever if hes promoted do i get his new pay inkitatos asked with the accent and ready opportunism of a man born in videssos the city krispos laughed out loud by the good god youve earned it he turned to the military scribe who was recording the nights promotions note that inkitatos here will draw troop leaders pay once for himself and once for his horse the scribes indulgent chuckle broke off when he saw that krispos meant it he was shaking his head as he made the notation it must have been close to midnight by the time the last promotion was awarded by then the crowd round the imperial tent had thinned out krispos envied the troopers who could go off to their bedrolls any time they felt like it he had to stay up on me podium until the whole ceremony was done when he did finally get to bed he remembered nothing after he lay down sunrise came far too soon krispos eyes felt gritty and his head ached he knew he should have been eager to press on after harvas but found exhausting the prospect of anything more vigorous than an enormous yawn yawning over and over he went outside for breakfast when the army moved out archers were in the van ready to harass harvas men as they retreated with them rode the wizards zaidas in front of them all harvas could have left any number of sorcerous ambushes behind to delay or destroy the videssians krispos worried even more that the raiders would choose to stand siege in imbros with the leisure that would bring harvas who could guess what wickedness he might invent delays the army found haloga rearguards twice stood and fought they sold their lives as bravely as videssians might have if they were protecting their countrymen the imperial army rode over them and pressed on imbros was almost in sight when a wall of darkness twice the height of a man suddenly rose up before the soldiers zaidas waved for everyone to halt the soldiers were more than willing they had no idea whether the wall was dangerous and did not care to learn the hard way the wizards went into a huddle trokoundos cast a spell toward that blank blackness the sorcerous wall drank up the spell and remained unchanged trokoundos swore the wizards tried a different spell the black wall drank up that one too trokoundos swore louder a third try yielded results no better what trokoundos said should have been hot enough to melt the wall by itself what now krispos asked are we blocked forever the wall stretched east and west far as the eye could see no by the lord with the great and good mind trokoundos scowl was as dark as the barrier harvas had placed in the imperial armys path were such facile creations as potent as this one appears the sorcerous art would be altogether different from what in fact it is he paused as if listening to his own words then right hand outstretched he walked up to the black wall and tapped it with a fingertip the other mages and krispos not believing he would dare do that cried out in dismay zaidas reached out to pull trokoundos backtoo late lightning crackled surrounding trokoundos in a dreadful nimbus but when it faded the wall faded too the wizard was left unharmed i thought as much he said his voice silky with selfsatisfaction just a bluff designed to keep us dithering here as long as we would you were very brave and very foolish krispos said please dont do that againi expected to see you die there i didnt and now the way lies open trokoundos answered with that krispos could not argue he signaled to the musicians the call advance all eager horns and pounding drums rang forth the army moved ahead what with rearguards and sorcerous ploys harvas had succeeded in putting space between himself and his pursuers when imbros came into sight late that afternoon krispos approached the town with more than a little trepidation fearing harvas had used the time hed gained to establish himself inside but imbros stood empty surrounded by its forest of stakes over the winter most of the impaled corpses had fallen from them bone gleamed whitely on the ground here and there though a mummified body still stood as if in macabre welcome krispos soldiers muttered to themselves as they made camp not far away they had heard of harvas atrocity but only a relative handful had seen it till now stories heard no matter how vile could be discounted in the mind what came before the eye was something else again an imperial guardsman stuck his head into krispos tent the general bagradas would see you majesty send him in krispos stuffed a last large bite of bread and cheese into his mouth then washed it down with a swig of wine he waved bagradas to a folding canvas chair what can i do for you excellent sir you led youror rather rhisoulphos regiment bravely against the halogai thank you your majesty i did my best i find myself embarrassed though when the fight was over i found a pair of letters had come for rhisoulphos and it slipped my mind till now that you wanted to see all such so i did krispos said well no harm done excellent sir let me have them if you please here you are your majesty bagradas sadly shook his head i wish he could have seen how his men fought yesterday they did him proud and many used his name as a battle cry reckoning that harvas had feared him enough to make away with him most mysterious and distressing his disappearance yes so it was krispos voice was abstracted one of the letters to rhisoulphos was from the patriarch gnatios that one he had been waiting for the other came as a complete and unpleasant surprise it was from dara he waited until bagradas had saluted and bowed his way out then sat and waited a little longer weighing the two letters in his hand without opening either of them he had repeatedly warned the ecumenical patriarch not to betray him again and he knew all his warnings might well have been wasted but dara ever since hed taken the throne hed relied on her and shed never given mm any reason to doubt his trust yet how did a relatively short connection with him weigh against a lifetimes devotion to her father he found he did not want to know not right away he set down the letter from dara and broke the seals on the one from gnatios it was daubed with as much wax as if it had come from the imperial chancery when at last he could unroll it he held it close to a lamp to read gnatios ecumenical patriarch of the videssians to the eminent and noble sir rhisoulphos greetings as you know i have suffered many indignities at the hands of the peasant whose fundament currently defiles the imperial throne i have long believed that those of noble birth confident in their own excellence can best rule the state without feeling the constant and pressing need to interfere in the affairs of the temples thus eminent sir should any accident genuine or contrived befall krispos rest assured that i shall be delighted to proclaim your name from the altar at the high temple krispos tossed the letter aside sure enough gnatios could no more turn away from treachery than a fat man could turn away from sweetness a fat mans taste just made him heavier gnatios though would soon be lighterby a head krispos promised himself not without regret but he had forgiven his patriarch too many times already what of his wife what was he to do if he found her plotting against him he put his hands over his facehe had no idea at last he made himself unseal the letter he recognized daras smoothflowing script at once dara to her father greetings may phos keep you safe through all the righting that is to come and may he give krispos the victory i am well though enormous the midwife says second births are easier than first the good god grant that she be right phostis has another tooth and says mama plain as day i wish you and krispos could see him give krispos my love and tell him i will write to him tomorrow love to you as well from your affectionate daughter ashamed of his worries krispos rolled up the letter to be avtokrator was to be schooled in suspicion had he not been suspicious he might not have found rhisoulphos plot till it found him but to suspect his wife flayed his conscience all the more so since she had but written her father an innocent friendly letter fool krispos said to himself would you rather have discovered she was guilty he stepped out into the night his haloga guard stiffened to attention im going over to mammianos tent krispos said the guardsman nodded and saluted mammianos guards were videssians they too saluted as krispos came up id like to see your master he said one of the guards went into the tent he emerged a moment later and held the flap wide mammianos had a roasted chicken leg in one hand and a cup of wine in the other he gestured to a platter on the ground in front of him plenty more where this came from your majesty help yourself later maybe krispos said first i want to known the latest word on harvas movements i talked with some scouts not a quarter of an hour ago mammianos paused for another bite theyve pushed into the woods that start north of imbros by all the signs harvas raiders are in full retreat the men had that zaidas with them so i dont think harvas could have cozened them the way he did poor mavros if they arent making a stand in the woods that means they have to go all the way back to the mountain pass doesnt it i think so yes mammianos paused again this time thoughtfully once past the woods theres no place between here and the mountains where id care to fight with footsoldiers against horse at any rate good enough krispos said im going to leave the army in your hands for a while thenmaybe a week maybe a little longer i have to get back to videssos the city as fast as i can ive had word of a plot against me too late he wonder if mammianos was part of the conspiracy if so the army might not be his when he came back to it but the fat general had certainly had countless chances to overthrow him and had used none of them now he only nodded gravely and said gnatios has decided hed sooner be emperormaker than patriarch after all has he or is it someone new this time no its gnatios krispos said he doubted mammianos once more but only for a moment the general needed no guilty knowledge to make that guess just the keen political sense hed shown as long as krispos had known him mammianos sighed hes just like petronas gnatios is thinks hes cleverer than anyone else will you finally go and settle him for good yes krispos said hes wriggled out of what he deserves too often and then gone and deserved it again ill ride the courier relays down to the city and drop on him before he realizes ive come meanwhile i want you to press ahead if harvas has fallen back to the pass dont try to force your way through into kubrat we came to grief with that last year but dont let him back into videssos either with the men and mages you have that should be no problem no indeed majesty mammianos agreed but its an expensive way to keep him out if youll forgive my being so bold as to say so i know krispos said im beginning to have an idea about that but its not ripe yet ill talk more about it with you after i get back as you say majesty mammianos tossed aside a bare bone now would you care for a chunk of this bird the white wine i have here goes nicely with it too you wouldnt want to set out riding on an empty stomach would you no i suppose not krispos ate and drank with mammianos through a mouthful of meat he said ill even sleep here through the night cant go far in the darkness anyhow true true if you dont want anything more there ill finish that off for you all thanks very much with a little help from krispos mammianos had completely devoured the chicken he sighed im still hungry i envy you your appetite krispos said mammianos chuckled hoarsely im getting old your majesty nice one of my appetites works as it did when i was young or maybe even better its not the one i would have chosen but then the choice wasnt up to me krispos went back to his own tent a few minutes later i want to be roused at first light he told the guard tell your relief to have progress saddled and ready for me it shall be done majesty the guardsman promised done it was but when krispos went to climb aboard progress he found the scout commander sarkis and a squad of his men waiting each of them already mounted best we ride back to the city with you your majesty to keep you safe krispos glared by the good god excellent sir can i do nothing secret not if it puts you in danger sarkis answered firmly his men nodded krispos glared again it did no good he spurred progress moving quickly into a trot and then a gallop the scouts horses were nothing special to look at but had no trouble keeping pace every couple of hours he and his unwanted companions changed mounts at a courier relay station his backside and inner thighs grew chafed and sore long before the end of the first day in the saddleriding hard from dawn to dusk was far different from ambling along at the slow pace of the imperial army but the miles melted away that night krispos slept like a dead man the attendants at the relay station had to shake him awake when morning came he rose grumpily from his bedroll but managed to say thanks for not worrying about my imperial dignity there one of the attendants grinned majesty right now you smell more like a horse than an avtokrator if you know what i mean i hadnt even noticed krispos said after so long in close contact with horses his nose no longer reported their presence its not a bad smell hed spent years in the stables first for iakovitzes then for petronas sarkis and the scouts were ready to go when krispos mounted his latest horse he scowled at them for being so fresh his own rear end gave a painful protest as he settled himself in the saddle he did his best to ignore it his best was not good enough his eyes blurred with tears from the wind of his passage he rode on one of the horses he took had a gait hard enough to shake his teeth and his kidneys loose he rode on a scouts horse went lame the fellow rode double to the next station he got a fresh animal and they all rode on when krispos stopped at last on that second day he dismounted with the slow brittle caution of a man twice his age even the ironarsed scouts were less limber than when theyd set out but sarkis said one day more and were in the city a good thing too krispos said feelingly for id never make two days more none of the scouts laughed at him that was the best sign hed done enough to win their respect everyone grumbled the next morning but everyone wearily scrambled onto a horse and rode south the horses were fresh they went hard to the next station but then got to rest there was no rest for krispos and the scouts just when he was convinced hed been on horseback forever and would stay on horseback forevermore the walls of videssos appeared on the southwestern horizon ahead it was late afternoon under three days sarkis said your majesty were i the head of the imperial courier service id hire you oh no you wouldnt for its not work id ever seek krispos retorted the scouts laughed krispos spurred his horse on toward the capital x gnatios stood at the altar in the center of the high temple chanting the sunset prayers that thanked phos for the days light and bid the sun to return safely on the morrow the benches were mostly empty only a few pious souls joined him in the days last liturgy still wearing the trousers and tunic in which hed ridden krispos strode up the temple aisle toward the ecumenical patriarch he felt bowlegged and wondered if it showed behind him sabers drawn came sarkis and the squad of scouts behind them tramped a squad of halogai part of the company that had been left behind to protect dara and phostis krispos waited in grim silence until gnatios finished the prayer that was last as well as first we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind watchful beforehand that the great test of our life may be decided in our favor this liturgy now is ended may phos be with us all one or two worshipers got up to go the rest stayed in their seats curious to see what would happen next gnatios bowed to krispos i thought you with the army your majesty how may i serve you you may not krispos said curtly he turned to the halogai arrest him the charge is treason the guardsmen swarmed forward gnatios turned as if to run then considered their upraised axes and thought better of it they seized him their big hands wrapped round his forearms in an unbreakable grip take him to the grand courtroom the priests and worshipers in the high temple cried out in dismay as the imperial guards dragged gnatios away but the weapons the halogai and sarkis scouts carried kept them from doing anything more than cry out krispos had counted on that the streets of the city were never empty but they were less crowded after the sun went down the party of soldiers marched back to the palace quarter unimpeded surrounded by tall halogai gnatios was almost invisible in their midst krispos had counted on that too a bonfire blazed in front of the grand courtroom by its light nobles courtiers and highranking bureaucrats filed into the building well done barsymes krispos said you look to have gotten just about everyone here i did my best on short notice your majesty the vestiarios said you did fine take charge of the guards and gnatios here would you youll know when to send them out where people can see them oh indeed your majesty barsymes gestured to the halogai wait here in this alcove for the time being gentlemen i shall tell you when to proceed krispos walked down the long central aisle toward the throne the officials who had been chattering among themselves wondering why theyd been so abruptly summoned fell silent when they saw him they resumed once he was past this time in whispers closest to the throne stood iakovitzes he knew what was toward everything all right at your end krispos asked at the sevastos nod he went on well settle that later tonight with more privacy meanwhile he climbed the steps to the throne turned sat and looked out at the assembled grandees they looked back at him noble sirs he said i apologize for ordering you together so quickly this evening but what has arisen will not wait i must get back to the army as soon as i can weve won a victory against harvas and hope to win more thou conquerest krispos thou conquerest the courtiers shouted in union echoes reverberated from the high ceiling of the grand courtroom the acclamation sounded more fulsome than usual news of the victory could only have beaten krispos to the city by a day and it was the first victory ever over harvas the outcry ceased at krispos upraised hand he said in spite of that victory i had to leave the army to come here to deal with a dangerous case of treason that is why you are gathered together now somehow without moving a muscle on hearing the word treason the assembled nobles all contrived to look perfectly innocent saddened and amused at the same time krispos went on here is the prisoner at a slow march the halogai led gnatios still in his patriarchal robes down the long aisle to the imperial throne gusts of whispers trailed him no one though exclaimed in horror or amazement that too saddened krispos but did not surprise him everybody knew what gnatios was like the guardsmen shoved him forward he prostrated himself before krispos i will read a letter gnatios sent to an officer in the imperial army krispos drew gnatios letter to rhisoulphos from his belt pouch and read it without naming rhisoulphos then he cast the letter in front of gnatios he also threw down the fragments of the patriarchs seal of skyblue wax can you deny these are your words written in your hand sealed with your seal gnatios stayed on his belly and did not dare even to raise his head majesty i he began then he stopped as if realizing nothing could save him now gnatios you are guilty of treason krispos declared i have forgiven you before twice over i cannot i do not i will not forgive you again tomorrow morning you will meet the headsman and your head will go up on the milestone as a warning to others a voiceless sigh rose throughout the grand courtroom again though none of the courtiers seemed surprised or dismayed softly gnatios began to weep take him away krispos said the guardsmen lifted gnatios they had to bear most of his weight as they marched him back along the central aisle for his legs could hardly carry him thank you for witnessing the sentence krispos told the grandees you may go and may phos bless you all the nobles filed out of the grand courtroom talking quietly among themselves krispos picked up the damning letter then caught iakovitzes eye iakovitzes nodded krispos went back to the imperial residence dara stood in the entranceway waiting for him she looked uncomfortable not least because she also looked as if she could have her baby at any moment what did you do with gnatios she asked as he came up the steps he loses his head tomorrow krispos said he walked down the hall good he should have lost it a long time ago dara said with a vigorous nod of approval then she let worry enter her voice now what didnt you tell me this afternoon when you rode in with such a rush krispos sighed hed always been glad dara was clever now he wished just a little that she wasnt he took out gnatios letter to rhisoulphos and showed it to her she carefully read it through when she was done she sagged against him no she whispered not father im afraid so he drew out the other letter his pouch contained the one from rhisoulphos to gnatios he handed it to her dara im sorry she shook her head back and forth back and forth like a wild creature thrashing in a trap what will you do she asked at last not her voice broke she could not say the word but krispos knew what she meant not if he doesnt force me to it he promised i have something else in mind he was glad word of rhisoulphos disappearance hadnt yet got back to the imperial city a few minutes later the eunuch tyrovitzes came in and said your majesty the sevastos iakovitzes is outside the entrance along with several of his ah retainers the chamberlain sniffed he had a low opinion of the handsome youths with whom iakovitzes surrounded himself ill come out krispos turned to dara wait here if you would this has to do with you and with your father ill be back in just a moment he left before she could argue iakovitzes grooms all of them stalwart and muscular young men bent themselves double in deep bows to krispos iakovitzes also bowed less deeply that left one man standing straight in the middle of the crowd bowing would have been hard for him in any case for his hands were tied behind his back he did nod politely your majesty he said hello rhisoulphos krispos said i daresay youre glad to be anyplace outside of iakovitzes basement yes and no given a choice between the basement and the chopping block i prefer the basement in fact i also like the basement rather better than the rolledup carpet in which i was brought to it you dont need to worry about the carpet anymore the chopping block is something else again krispos said come along with meyou and i and your daughter have a few things to discuss you come too iakovitzes if you please iakovitzes nodded he pulled out his tablet and wrote thats all lads and showed it to the grooms they nodded and started away from the imperial residence and out of the palace quarter iakovitzes wrote something else and passed the tablet to krispos such a pitythese days i can only pick from among lads who know how to read krispos screwed up his face and gave the tablet back when rhisoulphos came into the chamber where dara was sitting she looked up at him and said why father why her voice trembled tears stood in her eyes ready to fall i thought i could he answered with a shrug it appears i was wrong i would have made your son my heir for whatever thats worth nothing krispos said flatly gnatios goes to the block tomorrow give me one good reason you shouldnt follow him because i am daras father rhisoulphos said at once how would you dare to fell asleep beside her after you put me to death krispos wanted to kick himhe was still smooth and still right as you say but if you want to live it will cost you your hair youll go into a monastery for the rest of your days i agree rhisoulphos said again without hesitation iakovitzes scowled furiously and held up his tablet so krispos could read it are you mad your majesty how many people have you clapped into monasteries only to see them pop right out again i wasnt finished yet krispos turned back to rhisoulphos it wont be the monastery of the holy skirios for you no matter what iakovitzes thinks i have learned better than that if you want to live youll serve the good god at a monastery in prista for an instant rhisoulphos smooth facade cracked and revealed raw red rage the town of prista lay far to the north and west of videssos the city across the videssian sea it sat on the southern tip of a peninsula that dangled down from the steppes of pardraya and served as the empires listening post for the plains it was also the most phosforsaken spot in the empire to which to exile a man well rhisoulphos krispos said let it be as you say rhisoulphos answered at last his selfcontrol restored he nodded again to krispos i appear to have underestimated you your majesty my only consolation is that im not the first to make that mistake krispos paid hardly any attention to him after he said yes he was looking at dara instead hoping she could accept the choice hed made after some endless time that was less than a minute she too nodded the gesture was eerily like her fathers krispos did not care now once more he blessed her good sense she saw what had to be done krispos called tyrovitzes when the chamberlain came in he told him we need a priest here esteemed sir tell him to bring along scissors razor phos holy scriptures and a new blue robe the eminent rhisoulphos has decided to enter a monastery indeed your majesty was all tyrovitzes said he bowed and left the room the eunuch chamberlain returned within an hour a priest at his side after praying the priest told rhisoulphos bend your head rhisoulphos obeyed the priest used scissors first then the razor lock by lock rhisoulphos irongray hair fell to the floor when all his scalp was bare the priest held out the scriptures to him and said behold the law under which you shall live if you choose if in your heart you feel you can observe it enter the monastic life if not speak now i will observe it rhisoulphos declared twice more the priest asked him twice more he affirmed his will if he did so with irony in his voice the priest took no notice of it after the third affirmation the priest said doff your garment rhisoulphos obeyed the priest gave him the monastic robe to put on as the garment of phos blue covers your naked body so may his righteousness enfold your heart and preserve it from all evil so may it be rhisoulphos said he formally became a monk with those words thank you holy sir krispos said to the priest your temple will learn that im grateful tyrovitzes escort him back if you would be so kind and settle those arrangements you neednt haggle overmuch as you say your majesty tyrovitzes murmured krispos knew he would haggle anyhow on general principles perhaps this way he would not skin the priest too badly when the chamberlain had led the priest away krispos turned to rhisoulphos come with me holy sir rhisoulphos rose but said a moment if you please he put a hand on daras shoulder daughter i wish it had turned out better it could have she would not look at him i wish you would have left well enough alone she said in a voice filled with tears so do i child so do i rhisoulphos straightened then dipped his head to krispos now i will accompany you more halogai than the usual squad of guards stood outside the imperial residence the extra men converged on rhisoulphos krispos said take the holy sir here to the sea lion which is tied up at the neorhesian harbor put him aboard in fact stay aboard with him until the sea lion sails for prista in the morning the guardsmen saluted we obey majesty one of them said you have everything ready for me rhisoulphos observed nicely done i try krispos said shortly he nodded to the halogai they took charge of the newmade monk krispos watched them march him down the path till it rounded a corner and took them out of his sight he sighed and drank in a long lungful of sweet night air then he went back inside when he walked into the audience chamber iakovitzes eyes flickered from him to dara and back again the sevastos quickly got to his feet id best be going he wrote in large letters he held up the tablet to show it to both krispos and dara then bowed and left with what would have been unforgivable abruptness in most circumstances as it was krispos did not blame iakovitzes for being so precipitate he just wished the sevastos would have stayed longer no help for it he was alone with dara after sending her father into exile im sorry he said and meant it i didnt see what else to do she nodded if you want to keep the throne if you want to stay alive you did what you had to do i know that but she turned her head away from him her voice broke its hard aye it is he came over to her and stroked her lustrous black hair he was afraid she would shy from him but she sat steady he went on when i was a peasant i used to think how easy the avtokrator must have it all he needs to do is give an order and people do things for him he laughed briefly i wish it were that simple i wish it were too but its not dara looked up at him you seldom speak of your days on the farm most of them arent worth talking about believe me this is better krispos said dara did not pursue it which suited him fine the chief reason he rarely mentioned his early days to her was that he did not want to remind her how lowly his origins were since explaining would also have brought that to the fore he was pleased to get away without having to lets go to bed dara said the lord with the great and good mind knows i wont sleep much with the baby kicking me and getting me up to make water half a dozen times a night but i ought to try to get what i can all right krispos said before long the last lamp was blown out and he lay in the darkness beside dara he remembered rhisoulphos gibe was he safe next to her now with rhisoulphos on a ship bound for prista he must have decided he was for he fell asleep while he was still mulling over the question and did not wake the rest of the night at the northern edge of the palace quarter not far from the sorcerers collegium was a small park known to city wits as the hunting ground it was not stocked with boar or antlered stag in the center of that hedgesurrounded patch of greensward stood a muchhacked oak stump whose height was convenient for a kneeling mans neck his back to the earlymorning sun krispos waited not far from that stump a couple of haloga guards stood by chatting with each other in their own language they kept sneaking glances at the headsman who was leaning his chin on the pommel of his sword he was a tall man almost as tall as a haloga finally one of the northerners could hold out no more he walked over to the headsman and said please sir may i try the heft of that great blade be my guest the headsman watched the guard get the feel of the twohanded grip smiling at his whistle over the swords weight the haloga backed off and swung it a couple of times first across at waist level then up and down he whistled again gave it back a brave brand indeed but too heavy for me you handle it better than most the headsman said must be that youre used to the axe which isnt light either ive seen big strong men but ones whore used to these cavalry sabers that dont weigh nothin almost fall over when they try my sword they went on talking for a few minutes two professionals in related fields passing the time until one of them had to do his job then more halogai brought gnatios into the little park he wore a plain linen robe not even blue his hands were tied behind him he stopped when he saw krispos please your majesty i beseech you he fell to his knees have mercy in the name of phos in the name of the service i gave you in the matter of harvas krispos bit his lip hed come to witness the execution because he thought he owed gnatios that much but did he owe him mercyagain he shook his head may phos judge you more kindly than i must gnatios in the name of the service you gave me in the matter of petronas and in the matter of rhisoulphos who would be next he turned to the guardsmen take him to the stump they dragged gnatios the last few feet not kindly but not cruelly either just going about their business one told him hold still and it will be over soonest aye hes right the headsman said youd not want to twist and maybe make me have to strike twice still not roughly the guards forced gnatios head down to the stump his eyes were wide and bright and staring with white all around the iris he sucked in great noisy gulps of air his chest rose and fell against the thin fabric of his robe in an extremity of fear please he mouthed over and over again oh please the headsman stepped up beside the oak stump he swung the twohanded sword over his head gnatios screamed the sword came down the scream cut off abruptly as the heavy blade bit through flesh and bone gnatios head rolled away cleanly severed at the first stroke krispos was appalled to see its eyes blink twice as it fell from the stump every muscle in gnatios body convulsed at the instant of beheading it jerked free of the halogai blood fountained from the stump of his neck as his heart gave a couple of last beats before it realized he was dead his bowels and bladder emptied befouling his robe and adding their stenches to the hot iron smell of blood krispos turned away more than a little sickened hed read of bloodthirsty tyrants who liked nothing better than seeing the heads of their enemiesreal or imaginedroll all he wondered was whether the chunk of bread hed had on the way over would stay down watching a helpless man die was worse than anything the battlefield had shown him how harvas could have struck down a whole city grew only more mysterious and more dreadful krispos turned to the headsman who stood proudly expecting praise conscious of a job well done he didnt suffer krispos saidthe best he could do the headsman beamed so it must have been enough krispos went on take the head he would not look at it to the milestone im going back to the imperial residence as you say your majesty the headsman bowed your presence here honored me this morning not long after krispos returned to the residence barsymes asked him what he wanted for lunch nothing thanks he said the vestiarios did not change expression but still conveyed that his answer was not an acceptable response krispos felt he had to explain you neednt fear ill make a bloodthirsty tyrant esteemed sir i find i dont have the stomach for it ah now barsymes voice showed he understood will you return to the army later today then i have a couple of things to do before i go do i remember rightly that pyrrhos while he was patriarch condemned the hierarch savianos for some tiny lapse or other yes your majesty thats so barsymes eyes narrowed am i to infer then that you will name savianos ecumenical patriarch rather than restoring pyrrhos to his old throne thats just what i intend to do if he wants the job ive had a bellyful of quarrelsome clerics will you arrange to have savianos brought here as quickly as you can i shall have to find out in which monastery hes been confined but yes i will deal with that at once toward evening that day savianos prostrated himself before krispos how may i serve your majesty he asked as he rose his face was craggy and intelligent beyond that krispos had learned better than to guess character from features he came straight to the point gnatios head went up on the milestone this morning i want you to succeed him as ecumenical patriarch savianos shaggy gray eyebrows leaped like startled gray caterpillars me your majesty why me for one thing im more nearly of gnatios theological bent than pyrrhos and i even spoke against pyrrhos when you named him patriarch for another why would i want the patriarchal throne if you just killed the man who was on it i have no interest in making the headsmans acquaintance just because i somehow offended you gnatios didnt meet the headsman for offending me he met him for plotting against me if you plan on meddling in politics after you put on the blue boots youd best stay where you are if id wanted to meddle in politics id have become a bureaucrat not a priest savianos said good enough as for the other i remember your speaking up for gnatios that took courage its one of the reasons i want you to be patriarch and my own beliefs arent as as krispos groped for a word rigid as pyrrhos i didnt object to gnatios doctrines only to his treason so holy sir shall submit your name to the synod you really mean it savianos said in a wondering tone he studied krispos giving him a more thorough and critical scrutiny than he was used to getting since hed become avtokrator at last with a nod the priest said no youre not one to butcher for the sport of it are you no krispos answered at once queasily remembering how gnatios head had blinked as it bounced from the stump onto the grass no savianos agreed all right your majesty if you want to give it to me ill take it on shall we aim to work without biting each others tails by the good god thats just what we need to do krispos felt like cheering hed said that to pyrrhos and gnatios both time and again each in his own way had chosen to ignore it now an ecclesiastic was saying it for himself holy sirmost holy sir to bei already feel ive picked the right man savianos chuckle had a wry edge to it dont praise the horse till youve ridden him if you tell me as much three years from now well both have reason to be pleased im pleased right now let me come up with a couple of truly ghastly names to go along with the rules of the synod and ill be able to get back to the army knowing the temples are in good hands after savianos left the imperial residence krispos summoned the grand drungarios of the fleet a solidly built veteran sailor named kanaris that meeting was much shorter than the one with savianos but men unlike savianos kanaris did not need to be persuadedwhen he heard what krispos wanted he rushed away as fast as he could go all eager to start at once krispos wished he could look forward to the ride back to the army with equal anticipation the ride north was as fast as the ride south had been but even harder to endure krispos had hoped he would be inured to the endless rolling jouncing hours in the saddle but it was not so by the time he returned to camp his best walk was a spraddlelegged shamble sarkis and the squad of scouts were in hardly better shape the worst of it was krispos knew more long days of riding lay ahead the soldiers cheered as he rode up to the imperial tent he waved back to them and put all the exuberance he had left into that wave they would have been less flattered to know why he was so pleased but he kept that to himself hed most dreaded coming upon their broken remnants as he hurried north things have been quiet while you were gone mammianos reported that evening when krispos met with his officers a few skirmishes here a few there but nothing major oh the wizards have had a bit to do too so they have krispos glanced at trokoundos aye a bit to do the mage said krispos concealed a start at the sound of his voicehe sounded more than tired he sounded old battling harvas had taken its toll on him but he continued with sober pride everything the skotoslover has hurled at us we have withstood ill not deny hes cost us a handful of men but only a handful without us the army would be in ruins i believe you magical sir krispos said all videssos owes you and your fellows a great debt of thanks with everything safe here i can give you my own news from the capital everyone leaned toward him first gnatios is patriarch no more he plotted against me once too often and i took his head only nods greeted that announcement not exclamations of surprise krispos nodded too trokoundos and mammianos had both known why hed returned to the city in such a hurry and he hadnt ordered either one of them to keep quiet about it for that matter he often thought ordering a videssian to keep quiet about anything was a waste of breath he went on next i bring word of the eminent rhisoulphos he turns out to have given up the soldiers life for that of a monk and is spending his days in phos service at a monastery in prista that produced all the reaction he could have wanted prista bagradas burst out by the good god whats he doing in prista howd he get there several other officers loudly wondered the same thing krispos did not answer one by one the soldiers and mages noticed he was not answering they started to use their brains instead of their mouths no videssian of reasonable rank ignored politics ignoring politics was unsafe before long they reached the proper conclusion im to keep my regiment then bagradas asked id say its very likely krispos agreed with a straight face a nice bit of work that your majesty mammianos said almost everyone echoed him nobles and courtiers had an artists appreciation for underhandedness brought off with panache i did one more brief bit of business while i was in the capital krispos said i ordered kanaris to send a fleet of dromons up the astris river if the halogai want to cross into kubrat to fight for harvas why should we let them have an easy time of it fierce growls of approval rose from the officers aye lets see em take on our dromons with the canoes they hollow out of logs mammianos said all this may hurt harvas indirectly but how do we do more than that sarkis asked we cant go through him we tried that last summer he pointed to a map that a couple of stones held down and unrolled on krispos portable desk the next pass north into kubrat is easily eighty miles east of here thats too far to coordinate with a flying column and if we set the whole army moving whats to keep harvas from shifting too on his side of the mountains we could double back mammianos began then he shook his head no its too complicated too likely to go wrong besides if we march away from here whats to keep harvas from just jumping right back down into videssos there is a pass closer than eighty miles from here krispos said wizards and officers crowded close around the portable desk peered down sarkis pointed out the obvious its not on the map your majesty i know its not krispos said ive been through it all the same when i was maybe six years old and the kubratoi herded my whole village up into their country the outlet at the southern end is hard to find a forest and a spur of hillside hide it away unless you come at it from the right angle the pass is narrow and winding a squad of troops could hold back an army inside it but if you gentlemen dont know of it the odds are decent that harvas doesnt either the kubratoi wont have told him thats certain mammianos said everybody nodded at that by all accounts harvas and his halogai had been no gentler in kubrat than they were in the empire of videssos sarkis said i mean no offense your majesty but even if all is as you say you have not been six years old for some time how can you lead us to this hidden pass now krispos looked to trokoundos the good god willing between them the talented mages here should be able to pull the way from my mind i traveled it after all the memory is there trokoundos affirmed as for bringing it into the open once more we can try your majesty i would not presume to say more than that then tomorrow you will try krispos said id say tonight but im so tired right now that i dont think i have any mind left to look into the officers chuckled all but sarkis who had ridden with krispos sarkis was too busy yawning trokoundos ceremoniously handed krispos a cup drink this if you please your majesty before he drank krispos held the cup under his nose beneath the sweet fruity odor of red wine he caught others smells more pungent and musty whats in it he asked half curious half suspicious its a decoction to help loosen your wits from the hereandnow the mage answered there are roasted henbane seeds in it ground hemp leaves and seeds a distillate from the poppy and several other things as well youll likely feel rather drunk all through the day past that the brew is harmless lets be about it with an abrupt motion krispos knocked back the cup his lips twisted it tasted nastier than it smelled trokoundos eased him down into a folding chair are you comfortable your majesty comfortable yes ithink so krispos listened to himself answer as if from far away he felt his mind float detach itself from his body despite what trokoundos had said it was not like being drunk it was not like anything he had ever known it was pleasant though he wondered vaguely if anthimos had ever tried it probably if anything yielded pleasure anthimos would have tried it then anthimos too slid away from krispos mind he smiled content to float majesty hear me your majesty trokoundos voice echoed and reechoed inside krispos head he found he could not ignore it found he did not want to ignore it the mage went on your majesty cast your mind back to journeying through the passes between videssos and kubrat i conjure you remember remember remember obedientlyhe did not seem to have much will of his own krispos let his mind spin back through time all at once he gasped his distant body stiffened and began to sweat halogai chopped down his horsemen at the barricade a blackrobed figure gestured and boulders sprang from the hillsides to smash his army harvas he said harshly farther reach farther trokoundos said remember remember remember the lost battle of the summer before misted over and vanished from krispos thoughts he rolled back and back and back one gray year after another passing away then all at once he was in the pass again the pass he had tried and failed to forcesomehow he both knew and did not know that at the same time a short plump man in the robes of a videssian noble rode by he looked cocky and full of spit krispos knew his name and knewand did not knowmuch more than that iakovitzes he exclaimed he exclaimed again wordlessly for the voice that came from his lips was not his own but a boys high treble how old are you trokoundos demanded he thought about it nine the boys voice answered for him farther reach farther remember remember remember again he whirled through time now he emerged from a forest track toward what seemed at first only a spur of hillock in front of the mountains but shouting men on ponies urged him and his companions on with curses and threats beyond that spur was a narrow opening a man in a tunic of homespun wool steadied him with a hand on his shoulder he looked up in thanks amazement ran through himhe thought he was looking at himself then the amazement doubled father he whispered in a childs voice a younger childs voice now trokoundos broke into hisvision how old are you ithink im six do you see before you the pass of which your adult self spoke see it now with adult eyes as well as those of a child mark well everything about it so that you may find it once more can you do this and remember afterward yes krispos said his voice was an odd blend of two of boys and mans both of them his own he did not simply look at the opening to the pass anymore he studied it considered the forest from which hed emerged contemplated the streak of pinkish stone that ran through the spur examined the mountains and fixed their precise configuration in his mind at last he said i will remember trokoundos put another cup in his hand drink this then it was a hot meaty broth rich with the taste of fat with every swallow krispos felt his mind and body rejoin each other but even when he was himself again he remembered everything about the passand the feel of his fathers strong hand on his shoulder guiding him along thank you he said to trokoundos you gave me a great gift not many men can say their father touched them long years after he was dead trokoundos bowed your majesty im pleased to help in any way i can even that one which i did not expect any way you can krispos mused he nodded more than half to himself ride with me then trokoundos if need be you can use your magic again to help me find the pass well need a sorcerer along anyhow to keep harvas from noticing us as we slip around his flank if he catches us in that narrow place were done for i will ride with you trokoundos said let me go back to my tent now to gather the tools and supplies ill need he bowed again and walked away rubbing his chin as he thought about just what he ought to take krispos thought about that too but in terms of manpower rather than sorcerous paraphernalia sarkis and his scouts of course krispos smiled no matter how sore sarkis backside was he couldnt complain his emperor had ordered him to do anything krispos wasnt also doing but hed need more than scouts on this mission the column rode south out of camp the next day before noon the imperial standard still fluttered over krispos tent imperial guards still tramped back and forth before it but some dozens of horsemen concealed blond hair beneath helms and surcoat hoods they stayed clustered around one man in nondescript gear who rode a nondescript horseprogress was also still back at camp once well out of view of their own camp and that of the foe the soldiers paused trokoundos went to work at last he nodded to krispos if harvas tries to track us by magic your majesty he will phos willing perceive us as continuing southward perhaps on our way to the imperial capital whereas in reality aye krispos pointed to the east the riders swung off the northsouth thoroughfare and onto one of the narrow dirt tracks that led away from it the forest pressed close along either side of the track the column lengthened simply because the troopers lacked the room to ride more than four or five abreast every so often even smaller paths branched off from the track and wound their way back toward the mountains scouts galloped down each one of them to see if it seemed to deadend against a spur of hillock with a streak of pink stone running through it krispos thought his flanking column was still too far west but took no chances the soldiers camped that night in the first clearing large enough to hold them all that they found krispos asked trokoundos any sign harvas knows what were up to he wanted the mage to grin and shake his head instead trokoundos frowned your majesty ive had the feelingand it is but a feelingthat we are being sorcerously sought whether its by harvas or not i cannot say for the seeking is at the very edge of my ability to perceive it who else would it be krispos said with a scoffing laugh trokoundos laughed too he was not scoffing magicians did not scoff about harvas monster he surely was but they took him most seriously krispos sent double sentry parties out on picket duty and ordered them to set up farther than usual from the camp he had doubts about how much good that would do if harvas found him out the first he was likely to know of it would be a magical onslaught that wrecked the flying column the sentries went out even so on the off chance he was wrong as usual he got up at sunrise he gnawed hard bread drank rough wine mounted and rode as he headed east he kept peering at the mountains through breaks in the trees by noon he knew he and his men were getting close the granite shapes that turned the horizon jagged looked ever more familiar he began to worry about overrunning the pass hardly had the thought crossed his mind when a sloppily dressed scout came pounding up to him majesty i found it majesty the fellow said a pink vein of rock on the spur and when i rode in back of it sure enough it opens out ill take us there lead us krispos said slapping the scout on the back the order to halt ran quickly through the columnhorns and drums were silent for fear harvas might somehow detect their rhythmic calls at a range beyond that of merely human ears the scout led the troopers back to a forest path no different from half a dozen others theyd passed earlier in the day as soon as krispos plunged into the woods he knew hed traveled this way before almost as if it came from the leaves and branches around him he picked up a sense of the fear and urgency hed had the last time he used this track he thought for a moment he could hear guttural kubrati voices shouting for him to hurry hurry but it was only the wind and a cawing crow all the same sweat prickled under his armpits and ran down his flanks like drops of molten lead then the path seemed to come to a dead end against a spur of rock with a pink streak through it the scout pointed and asked excitedly is this it your majesty it looks just like what you were talking about is it by the lord with the great and good mind it is krispos whispered awe on his face he turned and bowed in the saddle to trokoundos the place looked as familiar as if hed last seen it day before yesterdayand so thanks to the mages skill he had before he ordered the army into the pass he asked trokoundos are we detected let me check after a few minutes of work the wizard answered not so far as i can tell i still think we may be sought but harvas has not found us i do not say this lightly your majesty i stake my life on the truth of it no less than yours so you do krispos took a deep breath and brought up his arm to point forward the pass was as narrow and winding as he remembered if the sides did not seem quite so overwhelmingly high he was now a fullgrown man on horseback rather than a boy stumbling along afoot he was as afraid now as then though a squad of harvas halogai could plug the pass if men waited up above with boulders the evil wizard would need no wizardry to rid himself of this entire column the troopers felt the danger as starkly as he did they leaned forward over their horses necks gently urging the animals to more and more speed and the horses responded they liked being in that narrow echoing gloomy placeit was so steep the sun could not reach down to the bottomno better than did their riders how long till were through sarkis asked krispos as the gloom began to deepen toward evening by the good god majesty i dont want to have to spend the night in this miserable cleft neither do i krispos said i think were close to the end of it sure enough less than an hour later the advance guard of the column burst out of the pass and into the foothill country on the northern side of the mountains looking north krispos saw nothing but those hills leading down to a flatter country of plains and patches of forest he turned round to the granite mass of the mountains to have them behind him instead of before seemed strange and unnatural as if sky and land had changed places on the horizon full darkness was close at hand the evening star dominated the western sky though a thin fingernailparing of moon also hung there more and more stars came out as crimson and then gray faded into black the soldiers buzzed with excitement as they set up camp theyd flanked harvas and he didnt know it day after tomorrow they would crash into his unguarded rear he and his men would be caught between their hammer and the anvil of the main imperial army one trooper told his tentmate they say the bastards a good wizard hell need to be better than good to get away from us now he is better than good the second soldier answered krispos sketched phos suncircle over his heart to avert any possible omen then he went to check with trokoundos the mage said no we are not found i still feel we are sought but i would also have that feeling because of harvas sorcerous scrutiny of the supposed southward journey of this army how much longer can that trick hold up krispos asked long enough i hope the farther harvas magic has to reach the less omniscient it becomes there are no guidelines i admit the more so for a unique sorcerer like harvas but as say what we have done should suffice that was as much reassurance as krispos could reasonably expect he arranged himself in his bedroll confident that harvas would not turn him into a spider while he slept and sleep he did despite aches in every riding muscle he went out like a blown lamp while he was still trying to get a blanket up to his chin camp broke quickly the next morning everyone knew the column had stolen a march on harvas and everyone wanted to take advantage of it underofficers had to warn men not to wear out their horses by riding too hard too soon off in the distance krispos saw other small mounted parties they saw his men too and promptly fled he did not know what to feel as he watched them gallop away so these were the fierce kubratoi who had scourged videssos northern provinces all through his childhood now they only wanted to escape his pride at that was punctured when trokoundos remarked i wonder whether they think were really who we are or some of harvas men near noon a band of about a dozen nomads approached the column instead of running away you horsemen you imperials one of them called in broken videssian aye the soldiers answered ready to kill them if they turned to take that news to harvas blackrobe but the kubrati went on you come to fight harvas aye the soldiers repeated with a yell this time we fight with you we fight for you the nomad held his bow over his head harvas and his axemen they worst in world you videssians you gots to be better better you rule over us than harvas any day any day better he spoke to his companions in their own language they shouted what had to be agreement krispos lifted his helmet so he could scratch his head kubratoi had meant enemies to him since he was six years old even imagining them as comrades came hard but the nomad had spoken the truth in a way he probably did not suspect the land of kubrat had been videssian once if the imperial army beat harvas it would become videssian againkrispos did not intend to turn it over to some kubrati chieftain who would stay grateful until the day he thought he could safely raid south of the mountains and not a moment longer gnatios had taught him some hard lessons about how long loyalty was apt to last still if he did succeed in annexingreannexing he reminded himselfkubrat the goodwill of the locals would be worth something aye join us he told the nomads help drive the invaders out of kubrat he did not say out of your land none of the kubratoi noticed the fine distinction most of the nomads who saw the flying column continued to avoid it but several more groups came in so that by the end of the day close to a hundred kubratoi camped with the videssians their furs and boiledleather cuirasses contrasted oddly with the linen surcoats and iron shirts the imperials wore their ponies also looked like nothing much next to the bigger handsomer horses that came from south of the mountains but those ponies hadnt breathed hard while they kept up with the column and krispos knew the kubratoi could fight he was glad to have them we cant be more than three or four hours away from harvas krispos said to sarkis but we havent seen a single haloga he doesnt know were here so it seems your majesty sarkis white teeth flashed in the firelight very bright against his thick black beard and mustaches i said a couple of years ago when i first served under you that things wouldnt be dull who else would have found a way to sneak up on the nastiest wizard the worlds ever seen i hope we are sneaking up on him trokoundos said my feeling of being sought grows ever stronger it worries me and yet surely harvas would assail us if he knew we were here i wish zaidas were along to tell me all my fears are so much moonshine the good god grant that i hold harvas befooled yet a little longer so may it be krispos and sarkis said in the same breath they both sketched the sunsign sarkis added this also shows the risk of depending too much on magic if harvas had his scouts properly posted hed already know we were loose in his country its not his country krispos said its ours he explained the thoughts hed had when the first kubrati party attached itself to the column finishing well never have another chance like this to bring kubrat back under our rule sarkis let out a soft approving grunt trokoundos cocked his head to one side and studied krispos youve grown your majesty he said youve come into the long view of things you need to make a proper avtokrator who but a man with that long view would say that taking kubrat which has been a thorn in our flesh for three centuries now is bringing it back under our rule both pleased and amused krispos said the good god willing ive learned a bit from that long past of ours he yawned right now this whole day seems a very long past all by itself its hard to remember when ive been out of the saddle except to squat by the side of the road or to sleep which is what im going to do now this is a sound strategy sarkis said his voice filled with such military seriousness that krispos came to attention and saluted then laughing he went off to spread out his blankets the next morning the troopers checked their swords edges and made sure their arrows were straight and well fletched as they did when they were certain they would be going into battle before long they leaped onto their horses and stormed westward krispos knew the only thing that made veterans hurry toward a fight was confidence they would win all that kept his own confidence from soaring equally was trokoundos attitude the mage kept looking back over his shoulder as if he expected to see harvas on the horse right behind him we are sought he said over and over again his voice haunted but despite his forebodings neither krispos nor any of the soldiers in the flying column had any sense that harvas knew they were there hed posted no guards not in land he thought his own and there ahead in the distance lay the northern mouth of the pass through the mountains in which the wizard and his halogai were about to be bottled unfurl our banner krispos said the imperial standard gold sunburst on blue fluttered free at the head of the column but before the men could even begin to raise a cheer trokoundos went white as milk we are found he whispered his eyes were huge and frightened too late krispos said fiercely trying to restore his spirit we have harvas now not the other way round the words were hardly out of his mouth before a wall of blackness sprang up in front of the column it stretched north and south far as the eye could see the troopers in the lead quickly reined in to keep from running into it headlong it did not dishearten krispos there you see he said to trokoundos its the same paltry trick he used to slow down the army south of the mountains one touch from you then and the whole silly wall just disappeared does he think to fool us the same way twice trokoundos visibly revived aye youre right your majesty he must indeed be panicked to forget he already used this illusion against us and a panicked sorcerer is a weakened sorcerer let me get rid of this phantasm and then on to the attack the soldiers in earshot yelled and clapped they swatted trokoundos on the shoulder as his smoothgaited gray approached the barrier with mincing steps the mage dismounted a few feet away walked straight up to it he stretched out a hand leaned forward shouted begone far far off in the distance krispos thought he heard a womans voice crying no wait he shook his head annoyed at his ears playing tricks on him in any case the cry came too late trokoundos forefinger had met the wall of blackness as they had before lightnings crackled round the mage men who had not been close by when he pierced the barrier south of the mountains cried out in alarm and dismay krispos sat smiling on his horse waiting for the barrier to dissolve trokoundos screamed a raw wordless sound of terror and agony his spine spasmed and arched backward as if it were a bow being bent he screamed again this time intelligibly trap he flung his arms out wide his back bent still farther impossibly far he cried out one last time again without words his hands writhed the motions reminded krispos of sorcerous passes if they were they did no good with a sound like that of a cracking knuckle but magnified a thousand times trokoundos backbone broke he fell to the ground limp and dead the black wallharvas blackrobes black wallremained along with his soldiers krispos stared in consternation at torkoundos crumpled corpse what would happen to him now with his own chief wizard slain and harvas all too aware of exactly where he was youll die in whatever dreadful way harvas wants you to die was the first answer that sprang to mind he cast about for a better one but did not find any shouts came from the right flank of the column the kubratoi who had briefly attached themselves to krispos force were galloping off as fast as their little ponies would take them shall we pursue sarkis asked no let them go krispos answered wearily you cant blame them for changing their minds about our chances can you no majesty not when ive just changed my own sarkis managed a grin but not of the cheery sortit looked more like the snarl of a hunting beast brought to bay what do we do now to his relief krispos did not have to answer that at once a trooper from the rearguard rode up saluted and said your majesty theres a party of maybe fifteen or twenty horsemen coming up on us from behind more kubratoi krispos asked theyll turn tail when they see the mess were in his eyes flicked to trokoundos body again soon he knew he would feel the loss of a friend as well as that of a mage he had no time for that not now not yet the trooper said your majesty they dont look like kubratoi or ride like em either they look like videssians is what they look like videssians krispos rather heavy eyebrows drew together over his nose had mammianos sent men after him for some reason if he had would harvas have spotted the party because it was not warded and could the evil wizard have been led from that party to the flying column krispos led the chain of logic made all too much sense cold anger in his voice krispos went on bring them here to me this instant aye your majesty the trooper wheeled his horse and set spurs to it the animal squealed a loud protest but quickly went into a gallop clods of dirt flew up from its hooves as it bounded away krispos fought down the urge to ride after the fellow making himself wait before long the trooper returned with the band of which hed spoken by their horses by their gear they were videssians as hed said as they drew closer krispos frown deepened he recognized none of them that he could see though some were hidden behind others surely mammianos would have sent out someone he knew who are you people he said what are you doing here the answer came from the back of the group majesty we are come to give you aid as we may krispos stared so did every man who heard that light clear voice or saw the beardless sculptured profile beneath that conical cavalry helm tanilis might don chain mail but no one anywhere would ever mistake her for a man with an effort krispos found his own voice my lady the good god knows youre welcome and more than welcome but how did you track us here trokoundos was sure hed screened off the column from sorcerers senses of course trokoundos proved not to know everything there was to know his mouth twisted he jerked his chin toward the mages corpse tanilis eyes moved with his gesture a slim finger sketched the suncircle above her left breast she said honor to his skill for had i depended on finding your soldiers i should not have been aware of their true path till far too late but i sought you with my magic your majesty our old ties of friendship made that possible where the other would have failed aye friendship krispos said slowly their ties had been more intimate than that back a decade before when hed wintered in opsikion helping iakovitzes recover from a badly broken leg he studied her she was ten years older than he or a bit more her son mavros had been only five years younger some of her years showed but not many most of them had only added character to a beauty that had once been almost beyond needing it she sat her horse quietly waiting under his scrutiny she did not wait long that had never been her way however skilled your mage was in harvas blackrobe he found one stronger than himself do you think harvas sits idly on the other side of that wall he made that wall black as his robes black as his heart i very much fear he doesnt krispos said but with trokoundos slain how can i answer him unless his voice trailed away just so tanilis said i tried to warn your wizard there at the end but he was too full of himself to hear or heed me i heard you krispos exclaimed i thought you might have harvas is also stronger than i am this i know i will stand against him all the same for my emperor and for my son she slid down from her horse and approached the barrier harvas had set in front of the flying column after some minutes study she turned back to krispos considering what you may find on the other side your warriors would be well advised to form line of battle aye krispos waved the command ran down the column the troopers moved smoothly into place they still sent wary glances toward the black wall but the routine of having orders to follow soaked up some of their fear instead of stabbing at the barrier with a peremptory index finger tanilis gently touched it with the palm of her hand krispos held his breath his heard pounded as he wondered if the livid lightnings would consume her as they had trokoundos the lightnings flashed some of the soldiers groanedthey had no great hope for her is she mad one man said no she knows what shes about another answered his eastern accent hinting that he came from somewhere not far from opsikion thats the lady tanilis that is mother to mavros the dead sevastos and a sorceress in her own right if the tales be true his words went up and down the line faster than krispos command had rumors were more interesting than orders tanilis back stiffened arched but only a little no harvas not now she said so softly krispos barely heard you have already hurt me worse than this it was as if she did not fight against whatever torment the black barrier dealt out but rather accepted it and in accepting defeated it the wall seemed to sense that the lightnings blazed ever brighter around tanilis as it sought to lay her low but she refused to topple no she said again very clearly again the lightnings increased this time to a peak of such brilliance that krispos had to turn his head away his eyes watering no tanilis said for a third time from the heart of that firestorm through slitted eyelids krispos looked back toward her she still stood defiantand all at once the black walls force yielded to her stronger will the lightning ceased the barrier melted into the thin air from which it had sprung the imperial soldiers cried out in triumph at that then a moment later they cried out again the black walls vanishing revealed the halogai who had been advancing on the flying column under its cover harvas too would have let the barrier disappear no doubt but at a time of his own choosing forward krispos shouted the cry is mavros mavros the videssians thundered they rolled toward harvas haloga then rolled over them the northerners were caught in loose order confident they would find foes ripe for the slaughter some of them turned tail when the downfall of the barrier showed that krispos men were more ready for battle than they more stood and fought they followed a wicked leader but kept their own fierce pride it availed them nothing the imperials rode them down then rode on toward the northern mouth of the pass mavros they shouted again and again and another cry tanilis we may yet bottle harvas up in there sarkis yelled to krispos his black eyes snapping with excitement aye when krispos horse even thought of slowing he roweled it with his spurs normally he was gentle to his mounts but now he would not willingly lose so much as an instant a solid line across the outlet to the pass and harvas army was done for the exultation in the thought almost made krispos drunk almost that army would be done for unless harvas magicked it free despite tanilis despite all the mages from the sorcerers collegium the possibility remained real any time krispos was tempted to forget it he had only to think of trokoundos twisted body now more than a mile behind him he saw the mouth of the pass ahead get his men across it and rein in he shouted and followed that with a volley of curses harvas halogai were already streaming north out of the trap some carried axes at the ready others bore them over their shoulders the long files of fighting men were ready for action unlike the nowshattered band that had been on the way to deal with krispos column too many for us to head sarkis said gauging the enemys numbers with a practiced eye i fear youre right worse luck for us krispos answered hes pulled them out just in time maybe he could tell when his wall went down or some such even if we cant keep him there though lets see how much we can hurt his soldiers theyre giving us their flank for a target sarkis nodded and brought up his hand in salute mammianos said you were learning the trade of war i see hes right the scout commander raised his voice archers shouting enthusiastically the bowmen began to ply their trade shooting from horseback did not make for accurate archery but with a massed target like the one they had they did not need to be accurate halogai screamed halogai stumbled halogai fell some of the northerners awkwardly shifted their shields to their right sides to help ward themselves from the arrows that rained down on them others singly and then by troops and companies rushed toward their tormentors the archers could not come close to shooting all of them before they closed the gap and began to swing axe and sword imperial lancers spurred forward to protect the bowmen half a dozen melees developed all along the imperial line as more and more halogai poured out of the pass krispos men found themselves outnumbered pull back he shouted we didnt come here to take on harvas whole bloody army by ourselves hes out of the pass and thats what counts do you think he can hold all the rest of our own troops out of kubrat with just a rearguard not likely an army of halogai would either have ignored krispos order or taken it as a signal to panic they fought as much for the joy of fighting as to gain advantage the videssians were less ferocious and more flexible they drew back stinging harvas footsoldiers with more arrows as they did so the lancers nipped in to cut off and destroy bands of halogai who pursued with too much spirit again and again the halogai paid in blood to learn that lesson i dont think harvas is leaving much of a rearguard in there sarkis said late that afternoon by then the running fight had moved close to ten miles into kubrat krispos was hardpressed to stretch the limited manpower of his column to cover all of harvas army like wildfire a cheer ran up the videssian line from the south at last itand the news that caused itreached krispos who was near the northern end of his force as it skirmished with harvas scouts and vanguard our own men are coming up out of the pass someone bawled in his ear thats good krispos said automatically then the full meaning of what hed heard sank in he let loose with a yell that made his horse sidestep and switch its ears in reproach we have him but as harvas had shown south of imbros he was general as well as wizard rearguards had to be beaten down sorcerous screens had to be cautiously probed and even more cautiously eliminated by the time night fell he had succeeded in breaking off contact between his army and most of his videssian pursuers though the flying column still hung just off his right flank krispos made his way back to where the main imperial army was setting up camp he smiled to find his own tent erect and waiting for him he invited mammianos over when the fat general arrived he clapped him on the back you couldnt have done a better job of timing your attack on harvas barricade he said i thank you kindly your majesty but mammianos did not sound as proud as he might have in fact he shuffled from foot to foot like an embarrassed schoolboy it uh wasnt exactly my idea though oh krispos raised an eyebrow what then might as well hear it from me instead of somebody else i suppose mammianos said he shifted his weight again before he went on that zaidasyou know the young wizardhe came up and told me he didnt think things were going any too well for you this morning he was right krispos said remembering the sound trokoundos spine had made as it snapped and his own fear when the wizard died trokoundos had a wifea widow nowin videssos the city krispos reminded himself to provide for her not that gold could make up for the loss of her man i figured he might be seeing as he was the one who sniffed out harvas army down south of imbros mammianos said so i asked him if we could help you by having a go at the barricade and he said yes so we had a go and maybe harvas was distracted on account of trying to deal with your lot because we broke through the rest i guess you know im just glad you listened to zaidas krispos said mammianos rumbled laughter now that you mention it your majesty so am i xi krispos and tanilis rode side by side theyd ridden side by side ever since the imperial army entered kubrat by now more than a week later and half the way to the astris river no one even gave them a sidelong glance no one had ever had the temerity to say anything to krispos about it perhaps someone might have had tanilis not proven her worth so solidly the mages from the sorcerers collegiumall krispos noted save zaidashad muttered when she included herself in their labors against harvas but the mutters died away soon enough inside of a day she became as much their spearhead as trokoundos had ever been again and again harvas sorcerous assaults failed again and again his army outflanked by the more mobile videssians had to retreat i think hes falling back on pliskavos krispos said in all of kubrat its the only place where he could hope to stand siege the prospect of harvas under siege still worried him a siege would give the evil wizard the leisure he needed to exercise his ingenuity to the fullest krispos grimaced at the prospect of facing whatever that exercised ingenuity came up with tanilis gaze became slightly unfocused yes she said a few seconds too late for a proper reply he is falling back on pliskavos she sounded as certain as if shed said the sun would rise the next morning a moment later she came back to herself a small frown on her face i have a headache she remarked krispos passed her his canteen heres some wine he said as she drank he ran his hands over his arms trying to smooth down the gooseflesh that had prickled up at her foretelling hed seen the mantic fit take her far more strongly than that not least on the day when hed first met her the day shed terrified him by calling him majesty then hed wondered if she saw true now he knew she did knowing that he thought to take advantage of her gift he called for a courier get sarkis over here he said the courier saluted and rode away he soon returned with the scout commander what can i do for you your majesty sarkis asked time to send out another column krispos said and watched sarkis grin harvas is on his way back to pliskavos sarkis caught his certainty and glanced over to tanilis krispos nodded he went on if we can put a few thousand men into the place before he gets there say or burn down a good part of it sarkis grin got wider aye your majesty we can try that we can swing wide and get around behind his men the good god willing horses go faster than shanks mare it should work ill get right on it good krispos grinned too savagely let harvas find out for a change what being hunted was like feel what it meant to move to someone elses will to move in fear lest the tiniest error bring the fabric of all his designs down in ruin hed inflicted misery on videssos for too longperhaps for the whole span of his unnatural life only fitting and proper to mete misery out to him at last the column clattered away from the main videssian army late that afternoon heading off to the west to circle round harvas halogai the troopers who stayed on the primary line of march whooped as their comrades departed one outflanking move had forced harvas out of his strong position in the pass another might ruin him altogether the soldiers were cheerful as they encamped for the night as was his habit krispos picked a line at random and patiently advanced toward the cookpot at the end of it anthimos with his love of rare delicacies would have turned up his toes at army fare used to worse for much of his life krispos minded it not at all peas beans onions and cheese made a savory stew enlivened as it had seldom been in his peasant days with small chunks of salty sausage and beef he slapped his stomach and raised a belch the men around him laughed they knew they ate better because he shared their food after he had eaten krispos walked along the lines of tethered horses stopping to chat now and then with a trooper grooming his mount or prying a pebble out from under a horseshoe his years as a groom after he came to videssos the city made him easy with horsy talk though he was not one of the fairly common breed who cared for nothing else by day or night for the most part the men treated their animals well their lives might depend on keeping the beasts in good condition the short full darkness of summer night had fallen by the time krispos made his way back to his own tent which stood as always in the center of the camp the haloga guardsmen in front of it came to attention as he approached as you were he said and ducked through the flap unlike the heavy canvas under which most of the troopers sweltered his summer tent was of silk he got whatever breeze there was tonight there was no breeze he was not ready to sleep yet not quite he sat down in a folding chair of wood and wicker set his chin in his hand and thought about what the coming days would bring he no longer believed harvas would be able to enspell his army this side of pliskavos hed had to summon most of the sorcerous talent in the empire to match the undying renegade but hed done it he thought harvas was beginning to understand that too if his magic would not serve him that left his soldiers some time soon he might try battle if he found a piece of ground that suited him outside the tent the sentries shifted their weight their boots scuffed the dirt their mail shirts rang softly the small sounds so close by made krispos glance up toward the entrance his right hand stole toward the hilt of his saber then one of the sentries said how do we serve you my lady in all the sprawling imperial camp there was only one my lady tanilis said i would speak with his majesty if he will see me one of the guardsmen stuck his head into the tent before he could speak krispos said of course i will see the lady he felt his heartbeat shift from walk to trot however they rode during the day tanilis had not come to his tent at night before the guard held the flap wide for her silk rustled as it fell after she came in krispos got to his feet taking a step toward a second chair so he could unfold it for her before he reached it tanilis went smoothly to her knees and then to her belly her forehead touched the ground in the most graceful act of proskynesis he had ever seen he felt his face grow hot get up he said his voice so soft the guards could not listen but rough with emotions he was still sorting through its not rightnot fittingfor you to prostrate yourself before me and wherefore not your majesty she asked as she rose with the same liquid elegance she had used in the proskynesis you are my avtokrator should i not grant you the full honor your station deserves he opened the other chair she sat in it he went back to the one in which he had been sitting his thoughts refused to muster themselves into any kind of order at last he said its not the same you knew me before i was emperor by the lord with the great and good mind my lady you knew me before i was much of anything i gave you leave long ago as a friend to call me by my name i could scarcely deny my emperor the same privilege a tiny smile tugged up the corners of tanilis mouth and you seem to have become quite a lot of something if i may take a friends privilege and point it out thank you krispos spoke carefully to ensure that he did not stammer being with tanilis took him back to the days when he had been more nearly boy than man he did not want to show that not to her of all people now he made himself think clearly and said and thank you also for making sure i left opsikion and youthat spring whether i wanted to or not she inclined her head to him now you have come into a mans wisdom to see why i did as i did i could tell that opsikion was too small for youand i at the time i was rather too large you were not yet what you would become her words so paralleled his own thoughts that he nodded in turn as he did he gazed at her she had held her beauty well enough to remain more than striking even in harshest daylight lamps were kinder now she seemed hardly to have aged a day seeing her hearing her also reminded him of how they had spent a good part of their time together hed gone on campaign before without seriously wanting to bring a woman into his tent to keep his cot warm part of that he admitted to himself with a wry grin was nervousness about dara but another part a bigger part came from fondness for his wife now he found he wanted tanilis none of what he felt for dara had gone away it just did not seem relevant anymore hed known tanilis known her body long before hed ever imagined he would meet dara wanting to take her to bed again did not feel like being unfaithful it felt much more like picking up an old friendship he did not stop to wonder what his taking tanilis to bed would feel like to dara he got up stretched and walked over to the map table in one corner of the tent videssos had not ruled in kubrat for three hundred years the imperial archives nevertheless held detailed if archaic maps of the land stored against the day when it might become a province of the empire once more but he only glanced at the ragged parchment with its ink going brown and pale from age he stretched again then walked about as if at random it was no accident though that he ended up behind tanilis chair he rested a hand on her shoulder she twisted her head up and back to look at him her small smile grew she made a pleased noise almost a purr deep in her throat her hand covered his her skin was smooth her flesh soft a ruby ring on her index finger caught the dim lamplight and glowed like warm blood krispos bent down and lightly kissed her like old times he said aye like old times her pleased purr got louder her eyes were almost all pupil then suddenly those huge eyes seemed to be looking past krispos or through him for a little while she said in a voice altogether different from the one shed used a moment before that distant expression faded before krispos was quite sure hed seen it her voice returned to normal too or better than normal kiss me again she told him he did gladly when the kiss ended she got to her feet afterward he was never sure which of them took the first step toward the cot she pulled her robe over her head slid out of her drawers and lay down to wait while he undressed she did not wait long do you want to blow out the lamps she whispered no he answered as softly for one thing it would tell the guardsmen just what were doing for another youre beautiful and i want to see you even more than her face her body had retained its youthful tautness her eyes lit no wonder i recall you so happily she held up her arms to him he got down beside her the cot was narrow for two the cot in truth was narrow for one they managed all the same tanilis was as krispos remembered her or even more so an all but overwhelming blend of passion and technique soon his own excitement drove memory away leaving only the moment even after they were spent they lay entangledotherwise one of them would have fallen off the cot tanilis hand stole down his side and stroked him with practiced art another round she murmured her breath warm in his ear in a bit maybe he answered after taking stock of himself im older than i was when i visited opsikion you know i wasnt spending long days in the saddle then either one of his eyebrows quirked upward against the velvety skin of her throat at least not on horseback she bit him in the shoulder hard enough to hurt he started to yelp but checked himself in time the small pain seemed to spur him though sooner than he had expected he found himself rising to the occasion once more tanilis let out a voiceless sigh as they began again from outside the tent one of the guardsmen called majesty a courier is here with a dispatch from the city krispos did his best not to hear the haloga dont be foolish tanilis said she retained as much selfcontrol as krispos remembered she made a small pushing motion against his chest go on see what news the rider brings ill be here when you get back knowing she was right helped only so much more than a little grumpily he separated from her climbed off the cot dressed and went out into the night here you are your majesty the courier said handing him a sealed roll of parchment after a salute the fellow twitched his mounts reins and headed out toward the long lines of tethered horses krispos ducked back into the tent as he did so his cheeks started to flame the halogai had never been shy about sticking their heads inside when they needed him to come out if they called now it had to be because they knew what he was doing in there oh to the ice with it he muttered the longer he ruled the more resigned he became to having no privacy the sight of tanilis waiting for him drove such minor annoyances clean out of his mind he yanked off his robe and let it fell to the ground tanilis frowned the dispatch whatever it is it will keep long enough she lowered her eyes in acquiescence then hurry here your majesty krispos hurried afterward languid he wanted to forget about the roll of parchment but he knew tanilis would think less of him for thatand he would think less of himself when morning came he got into his robe again and broke the seal on the message tanilis projected an air of silent approval as she also put her clothes back on his impatient thoughts full of her he hadnt bothered to hold the dispatch up to a lamp to find out whod sent it now as he read the note inside he learned the empress dara to her husband krispos avtokrator of the videssians greetings yesterday i gave birth to our second son as mavros mother tanilis foretold as we agreed ive named him evripos he is large and seems healthy and squalls at all hours of the day and night the birth was hard but all births are hard the midwife acts pleased with him and me both the good god grant that you are soon here in the city once more to see him and me krispos had felt no guilt before now it all crashed down on him at once when he said nothing for some time tanilis asked is the news so very bad then wordlessly he passed the letter to her she read quickly and without moving her lips something krispos still found far from easy oh was all she said when she was done yes krispos said only two words between them but words charged with a great weight of meaning shall i come here to your tent no more then your majesty tanilis asked her voice all at once cool and formal that might be best krispos answered miserably as you wish your majesty do recall though that you knew of the empressyour wifescondition before this dispatch arrived i grant that knowing and being reminded are not the same but you had the knowledge and now by your leave she tossed daras letter onto the cot strode briskly to the tent flap ducked through it and walked away krispos stared after her minutes before they had been gasping in each others arms he picked up the letter to read it again he had another son and dara was well good news every bit of it even so he crumpled the parchment into a ball and flung it to the ground scouts pushed ahead before dawn the next morning probing to make sure no ambushes lay ahead of the imperial army the main force soon followed a long column with its supply wagons protected by a sizable knot of mounted men rattling along in the middle the unwieldy arrangement never failed to make krispos nervous if harvas had even a few kubrati horsearchers on his side he could give us no end of grief he remarked to bagradas who led the force guarding the baggage train concentrating on the armys affairs helped krispos keep his mind off his own and off the fact that today tanilis had chosen not to ride beside him but rather with the rest of the magicians bagradas did not notice thator if he did had sense enough not to let on he said whatever kubratoi still have fight in them want to come in on our side your majesty not against us we picked up another few dozen yesterday of course when it comes to real fighting they may do us as little good as that group that stayed with you out of the pass all the way up until things looked dangerous and then took off the regimental commander lifted a cynical eyebrow as long as they arent raiding us they can do as they please krispos said we brought along enough of our own folk to do our fighting for us he lifted a hand from progress neck to pluck at his beard i wonder how that column i sent out is faring my guess would be that they are still out swinging wide your majesty bagradas said if they turn north too close to us harvas might be able to position men in front of them they were warned about that krispos said one more thing to worry about he urged progress ahead toward the group of sorcerers they were he saw without surprise gathered around tanilis zaidas who had been animatedly chattering with her looked over with almost comic startlement as krispos rode up beside him a good thing im not harvas krispos remarked dryly he bowed in the saddle to tanilis my lady may i speak with you of course your majesty you know you have only to command she spoke without apparent irony and flicked the reins to get her horse into a trot and away from the wizards krispos did the same zaidas and the other wizards stared after them in disappointment when enough clear space had opened up to give them some privacy tanilis inclined her head to krispos your majesty i just wanted to say i feel bad about the way things ended between us last night you neednt trouble yourself about it she replied after all you are the avtokrator of the videssians you may do just as you wish anthimos did just as he wished krispos said angrily look what it got him i want to try to do whats right so far as i can see what that is youve chosen a harder road than he did after a small pause tanilis went on in a dispassionate tone of voice few would say that bedding a woman not your wife falls into that category i know i know i know he made a fist and slammed it down on his thigh just below the bottom edge of his coat of mail i dont make a habit of it you know i would have guessed that yes now she sounded amused perhaps not in an altogether pleasant way it isnt funny curse it doggedly clumsily he went ahead id known youloved you for a while though i know you didnt love mefor such a long time and now id seen you again when i never expected to well i never worried about what i was doing till id done it then that note came and i got brought up short aye you did tanilis studied him i might have guessed your marriage was one of convenience only but two sons born close together argues against that the more so as youve spent a good part of your reign in the field oh theres something of convenience in it for me and for her both krispos admitted but there turns out to be more to it than that too he laughed without mirth you noticed that didnt you but all the same when wed made love and the courier brought the letter i had no business treating you the way i did thats not right either and im sorry for it tanilis rode on for a little while in silence then she remarked i think riding into battle might be easier for you than saying what you just said krispos shrugged one thing im sure of is that putting a crown on my head doesnt make me right all the time the lord with the great and good mind knows i didnt learn much from anthimos about how to rule but i learned that and if i was wrong whats the point in being ashamed to say so wherever you learned to rule krispos he warmed to hear her use his name again rather than his title you appear to have learned a good deal shall we return to being friends then yes he answered with relief how could i be your enemy mischief sparkled in tanilis eyes suppose i came to your tent again tonight would you take up saber and shield to drive me away in spite of all his good intentions his manhood stirred at the thought of her coming to his tent again he ignored it im too old to let my prick do my thinking for me he told himself firmly a moment later he added i hope aloud he said if youre trying to tempt me youre doing a good job he managed a smile i would not seek to tempt you into something you find improper tanilis answered seriously if that is how it is let it be so i said back in opsikion all those years ago that we would not suit each other over the long haul it still seems true yes krispos said again with no small regret he still wondered if he and dara suited each other over the long haul ever since he became emperor hed been away on campaign so much that theyd had scant chance to find out he went on im glad we can be friends so am i tanilis looked around at the kubrati countryside through which they were riding her voice sank to a whisper being friendless in such a land would be a dreadful fate its not that bad krispos said remembering his childhood years north of the mountains its just different from videssos the sky was a paler damper blue than inside the empire the land was a different shade of green too deeper and more like moss the graygreen olive trees that gave videssos so much of its distinctive tint would not grow here the winters krispos knew had a ferocity worse than any videssos suffered but perhaps tanilis was not seeing the material landscape that was all krispos could perceive this land hates me she said shivering though the day was warm her sepulchral tone made krispos want to shiver too then tanilis brightened or rather grew intent on her prey if we can pull harvas down let it hate me as much as it will with that krispos could not argue he gazed out at kubrat again far off in the northwest he spied a rising smudge of dirty gray smoke against the horizon he pointed to it maybe thats the work of the column i sent out he said hopefully tanilis gaze swung that way aye it is your column she said but she did not sound hopeful krispos tried to make himself believe she was still fretting over the way the land affected her but the next morning as the main body of the army was getting ready to break camp riders began straggling in from the west krispos did not want to talk with the first few of them as hed learned men who got away first often had no idea what had really gone wrongif anything had sarkis came in about midmorning a fresh cut seamed one cheek his right forearm was bandaged im sorry majesty he said i was the one who made the mistake you own up to it anyhow krispos said tell me what happened we came across a villagea town almostthat isnt on our old maps the scout commander answered im not surprisedit looked as if the halogai were still building it longhouses are their style anyhow not a lot of men were in it but those who were came boiling out and their women with them armed and fighting as fierce as they were sarkis picked at a flake of dried blood on his face majesty beating them wasnt the problem we had plenty of men for that but i knew our true goal was pliskavos and i wanted to get there as quick as i could so instead of doing much more than skirmishing and setting the village ablaze we saw the smoke krispos broke in i shouldnt wonder anyhow i didnt want to lose time by riding around the place either so i swung us in on this side instead and we rode straight northright into a detachment from harvas army they had more troopers than we did and they beat us curse em oh a plague krispos said as much to himself as to sarkis he thought for a few seconds any sign of magic in the fight not a bit of it sarkis answered at once the northerners looked to be heading west themselves to try to cut us off from riding around their army thanks to that miserable stinking fleafarm of a village they got the chance and they took it let me have another go at them your majesty or some new man if youve lost faith in me the plan was good and we still have enough room to maneuver to make it work krispos thought some more and shook his head no a trick may work once against harvas if it catches him by surprise i cant imagine him letting us try one twice something ghastly would be waiting for us i feel it in my bones youre likely right sarkis hung his head do what you will with me for having foiled you nothing to be done about it now krispos answered you tried to pick the fastest way to carry out my orders and it happened not to work may you be luckier next time may the good god grant it be so sarkis said fervently ill make you glad youve trusted mei promise i will good krispos said sarkis saluted and rode away to see the men who were still coming in from the column krispos sighed as he watched him go it would have to be the hard way then with the butchers bill that accompanied the hard way hed already thought about putting peasants back into the border regions south of the mountains he would also have to find soldiers to replace those who fell in this campaign where he wondered would all the men come from he laughed at himself though it wasnt really funny back in his days on the farm hed never imagined the emperor could have any reason to worry let alone a reason so mundane as finding the people to do what needed doing he laughed again back in his days on the farm hed never imagined a lot of things harvas skirmished screened avoided pitched battle he seemed content to let the war turn on what happened after he got to pliskavos that worried krispos even the kubratoi and the videssianspeaking peasants who flocked to his army and acclaimed him as a liberator failed to cheer him kubrat would return to imperial rule if he beat harvas aye if he lost the nomads and peasants both would only suffer more for acclaiming him as his force neared pliskavos he began sending out striking columns again not to cut harvas off from the capital of kubrat but rather to ensure that he and his army went nowhere else one of the columns sent men galloping back in high excitement the astris the astris they shouted as they returned to the main force from the northwest they were the first imperial soldiers to reach the river in three hundred years another column came to the astris east of pliskavos a day later instead of sending back proud troopers to boast of what theyd done they shouted for reinforcements a whole raft of halogai are crossing the river on boats a rider gasped as he rode in mixing his metaphors but getting the message across krispos dispatched reinforcements on the double he also sent a company of soldiers from the first column that had reached the astris to ride west along its bank toward the videssian sea find kanaris and bring him here he ordered this is why we have ships on the astris lets see the northerners put more men across it once he sails up he saw the astris himself the next day the wide gray river flowed past pliskavos which lay by its southern bank the stream was wide enough to make the steppes and forests on the far bank seem distant and unreal unfortunately quite real however were the little boats that scurried across it each one brought a new band of halogai to help harvas hold the land hed seized krispos raged but could do little more until the grand drungarios of the fleet arrived while he waited the army began to built a palisade around pliskavos something occurs to me mammianos said that evening i dont know as much as id like about fighting on water or much of anything about magic but whats to keep harvas from hurting our dromons when they do come up the astris krispos gnawed on his lower lip wed better talk with the magicians by the time the talk was done krispos found himself missing trokoundos not just because the mage had been a friend trokoundos had been able to make sorcerous matters clear to people who were not wizards his colleagues left krispos feeling as confused as he was enlightened he gathered though that sorcery aimed at targets on running water tended to be weakened or to go astray altogether he didnt care for the sound of that tended to i hope harvas has read the same magical books you have he told the wizards your majesty i see no sorcerous threat looming over kanaris fleet zaidas said nor do i tanilis agreed zaidas blinked then beamed he sent tanilis a worshipful look she nodded to him a regal gesture krispos knew well the force of it seemed to daze zaidas who was younger and more susceptible than krispos ever had been when he knew her krispos shook his head noticing how young other people were was a sign he wasnt so young himself but he had as much assurance from his wizards as he could hope for that was worth a slight feeling of antiquity the palisade around pliskavos grew stronger over the next couple of days the troopers dug a ditch and used the dirt from it to build a rampart behind it they mounted shields on top of the rampart to make it even higher all the same the gray stone wall of pliskavos stood taller still the halogai sallied several times seeking to disrupt the men who were busy strengthening the palisade they fought with their folks usual reckless courage and paid heavily for it each day though dugouts brought fresh bands of northerners across the astris and into pliskavos halogaland must be grim indeed if so many of the northerners brave the trip across pardraya in hopes of settling here krispos observed at an evening meeting with his officers aye true enough for the lands hereabouts are nothing to brag of mammianos said krispos did not entirely trust the fat generals sense of proportion the coastal lowlands where mammianos had been stationed were the richest farming country in the whole empire sarkis put in i wonder how many villages like the one that gave me trouble have been planted on kubrati soil well have to finish the job of uprooting them once were done here a gleam came into his dark eyes i wouldnt mind uprooting one or two of those goldhaired northern women myself several of the men in krispos tent nodded fair hair was rareand exotically interestingin videssos have a care now sarkis mammianos rumbled from what youve told us the haloga wenches fight back everyone laughed you should have tried sweet talk sarkis bagradas said the laughter got louder i hadnt gone there to woo them then sarkis answered tartly back to business krispos said trying without much success to sound stern how soon can we be ready to storm pliskavos his officers exchanged worried looks starving the place into submission would be a lot cheaper your majesty mammianos said harvas cant have supplies for all the men hes jammed in there no matter how full his warehouses are his troopsll start taking sick before long too crowded together the way they must be so will ours in spite of everything the healerpriests can do krispos answered mammianos nodded camp fevers could cost an army more men than combat krispos went on even so id say you were right most of the time but not against harvas blackrobe the more time he has to ready himself in there the more i fear him mammianos sighed aye some truth in what you say he is a proper bugger isnt he he glanced around to the other officers as if hoping one of them would speak out for delay no one did mammianos sighed again well majesty we have ladders and such in the baggage train and all the metal parts and cordage for siege engines well need some time to knock down trees for their frames and cut the wood to fit but as soon as thats done we can take a crack at it how long krispos insisted a week maybe a day or two less mammianos said obviously reluctant to be pinned down other thing is though that harvasd have to be blind not to see what were up to as we prepare hes a lot of nasty things but blind isnt any of them i know krispos said still he knows what were here for anyhow we didnt fight our way across kubrat to offer to harvest his turnips lets get those engines started mammianos and the rest of the officers saluted with orders given they would obey the next morning armed parties rode out to chop timber by midday horses and mules began hauling back roughly trimmed logs under the watchful eyes of the engineers who would assemble and direct the use of the catapults and rams soldiers cut the wood to proper lengths the noise of carpentry filled the camp mammianos had been right the halogai on pliskavos walls had no doubt what the imperials were doing they jeered and waved their axes and swords in defiance the ones with a few words of videssian yelled out what sort of welcome the attackers were likely to receive some of krispos soldiers yelled back most just kept working a tall thin pillar of smoke rose into the sky from somewhere near the center of pliskavos when zaidas saw it he turned pale and drew the suncircle over his heart all the wizards with the imperial army redoubled their apotropaic spells what exactly is harvas up to krispos asked zaidas reasoning he would be most likely to know because of his sensitive sorcerous vision but the young mage only shook his head nothing good was the sole answer he would give that smoke he shuddered and sketched the sunsign again this time krispos did the same the wizards concern made krispos more and more edgy nor was his temper improved when a dozen more dugouts full of halogai landed at pliskavos quays before the sun reached its zenith in the late afternoon videssian watchers on the shore of the astris spied another small flotilla getting ready to set out from the northern bank the news went straight to krispos he slammed his fist down onto his portable desk and scowled at the messenger by the good god i wish we could do something about these bastards he growled every one of them who gets into town means another one wholl be able to kill our men seldom in a mans life are prayers answered promptly all too seldom in a mans life are prayers answered at all but krispos was still fuming when another messenger burst into his tent this one fairly hopping with excitement majesty he cried weve spotted kanaris ships rowing their way upstream against the current have you krispos said softly he rolled up the message hed been reading it could wait this i want to see for myself he hurried out of the tent shouting for progress he booted the gelding into a gallop in a few minutes the horse stood blowing by the riverbank krispos peered west using a hand to shield his eyes from the sun sure enough up the river stormed the lean sharkshapes of the imperial dromons their twin banks of oars rose and fell in swift unison spray flew from the polished bronze rams the ships bore at their bows sailors and marines hurried about on the decks readying the dromons for combat the halogai had paddled their dugout canoes scarcely a quarter of the way across the astris they might have turned around and got back safe to the northern shore but they did not even try retreat was a word few northerners knew they only bent their backs and paddled harder a few of the dugouts sported small masts sails sprouted from those now for a moment krispos thought the halogai might win their race into pliskavos but the videssian warships caught them a couple of hundred yards from the quays darts flew from the catapults at the dromons bows so did covered clay pots which trailed smoke as they arced through the air one burst in the middle of a dugout in an instant the canoe was ablaze from one end to the other so were the men inside thinned by long travel over water their screams came to krispos ears the halogai who could plunged into the astris their mail shirts dragged them to the bottom an easier end than one filled with flame a dromons ram broke a dugout in half more halogai these unburned thrashed in the water but not for long videssian marines shot those who did not sink at once from the weight of their armor another canoe broke free from the midriver melee and sprinted for the protection of pliskavos docks halogai on the walls of the town cheered their countrymen on but a dromon quickly closed on the canoe instead of ramming the captain chose a different form of fire a sailor aimed a wooden tube faced inside with bronze at the fleeing dugout two more men worked a hand pump similar to the ones the fire brigades used in videssos the city but they did not pump waterout spurted the same incendiary brew that had incinerated the first haloga canoe this one suffered a like fate for the sheet of fire that covered it was nearly as long as it was the northerners writhed and wilted in the fire like moths in a torchflame krispos head swiveled back and forth as he looked around for more dugout canoes he saw none in the space of a couple of minutes the imperial dromons had swept the river clear only a couple of chunks of flaming debris that drifted downstream and were gone said any folk but the videssians had ever been on the astris the soldiers by the water who had watched the fight yelled themselves hoarse as the dromons came in to beach themselves on the riverbank inside pliskavos the halogai were as silent as if the town were uninhabited the grand drungarios barred pennant snapped at the stern of a galley not far from krispos he rode progress over to the dromon and got there just as kanaris was coming down the gangplank to the ground well done krispos called kanaris waved to him then saluted more formally well done yourself majesty he answered his deep gruff voice pitched to carry over wind and wave sorry we were west of here but who thought youd push all the way to pliskavos well done indeed praise from a longtime warrior always made krispos proud for he knew what an amateur he was in matters military he called for a messenger when one came up he told the fellow fetch some of the wizards here the fleet will need them as the messenger rode away kanaris said we have our own wizards aboard majesty no doubt krispos aid but ive brought the finest mages from the sorcerers collegium up with the army harvas blackrobe is no ordinary enemy and youve given him special reason to hate you and your ships right now have it your way then majesty the grand drungarios said by the look of things youve been right so far aye so far krispos sketched the sunsign to turn aside any evil omen he also reminded himself never to take anything for granted against a foe like harvas krispos raised his cup to tomorrow he said to tomorrow the officers in the imperial tent echoed they too held their wine cups high then emptied them and filed out twilight still tinged the western sky but they all had many things to see to before they sought their bedrolls tomorrow the imperial army would attack pliskavos krispos paced back and forth trying again to find holes in the plan he and his generals had hammered out for all their planning there would be holes and the attack would reveal them war he had learned was like that if he could find one or two of them before the trumpets blew he would save lives but he could not he kept pacing for a while anyhow to work off nervous energy then he blew out all the lamps save one undressed and lay down on his cot sleep would be slow coming best to start seeking it early he was warm and relaxed and just drifting off when geirrod poked his head into the tent majesty the lady tanilis would see you the imperial guardsman said must see you tanilis corrected from outside wait a minute he said muzzily cursing under his breath at having rest jerked out from under him he pulled a robe on over his head and relit a couple of the lamps hed put out not long before as he went about that homely labor his bad temper eased and his wits began to clear he nodded to geirrod let her come in aye majesty the haloga managed to bow and hold the tent flap open at the same time go in my lady he said his voice as respectful as if tanilis were of imperial rank any thought that she was seeking to seduce him for her own advantage disappeared when krispos got a good look at her face for the first time he saw her haggard her hair awry her eyes hollow and darkcircled lines harshly carved on her forehead and at the corners of her mouth by the good god he exclaimed whats wrong without asking leaveagain most unlike hertanilis sank into a folding chair the motion held none of her usual grace only exhaustion you will assail harvas in his lair tomorrow she said it was flat statement not question she had not been at the officers conclave but the signs of a building attack were hard to hide krispos nodded aye we will what of it you must not again tanilis voice held no room for doubt only pyrrhos perhaps pronouncing on some point of dogma could have sounded as certain if you do much the greater part of the army will surely be destroyed youveseenthis even as the words passed his lips krispos knew how foolish they were tanilis would not trouble him with ordinary worries she did not twit him for stupidity either as she might have were the matter less urgent and she less worn she simply answered i have seen this she rested for a moment slumped down with her chin in her hands then drawing on some reserve of resolution she straightened yes i have seen when i wrote you after mavros was slain i said i know harvas power was greater than mine but i hoped to face him nonetheless now i have faced him his power she shivered though the night was warm and muggy when she slumped again the heels of her hands covered her eyes krispos went to her and put his hand on her shoulder hed done the same just before they made love but this touch had nothing of the erotic to it it was support and care as he might have given any friend brought low by killing labor he said what did you do tanilis the words dragged from her one by one since harvas was wiling to stand siege i sought to spy to seekaye to sneak from his mind how he aimed to answer us when the time came i did not plan to confront him directly had i done so i would now be lying dead in my tent i came near enough to that as it was she paused to rest again krispos poured her a cup of wine she seemed a little restored after she drank it her voice was stronger as she went on even entering the corners of that mind is like tiptoeing through a maze of death he has shields and spikefilled snares in his head snares beyond counting be thankful you are mindblind dear krispos that you never need to touch such evil i made myself very small hoping he would not notice me tears ran down her cheeks she did not seem to know they were there what did you do krispos asked again i found what i sought were harvas less arrogant less sure of himself he would have caught me no matter what i did but down deep he will not believe any mere mortal truly able to challenge him and so beneath his notice i found what he intendedand i fled of themselves krispos hands curled into fists and what is waiting for us he demanded fire tanilis answered i know not hownor did i stay to try to learnbut harvas has made the city wall of pliskavos a great reservoir of flame at his will or signal the wall can be ignited most likely he would wait until our men are on it everywhere perhaps beginning to drop down into pliskavos then he could burn those on the wall and climbing up it and also trap the intrepid souls who aimed to take the fight farther but hed burn the defenders on the wall too krispos said would he care tanilis asked brutally no krispos admitted not if they served his purpose it would toohe wouldnt have to have many halogai up there just enough to slow us to make us think we were overpowering them because of our might and then he did not want to think about and then not so soon after watching what the dromons invincible fire did to dugout canoes and men exactly so tanilis said you see you must delay the attack then until our mages devise some suitable countermeasure to abate the menace of this hold on krispos said tanilis tried to continue he shook his head at her hold on he repeated more sharply this time a couple of ideas rattled around in his head if he could bring them together he did with almost an audible click his eyes widened suppose we lit the wall first he whispered what then fatigue fell from tanilis like a discarded cloak as she surged to her feet yes by the lord with the great and good mind she and krispos hugged not so much like lovers as like conspirators who realized theyd hatched the perfect plot krispos stuck his head out of the tent geirrod came to smart attention never mind that krispos said get me mammianos and then get me kanaris drawn up in full battle array the imperial army ringed the entire landward perimeter of pliskavos horns and drums and pipes whipped the soldiers toward full martial fury the men shouted krispos name and bellowed abuse and threats at the halogai on the walls the halogai roared back crying defiance to the sky come on little men try us one shouted we make you littler still he threw his axe high in the air and caught it with a flourish siege engines bucked and snapped stones and great darts flew toward pliskavos engineers returned the machines throwing arms to their proper positions checked ropes reloaded then hauled on windlasses to tighten the cordage to the point where the engines could cast again meanwhile archers skipped forward to add their missiles to those of the catapults not many halogai were bowmen the fighting they reveled in was hand to hand those who had bows shot back a couple of videssians fell more northerners tumbled from the wall the main body of imperial troops shouted and made as if to surge toward the wall the halogai roared back krispos watched all that from the riverbank west of pliskavos it was a fine warlike display with banners flying and polished armor gleaming under the morning sun he hoped harvas found it as riveting as he did himself if all the wizards attention focused there he would pay no heed to the pair of dromons now gliding up the astris toward his town with their twin banks of oars thirty oars to a bank the war galleys reminded krispos of centipedes striding over the water such smooth motion seemed impossible as with anything else it came by dint of endless practice closer and closer to the quays at the bottom of the wall came the two dromons krispos watched the marines who were busy at their bows a few halogai watched too watched and jeered a whole fleet of dromons might have carried enough warriors to attack pliskavos from the river two were no threat aboard each vessel an officer raised his hand then let it fall the marines at the hand pumps swing their handles up and down up and down twin sheets of flame belched from the woodandbronze siphon tubes the quays caught at once black smoke shot skyward then the flames splashed against the wall for most of a minute as the marines aboard the dromons kept pumping out their incendiary mixture krispos could not tell whether tanilis had stolen the truth from harvas mind whether his own scheme could disrupt the wizards plan then the tubs of firemix went dry the fiery streams stopped pouring from the siphons the wall still burned slowly at first then quicker and quicker the flames spread the dromons backed oars to get away from a conflagration greater than any they were intended to confront the halogai atop the river wall poured buckets of water down onto the fire it kept burning kept spreading the halogai poured again with no better luck krispos saw them stare down the images of their bodies wavering through heathaze then they gave up and ran away the flames were already running as fast as a man could they burned a brilliant yellow brighter and hotter than the orangered fire that had spawned them they reached the top of the wall and threw themselves high into the air as if in play by the good god krispos whispered he sketched phos sunsign at the same time he narrowed his eyes against the growing glare from pliskavos his face heated as if he were standing in front of a fireplace so he was but several hundred yards away halogai ran all along the wail now even where the flames had not yet reached their terrified shouts rose above the crackle and hiss of the fire then the flames that had gone one way around pliskavos met those that had gone the other and there was nowhere to run anymore harvas city was a perfect ring of fire the wall itself burned with a clean almost smokeless flame before long though smoke did start rising up from inside pliskavosand no wonder krispos thought by then he had already moved back from the fire twice houses and other buildings could not move back so close to so much heat they had to ignite too kanaris came up to krispos the grand drungarios of the fleet pursed his lips in a soundless whistle as he watched pliskavos burn theres a grim sight he said as a lifelong sailing man he feared fire worse than any foe krispos remembered the fright fire had given him the winter before when wind whipped midwinters day blazes out of control all the same he said its winning our war for us would you sooner have watched our soldiers burn as they tried to storm those walls harvas intended the flames for us you know oh aye he and his deserve them kanaris answered at once and the ice theyll meet in the world to come as well but there are easier ways of dying he pointed toward the base of the wall some halogai had chosen to leap to their deaths rather than burn as is the way of such things not all had killed themselves cleanly they burned anyway most of them and had the added torment of splintered bones and crushed organs to accompany the anguish of the fire that ate their flesh the strongest and luckiest tried to crawl away from the flames toward the videssian line forgetting for a moment that they were deadly enemies imperial troopers darted out to drag two or three of them to safety healerpriests hurried up to do what they could for the halogai the fire burned on and on krispos ordered his men out of their battle line until the flames subsided they screened pliskavos better than the wall from which they sprang the soldiers watched the fire with something approaching awe they cheered krispos almost frantically whether for having raised the fire or for having saved them from it he could not tell he wondered what harvas was doing was thinking there inside his burning wall after three hundred years of unnatural life did the evil wizard have teeth left to gnash whether or no his hopes were burning with the wall a sudden savage grin twisted krispos mouth maybe harvas had even been on the wall when it went up that would be justice indeed afternoon came and evening pliskavos kept burning the sky grew dark the evening star appeared it might still have been noon in the videssian camp so brilliant was the firelight only its occasional flicker said that light was born of flames rather than the sun krispos made himself go into his tent sooner or later the flames would die when they did the army would need orders he wanted to be fresh to be sure he gave the right ones but how was he to sleep when the glow that came through the silk fabric of his tent testified to the fearful marvel outside and outside one of the guards said aye my lady hes within the haloga looked into the tent the lady tanilis would see you majesty ah good youre up and about krispos hadnt been but hearing my lady had bounced him from his cot fester than anything short of a sally out of pliskavos when tanilis came in krispos pointed to the bright light that played on the silk that victory is yours tanilis he said then he gave her the salute properly reserved for the emperor alone thou conquerest he took her in his arms and kissed her hed intended nothing more than that but she returned the kiss with a desperate intensity unlike anything hed known from her before she clung to him so tightly that he could feel her heartbeat through her robe and his she would not let him go before long all his continent intentions all his promises to control himself and his body were swept away in a tide of furious excitement that seemed as hot and fiery as pliskavos flaming wall still clutching each other he and tanilis tumbled to the cot careless of whether it broke beneath them as it nearly did quickly oh quickly she urged him not that he needed much urging the cool practiced competence she usually brought to bed was gone now leaving only desire when she arched her back beneath him and quivered at the final instant she cried out his name again and again he scarcely heard her a moment later he too cried out wordlessly as he spent himself the world apart from their stilljoined bodies returned to him little by little he leaned up on his elbows or began to but tanilis arms tightened round his back dont leave me she said dont go dont ever go her eyes scant inches from his own were huge and staring he wondered if she was truly looking at him the last time the only timehed seen eyes so wide was when gnatios met the executioner he shook his head the comparison disturbed him whats wrong he stroked her cheek she did not respond directly i wish we could do it again right now one last time she said again krispos had to laugh after that tanilis im not sure i could do it again in a week let alone right now then he frowned as he listened again in his own mind to all of what shed said what do you mean one last time now she shoved him away from her too late she whispered oh too late for everything once more krispos hardly heard her this time though it was not because of passion but rather pain agony such as he had never known filled every crevice of his body again he thought of the burning walls of pliskavos now that fire seemed to blaze within his bones to be consuming him from the inside out he tried to scream but his throat was on fire too and no sound came forth a new voice echoed in the tiny corner of his mind not given over to torment little man thinkest thou to thwart me thinkest thou thy fribbling futile mages suffice to save what i would slay aye they cost me effort but with effort cometh reward learn of my might as thou diest and despair tanilis must have heard that cold hateful voice too for she said no harvas you may not have him her tone now was as calm and matteroffact as if the wizard were in the tent with them krispos felt a tiny fragment of his anguish ease as harvas shifted his regard to tanilis be silent naked slut lest i deal with thee next deal with me if you can harvas tanilis chin went up in defiance i say you may not have this man this i have foreseen damnation to thy foreseeing and to thee harvas returned since thoudst know the wretchs body know what it suffereth now as well tanilis gasped with a great effort of will krispos turned his eyes toward her she was biting her lip to keep from crying out blood trickled from the corner of her mouth but she would not yield do your worst to me she told harvas it cannot be a tithe of the harm krispos and i worked against your wicked scheme this day harvas screamed then so loudly that for a moment krispos wondered why no guardsmen burst in to see who was slaying whom but the scream sounded only in his mind and in tanilis more torment lifted from him tanilis said here harvas as you give so shall you get let me be a mirror to reflect your gifts this is what i feel from you now harvas screamed again but in an altogether different way he was used to inflicting pain not to receiving it krispos anguish went away he thought tanilis had forced the wizard to yield simply by making him experience what he was used to handing out but when krispos glanced over at her he saw her fine features were still deathpale and twisted in torment her struggle with harvas was not yet done krispos drew in a long miraculously painfree breath he opened his mouth to shout for more wizards to come to tanilis rescue no sound emerged despite everything tanilis was doing to himeverything he was doing to himselfharvas still had the strength to enjoin silence on krispos and tanilis agreed this is between the two of us now krispos she returned her attention to her foe here harvas this is what i felt when i learned you had slain my son you should know all your gifts in full harvas howled like a wolf with its leg crushed in the jaws of a trap but he was trapper as well as victim he had endured a great deal in his sorcerously prolonged span of days though tanilis wounded him as he had never been wounded before he did not release her from agony he too felt if he could bear it longer than she victory would in the end be his krispos caught an echo of what he whispered longingly again and again to tanilis die oh die when i do may you go with me she answered i will rise to phos light while you spend eternity in the ice of your master skotos i usher in my masters dominion to the world thy phos hath failed only fools feel it not and thou hast not the power to drag me into death with thee see now tanilis whimpered on the cot beside krispos her hand reached out and clutched his forearm her nails bit into his flesh deep enough to draw blood then all at once that desperate grip went slack her eyes rolled up her chest no longer rose and fell with breath krispos knew she was dead while the link with harvas held he heard in his mind the beginning of a frightened wail but the link was abruptly cut clean as a cord swordsevered had tanilis succeeded in taking the evil wizard down to death with her if not she had to have left him hurt and weakened but the price shed paid krispos bent down to brush his lips against those that had so recently bruised his now they did not respond may you be avenged he said softly a new and bitter thought crossed his mind he wondered if shed foreseen her own doom when she set out from opsikion to join the imperial army being who and what she was she must have her behavior argued for itshed acted like someone who knew she had very little time but shed come all the same heedless of her safety krispos shook his head in wonder and renewed grief he heard rapid footsteps outside footsteps that came to a sudden stop in front of the imperial tent what do you want wizard a haloga guardsman demanded i must see his majesty zaidas answered his young light voice cracked in the middle of the sentence you must eh the guardsman did not sound impressed what you must do young sir is wait but wait the guard said implacably he raised his voice pitching it so krispos would notice it inside the tent majesty a wizard out here would have speech with you the guard did not poke his head right into the tent now not after tanilis had gone in yes he had his own ideas about what was going on in there krispos wished he was right wishing did as much good as usual no more and no less krispos slowly got to his feet ill be with you soon he called to the guard and zaidas he put on his robe then covered tanilis body with hers he straightened no help for it now let the wizard come in zaidas started to fall to his knees to prostrate himself before krispos but broke off the ritual gesture when he saw tanilis lying dead on the cot her eyes were still open staring up at nothing oh no zaidas whispered he sketched the sunsign over his heart then he looked at tanilis again this time not in shocked surprise but with the trained eye of a mage he turned to krispos harvas work he said without hesitation or doubt yes krispos voice was flat and empty lines of grief etched zaidas face in that moment krispos saw what the young man would look like when he was fifty i sensed the danger zaidas said but only the edges of it and not soon enough i see would i had been the one to lay down life for you majesty not the lady would that no one ever needed to lay down life for me krispos said as flatly as before oh aye your majesty aye zaidas stammered but the lady tanilis she wasshe wassomething someone special he scowled in frustration at the inadequacy of his words krispos remembered how zaidas had hung on everything tanilis said when the wizards gathered together remembered the worshipful look in the younger mans eye hed loved her or been infatuated with herat his age the difference was hard to know krispos remembered that too from opsikion love or infatuation zaidas had spoken only the truth someone special she was indeed krispos said harvas had cost him so many who were dear to him his sister evdokia his brotherinlaw his nieces mavros trokoundos now tanilis but tanilis had hit back hit back harder than harvas could have expected how hard now krispos voice held urgency zaidas see what you can sense of harvas for me of his plans do you mean your majesty the young mage asked in some alarm i could not probe deeply without his detecting me probing at all is no small risk not his plans krispos said quickly just see if hes there and active inside pliskavos very well your majesty i can do that safely enough i think zaidas said as youve seen even the subtlest screening techniques leave signs of their presence the more so if they screen a presence as powerful as harvas let me think we bless thee phos lord with the zaidas voice grew dreamy and far away as he repeated phos creed to focus his concentration and slide into a trance much as a healerpriest might have done but instead of laying hands on a wounded man zaidas turned toward pliskavos his eyes were wide and unblinking and seemed sightless but krispos knew they sensed more than any normal mans after a couple of minutes of turning ever so slightly this way and that as if he were a hunting dog unsure of a scent zaidas slowly came back to himself he still looked like a puzzled hound though as he said your majesty i cant find him i feel he ought to be there but its as if hes not its no screen ive ever met before i dont know what it is he did not enjoy confessing ignorance by the good god magical sir i think i know what it is its tanilis krispos told zaidas the whole story of her struggle against harvas blackrobe i think youre right your majesty zaidas said when he was through the young mage bowed to the cot on which tanilis lay as if she were a living queen either she slew harvas as she herself was slain or at the very least hurt him so badly that his torch of power is reduced to a guttering ember too small for me even to discern which means all we face in pliskavos is an army of ferocious halogai krispos said he and zaidas beamed at each other next to the prospect of battling harvas blackrobe again any number of berserk fearless axeswinging northerners seemed a stroll in the meadow by comparison xii the walls of pliskavos burned all through the night only when morning came again did the flames begin to subside smoke still rose here and there inside the town from the fires the blazing wall had started two heralds one a videssian the other from krispos force of haloga guards approached the wall as closely at its heat would allow in the imperial speech and the tongue of halogaland they called on the northerners inside pliskavos to yield the more so as the videssianspeaker put it since the evil wizard who brought you to this pass can no longer aid you krispos held his breath at that afraid in spite of everything that harvas had been laying low for reasons of his own and would now reappear with redoubled malice and might but of harvas there was no sign the halogai did not yield either the heralds called out their message again and again then withdrew to the imperial lines pliskavos remained silent smoky and enigmatic the whole day long at the officers meeting just after sunset krispos said if the walls have cooled enough by morning well send men up onto them to see whats going on in there aye mammianos said its not like the cursed northerners to keep so quiet so long theyre up to something well likely regretunless theyve all been roasted but thats too much to ask for worse luck the rest of the generals loudly and profanely agreed with him then bagradas raised his wine cup and said lets drink to the brave lady tanilis who made sure they were the ones who roasted rather than us and who made harvas choke on his own bile tanilis the officers shouted out her name krispos spoke it with the rest of them and drank with them as well the meeting broke up soon afterward the soldiers filed out of the imperial tent leaving him alone he sat down on the edge of the cot he shook his head the night before tanilis and he had shared the cot first in triumph then in terror now she was dead and bagradas wellmeaning toast did not could not begin to do justice to what shed accomplished zaidas understood far more krispos wondered how much he understood himself too much had happened too fasthis emotions were still several jumps behind events instead of victorious or full of grief he mostly felt battered as if hed gone through rapids without a boat he drained his cup then poured another and drained that then he set down the jar of wine tanilis would have wanted him to stop he thought hed need a clear head come morning he undressed and lay down where he had lain with tanilis the scent of her still clung to the blanket tears filled his eyes he angrily brushed them aside tears were no fit monument for tanilis finishing what shed made possible was he did his best to sleep majesty a haloga guard boomed theres stirring inside pliskavos majesty krispos woke with a grunt a guttering lamp gave the tent all the light it had the sun was not yet up ill be out soon he called he got out of bed used the chamber pot and put on his gilded coat of mail he saw the eastern sky had turned gray whats toward he asked the guardsman that we dont yet know majesty but through the grates of the portcullises some scouts have spied the warriors within pliskavos milling about come the dawn well have a better notion of why true enough krispos said wed best be ready for the worst though night or day a detachment of military musicians remained on duty krispos went over to them call the men from their tents and to assembly as the martial music rang out he hurried up to the palisade to see what was going on for himself as the guard had said no one could tell just what was going on in pliskavos but something definitely was the wooden gates had been burned to ashes when the wall caught fire but the portcullises iron grills survived through the grillwork krispos saw shadowy motion he could not make out more than that even as twilight brightened toward dawn behind him noise quickly built as the imperial army readied itself for whatever might come men called back and forth underofficers shouted swords and quivers and armor rattled horses snorted and complained as troopers tightened girths through it all the musicians kept playing their music got louder too as more of them came on duty the sun rose krispos sketched phos circle over his heart as he murmured the creed it was also on other mens lips as they caught the days first sight of the chiefest symbol of the good god mammianos came up to krispos he said if they are going to try to break out your majesty do you want to meet them behind the palisade or before it if everything goes well meeting them behind the palisade would be cheapest krispos mused but wed be stretched all along the line around pliskavos and they might well rush their men at one point and smash their way through us he rubbed his chin i hate to say it but i think we have to meet them face to face what do you say mammianos i halfway hope you can talk me out of it the fat general grunted far from happily no i fear you have the right of it your majesty i was hoping you could talk me round to the other way but you see the same dangers i do he grunted again ill pass on the word then thank you eminent sir the musicians calls changed from assembly to battle stations officers orders amplified the music no not behind the rampart lads today were going to let them see what theyll be tangling with if they have the stones for it krispos made his own way back through the crowd to the imperial tent as hed expected progress was saddled and waiting for him he checked the straps under the saddle for tightness then swung his left foot into the stirrup climbing onto progress reminded him how mavros had helped him choose the big bay gelding and helped haggle the price down too one more win foster brother of mineone more win and you and your mother are both avenged he said softly he rode out through a gap in the palisade and took his place at the center of the imperial army that was rapidly forming up in front of pliskavos he thought about sending his heralds up to the town to call once more for the halogai to surrender but decided not to soon enough the northerners would show what they intended to do the thought had hardly crossed his mind when the portcullises began to rise they did not move smoothly one indeed warped by the heat of the burning wall stuck in its track with its spiked lower edge about four feet off the ground that did not keep hundreds of armed halogai from ducking under it as they filed out of pliskavos more of the big blond warriors came through other gates they dont look like men about to yield mammianos said no they dont krispos agreed glumly the leading ranks of halogai carried big shields that protected them almost from head to foot behind that shield wallalmost a palisade in itselfthe rest of the northerners began to deploy krispos swore if we had all our men in place we could break them before they got set up themselves he scowled at the halogai by the good god lets hit them anyway with us mounted we can choose when and where the attack goes in aye majesty mammianos opened his mouth to shout orders then stopped staring in amazement at one of the gates where the portcullis had gone all the way up krispos followed his gaze he started too a company of halogai on horseback was coming out i didnt think any of them were riders he said i didnt either mammianos made a noise half cough half chuckle by the look of them they arent too sure themselves the halogai were on kubrati ponies the only sort of horses they could have found inside pliskavos some of the blond warriors so outmatched their mounts in size that their feet almost brushed the ground they brandished swords and axes as they formed a ragged line from his own experience in the courtyard of the high temple krispos knew a footsoldiers axe was no proper weapon for a cavalryman they do try to learn new things dont they mammianos said in a thoughtful tone that makes them more dangerous or rather dangerous in a different sort of way than say the makuraners who do what they do very well but always in the same old way if they want to learn lets see that they pay for their first lesson krispos turned to a courier order bagradas to send one of his companies out into the ground between our army and the barbarians well find out what sort of riders they are the courier grinned nastily as he hurried away bagradas troopers a band of archers and lancers about equal in numbers to the mounted halogai rode into the nomansland there they stopped and waited after a moment the halogai understood the challenge they yelled and spurred their horses toward the imperials the videssians also raised a shout they urged their horses forward too the archers used their knees to control their mounts as they let fly again and again a couple of halogai fell from the saddle more ponies were wounded and went bounding out of the fight beyond the ability of their inexperienced riders to control but the archers could account for only so many of their foes before the two companies came together then it was the lancers turn their long spears gave them far greater reach than the northerners they spitted halogai out of the saddle without getting close enough for their foes to strike back the imperials had also mastered the art of fighting as a unit rather than man by man the halogai fought that way afoot but had never practiced it on horseback as krispos had been sure they would they paid dearly for instruction finally however brave they were the halogai could bear no more they wheeled their horses and fled for the protection of their comrades on foot the imperials pursued the archers accounted for several more men before they and their comrades turned about and rode back to their own lines the videssians cheered thunderously the halogai with nothing to cheer about advanced on the imperial army in grim silence they must be getting desperate to challenge us mounted when they can barely stay on their horses mammianos observed our cavalrys beaten them again and again first south of the mountains and now up here krispos answered if they are desperate weve made them that way and now remember they dont have harvas to help them any more i hope they dont he added to himself aye thats so mammianos cocked his head to one side from what i hear we have the lady tanilis and you to thank for it your majesty give the lady the credit krispos said firmly if it had just been me youd be looking for a new emperor right now or more likely in too much trouble to worry about finding one companies of horse archers cantered forward to pour arrows into the oncoming halogai they could not miss such a bunched target but did less damage than krispos had hoped the first ranks of northerners had those headtofoot shields the men behind them raised their round wooden bucklers high to turn aside the shafts some got through but not enough inexorable as the tide the halogai tramped forward the videssian archers withdrew into the protection of their line the musicians sounded the charge lancers couched spears dug spurs into horses flanks slowly at first then faster and fester they rumbled toward the halogai this isnt going to be pretty mammianos shouted over the thunder of hoofbeats so long as it works krispos shouted back the two lines collided then videssian horsemen spitted northerners using their mounts to bowl over and ride down others unlike the cavalry fight they did not have it all their own way not for a moment at close quarters the axes of the halogai hewed down men and horses alike those big swift strokes bit through mail shirts to hack flesh and split bones the battle line did not move twenty yards forward or back for some time halogai pressed forward as their comrades were killed they blunted charge after charge by fresh troops of lancers each side dragged its wounded to safety as best it could dead horses and soldiers hindered the living from reaching one another to slay some more shouts of alarm rose from the far right as the northerners borrowing from the videssian book tried to slide round the imperial armys flank after a few tense minutes a messenger reported to krispos weve held em majesty looks like a good many bowmen had to pull out their sabers before we managed it though thats why they carry them krispos answered the imperials shouted his name over and over they also had another cry one calculated to unnerve the halogai wheres harvas blackrobe the northerners were not using the wizards name as their war cry when they shouted they most often called the name svenkel krispos learned soon enough who svenkel was an enormous haloga tall even for that big breed swung an axe that would have impressed the imperial headsman no one came within its length of him and lived after he felled a videssian with a stroke that caved in the luckless fellows chest all the northerners who saw cried out his name he had presence as well as strength and warriors skill before he went back to battle he waved to show he heard the cheers shall we send one of our champions against him mammianos asked why risk a champion krispos said enough arrows will take care of him give the archers word to shoot at him till he goes down thats not sporting mammianos said with a laugh but its the right way to go about war lets just see how long svenkel the hero lasts but along with being a warrior bold even by haloga standards svenkel the hero was far from a fool when three or four arrows in quick succession pincushioned his shield and another glanced off his helm he knew he was a marked man instead of drawing back among his comrades as most might have done he led a wedge of northerners into the center of the imperial line against his countrymen who warded krispos they were axemen like himself when they tried to slay him he could strike back the imperial guards had seen hard fighting in all the clashes since the campaign began south of imbros the halogai who were hale still fought as fiercely as ever but their ranks had been thinned svenkels wedge punched deep if it broke through it would cut the imperial army in half krispos drew his saber he looked at mammianos the fat general also had his sword out he shrugged ah well your majesty sometimes we have to be sporting whether we want to or not so we do krispos raised his voice and cried videssos he spurred progress toward the sagging line of guardsmen mammianos rode with him so did the couriers who had congregated around them by then only a handful of halogai in imperial service stood in svenkels way he must have seen victory just ahead his mouth flew open in a great snarl when horsemen rode up to aid the guards then he realized who led the makeshift band in videssian he shouted to krispos leader to leader then it didnt quite work that way war was too chaotic a business to conform to anyones expectations even a heros krispos got into the battle a few feet to svenkels right against a haloga almost as big as the northern chieftain the fellow swung up his axe to chop at progress before he could krispos slashed at his face he missed but made the haloga shift his weight backward so his own stroke fell short krispos slashed again this time he felt his blade bite the haloga howled and reeled away clutching a forearm gashed to the bone seeing krispos in the fight made his surviving guardsmen redouble their efforts svenkels men still battled for all they were worth but could push forward no farther the guards threw themselves at svenkel one after another one after another he beat them back his strokes never faltered he might have been a siege engine himself powered by twisted cords rather than flesh and sinew as the guardsmen sought to cut down svenkel so his warriors went for krispos krispos fought desperately trying for nothing more than staying alive he knew he was no great master of the soldiers art and was very glad when geirrod came up to stand by progress right flank and help him beat back the foe step by step some of svenkels men began to give ground others stubborn with the peculiar haloga stubbornness preferred dying where they stood to falling back die they did one after another along with the imperial guardsmen and videssian troopers they slew before they went down there at the forefront of the fighting what scholarly chroniclers would later call a line hardly deserved such a dignified name it was more like knots of grunting cursing sweating bleeding men all entangled with one another krispos struck and struck and struckand knew most of his strokes were useless either because they clove only air or because they rebounded from mail he did not much mind no one in that crush could have hoped to do better then he saw a haloga close by swing up an axe to chop at one of the guardsmen he lashed out with his saber it cut deep into the northerners wrist the axe flew from his hand the haloga bellowed in pain and whirled around krispos was startled to see it was svenkel svenkel looked startled too but was neither too startled nor too badly hurt to raise his shield before krispos could cut at him again but that did not save him for long geirrods axe bit into the shield once twice on the third blow the round slab of wood split in two geirrod struck once more blood sprayed svenkels armor clattered as he fell the imperials raised a great cheer the halogai still fought ferociously but something at last went out of them with their chieftains death now the fighters in the wedge that had been his drew back more quickly as they did so geirrod turned to krispos and said out of the line for you now majesty you did what was needful well go on from here krispos was not sorry to obey hed never been an eager warrior hed also learned that the emperor like any other highranking officer usually was more useful directing the fighting than caught in the thick of it he looked round for mammianos and was relieved to see the general had also got out of the press but mammianos had not come through unscathed he bared his teeth in a grimace of pain as he awkwardly tried to tie a strip of cloth around his right forearm the cloth was soaked with red here let me help you krispos said sheathing his saber i have two free hands thank you your majesty aye get it good and tight there that should do it the fat general shook his head im lucky its not a bloody stump i suppose been too long since i last tried trading handstrokes what was it you said sometimes we have to be sporting but troopers not your proper trade anymore too right it isnt and a good thing else id long since be dead mammianos grimaced as is this arms the only thing thats killing me shouts rang out far off at the end of the imperial armys left wing krispos and mammianos both stared in that direction for the moment that was all they could dotheir couriers were still battling to drive back svenkels men some of the shouts were full of excitement others of dismay from several hundred yards off krispos could not tell which came from the halogai which from the imperials he kept his neck craned leftward fearing above all else to see the videssians driven back in rout he saw no soldiers fleeing on horseback which he took as a good sign all the same he fidgeted atop progress for the next several minutes until at last a rider came galloping his way from the left the horsemans grin told him most of what he needed to know before the fellow began to speak majesty weve flanked them sarkis got his scouts round their right and now were rolling em up the good god be praised krispos said thats what i most wanted to hear go back there and tell all the officers on that wing to pour as many men after sarkis as they can spare without thinning their line too much majesty theyre already doing it the messenger said theyre good soldiers most of them mammianos put in the riders news banished pain from his face a good soldier doesnt wait for orders when he sees a chance like that he just ups and grabs it its all right with me krispos said his grin stretched wider than the one the messenger was wearing in fact its better than all right faster even than hed dared hope the haloga right came to pieces the northerners faced a cruel dilemma if they turned at bay and formed an embattled circle nothing would keep the videssians from simply riding into pliskavos but if they fell back toward the gates they risked fresh breakthroughs as the imperials probed flimsy makeshift lines some turned at bay some fell back the videssians did break through repeatedly forcing more and more halogai to make the unpalatable choice sarkis could easily have seized pliskavos instead with even deadlier instinct he urged his menand the other imperials in their wakeall around the rear of the haloga army krispos traced their progress by the panicfilled yells that rose first from the northerners shattered right then the center and then their leftthe imperial right a few minutes later the imperials on the right yelled too in triumph by the lord with the great and good mind theyre in the sack mammianos said now we slaughter them he did not sound as if he took any great joy in the prospect merely as if it was a job that needed doing the imperial headsman plied his trade in that matteroffact deadly fashion the videssian army went about its business the same way methodically using bows lances and sabers against the northerners as mammianos had said it was a slaughter then all the halogai suddenly turned round and rushed against the videssians who stood between them and pliskavos that part of the imperial line remained thinner than the rest shouting wildly the northerners hacked their way through after them krispos yelled quite without orders the musicians played charge they were soldiers too and out to grab the chance the videssians surged forward in pursuit of their fleeing foes here and there a haloga stood and fought those who did were beset by several men at once and quickly fell many more were cut down or speared from behind and more than one rather than dying at the imperials hands or doffing his helm in token of surrender plunged a sword into his own belly or a knife between his ribs the way the northerners so deliberately killed themselves chilled krispos why do they do that he asked geirrod we halogai we think that if a man be slain by an enemy he serves him in the world to come the guardsman answered some of us we would liefer live free after we die if you take my meaning majesty i suppose i do krispos sketched the sunsign over his heart he wished the halogai could be persuaded to follow phos every so often zealous priests went to preach the good gods doctrines in halogaland if they were fearless men the northerners generally let them live but they won few converts the halogai stubbornly clung to their false gods such reflections ran through his mind and then were gone lost in the chase now he wished sarkis had sent men to secure pliskavos gates a few videssians made for them but the rush of halogai overwhelmed the riders the big blond men streamed into the town more turned at bay to give their comrades the chance to save themselves krispos swore if we had ladders ready we could storm the place it would fall at the first rush aye likely so your majesty mammianos said but ladders arent of much use in a pitched battle which is what we were set to fight this isnt one of those minstrels romances where the bold hero always thinks of everything ahead of time if it were i wouldnt have this he held up his bandaged arm the imperials charged again and again at the haloga rearguards then some of the northerners gained the walls of pliskavos and began shooting at their foes and pelting them with stones under the cover of that barrage most of the halogai managed to withdraw into the city portcullises slammed down in the videssians faces only when the fighting finally died away did krispos notice how far toward the east his shadow stretched the sun was nearly set he looked over the battlefield and shook his head in wonder softly he said how many halogai are down thats the way of it when one side breaks mammianos said remember agapetos and mavros paid in this coin for us i remember krispos said oh yes i remember the videssians ranged over the field they dragged and carried their wounded countrymen back to their healerpriests most of the halogai not yet dead got shorter shrift somethose who had been seen to fight with special bravery and those who looked rich enough to be worth ransomingwere spared horse leeches went here and there doing what they could for injured animals other soldiers went here and there too plundering the dead piles of haloga shields too big and bulky to be of use to horsemen grew and grew krispos saw so many that he ordered a count made to give him some idea of how many northerners had fallen he also wondered what his horsemen would do with the war axes and heavy swords they were happily taking away some will be inlaid with gold and so worth something geirrod said when he spoke that thought aloud as for the others well majesty even you southrons deem it worth recalling that you overcame brave men krispos had to nod burial parties began their worka pit that would make a mass grave for the fallen halogai individual resting places for the far smaller number of videssians who had died krispos told the soldiers to dig a special grave for tanilis apart from all the others set a wooden marker over it for now he said when this land is ours and peaceful once more the finest marble will be none too good for her the men counting northern shields came to him with their total over twelve thousand he knew fewer halogai than that had died some would have discarded their shields to flee the fester it was still a great total especially when set against imperial losses which were under two thousand that evenings as the army rested in camp krispos went to see some of the haloga prisoners archers stood guard over them as they dejectedly sat around in their linen drawers and undertimestheir armor was already booty they stirred with interest as he approached some of them glowered at their countrymen who guarded him he ignored that announcing i need a man who understands videssian to listen to my words and take them to your comrades in pliskavos who will do this for me several northerners raised their hands he chose a solidlooking fellow with gray mixed in his golden hair and beard he asked the man what is your name i am soribulf videssian emperor the haloga said politely but without the elaborate respect imperials used well soribulf tell this to your chiefs in pliskavos if they yield the city and set free any videssian prisoners they are holding i will let them cross to the north shore of the astris without ordering my fleet to burn their boats we are the halogai soribulf said drawing himself up proudly we do not yield if we werent already burying them you could see all the haloga corpses on todays field krispos said if you dont yield every one of you inside pliskavos will die too do you think we cant take the town with our siege engines and our ships that shoot fire soribulfs mouth puckered as if he were chewing on something sour how do we trust you not to burn us even so when we are on the water and cannot ward ourselves my word is good krispos said better than that of the evil mage you followed aye you speak truth there videssian emperor he told us you would burn with the wall but our warriors were the ones the bright blaze bit and then after he helped us no more some say he fled i know not the truth of that but we saw none of him today when swords struck pass on what i say then and my warning krispos urged soribulf swayed back and forth he mourns a guardsman whispered to krispos soribulf spoke in his own language the guard translated the glory of haloga arms is dead will we now yield ingloriously to videssos and travel back to our homeland in defeat never have we done sobraver to conquer or die die you will if you fight on krispos said shall i choose someone else as my messenger no soribulf returned to the imperial speech i will bear your words to my people whether they choose to hear i could not guess krispos nodded to a couple of the archers who guarded the haloga prisoners you men take him to the rampart and let him go to pliskavos he turned back to soribulf if your chiefs are willing to speak of yielding tell them to show a whitepainted shield above the central gate first thing tomorrow morning i shall tell them soribulf said the guards led him away krispos sent an order to kanaris the grand drungarios of the fleet to have his dromons sailing back and forth on the astris by dawn as a warning that the trapped northerners had no way out unless the imperials granted it to them then while the rest of the army celebrated the great victory they had won krispos went to bed when he woke the next morning he looked to the walls of pliskavos halogai marched along them but he saw no truce shield glowering he ordered the engineers to ready their dartshooters and stonethrowers dont make any secret of what youre doing either he told them the halogai watched from the walls as the artisans ostentatiously checked the ropes and timbers of their engines made sure they had plenty of stones and sheaves of outsized arrows close at hand and squinted toward pliskavos as if checking range and aim for the catapults dew was still damp on the grass when a shield went up over the gate well well krispos let out a long sigh of relief even without magic used against his men storming the town would have been desperately expensive have progress saddled up for me he said to his guardsmen ill parley with their chief not alone the guards said in one voice if the foe sallies i hadnt intended to go out there alone krispos answered mildly not for fear of treachery and not for my dignitys sake either he approached pliskavos in the midst of a full company of haloga guards another company this one of videssian horsearchers flanked the guards on either side the horsemen had arrows nocked and ready in their bows he reined in about a hundred feet from the wall who will speak with me he called a haloga stood atop one of the low stretches of battlement i am ikmor he called back those inside will obey me his videssian was good a moment later he explained why years ago in my youth i served in the city as guard to the avtokrator rhaptes i learned your speech then you served anthimos father eh good enough krispos said soribulf brought you my terms will you take them or will you go on with a fight you cannot win you are a hard man videssian emperor harder than rhaptes who was ikmor answered i grieved the whole night long at the ruin of our grand army struggling with my spirit over whether to yield or battle on but i saw in the end that i must give over though it is bitter as wormwood to me yet a war leader must not surrender to sorrow but try in every way to save the lives of the warriors under him spoken like a wise man krispos said spoken like a man who indeed spent time in videssos he thought a haloga fresh from his native land would have been unlikely to take such a long view spoken like a man who finds himself without choice ikmor answered bleakly to show i am in earnest i will send out the captives from your people whom we hold the haloga chieftain turned shouting in his own language the portcullis beneath him creaked up one by one darkhaired men came through the gateway most of them in rags many pale and thin as only longtime prisoners become some rubbed at their eyes as if unused to sunlight when they saw the imperial banner that floated above krispos head they cheered and pelted toward him his own eyes filled with tears he called to the officer who led the cavalry company take them back to our camp feed them get clothes for them have the healerpriests check them too those who arent too worn from work with our wounded the captain saluted and told off a squad to take charge of the newly released videssians no sooner was the last imperial out of pliskavos than the portcullis slammed down again ikmor said videssian emperor if we come out ourselves how do we know you will not treat us as as he hesitated but had to say it as we treated imbros do you not trust my pledge krispos said not in this ikmor answered at once after a moments anger krispos reluctantly saw his point having done deeds that deserved retribution no wonder the halogai feared it ikmor went on let us come forth in arms and armor to ward ourselves at need no krispos said you could start the battle over then looking to take us by surprise he stroked his beard as he thought hows this haloga chief wear your swords and axes if you will but leave shields behind and carry your mail shirts as part of your baggage rolled up on your backs it was ikmors turn to ponder at last he said let it be as you will we shall need our weapons against the khamorth nomads as we trek north over the plains to halogaland with luck krispos thought the nomads would take a good bite out of the halogai before they made it back to their own cold country that might them think twice about moving south against videssos again come to that he might help luck along aloud he said one other thing brave ikmor what would you videssian emperor when you northerners come out of pliskavos you will all come through this same gate through which you let out your videssian prisoners i want to post wizards there to make sure harvas blackrobe doesnt sneak out among you ikmors laugh was unkind then you should have checked the captives too eh krispos ground his teeththe haloga chieftain was right ikmor continued but we will do as you say once more though for our own sake rather than yours if you do find harvas let our axes drink his blood for he betrayed us he spoke in his own tongue to the men on the wall with him they growled and hefted their weapons in a way that left no doubt of what they thought of harvas krispos said if you love him so well why didnt you turn on him before before videssian emperor he led us to victory and helped us settle this fine new land even a war leader with the soul of a carrion crow will hold his followers thus ikmor said but when his fires turned against his own folk when after that he vanished from our ken instead of staying to battle on as a true man would he showed us he had not even a carrion crow inside himself only the splattered white turd one leaves behind after it has fed and flown on some of the halogai on the wallthe ones who followed videssian krispos supposednodded vigorously so did some of the soldiers with krispos impressed by ikmors ability to revile without actually cursing if you agree ikmor we will bring the wizards into place tomorrow krispos said no give us four days time ikmor answered we will use timber from the town to knock together rafts and go out through the river gates to put them at the quays if you try to escape on them before the day we agreed to the dromons will burn you krispos warned we have seen the fire they fling the fire they spit we will hold to these terms videssian emperor good enough krispos gave ikmor a videssian salute clenched fist over his heart he was not surprised to see the haloga return it as quickly as ceremony permitted or maybe a little quicker he withdrew to the camp the first thing he did there was to summon zaidas by the time he was done talking the young mages face mirrored the concern he knew his own showed aye your majesty ill attend to it directly zaidas said it would be a dreadful blow if harvas the accursed profited thus from the misery of our own people but if he is among them i shall sniff him out the picture of determination he started away from the imperial tent take a squad of soldiers in case you need to do more than sniff krispos called after him zaidas did not turn around but waved to show he had heard krispos spent the rest of the day worrying half afraid he would hear of trouble from where the liberated videssians sat and ate and talked and marveled at being free half afraid he wouldnt because harvas had managed to outfox zaidas but toward sunset zaidas reported he is not among those who are there your majesty on that i would take oath by the lord with the great and good mind if no other captives came from pliskavos we may rest easy the officers and men who have dealt with them believe them to be all the ones the halogai released the good god be praised krispos said he could not be perfectly sure harvas hadnt been among the freed captives but the older he got the less he was perfectly sure of anything with a nod toward zaidas he said ready yourself and your comrades to study the haloga when they leave pliskavos we shall be fully prepared zaidas promised harvas hale could hope to stand against us harvas as he is after the lady tanilis smote him his voice softened as he spoke her name but his eyes flashed is small beer as the saying goes if he is there we will smoke him out good krispos was not usually vindictive but he wanted to lay hands on harvas to make him suffer for all the suffering he had inflicted on videssos then he remembered a saying himself to make rabbit stew first catch a rabbit the halogai inside pliskavos gave no sign of breaking the terms to which ikmor had agreed kanaris brought word that the northerners really were building rafts all the same krispos held off sending word of his victory south to the city once hed caught his rabbitor in this case seen it across the astris would be time enough on the fourth morning he ordered his army to advance on pliskavos the soldiers came fully armed and ready for battle he had strong forces covering each gate not merely the one through which ikmor had promised the halogai would march mammianos nodded at that if we show em were set for everything theyre less likely to try anything zaidas and the rest of the wizards took their place outside the central gate they waved to krispos to show they were ready he peered into the town through the grid of the portcullis a lot of men looked to be lined up there then the portcullis rose screeching in its track every inch of the way one man came through alone he tramped past the videssian mages without sparing them a glance and made straight for the imperial banner he saluted krispos i am ikmor for my folk i stand before you do as you will with me if we play you false go with your people krispos said i did not ask this of you i know that i give it to you for my honors sake i shall stay krispos had learned better than to argue about a halogas prickly sense of honor as you will northern sir he undid his canteen swigged and passed it to ikmor share wine with me aye ikmor drank a couple of drops splashed on his white tunic which was already none too clean the haloga was a wellmade man of middle height snubnosed and grayeyed he was bald on top of his head but let the hair above his ears grow long his mustaches were also long though the rest of his beard was rather thin in each ear he wore a thick gold ring set with pearlsiakovitzes would have wanted a pair of them krispos thought irrelevantly when he handed the canteen back to krispos it was empty the halogai filed out of pliskavos a few at a time walking between zaidas and the other wizards most of the northerners made ikmor seem immaculate by comparison more than a few showed the marks of burns from when the wall caught fire wounds from the latest battle or both they glared at the imperials who had overcome them as if they still could not believe the campaign had gone against them looking at them krispos also wondered how hed won the halogai were big fierce men who might have been specially made for war fighting came less naturally to videssians in the end though trained skill had overcome ferocity mammianos was thinking along similar lines he remarked they want another chance at us you can see it in their eyes they wont have such an easy time trying again krispos answered now that we rule all the way up to the astris again i expect well keep a flotilla of dromons patrolling the river i wouldnt want to try crossing it in the face of them he spoke as much to ikmor as to mammianos out of the corner of his eye he saw the haloga chiefs mouth turn down the message had got through then a few minutes later a warrior broke ranks and strode toward krispos he touched his sword his guardsmen tensed readying themselves to cut the fellow down but he paused at a safe distance and spoke loudly in his own language krispos glanced at ikmor what does he say ikmor looked even less happy he wants to take service with you videssian emperor what why ikmor spoke to the haloga then listened to his reply he says his name is odd the son of aki and that he will only fight among the best soldiers in the world till now he thought those were his own people but you have beaten us so he must have been wrong for that ill find him a place krispos said grinning ikmor translated odd the son of aki dipped his head to krispos then stepped aside a videssian officer took charge of him as the day went on more halogai broke ranks and asked leave to join the imperial army most of them gave the same reason odd had by the time the last northerner filed out of pliskavos krispos found he had recruited a goodsized company ikmor turned his back on the men who had gone over the halogai marched around pliskavos toward the quays more evidence of imperial might awaited them there kanaris warships holding their place against the current of the astris like so many sparrowhawks hovering above a mousehole krispos rode progress up toward the riverbank so he could watch the northerners embark on their rafts ikmor paced alongside him though two guardsmen made sure they were between the chieftain and the avtokrator at all times the halogai paddled the first raft out onto the astris a little past noon a dromon shadowed it all the way across the river the fearsome siphon tube pointing straight at it the wallowing raft was completely at the dromons mercy no one haloga or imperial could doubt it more than anything else that first river crossing brought home who had won and who had lost more and more rafts set out not all of them enjoyed the attentions of a dromon all the way across the astris but the warships stayed close enough to leave no question of what they could do at need destroying the northerners dugout canoes had been an unequal struggle attacking the rafts would have been a massacre zaidas made his way through the crowd to krispos all the halogai passed before me your majesty i found no sign of harvas presence go rest then krispos told him the young mage had always been reedy now he was a thin reed indeed even so he tried to protest i ought to go into the town to see whether the evil wizard still lurks within he weakened his own words with an enormous yawn the shape youre in youre likelier to fall asleep than find him krispos said ill keep wizards posted at each gate if hes in there he wont get out he did his best to look stern and imperial it probably wasnt a very good best zaidas winked at him but the mage went back toward the camp which was what krispos had in mind the rafts the halogai had built carried only a fraction of them over the astris that first day the northerners who were left behind spread their bedrolls outside of pliskavos the countrymens campfires blazed from the far shore between the two groups up and down up and down along the river the dromons of the imperial fleet prowled all night long videssian archers stood guard through the night on the southern bank of the astris alert in case the halogai proved treacherous but most of the imperial army returned to the camp on the other side of the palisade at the officers meeting that evening sarkis gave krispos a sly look may i read your mind majesty go ahead krispos told him youre wishing a nice big band of khamorth would pitch into the halogai on their way north and finish the job we started who me as he tried to look imperial to zaidas now krispos tried to look innocent that would be a terrible fate to wish on a foe weve just made peace with aye so it would majesty sarkis eyes twinkled but didnt i see you send a couple of men with horses to the north shore of the astris unless theyre going to keep the northerners company on their way back to halogaland theyre probably up there to talk with one of the local khamorth khagans with more than one krispos admitted one of the local clan leaders by himself wouldnt have enough men to risk tangling with such a big haloga army three or four together might in hopes of getting gold from us for the favor id sooner spend gold than soldiers weve spent enough soldiers against the halogai a low mutter of approval ran through the officers bagradas turned to krispos and said your majesty you are truly what an avtokrator of the videssians should be the rest of the commanders solemnly nodded krispos felt himself swell with pride sarkis asked what would you have done had ikmor made you pledge not to send envoys to the khamorth i would have kept my word krispos answered but since he didnt think of it i saw no reason to bring it up myself aye a videssian indeed sarkis murmured reminding krispos that the scout commander sprang from vaspurakan a moment later sarkis softened his words no blame to you though majesty not after what the northerners have done to videssos theyve earned whatever they catch again the officers nodded and called out many with fierce eagerness but krispos asked whatever they catch what of imbros abrupt silence fell inside the imperial tent krispos was relieved to hear it no one who preferred phos to skotos could feel easy about imagining imbros fate for any group no matter what its crimes and he was glad none of his officers thirsted so much for revenge as to forget it zaidas seemed much more his old self when morning came along with several other wizards he entered pliskavos to continue the search for harvas blackrobe a substantial armed band went along to guard them the halogai were out of pliskavos and in the process of crossing the astris but some of the folk who had lived there before harvas before the halogai still remained the guard party would have been smaller had krispos not decided to go into pliskavos with the mages not only did he want to be in at the kill if harvas was captured he also wanted to see what would be needed to restore the town to a provincial capital after its occupation first by the kubratoi for centuries and then by the evil wizard and the northerners his first horrified thought was that everything inside the fortifications should be torched to cleanse the place and start again the fires that had spread from the burning wall had done some of that but not enough halfburned wooden buildings were everywhere along with the stenches of stale smoke and of burned and rotting flesh once or twice heads peeked out of ruins to eye the newcomers krispos saw more than one glint of weapons in the shadows and was glad for his armed escort this was once a videssian town of note he said shaking his head i cant believe it its true your majesty zaidas pointed see that stone building and that one and whats left of that one over there youll find the same sort of work in videssos the city and the streets or some of them still keep to the square grid pattern we usually use you know town planning as well as wizardry krispos asked zaidas flushed my older brother is a builder if he serves his craft as well as you do yours hell be one of the best krispos said which made the young mage turn pink all over again as they rode on toward the center of town they came across more and more stretches of unburned buildings now people did emerge to stare some were of kubrati blood stocky the men heavily bearded others slimmer their features more sharply sculpted could have been poor videssians by the look of them they all watched soldiers wizards and emperor as if wondering what fresh misfortunes these newcomers would bring down on them how will you sniff out harvas from among them and from among others who may be hiding krispos asked zaidas i will have to ride through the whole of pliskavos i think the wizard answered i know the reek of his magic and i know the blankness with which he seeks to disguise it to detect either i will have to be close to it for thanks to the lady tanilis his power is less than a shadow of what it once was if he is here at all krispos added aye your majesty if he is here at all in a park in the heart of pliskavos stood an ornately carved wooden palace the former residence of the khagans of kubrat a new carving was set above the doorway twin threepronged lightning flashes zaidas finger stabbed toward them that is skotos mark he sketched phos suncircle so did krispos harvas laired here then he asked harvas once laired here zaidas agreed be thankful you cannot feel the effluvium of his past power he grew thoughtful i wonder if now he seeks to hide there hoping no one will notice his present small bad odor in the great stench of the past we must closely examine that building one of the other videssian mages a stout middleage man named gepas stirred in the saddle and said do pray remember were not your servants zaidas are you the empires servants gepas krispos asked sharply the wizard stared startled his eyes fell he nodded good krispos said for a moment there i wondered do you deny that zaidas speaks good sense or do you just wish youd spoken before he did does harvas palace need looking at or not it does your majesty gepas admitted then lets look at it krispos urged progress forward and tied the horse at the rail in front of the palace neither his guards nor the mages would hear of his going in first hed wondered if the doors would be locked but they opened at the guards touch zaidas turned to gepas with unaffected politeness the young wizard asked sir would it please you to stand guard here at the doorway to ensure that harvas cannot sneak past you better youngling gepas puffed out his chest and pulled in his belly his voice got deeper aye ill do that he shant escape by this road good zaidas face was perfectly straight krispos had to work to keep his the same way he wondered whether zaidas was a natural innocent or a schemer subtle beyond his years either way he got results wizards fanned out through the wooden palace krispos stayed with zaidas the guards naturally stayed with him together they made their way into the hall that was krispos supposed the equivalent of the grand courtroom back at the capital he pointed to the white throne that stood out against the gloom at the far end is that ivory like the patriarchs throne zaidas studied it murmuring briefly to himself his large larynx worked itsbone he said at last just then krispos saw skotos symbol on the wall above the high seat he decided not to ask what sort of bone the hall held a sour metallic smell without much enthusiasm krispos walked down the hard dirt aisleway toward the throne a few feet in front of it his boot heels sank into a soggy spot the smell got worse thats blood he said hoping zaidas would contradict him zaidas didnt he said we already knew harvas practiced abominations we also know now that he is not in this hall which was our purpose in coming here lets go on to see where he may be yes lets krispos said in a small voice admiring the young mages ability to stay calm in the face of horror to the left of the bone throne was a door in the twilight that filled the hall with all torches dark its outline was invisible until one came right up to it again krispos guards would not let him go in first one of them tugged at the latch the door did not open the guardsman used his axe with a will moments later he tried the door again this time he easily palled it open when he did he and everyone else in the hall drew back a pace or more than a pace for darkness seemed to well out toward them krispos hand shaped the suncircle loudly and clearly zaidas declared we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor the spreading darkness faded krispos wondered if it had really been there even after it was gone the open doorway remained black and forbidding he glanced toward zaidas the young wizard licked his lips and seemed to gather his courage then he strode into the room remembering trokoundos krispos started to shout for him to come back but zaidas said ah as i thought with such scholarly satisfaction that krispos knew hed come to no harm the mage went on it is a shrine dedicated to skotos they speak of them at the sorcerers collegium but id never seen one before krispos had never seen one either or wanted to see one but his pride would not let him stay back while zaidas was inside he was glad to have his guardsmen form up around him they went into the small room together the hall of the throne had been dark even so his eyes needed a minute or so to adapt to the deeper shadow inside as the eye went to the altar in one of phos temples so it did here indeed this altar at first glance resembled one from a templenot surprising krispos supposed since harvas the evil mage the apostate had in his earlier days been rhavas the prelate of skopentzana but no altar dedicated to phos would have had knives lying on it one of phos temples would have been full of icons holy images of the good god and his work in the world as krispos vision adapted to the gloom he saw icons on the wall above the altar here too he saw the dark god wreathed in blackness fighting phos driving him and slaying him he saw other things as well things he thought no man could have dreamed of taking brush to panel to portray he saw things that made the forest of stakes outside imbros seem a mercy one of his guardsmen a warrior who delighted in battle like most halogai lurched out into the great hall and was noisily sick there this is what he would have brought to videssos the city zaidas said quietly i know krispos said but knowing and seeing were not the same hed found that out in a different context when hed got word of evripos birth while tanilis was in his bed he looked at the icons again and at the altar he saw small bones among the knives his little sister kosta would have had bones about that size a couple of years before cholera killed her for a moment he thought he would be sick himself a pity the flames from the wall didnt reach here he said well just have to fire this building ourselves more than anything else he wanted phos icons to burn one of the guardsmen clapped him on the back hard enough to stagger him zaidas said excellent your majesty fire and its light are gifts from phos and will cleanse the evil that has put its roots down here may something better arise from the ashes and he added his voice suddenly hopeful if harvas has managed to elude us here fire will cleanse the world of him as well so may it be krispos said after that he was not ashamed to leave the dark chapel zaidas followed close on his heels the young mage carefully closed the splintered door behind him as if to make sure what dwelt inside stayed there all the wizards gathered by the entrance that gepas still guarded theyd not found harvas nor had any of the rest of them stumbled onto anything as black as skotos altar not one however offered a word of protest at what krispos proposed to do to the palace he unhitched progress and led the gelding well away from the wooden building the mages still kept a close watch on it as if they could sense even at a distance the evil harvas had brought into it very likely they could krispos thought most of his guardsmen stayed by him but one hurried back to the imperial camp the guard returned fairly soon he was carrying a jar of lamp oil and a smoking torch he handed krispos the torch unstoppered the jar and splashed oil on the palace wall light it majesty he urged as krispos touched the torch to the oil he reflected that the dromons incendiary mix would have served even better but the lamp oil did the job flames walked across the weathered surface of the wooden wall crept into cracks climbed over carvings before long the wood caught too no hearth logs could have been better seasoned than the old timbers of the palace they burned quick and hard and hot a pillar of smoke rose to the sky imperials ran and rode up in alarm fearing the blaze had broken out on its own krispos kept some of them close by to help fight the fire in case it spread but the palace was set apart from pliskavos other buildings as if to give the khagans of kubrat the sense of space they might have enjoyed on the steppe it had plenty of room in which to burn safely krispos watched the fire for a while he wished he could know whether harvas was burning with those flames whether or not though the power he had forged to strike at videssos was broken those of his raiders who lived were boarding rafts under the eyes and arrows of imperial troops and harvas own power was broken as well thanks to tanilis krispos shook his head wishing for the thousandth time the price of the latter breaking had not been so high but he knew that tanilis had willingly paid the price and that she would not have wanted him to grieve in victory the knowledge helpedsome he swung himself up onto progress and twitched the reins the horse turned till krispos felt the warmth of the burning palace on his back he touched progress flanks with his heels and rode away with a hand shading his eyes to ease the glare krispos peered across the astris tiny in the distance the last of harvas halogai trudged away from the northern back of the river this land is ours now krispos said slightly embarrassed to hear slight surprise in his voice ours again he amended mammianos was also watching the halogai go a very neat campaign your majesty he said the provincial levies will be back on their farms in time to help with the harvest very neat indeed so they will krispos turned to the fat general and what of you mammianos shall i send you back to your province too to govern the coastal lowlands for me this for the coastal lowlands mammianos yawned a slow deliberate scornful yawn the only reason i was there is that petronas sent me to the most insignificant place he could think of the yawn gave way to a smug expression turned out not to be so insignificant after all the way things worked out eh your majesty youre right about that krispos said mammianos had given him the opening hed hoped for if youre bored with the lowlands eminent sir will you serve as my governor here as the first governor of the new province of kubrat ah that job wouldnt soon grow dull now would it mammianos didnt sound surprised but then mammianos was no ones fool his voice turned musing lets see what all would i be doing keeping the nomads on their side of the astris and the halogai too if they think about getting frisky again cleaning up the haloga settlements that got started here like the one that gave sarkis so much trouble krispos put in aye and the kubratoi might decide to rise up again once they get over being grateful to us for ridding them of dear harvas which is to say any time starting about day after tomorrow oh we ought to be good until next week krispos said both men chuckled although krispos knew he wasnt really joking he went on well start resettling farmers too to start giving you enough men to use as a balance against the kubratoi people will want to come if we forgive say their first five years taxes after they get here its not the worst farming country not if the kubratoi dont come by every fall to steal half your crop youd know about that wouldnt you your majesty oh yes even across more than two decades and the vast gulf that separated the man he was from the boy he had been krispos could still call up the helpless fury hed felt as the nomads plundered the peasants theyd kidnapped mammianos glanced over to the walls of pliskavos not far away ill need artisans to help set the town right and merchants to come live in it aye and priests as well for the good god he sketched phos suncircle seems mostly forgotten here he hardly seemed to notice hed agreed to take the job the artisans will come krispos promised though imbros needs them too mammianos nodded krispos continued ill see that priests come too theyll be happier if we have a temple ready for them he snapped his fingers in happy inspiration and i know just whereon the spot where the old wooden palace stood thats very fine your majesty the tradersll come too i expect theyll be eager for the chance to do direct business with the nomads north of the astris instead of going through kubrati middlemen come to that therell be trade down the astris too in the days ahead from pliskavos to videssos the city direct by water aye the merchants will come i think youre right krispos said youll be busy making all of that happen id sooner be busy than bored unlike half the useless drones back in the city mammianos said his eyes narrowed as he studied krispos you think youll stay busy yourself your majesty without a civil war and a foreign one to juggle by the good god eminent sir i hope not krispos exclaimed mammianos stared at him then started to laugh krispos said trouble is though something always comes along by the time im back to the capital ill have something new to worry about one thing i can think of right away before too long i have to decide whether to keep paying tribute to makuran or take the chance on another war by cutting it off were not ready for another war mammianos said seriously dont i know it but we cant let the king of kings go on sucking our blood forever either krispos sighed this avtokrator business is hard work if you try to do it the way you should i understand anthimos better than i used to and why he forgot about everything save women and wine sometimes i think he had the right idea after all no you dont mammianos said krispos sighed again no i suppose i dont but there are times when packing it in can look awfully good a farmer cant afford to pack it in and he only has to deal with one plot of land mammianos said you have the whole empire to look out for on the other hand you get rewards that poor farmer will never see starting with the parade down middle street when you do get back to the city anthimos arranged for people to cheer him too ah but theres a difference youll have earned these cheersand you know it mammianos thumped krispos lightly on the back krispos thought it over at last he nodded xiii the great valves of the silver gate swung open trumpeters on the wall above blared out a fanfare krispos flicked progress reins along with his victorious army he rode into videssos the city as he passed through the covered way between the outer and inner walls his mind went back to the day now more than a decade behind him when hed first walked into the great imperial capital then no one had knownor caredhe was arriving now the whole city waited for him he came out of the shadow of the covered way and into the city another fanfare blew ahead of him in the procession a marching chorus began to chant behold krispos comes in triumph who subjected kubrat once he served the folk north of the mountains but now they serve him people packed both sides of middle street they jeered the chained haloga prisoners who dejectedly clanked along in front of krispos when they saw him the jeers turned to cheers thou conquerest krispos they shouted thou conquerest in his two years as avtokrator hed heard that acclamation many times as often as not it was as much for forms sake as a cobblers giving his neighbor good morning every once in a while though people sounded as if they truly meant it this was one of those times he smiled and waved as he rode up the citys main thoroughfare protocol demanded that an emperor stare straight ahead looking neither to the left nor to the right to emphasize how far above the people he was barsymes would probably scold him when he got back back to the palaces but he didnt care he wanted to feel the moment not to pretend it wasnt happening on either side of progress marched more halogai members of the imperial guards some wore crimson surcoats that matched krispos boots others blue ones that went along with the banner of videssos the guardsmen seemed to ignore the people they strode past but the axes they carried were not just for show behind krispos clattered the ironshod hooves of sarkis unit of scouts the scouts were looking into the crowd all right and didnt pretend otherwise they knew what they were looking for too hey pretty lass i hope i find you tonight one of them called hearing that krispos made a note to himself to make sure extra watchmen were on the street after the procession was done wine shops and joyhouses would both be jumping and he wanted no trouble to mar the day his smile turned ironic for a moment automatically thinking of such things was part of what it meant to be avtokrator then he thought of dara and how good it was not to be just one more man prowling the city for whatever he could find for a night when he came to the palaces he was coming home he wondered what evripos looked like soon enough hed find out he even wondered how phostis was doing about time his heir got to know him kubrat is ours again the people shouted some of them he was certain had no idea in which direction kubrat lay or how long it had been out of videssian hands they shouted anyway if hed got himself killed in the campaign they would have shouted just as hard for whichever general seized the throne some of them would have shouted just as loud for harvas blackrobe were he riding down middle street in triumph krispos smile disappeared altogether ruling over the empire was making him expect the worst in men because the consequences of misfortune were so often what he saw and had to try to repair folk who led good and quiet lives seldom came to his notice but he needed to remember the good still existed if he forgot that he began to walk the path harvas had followed and if he needed to remember the good he had only to think of tanilis the procession moved on along middle street past the dogleg where it bent more nearly due west through the forum of the ox and on toward the plaza of palamas after a while krispos grew bored even adulation staled when it was the same adulation again and again he did his best to keep smiling and waving anyhow while he heard the same praise the same chorus over and over the parade was fresh and new to each person he passed he tried to make it as fine as he could for all of them the sun was a good deal higher in the sky by the time he finally reached the plaza of palamas much of the big square was packed as tight with people as the sidewalks of middle street had been a thin line of watchmen and soldiers held the crowd back from its center to give all the units in the parade room to assemble a temporary wooden platform stood close to the milestone atop it paced a shavenheaded graybearded man in a robe of blue and clothofgold krispos guided progress toward the platform he caught the eye of the man on it and nodded slightly savianos nodded back he looked most patriarchal of course so had pyrrhos and gnatios as savianos himself had said how well he would wear remained to be learned all the same seeing his new patriarch in full regalia for the first time sent hope through krispos he rode up to the stairs on the side of the platform nearest the red granite obelisk that was the center of distance measure throughout the empire geirrod stepped forward with him and held progress head while he dismounted thanks he said to the haloga guard he started for the stairway then stopped gnatios severed head was still displayed on the base of the milestone along with a placard that detailed his treacheries after some weeks exposed to the elements the head was unrecognizable without the placard your own fault krispos said to himself he went up the steps with firm untroubled stride thou conquerest majesty savianos said loudly as krispos reached the top of the platform thou conquerest the crowd echoed savianos prostrated himself before krispos his forehead pressed against rough boards rise most holy sir krispos said savianos got to his feet he turned half away from krispos to face the crowd his hands rose in benediction he recited phos creed we bless thee phos lord with the great and good mind watchful beforehand that the great test of life may be decided in our favor krispos spoke the creed with him so did the great throng who watched them both their voices fell like rolling surf with the rhythms of the prayer krispos thought that if he listened to that oceanic creed a few times he might discover for himself how healerpriests and mages used the holy words to sink into a trance but instead of repeating the creed savianos addressed the people who packed the plaza of palamas we call our avtokrator the viceregent of phos on earth most often this strikes us as but a pleasant conceit a compliment even a flattery to the man who sits on the high throne in the grand courtroom for we know that while he does rule us he is but a man with a mans failings but sometimes people of the city sometimes we find the fulsome title enfolds far more than fulsomeness i submit to you people of the city that we have just passed through such a time for great evil threatened from the north and only through the good gods grace could his champion have overcome it thou conquerest krispos the shout filled the square savianos kept facing the crowd but his eyes slid to krispos krispos waved to the people the shouts redoubled krispos waved again this time for quiet slowly slowly the noise faded the patriarch resumed his speech krispos listened with half an ear the opening had been enough to tell him savianos was indeed the man he wanted wearing the blue boots intelligent pious yet mindful that only the emperor was the chief power of videssos instead of listening krispos watched the people who were watching him he also finally got to watch his parade as unit after unit entered the plaza after the imperial guards and the scouts came the northerners who had chosen to serve videssos rather than returning to halogaland after them rode bagradas company which had routed the halogai who tried to fight on horseback a contingent of kanaris marines marched behind them without the grand drungarios dromons the northerners could have crossed the astris in safety and lingered near kubrat ready to swoop down again at any moment a unit of military musicians had played all the way up middle street the men fell silent as they came into the plaza of palamas so as not to drown out savianos the patriarch finished just as the last troop of horsemen entered the square he waved his hand toward krispos and said now let the avtokrator himself tell you of his dangers and of his triumphs with a deep bow he urged krispos to the forward edge of the platform krispos attitude toward speeches was the same as his attitude toward combat they were a part of being avtokrator he wished he could do without along with the people polished courtiers would be weighing his words smiling at his unsophisticated phrases too bad for them he thought he attacked speeches as if they were armored foes and went straight at them the approach was less than elegant but it worked people of the city brave soldiers of videssos we have won a great victory he began the halogai are bold warriors no one would say otherwise or we would not want them as the emperors guards we should applaud the halogai who fought for me and for the empire they served as loyally as any of our men though they fought their own countrymen without their courage i would not be talking to you today he pointed down at his guardsmen and clapped his hands together the assembled units of the army were the first to join him in paying tribute to the halogai theyd seen the northerners in action more slowly cheers filled the rest of the plaza of palamas some of the imperial guards grinned others not used to such plaudits looked at their boots and shuffled half a step this way and that krispos went on we should also cheer our own brave soldiers who made the fierce men from the north yield for the first time in history some of the halogai you see now are their captives some joined videssos army of their own free will after their chief ikmor surrendered pliskavos to uswed shown them we were the better soldiers the soldiers cheered first again many of them cried hurrah for us the rest of the crowd joined in more quickly this time cheering their fellow videssians made the people of the city happier than applauding foreigners even foreigners in imperial service we did not face danger from the halogai alone krispos said when something not far from quiet returned once more we also faced a wizard who worshiped skotos as always in videssos the dark gods name brought forth first shocked gasps then complete attentive almost fearful silence into that silence krispos continued truth to tell the accursed one did us more harm than the halogai but in the end the mages of the sorcerers collegium were able to stymie his wicked attacks and one the brave sorceress tanilis of opsikion broke his power though she herself died in that combat people sighed when they heard that krispos heard a few women weep some of the soldiers called out tanilis name all of that was as it should be none of it was close to what she deserved what weve won is important he said kubrat is ours again wild horsemen will raid south of the mountains no more and the astris is a broad swift river the nomads will not easily slip over it to steal away the land weve regained with this victory videssos is truly stronger its no sham triumph unlike some you may have seen in the past he could not resist the dig at petronas who had celebrated his undistinguished campaign against makuran as if hed overthrown mashiz people of the city you deserve more than a parade to mark what we have done krispos proclaimed thats why i declare the next three days holidays throughout the city enjoy them this time the ordinary people in the plaza of palamas cheered faster and louder than the soldiers may phos be with us all krispos shouted through the din may phos be with you your majesty the people shouted back savianos stepped close to krispos youve made them like you your majesty he said too quietly for anyone but krispos to hear in the turmoil krispos eyed him curiously not love most holy sir most men would say that if they aimed to pay a compliment let most men say what they will and curry favors as they will savianos answered wouldnt you like to have at least one man around who tells you what he thinks to be the truth now i have two krispos said it was savianos turn to look curious krispos went on or has iakovitzes died in the last quarter of an hour he knew perfectly well that iakovitzes hadnt died were the sevastos still able to speak hed have been on the platform with krispos and the patriarch savianos dipped his head there you have me your majesty one of his bushy eyebrows lifted at least i wont envenom it before i give it to you ha i ought to tell him you said that just to see some venom come your way but since the good god knows youre not altogether wrong ill let you get away with it your majesty is merciful savianos said his eyebrow went up again oh hogwash krispos said with a snort he and his patriarch smiled at each other then he turned to face the crowd once more he raised his hands a few at a time people noticed him pointed the plaza of palamas grew if not quiet quieter people of the city soldiers of the empire as far as im concerned this gathering is done he said go on and celebrate one last cheer louder than the rest filled the square and reverberated from the milestone and the outer wall of the amphitheater krispos waved to the crowd then started for the stairs that led down from the platform and how will you celebrate your majesty savianos called after him not with revels like the ones anthimos enjoyed krispos answered me im just another man with a family coming back from the war all i want to do right now is see my new baby and my wife the palm of daras hand cracked against krispos cheek he caught her wrist before she could hit him again let me go you bastard she screamed you think you can pull off your robe as soon as you go on campaign do you and with mavros mother of all people by the good god she must be old enough to be your mother too hardly krispos thought but he knew better than to say that out loud what he did say was will you listen to me please he was more than a little appalled hed thought of so much on the campaign just past he hadnt thought that rumors about tanilis and him would get back to videssos the city so fast whats there to listen to curse you dara tried to kick him in the shins did you take her to bed with you or not yes but she punctuated the sentence by trying to kick him again this time she succeeded aii he said the pain roused his own anger when she started screaming at him again he outyelled her if it werent for tanilis id be dead now and the whole army with me bugger the army and bugger you too why are you so furious at me he demanded anthimos was unfaithful to you twice a daythree or four times when he could manage that manyand you put up with him for years dara opened her mouth to screech more abuse at him but hesitated he enjoyed a moment of reliefthe first moment hed enjoyed since he walked into the imperial residence in slightly softer tones than shed used thus far she said i expected it from anthimos i didnt expect it from you krispos heard the hurt in her voice along with the outrage i didnt expect it from me either not exactly he said its just that well tanilis and i knew each other a long time ago before i ever came to the palaces knew each other now it was all outrage again that makes it worse not better if you missed her so much why didnt you just send for her when you got the urge it wasnt like that krispos protested and it wasnt as if i set out to seduce her for the first time it was just the more he talked the deeper in trouble he found himself he gave up and spread his hands in defeat i made a mistake what can i say the only thing i can think of is that its not the sort of mistake im likely to make again dara twisted the knife there arent another threescore women you knew in those longlost and forgotten days out there pining for you now but then she hesitated again i dont think i ever heard anthimos say he made a mistake one of the things krispos had learned from repeated meetings with his officers was to change the subject when he didnt have all the answers he said dara could i please see my new son hed hoped that would further soften her it didnt work instead she flared up again your new son and what were you doing while i was panting like a dog and screaming like a man on the rack to make your son come into the world you dont need to tell me with whom you were doing it i already know that by the letter you sent on the day evripos was born the army was fighting its way north from the mountains into kubrat and i wasnt doing anything more with tanilis then than traveling in the same army what hed been doing when her letter arrived but she hadnt asked him that then she said a word that spoke volumes all by itself she went on bitterly you even had the brass to acclaim her to the people today he wondered how shed learned that nothing in videssos the city flew faster than gossip he said whatever you think of me whatever you think of her she deserved to be acclaimed to them i told you once youd be a widow now if not for her dara gave him a long cold measuring stare that might be better i warned you not to trifle with me krispos remembered what rhisoulphos had asked himhow would he dare fall asleep beside her he said careful there youd have had no joy bargaining with harvas blackrobe over the fate of the empire i would have bargained with someone besides harvas she was angry enough to add one thing more i still may i brought you the throne after all and you think you can take it away again is that what youre saying that the only reason i belong on it is because i married you he shook his head maybe that was so two years ago i dont think it is anymore i beat petronas i beat harvas people are used to me with a crown on my head and they see i can manage well enough now he glared coldly at her and so if i wanted to i expect i could send you to a convent go on about my affairs here and get away with it quite handily do you doubt me you wouldnt to save myself i would but i dont want to if we only had a marriage of convenience as he groped for the phrase he remembered tanilis using it he shook his head wishing he hadnt come up with the memory at exactly this moment i think i could put you aside now and not have much trouble over it i just told you that i could have arranged it as i was on the way home from kubrat i came back here though because i love you curse it dara was not ready to give in or to let him down easy i suppose youd say the same thing if tanilis had come back with you he winced as if from a low blow for all his wishing that tanilis had lived he hadnt thought about how he would handle her and dara both badly was the answer that sprang to mind between the two of them theyd have made mincemeat of him in short order dara was doing a good job by herself he answered as best he could mighthavebeens dont matter they arent real so how can you tell whats true about them that just makes for more arguments we dont need more arguments right now dont we i trusted you krispos how am i ever supposed to trust you again now that i know youve been unfaithful it comes in time if you give it a chance he said i grew to trust you for instance me what about me daras eyes flashed dangerously dont go twisting things ive never been unfaithful to you by the good god and youd better know it too im not twisting things and i do know that krispos said but you were unfaithful to anthimos with me so ive known all along that you could be unfaithful to me too it used to worry me it used to worry me a lot it took a long time for me to decide i didnt need to worry about it anymore you never let on dara said slowly she looked at him as if she were seeing him for the first time you never let on at all what would have been the point i always figured that showing i was worried would have made things worse not better so i just kept quiet yes thats like you isnt it you would have just kept quiet about tanilis too and gone about your business but some of the heat finally left daras voice she kept studying krispos in spite of her temperand in spite of the good reason hed given her for losing itshe was thoroughly practical down deep krispos waited at last she said well you may as well have a look at evripos thank you the two words took in much more than her last sentence alone hed known her a long time he counted on her to hear that not a servant was in sight when krispos and dara emerged from the imperial bedchamber his mouth twisted wryly he said all the eunuchs and women must be afraid to get anywhere near us what with the row we were having i cant blame them neither can i dara said with the first half smile shed given him theyre probably waiting to find out which one of us comes out of there aliveif either of us does the nursery was around a couple of corners from the bedchamber only when krispos and dara rounded the last corner did they encounter barsymes in the hallway the vestiarios bowed your majesties he said with the subtle shifts of tone of which he was a master he managed to make the innocuous greeting mean something like are your majesties done sticking knives in each other yet its krispos started to say it was all right but it wasnt maybe in time it would be its better esteemed sir he glanced toward dara wondering if she would make a liar of him its some better esteemed sir she said carefully krispos clicked his tongue between his teeth that would have to do im pleased to hear it your majesties barsymes actually did sound pleased he had to see the palmsize patch of red on krispos cheek but he made sure he did not notice it he bowed again if you will excuse me he walked past krispos and dara palace servants had a magic all their own within minutes everyone in the imperial residence would know what the vestiarios knew krispos opened the nursery door and let dara precede him through it the woman sitting inside quickly got up and started to prostrate herself nevermind iliana krispos said the wet nurse smiled pleased he remembered her name he went on everythings quiet so evripos must be asleep so he is your majesty iliana said she smiled again in a different way this time the haggard smile of anyone who takes care of a baby she pointed to the cradle against one wall krispos walked over to it and peered in evripos lay on his stomach his right thumb was in his mouth his odor the peculiar mix of inborn baby sweetness and stale milk wafted up to krispos krispos said the first thing that came into his mind he doesnt have as much hair as phostis did no he doesnt dara agreed i think hes going to look like you your majesty iliana said to krispos she seemed oblivious to the fight he and dara had just had if shed been here by herself with evripos all the while maybe she was if so she had to be the only person in the imperial residence who was she continued his face is longer than phostis was at the same age and i think hell have your nose krispos examined evripos again he found himself shrugging for one thing hed been in the field when phostis was this age so comparing the two little boys was hard for him for another he didnt think evripos button of a nose looked anything like his own formidable beak he asked how old is he now six weeks a couple of days more dara answered hes a bigger baby than phostis was second babes often are iliana put in maybe he does look like me krispos said well have to train him to be always at his brothers right hand when the time comes for phostis to rule that won him a genuinely grateful look from dara here with a son surely his he said nothing of removing phostis from the succession the nursery door opened phostis came in accompanied by longinos the eunuch the little boy was much more confident on his feet than he had been when krispos set out on campaign he looked at krispos as much at his robes as at his face dada he said tentatively maybe hes not sure either krispos thought he scowled at himself then smiled his biggest smile at phostis dada he said phostis ran to him and hugged him around the legs he reached down to ruffle phostis hair how does he know who i am he asked dara do you suppose he remembers ive been gone a long time and hes not very big maybe he does hes clever dara said but ive also shown him the pictures of oldtime avtokrators in their regalia and said emperor and dada if he didnt recognize you i wanted to be sure he recognized the robes oh that was thoughtful of you krispos said dara didnt answer just as well krispos thought if she had answered shed have been only too likely to come back with something like yes and look what you were doing while i was busy reminding him who you were up phostis said krispos picked him up and held him out at arms length so he could look him over phostis kicked and giggled krispos had no idea whom evripos looked like phostis looked like dara his coloring the shape of his face that unusual small fold of skin at the inner corner of each eyelid all recalled her krispos tossed him a couple of feet into the air caught him then gently shook him phostis squealed with glee krispos wanted to shake him harder to shake out of him once and for all who his father was dada phostis said again he stretched out his own little arms to krispos when krispos drew him close he wrapped them around krispos neck krispos hugged him too from whosever seed he sprang he was a fine little boy thank you for helping him to keep me in mind krispos said to dara he seems happy to see me yes so he does daras voice softened most likely because she was talking about phostis longinos handed krispos an apricot candied in honey the young majesty is especially fond of these is he krispos held the fruit where phostis could see it the toddler wiggled in delight and opened his mouth wide krispos popped in the apricot phostis made small nyumnyumnyum noises as he chewed krispos said i think he has more teeth than he did when i left the city they do keep growing them dara said phostis finished the candied apricot more he said hopefully laughing krispos held out his hand to longinos the chamberlain produced another apricot krispos gave it to phostis nyumnyumnyum youll spoil his supper iliana said then she remembered to whom she was speaking and hastily added your majesty one spoiled supper wont matter krispos said he knew that was true but also wondered how often it was wise to say such things he suspected no one had ever said no to anthimos about anything he didnt want phostis to grow up that way barsymes stuck his head into the nursery as the afternoon is drawing on your majesty phestos the cook wishes to know how you care to dine this evening by the good god one big fine supper wont spoil me either not after eating camp food ever since i left the city krispos said tell phestos to let himself go hell be pleased to hear that your majesty barsymes said he told me that if you asked him to do up a pot of army stew hed leave the palaces hed better not krispos exclaimed laughing i like good food all the time and ive come to enjoy fancy meals now and again too this one will be the more welcome after eating plain for so long the vestiarios hurried away to carry his word back to the kitchens krispos tossed phostis in the air again and what do you want to eat tonight your majesty phostis pointed to the pocket where longinos kept the candied apricots with a frown of regret longinos turned the pocket inside out im dreadfully sorry young majesty he said i have no more phostis started to cry krispos tried cuddling him against the tragedy of no more candied fruit cuddling did no good krispos turned him upside down he decided that was funny krispos did it again phostis chortled i wish we could so easily forget the things that hurt us dara said krispos thought that we was really an i he said we cant forget the best we can do is not let them rankle i suppose so dara said though vindictiveness has a bittersweet savor in which so many videssians delight many nobles would sooner forget their names than a slight krispos knew some small measure of relief that she did not include herself in that number just then evripos woke up with a whimper phostis pointed to the cradle baby thats your baby brother krispos said baby phostis repeated evripos cried louder diana picked him up krispos turned phostis upside down again lowered him to the floor and set him down let me hold evripos he said iliana passed him the baby he took a gingerly grip on his son put one hand behind his head your majesty iliana said his neck still wobbles krispos obeyed he examined evripos anew the cheek on which the baby had been sleeping was bright red evripos eyes would be brown already they were several shades darker than the bluegray of a newborns he looked at krispos krispos wondered if hed ever seen anyone with a beard before then he wondered if the baby was old enough even to notice it evripos eyes opened wide as if he was really waking up now his face worked he smiled at me krispos said hes done it a few times dara said give him to me if you please your majesty iliana said hell be hungry krispos returned the baby to her he averted his eyes as she undid her smock he did not want dara to see him look at another womans breasts not now of all times evripos seized the wet nurses nipple and started making sucking and gulping noises milk phostis said baby he stuck out his tongue you were fond of it till not so long ago iliana told him a smile in her voice phostis paid no attention to her with such delicious things as candied apricots in the world he cared for the breast no more well what do you think of your son dara asked i think well of both my sons krispos said good dara sounded truly pleased maybe she knew the words were an offer of truce but they were the right one to make she went on evripos should stay awake for a while do you want to play with him a bit longer when hes done nursing yes ill do that krispos said soon iliana presented him with the baby see if you can get him to burp she said he patted evripos on the back at the same time as iliana said not so hard your majesty evripos let out a surprisingly deep belch krispos grinned a vindicated grin he held the baby for a while evripos was still too small to give back very much every so often his eyes would focus intently on krispos face once when krispos smiled at him he smiled back but his attention drifted away again before long phostis tugged at krispos robe up he demanded krispos passed evripos back to iliana and lifted phostis after the baby the older boy seemed to weigh quite a lot he threw himself backward to show he wanted to play the upsidedown game again krispos lowered him to the floor then picked him up so they were nose to upsidedown nose you trusted me there didnt you he said why shouldnt he dara said you never dropped him on his head krispos clicked tongue between teeth hearing her unspoken as you did me before long phostis got bored with going upside down krispos returned him to solid ground he ran over to a toy chest where he drew out a carved and painted wooden horse dog and wagon he neighed barked and did an alarmingly realistic impression of the squeak of a big wagons ungreased wheels krispos bent down he barked and neighed too he made the dog chase the horse then made the horse jump into the wagon phostis laughed he laughed louder when krispos made loud wheelsqueaks and had the toy dog run off in pretended terror he played with phostis a bit longer then held evripos again until the baby started to fuss iliana took him back and gave him her breast he fell asleep while he was nursing she set him in the cradle by then krispos was playing with phostis again dara said this must be your most domestic afternoon in a longtime this is my most domestic afternoon ever krispos said it has to be i never had two sons to play with before he thought for a few seconds i like it i see that dara said quietly barsymes came into the nursery your majesty phestos is ready for you and your lady is it that time already krispos said startled he looked at where the sunlight stood on the nursery wall considered his stomach by the good god so it is all right esteemed sir well come with you dara nodded phostis started to wail when krispos and dara walked to the door hes tired your majesties longinos said apologetically he should have had a nap some time ago but he was too excited playing with his father daras eyes flickered to krispos all he said was i enjoyed it too no matter who phostis father was he was a delightful little boy krispos realized he should have noticed that long ago in the end it was what counted barsymes took krispos and dara to the smallest of the several dining chambers in the imperial residence lamps already burned there against the coming of evening a jar of wine stood in the center of the table a silver goblet before each place as he sat krispos glanced down into his white wine he observed yes your majesty barsymes said as youve been so long inland phestos thought all the courses tonight should come from the sea to welcome you back to the fare of videssos the city when the vestiarios had gone krispos raised his goblet to dara to our sons he said and drank to our sons she also held the cup to her lips she looked at krispos over it thank you for picking a toast i can drink to he nodded back i did try he was glad to have any truce between them no matter how fragile barsymes brought in a crystal bowl a salad with small squid sliced into it he announced phestos bids me tell you it is dressed with olive oil vinegar garlic oregano and some of the squids own ink thus the dark color he served a portion to krispos another to dara and bowed his way out krispos picked up his fork and smiled trying to remember the last time hed used any utensil but spoon or belt knife the last time hed been in the city he decided he ate a forkful of salad thats very good dara tasted hers too so it is as long as they talked about something safe like the food they were all right together at precisely the proper moment barsymes reappeared to clear away the salad he came back with soup bowls and a gold tureen and ladle a wonderful odor rose from the tureen prawns leeks and mushrooms he said ladling out the soup if this tastes as good as it smells tell phestos ive just raised his pay krispos said he dipped his spoon and brought it to his lips it does i have tell him barsymes i shall your majesty the vestiarios promised the sharp taste of leeks though lessened by their being boiled made a perfect contrast to the prawns delicate flavor the mushrooms added the earthy savor of the woods where theyd been picked krispos used the ladle himself until the tureen was empty when barsymes returned to take it away krispos held out his bowl to him take this back to the kitchens and fill it up again first if you please esteemed sir of course your majesty if i may make so bold though do not linger with it overlong the other courses advance apace sure enough as soon as that last bowl was done barsymes brought in a covered tray what now esteemed sir krispos asked him roast lampreys stuffed with sea urchin paste served on a bed of cracked wheat and pickled grape leaves i expect ill grow fins by the time im done krispos said with a laugh whats that old saying when in videssos the city eat fish thats it well no one could hope to eat better fish than i am tonight he raised his cup to salute phestos when he set it down it was empty he reached for the jar that was empty too ill fetch more directly your majesty barsymes said cant go through a feast like this without wine krispos said to dara indeed not she drained her own cup put it down then stared across the table at krispos as well i hadnt had any to drink earlier this afternoon though id have tried to put a knife in you i think he eyes fell to the one with which shed been cutting her lamprey youdidnt do badly as it was he said cautiously he looked at her knife too youre not trying to carve me now does that meani hope that meansyou forgive me no she said at once so sharply that he grimaced she went on it does mean i dont want to kill you just this minute will that do it will have to if we had some wine id drink to it ah barsymes the vestiarios brought in a new jar and used a knife to slice through the pitch that held the stopper in place he poured the wine krispos said heres to letting knives cut up fish and not people he and dara both drank barsymes said that your majesty is an excellent toast isnt it krispos said expansively he touched the end of his nose it was getting numb he smiled i can feel that wine he took another sip barsymes cleared the table i shall return shortly with the main course he said as usual he was as good as his word he set down the latest tray with a flourish tuna your majesties poached in resinated wine with spices i will grow fins krispos declared ill enjoy every bit of it too he let barsymes serve him a large piece of flaky pinkishwhite fish he tasted it phestos has outdone himself this time dara was busy chewing but made a wordless noise of agreement he will be pleased to know he has pleased you your majesties barsymes said now would you care for some boiled chickpeas or beets or perhaps the parsnips in creamy onion sauce after the tuna barsymes brought in a bowl of red and white mulberries krispos was normally fond of them now he rolled his eyes and looked over at dara she was looking at him with a similarly overwhelmed expression they both started to laugh in an act of consciousand conscientiousbravery krispos reached for the bowl have to eat a few to keep from hurting phestos feelings i suppose so here let me have some too dara washed them down with another swallow of wine she set down her cup harder than she might strange you worry about the cooks feelings more than mine krispos grunted looking down at the mulberries it wasnt something i made a habit of bad enough once she said being without a good answer to that krispos kept quiet barsymes came in and took away the bowl of fruit he seemed willing not to see that it had hardly been touched would you care for anything else your majesties he asked dara shook her head no thank you esteemed sir krispos said the vestiarios bowed to him and dara then strode silently out of the dining chamber krispos hefted the wine jar would you like some more he asked dara she pushed her cup toward him he filled it then poured what was left in the jar into his own they drank together only the lamps lit the dining chamber the sun was long down what now krispos asked when the wine was gone now dara would not look at him i dont know lets go to bed he said seeing her scowl he amended to sleep i mean im too full and too worn to think about anything else tonight anyway all right she pushed her chair back from the table and got up krispos wondered if he ought to check the cutlery to make sure she hadnt secreted a knife up her sleeve youre being foolish he told himself as he too rose from the table he hoped he was right in the bedchamber he pulled off the imperial boots then let out a long sigh of relief as he clenched and unclenched his toes he took off his robe and noticed he hadnt spilled anything on it at dinnerbarsymes would be pleased he lay down on the bed sighing again as the mattress enfolded him in softness dara was also undressing a little more slowly shed always had the habit of sleeping without clothes krispos remembered the first time hed been her the first time hed come into this chamber as anthimos vestiarios her body had been perfect then it wasnt quite perfect anymore after two births her waist was thicker than it had been and with the second one so recently past the skin on her belly hung a little loose while her breasts drooped softly krispos shrugged she was still dara he still found himself wanting her as hed told tanilis it was rather more than a marriage of convenience if he wanted it to remain so he suspected he ought to stop thinking about what hed told tanilis that seemed dreadfully unfair but hed learned a good deal of life was unfair he shrugged again unfair or not you went on anyway get up please dara said when krispos did she pulled back the spread leaving just the sheet and a light coverlet its a warm night all right he slid under the sheet and blew out the lamp that stood on the night table a moment later dara got into bed with him she blew out her lamp the bedchamber plunged into darkness good night krispos said good night she answered coolly the bed was big enough to leave a good deal of space between them here i am returned in triumph and i might as well be sleeping alone krispos thought he yawned enormously his eyes slid shut he slept he woke at sunrise the next morning with a bladder full to bursting he glanced over at dara shed kicked off the covers some time during the night but was still peacefully asleep carefully so as not to wake her he got out of bed and used the chamber pot he lay down again dara did not wake he slid toward her very very gently his tongue began to tease her right nipple it crinkled erect she smiled in her sleep all at once her eyes opened she stiffened then twisted away from him what are you trying to do she snapped i thought that would be plain enough he said your body answered mine or started to even if youre angry with me bodies are fools dara said scornfully aye they are krispos said mine was too shed opened her mouth to say something and likely something harsh that made her shut it even so she shook her head you think that if i lie with you well be fools together and ill forget about what you did i dont think youll forget krispos sighed i wish you could but i know better not even the mages have a magic to make things as if theyd never happened but if we do lie together i hope you will remember i love you he nearly finished that sentence i love you too one hastily swallowed syllable stood between him and disaster a nearer brush than in any fight against the halogai if we are to live as man and wife i suppose well have to be man and wife dara said as much to herself as to krispos her lip curled otherwise youd surely take your nets and go trolling for other women very well krispos as you will she lay back and stared up at the ceiling he did not go to her sucking in a deep irritated breath he said i dont want you just to be having you curse it that was anthimos sport i dont care for it if we cant meet halfway better not to bother when were angry at each other she lifted her head from the mattress to study him you mean that she said slowly yes by the good god i do lets just ring for the servants and start the new day he reached for the crimson bell pull by his side of the bed wait dara said his hand stopped he raised a questioning eyebrow after a moment she went on let it be aa peaceoffering between us then i cant promise to enjoy it krispos i will do more than endure it are you sure he asked im sure be gentle if you can im not that long out of childbed i will he promised now he reached out to clasp her breast her hand closed on his their lovemaking was perhaps the strangest hed known certainly the most selfconscious both her physical frailty and knowing she remained just this side of furious at him constrained him until he was almost afraid to touch her despite her pledge she lay still and unstirred under his caresses her jaw was clamped with apprehension when he entered her is it all right he asked she hesitated considering finally she nodded he went on as carefully as he could at last he gasped and jerked even then cautiously he realized he was lying with all his weight on her he slid out of her then away from her im sorry he said id hoped to please you better never minddont worry about it she answered he looked at her in some surprise for she sounded serious then she nodded to show she was she went on i told you i doubted i was happy enough with you to take full part in it now but i noticed how you did what you did how you were careful with me maybe i even noticed that more because i wasnt swept away you wouldnt have been so regardful if i were just so much convenient flesh to you ive never thought of you like that krispos protested a woman often wonders dara said bleakly especially a woman who has known anthimos and most especially a woman who when her husband goes away while she must stay behind learns hes found some other convenient flesh with which to dally for a while me i mean krispos started to say it wasnt like that but knowing when to hold his tongue had served him well through the years this was as good a time as any and better than most he knew he was rightwhat he and tanilis had done together was far more than dallying with convenient flesh at the moment though being right mattered little if he pressed it being right was indeed liable to be worse than being wrong peace with dara was worth giving her the last word what he did say not even a beat late was im no anthimos i hope youve noticed i have she said i was quite sure of it till you went on campaign then she shook her head then i doubted everything but maybe just maybe we can go on after all i want us to krispos said ive packed a lifetimes worth of upheavals into the last two years i dont need any more suddenly dara made a wry face she quickly sat then looked down between her legs krispos took a few seconds to be sure the snort she let out was laughter she said the maidservant who changes the bed linen will be sure weve reconciled i suppose we may as well good krispos said im glad i think i am too with that krispos had to be content considering how dara had greeted him the day before it was as much as he could have hoped for now he did yank at the bell pull barsymes appeared as promptly and silently as if hed been conjured up good morning your majesty i trust you slept well yes thank you esteemed sir the vestiarios brought him a pair of drawers and pointed to a robe in the closet krispos nodded at his choice barsymes drew out the robe krispos let the eunuch dress him dara must have used her bell pull too for a serving maid came in while barsymes was fussing over krispos she helped dara into her clothes and combed out her shining black hair and how would you care to break your fast this morning your majesty barsymes asked krispos slapped his belly with the flat of his hand seeing that i ate enough for three starving men last night i hope phestos wont be put out if i just ask for a small bowl of porridge and half a stewed melon i trust he will be able to restrain his chagrin yes the vestiarios agreed blandly krispos gave him a sharp lookbarsymes wit was droughtdry the chamberlain turned to dara and you your majesty the same as for krispos i think she said i shall so inform phestos no doubt he will be pleased to find the two of you in accord with that oblique comment on yesterdays fight barsymes strode out of the imperial bedchamber when the vestiarios cleared away the few breakfast dishes krispos knew he ought to start in on all the scrolls and parchments that had piled up at the palaces while he was on campaign the most pressing business had followed him even to pliskavos but much that was not pressing remained importantand would swiftly become urgent if he neglected it but he could not make himself get up and attend to business not on his first full day back in videssos the city hadnt he earned at least one day of rest he was still arguing with himself when longinos brought phostis into the dining room dada phostis exclaimed and ran to him krispos decided the parchments could wait he scooped up phostis and gave him a noisy kiss phostis scrubbed at his cheek with the palm of his hand after a moment krispos realized the boy was not used to being kissed by anyone who wore a beard he kissed him again phostis rubbed again youre doing that on purpose just to confuse him with your whiskers dara said if he gets to know me he has to get to know my beard too krispos answered the lord with the great and good mind willing ill be able to stay in the city long enough now to keep him from forgetting me dara yielded may phos hear that prayer phostis stood up on krispos lap he wrapped his arms around krispos neck and made a loud kissing noise krispos found himself grinning dara smiled a mothers smile she said he seems fond of you he does doesnt he thats good krispos glanced to longinos then to the doorway the eunuch trained to the nuances of palace service gave a half bow that turned his plump cheeks pink then stepped into the hall krispos lowered his voice and said to dara you know at last i find i dont care who his father really was hes a fine little boy thats all ive thought so all along she answered i never wanted to say it very often though for fear of making you worry more about that than you would have otherwise she studied him nodding thoughtfully as if hed passed a test he wondered if he had was he showing maturity about phostis lineage or merely resignation he didnt know himself whatever it was it seemed to please dara that practical consideration carried more weight with him than any finespun point of philosophy he chuckled what dara asked only that id never make a good sorcerer or theologian he said youre probably right she replied on the other hand precious few sorcerers or theologians would make a good avtokrator and youre shaping pretty well for that he dipped his head to her in silent thanks then all unbidden harvas rose to the surface of his mind harvas had been theologian and sorcerer both and wanted to rule the empire of videssos what sort of avtokrator would he have made krispos knew the answer to that and shuddered at the knowledge but harvas was menace no more thanks to tanilis even if he could not speak of her to dara krispos reflected how could he erase her from his memory maybe one day the sorcerer would arise and threaten videssos again but krispos did not think it would be any year soon if it did happen he would deal with it as best he could or phostis would or phostis son or whoever wore the avtokrators crown in some distant time with the infallible instinct palace servants develop longinos knew he could come back into the dining room shall i take charge of the young majesty again he asked krispos krispos expected phostis to go to the eunuch with whom he was far more familiar but phostis stayed close by ill keep him awhile if its all right with you longinos krispos said hes mine after all indeed your majesty phos has blessed youblessed you twice now the chamberlains voice not quite tenor not quite alto was wistful phos would not bless him not that way when krispos got up from the table and went out into the hall phostis toddled after him he slowed his steps to let the little boy keep up phostis walked over to a carved marble display stand and tried to climb up it krispos didnt think he was strong enough to knock it over but took no chances he lifted phostis into his arms displayed on the marble stand was a conical helm once worn by a makuraner king of kings part of the spoil from a videssian triumph of long ago on the wall above the helmet hung a portrait of the fiercelooking avtokrator stavrakios who had beaten the halogai in their own country every time krispos saw it he wondered how he would measure up in stavrakios uncompromising eyes phostis pointed to the portrait and frowned in intense concentration empror he said at last yes thats true krispos said he was emperor a long time ago phostis wasnt finished he pointed to krispos almost sticking a finger in his eye empror he said again adding a moment later dada krispos hugged the little boy thats true too he agreed gravely i am the emperor and your dada come to think of it young majesty youre an emperor yourself now he pointed at phostis emperor empror phostis laughed as if that were the funniest thing hed ever heard krispos laughed too it was a preposterously unlikely notion when you got right down to it but it was also true krispos hugged phostis tighter till the boy squirmed every year so many many peasants left their farms and came to videssos the city to seek their fortunes unlike almost all of them hed found his emperor he said wonderingly he lowered phostis to the floor they walked down the hall together
