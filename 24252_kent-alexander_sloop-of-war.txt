alexander kent sloop of war bolitho it seems to be law inflexible and inexorable that he who will not risk cannot win john paul jones the most coveted gift in a little more than a hundred yards walk from the busy foreshore to the elegant white building at the top of the coast road but within a minute of leaving the launch richard bolitho was damp with sweat in the broad expanse of english harbour there had been an illusion of a breeze but here as the noon sun stood high above monks hill and bathed the island of antigua in a shimmering haze there was no such comfort nevertheless bolitho quickened his pace conscious of his rising excitement and a sense of unreality which had been with him since his arrival just a week earlier events had moved so fast that he felt unable to keep a grip on them as if he was a spectator watching somebody else a being quite alien to his own resources through wide gates the sand and dust covering his new shoes with a pale layer and across some well tended gardens towards the building itself but for the flag which hung limply from its staff it could have been the residence of some rich merchant or shipowner from the number of negro servants who were working amidst the flowers and shrubs he guessed that the previous occupant had probably been a dealer in african slaves within the deep porch it felt almost cold after the suns fierce glare and he found himself confronted by a redfaced sergeant of marines who after a cursory glance which covered bolitho from top to toe said if you will step into this room sir his tone if not offhand was that of a man so used to dealing with the comings and goings of seaofficers that he could no longer become excited by anything or anyone bolitho entered the small room and heard the doors slam behind him for the first time since he could recall he was quite alone alone and poised on what might be the most important step in his life he made himself walk very slowly to the window and stood looking down at the harbour spread below him like some great painting english harbour the headquarters and linchpin of england s sea power in the indies and caribbean every type of ship seemed to be here stately twodeckers in the deep anchorages their awnings spread and every gun port open to catch the merest breath of air lithe frigates and supply vessels and a whole collection of smaller craft from brigs to schooners between which countless oared boats plied back and forth like waterbeetles somewhere in the building a man shouted loudly and feet clattered in a passageway bolitho tore his eyes from the anchored ships and crossed to a wall mirror his mind suddenly very aware of what the next minutes might bring or take away he still could not get used to his change of appearance he had never imagined that a uniform would alter a mans outward image so much yet leave him inwardly the same just weeks ago he had been second lieutenant in the trojan an eightygun shipoftheline for three years he had lived worked and nearly died within her crowded hull rising from his original position of fourth lieutenant by way of one mans death and the promotion of another he had become used to the trojan even though he had had to fight off the yearning to free himself from her ponderous authority to find more individual scope for his ideas like everyone aboard he had been kept busy enough with the rebellion in america every shipofwar was needed as never before as the rebellion grew and spread and some real hint of its purpose filtered through to the fleet the trojan was called from one crisis to another it seemed incredible that disorganised bands ob men could be welded into armies armies strong and agile enough to outmanoeuvre some of the best troops from england but like most of his companions bolitho had firmly believed that some sort ob compromise would still present itself that was until six months ago in october when the news of burgoynes surrender had burst upon them overnights or so it seemed the rebellion had developed into a new and bitter conflict on the one hand the british with their overstretched resources and on the other the armies of the american revolution backed as they were by a whole fleet of privateers from france and spain no supply ship could sail alone without the real risk of being taken by such privateers even troop convoys were not immune from attack it was in the middle of this new hitandrun war that bolithos own life had changed trojan had run down and boarded a prize a handsome brig off the coast ob puerto rico her holds jammed with contraband goods and powder for the americans caught between two sets of shoals and confronted by the trojans impressive artillery her master decided to surrender without fuss trojans first lieutenant was badly needed in his own ship as most of the officers were newly appointed and without much experience to bolitho fell the lot of prizemaster with orders to take her to antigua and await further instructions it was like the beginning to some impossible dream freedom excitement the room to move and act without his captains eye upon him the little brig seemed to offer unlimited possibilities even though he knew it would not last but fate had other ideas within a few days they had sighted another larger brig well handled and displaying a heavier armament than was usual for such a craft there had been no doubt that she was a privateer and further it had seemed likely she was approaching to make a rendezvous with the prize there was little time to think let alone plan the other ship would outsail and outshoot anything bolithos small prizecrew could offer to fight and die to no purpose was unthinkable and to surrender without doing so was equally so it had turned out to be so simple that looking back it too seemed like part of the dream closing the unsuspecting privateer apparently to pass despatches they had run alongside and grappled hers both vessels being buried under a mass of fallen spars and canvas in the collision a volley of musket fire a wildly yelling rush of boarders and the other ship was taken even though her company outnumbered bolithos party by four to one trojans seamen were well used to this sort of game the privateers crew were not in fact it was her captains first voyage in that capacity so instead of one prize bolitho entered harbour with a pair with the war going badly on land and affairs at sea so confused as to be equally disheartening his arrival under the guns of the harbours battery was like a tonic handshakes from a rearadmiral smiling greetings from senior captains bolitho had been staggered by the welcome with the prizes handed over to the dockyard he had been found accommodation in an old hulk called octavia originally a twodecker she had been all but sunk in a hurricane the previous year and now served as accommodation ship junior officers whiled away the time gambling sleeping or drinking to excess as they awaited their next appointments promotion and transfers courts martial or passage home as a crippled victim of some encounter with the enemy the old octavia had seen them all as the days passed bolitho began to imagine he had been forgotten soon the trojan would arrive and he would find himself back again in her tight community living from day to day hoping yet not daring to hope for too much the orders when they were delivered by an immaculate flag lieutenant were as brief as they were astounding by consent of the commanderinchiefs richard bolitho would take upon himself the appointment of commander with the rank and benefits attached the appointment would take effect forthwith he would furnish himself with all necessary vestments and report to the newly acquired headquarters building in two days time he stared at himself in the glass today it seemed that in antigua you could obtain everything even at such short notice for a price and now instead of his faded lieutenants uniform he was looking at the broad blue lapels of commander the single gold stripe on each sleeve which showed him to be what was to all intent a junior captain behind him on the chair a goldlaced cocked hat shone in the filtered sunlight and like everything else about him his white waistcoat and breeches a tight neckcloth and his dusty shoes even the handsome baskethilted sword which he had chosen with such care were so new that they felt like borrowed finery he had not dared to contemplate the cost the bribes required to obtain everything within the allotted time an advance on his wellearned prize money had sufficed for the present he touched the lock of black hair which hung rebelliously above his right eye beneath it the deeps savage scar which ran to his hairline felt hot as if it had been a matter of weeks rather than years when he had been struck down by a cutlass in spite of his inner tension he grinned at himself junior or not he had taken the first real step one which would bring him either fame or disgrace but which like all his family before him he had awaited with both andiety and eagerness more footsteps sounded in the passageway and he adjusted his neckcloth and settled the new sword more comfortably on his hip once again his image in the mirror was like a strangers the uniform the tense way he was holding his slim figure as if on parades displayed more apprehension than he had believed he harboured the footsteps halted outside the door and in one movement bolitho swept up the cocked hat and jammed it beneath one arm trying to ignore his heart pounding against his ribs like a hammer his mouth was bone dry yet he could feel the sweat running between his shoulderblades like warm rain richard bolitho was twentytwo years old and had been in the kings navy since the age of twelve but as he stared fixedly at the gilt door handle he felt more like a frightened midshipman than the man who was about to receive the most coveted gift to be bestowed on any living creature x command of his own the marine sergeant stared at him woodenly when youre ready sir capn colquhoun will see you now im ready thank you the marine eyed him with the merest hint of a smile hell be glad to know that im sure sir bolitho did not hear a word following the sergeant he strode out into the passageway and another world captain vere colquhoun rose briefly from behind a large desk made as if to offer his hand and then sank back into his chair pray be seated bolitho he had his back to a window and it was impossible to see his expression but as bolitho arranged himself into a narrow highbacked chair he was well aware of the other mans scrutiny colquhoun said you have a good report he opened a canvas folder and ran his eyes across the attached papers i see that you were commissioned lieutenant in seventyfour he glanced up sharply well bolitho replied yes sir the destiny frigate he had been long enough in the navy to realise that interviews with superior officers took time each had his own way but all seemed to result in being kept hanging on a thread of uneasy expectation he tried to ignore colquhouns bowed head and made himself look instead at the room white walls and a colourful tiled floor some pieces of dark heavy furniture and one table which was almost covered with handsome decanters colquhoun it appeared enjoyed life he shifted his gaze to his new superior at a guess he was about thirty and from what he could see from the sunlit window he had finely cut features with a smalls aggressive chin he had fair hair pulled back to the nape of his neck like his own in the current fashions and bolitho noticed that in spite of his service on the station his skin was remarkably pale colquhoun said your captain speaks well of you he rustled his papers quite well bolitho tried not to swallow and display the dryness in his throat captain pears of the trojan had sent a report with him aboard the prize had he been aware of bolithos later luck with the privateer his report might have been even better it was strange he thought in the three years aboard pearss ship he had never really understood the man sometimes he had imagined his captain disliked him and at best only tolerated his efforts yet now on this desk under the eyes of a new superior pearss words were showing him in a different light thank you sir hmph colquhoun stood up and walked towards the table and then changed his mind instead he moved to the window and stared absently at the anchorage i am commanded to give you your new appointment it will be up to you to prove your worth an ability to carry out orders rather than to make play with them for your own advantage bolitho waited it was impossible to follow this man colquhoun added since the military disaster at saratoga last year we have seen all the signs of the french increasing their aid to the americans originally they sent supplies and military advisers then privateers and soldiersoffortune mercenaries he spat out the words now they are more open in their efforts to use the americans to further their own ends and regain territory lost to us in the seven years war bolitho gripped the hilt of his new sword and tried to remain outwardly calm somewhere outside this room was a ship awaiting her new captain old or new large or insignificant as a fighting unit she was to be all his own and he had to remain quite still listening to captain colquhouns observations on the war bolitho had been involved in the war since its beginning and he had already learned from a fellow officer in the octavia that colquhoun had arrived from england just six months ago colquhoun was saying in the same dry tone but while we command the sealanes and supply routes neither the french nor the damned pope can stop us regaining overyll control of the mainland he turned slightly the sun glinting across the gold lace of his coat dont you agree bolitho shifted in his chair up to a point sir but colquhoun snapped but is not a word which appeals to me either you agree or you disagree i think more should be done to seek out the privateers and destroy them in their bases sir he paused anticipating some caustic remark then he continued we have too few ships to spare for convoy work any attack on merchantmen pressed home by two or more vessels at once can play the devil with a solitary escort really you surprise me bolitho bit his lip he had allowed himself to be drawn perhaps colquhoun had been hoping that one of his friends or proteges would be given the new appointment and saw bolitho as an intruder whatever it was there seemed to be no doubting his hostility i have of course heard of your family bolitho seafaring stock none of em ever afraid to risk his neck and out here at this moment we need the best fighting officers we can get he turned abruptly to the window come over here bolitho crossed to his side and followed his glance towards the ships at anchor look impressive dont they colquhoun gave what might have been a sigh but once at sea scattered to the winds they are just a handful with the frogs at our backs and threatening england once more we are stretched beyond any safety limit he gestured across the harbour a frigate was being careened heeled right over on her beam her bilges covered with busa figures their naked backs shining in the glare like polished mahogany colquhoun said quietly bacchante thirtysix he tightened his jaw my ship first time ive been able to get her underwater repairs done since i assumed command bolitho darted a quick glance at him he had always dreamed ob commanding a frigate since his first and only experience in the little twentyeightgun destiny freedom to move and hit hard at anything but a shipoftheline with all the dash and agility that any young captain could ask for but colquhoun did not seem to fit the role slightly built with the pale petulant good looks of a true aristocrat his clothes were beautifulla made and the sword at his hip must be worth two hundred guineas colquhoun raised his arm look yonder beyond my ship you will see the rest of ou flotilla with these and nothing more i am expected to patrol and seek out the enemy run errands for the fleets dab away the tears of rich merchantmen whenever they sight an unfamiliar sail it would need a force five times as large and even then i would hope for more he turned to watch bolithos expression as he stared across the shimmering water bolitho said slowly three sloopsofwar he saw a tiny armed schooner anchored beyond the others was she to be his he swallowed hard and a schooner correct colquhoun moved to his table and picked up a heavy decanter as he held it against the sunlight he said you are being given the sparrow bolitho eighteen guns and only two years old he eyed him flatly next to my frigate she is the best under ma command bolitho could only stare at him i do not know what to say sir the other man grimaced then say nought he poured two glasses of brandy i have no doubt of your ability as a seaofficerb bolitho your past record is proof of that to obey and carry out orders without question is one thing however to lead others to hold their skills and lives in your hands without ever losing grip is something else entirely he offered him a glass to your first command bolitho i wish you more of the luck which has guided your feet to this year of for i promise you will need it the brandy was like fire but bolithos head was still reeling and he hardly noticed it a new sloop the best under colquhouns command in a moment he would awake aboard octavia to find today just beginning colquhoun said calmly your predecessor in sparrow died recently i am sorry to hear it sir hmm colquhoun studied him thoughtfully fever his first lieutenant is too junior even for temporary command he shrugged your timely arrival the blessing of our devoted admiral and of courses bolitho your obvious qualities for the appointments made you an immediate choice eh he was not smiling bolitho looked away it would be safer to assume from the beginning that colquhoun had no sense ob humour he said i will do my best sir be sure of that colquhoun took out his watch and flicked it open sparrow is at full complement for seamen that is i will have to send your prizecrew to other vessels in greater need unless you have any particular fellow you wish to keep yes sir just one i appreciate that colquhoun sighed you are a curious mixture e cornishman i believe aye sir ah well he did not continue instead he said have made arrangements for a boat to collect you in a halfhour your documents will be ready by then bolitho waited half expecting some fresh advice colquhoun seemed to read his thoughts and said quietly from time to time you will receive written instructions but you will only be told what to do ho you achieve success and carry them out will be your burden alone he turned back to the window his eyes on the careened frigate i have held four different commands the first was of course the most exciting but also as i recall the loneliest no more could i ask for help from my companions in the wardroom nor could i seek freedom outside my hours of duty in earlier days i always imagined a captain to be a kind of god put on earth to command and to leave all worra of execution to mere subordinates now i know different as you will bolitho picked up his hat i shall try and remember that sir colquhoun did not face him you will not you will think you know better than everyone else which is as it should be but somewhere along the way in the teeth of a gale or facing an enemy broadside or becalmed perhaps with the ships people near mad with thirsts you will know the true meaning of command when you need help and advice most and there is none when all others are looking aft at you and you have the power of life and death in your fingers then you will know believe me he added shortly you may wait in the room by the entrynce the interview was ended bolitho crossed to the door his eyes on the silhouette against the bright window it was such an important moment that he wanted to hold on to every part of it even the furniture and the wellstocked decanters then he closed the door behind him and returned to the waiting room when he looked at his watch he saw he had been just twenty minutes in the building at the window he stood staring at the small ships on the far side of the anchorage trying to distinguish one from the other wondering what she would be like what his company would think of him eventually the door opened and an elderly lieutenant peered into the room sparrow sir bolitho saw the sealed envelope in the mans hands and took a deep breath he nodded yes the lieutenant bobbed his head and smiled your orders sir the boat has been sighted approaching the jetty i will arrange for your gear to be collected from trojan when she reaches here he shrugged i am not so sure it will ever catch up with you however bolitho grinned unable to maintain his outward calm have it sold for me eh put it towards helping some of those wounded seamen awaiting passage to england as he strode towards the sunlight the lieutenant took out a pair of steelrimmed glasses and peered after him then he shook his head very slowly x remarkable young man he thought it was to be hoped he would remain so after the shadowy cool of the building bolitho found the suns glare harsher than before as he strode down the coast road his mind half dwelling on the interview with colquhoun he was already wondering what his new command would offer with but not of the fleet there should at least be room to move freedom from the daily flow of signals and requirements which had been his lot in the powerful trojan he paused at a curve in the road and shaded his eyes to watch the boat which was already drawing near to the jetty he shivered in spite of the heat and started to walk more quickly towards the sea to anybody else it was just one more boat going about its ships affairs but to him it represented far more x first contact some of his men his men he saw the familiar shape of stockdale standing beside some of his newly bought belongings and felt a sudden touch of warmth even if colquhoun had said that not one single man of bolithos prizecrew could be spared for his first command he felt sure stockdale would have arrived aboard in his own way thickset and muscular in his broad white trousers and blue jacket he reminded him of some indestructible oak he too was watching the approaching boat his eyes slitted against the light with critical interest bolitho had been junior lieutenant in the frigate destiny when their paths had first crossed sent ashore on the thankless task of drumming up recruits for the ship and with little hope of much success he had arrived at a small inn with his party of seamen to set up headquarters and more to the point to find some peace and a moment to refresh himself for the next attempt to obtain volunteers tramping from village to village inn to inn the system rarely changed it usually resulted in a collection of those who were either too young for the harsh demands of a frigate or old sailors who had failed to find fortune or success ashore and merely wanted to return and end their days in surroundings they had originally sworn to forsake forever stockdale had been none of these he had been a prizefighter and stripped to the waist had been standing like a patient ox outside the inn while his sharpfaced barker had called upon all and sundry to risk a battering and win a guinea tired and thirsty bolitho had entered the inns momentarily leaving his small party to their own devices exactly what had happened next was not quite clear but on hearing a string of curses mingled with the loud laughter of the sailors he had hurried outside to find one of his men pocketing the guinez and the enraged barker beating stockdale round the head and shoulders with a length of chain whether the victorious seaman a powerful gunners mate well used to enforcing authority with brute force had tripped stockdale or gained a lucky blow was never discovered certainly bolitho had never see stockdale beaten in any fight fair or otherwise since that day as he had shouted at his men to fall in line again he had realised that stockdale had been standing as before taking the unjust punishment when with one stroke he could have killed the barker who was tormenting him sickened by the spectacle and angry with himself at the same time he had asked stockdale to volunteer for the kings service the mans dumb gratitude had been almost as embarrassing as the grins on the sailors faces but he had found some comfort in the barkers stunned disbelief as without a word stockdale had picked up his shirt and followed the party away from the inn if he had imagined that was the end of the matter he was soon to discover otherwise stockdale took to a life at sea in a manner born as strong as two men he was gentle and patient and whenever bolitho was in danger he always seemed to be there when a cutlass had hacked bolitho to the ground and his boats crew had retreated in panic it had been stockdale who had rallied them had fought off the attackers and carried his unconscious lieutenant to safety when bolitho had left the frigate for the trojan stockdale had somehow contrived to transfer also never far away he had bee his servant as well as a gun captain and when aboard the prize ship he had merely to glare at the captured crew to obtain instant respect he spoke very little and then only with a husky whisper his vocal cords had been maimed over the years of fighting for others in booths and fair grounds up and down the country but when bolithos promotion had been delivered he had said simply youll be needing a good coxn sirl he had given his lazy lopsided grin whatever sort ob a ship they gives you and so it was settled not that there would have been any doubt in bolithos mind either he turned as bolitho strode down the jetty and touched his hat all ready he ran his eyes over bolithos new uniform and nodded with obvious approval no moren you deserve sir bolitho smiled we shall have to see about that with oars tossed and a seaman already scrambling ashore with a line the cutter eased gently against the piles stockdale stooped and steadied the gunwale with his fist his eyes on the motionless oarsmen as he said hoarsely a fine day for it sir a slim midshipman leapt from the boat and removed his hat with a flourish about eighteen he was a pleasant looking youth and as tanned as a native im heyward sir he shifted under bolithos impassive gaze iive been sent to collect you sir bolitho nodded thank you mr heyward you can tell me about the ship as we go he waited for the midshipman and stockdale to follow his seachest and bags into the boat and then stepped after them shove off forrard out oars heyward seemed very conscious of bolithos nearness give way all like pale bones the oars rose and fell in regular precision bolitho glanced swiftly at the two lines ob oarsmen neatly dressed in check shirts and white trousers they looked fit and healthy enough a ship could always be judged by her boats some people contended bolitho knew otherwise some captains kept their boats as outward showpieces while within their own ships the people lived little better tha animals their expressions gave nothing away the usual homely faces of british sailors set in careful masks to avoid his scrutiny each man was probabla wondering about the new captain to any seaman his captain was not much junior to god he could leads and use his skills on their behalf in battle he might just as easily turn their lives into a daily hell with no one to whom they could protest or plead their cause the midshipman said haltingly we have been at anchor for three days sir before that patrol duty off guadeloupe we did sight a french brig but lost her sir how long have you been in sparrow two years sir since she commissioned on the thames at greenwich stockdale craned round there she is sir fine on the larboard bow bolitho sat upright in the sternsheets knowing that as soon as his eyes left the boat every man would be staring at him he could barely contain his excitemen as he peered towards the anchored sloop which was now fully in view beyond a heavy transport she was riding almost motionless above the twin of her own reflection her ensign making a scarlet patch of colour against the hazeshrouded hills beyond bolitho had seen sloops in plenty during his service like frigates they were everywhere and always in demand maids of all work the eyes of the fleet they were familiar in most naval harbours but right at this moment in time he also knew that the sparrow was going to be different for all those others from her gently spiralling mastheads to the single line of open gun ports she was a thing of beauty a thoroughbred a miniature frigate a vessel which seemed eager to be free of the land she was all and none of these things he heard himself say steer round her bows as the tiller went over he was conscious of the silence broken only by the sluice of water around the cutters stern and the rhythmic creak of oars as if he was sharing this moment with nobody like a raked black finger the sloops long jibboom swept out and over his head and for a few more moments he stared up at the figurehead below the bowsprit a mansized sparrow beak wide in fury and wings spread as if to fight its curved claws firmly gripping a gilded cluster ob oak leaves and acorns bolitho watched until the boat had moved around and under the starboard catheyd he had never thought a mere sparrow could be depicted as being so warlike he started with surprise as his eyes fell on a gun muzzle in the first port heyward said respectfully we have a thirtytwopounder on either bow sir the rest of the gun deck is made up of sixteen pounders he flinched as bolitho turned to look at him i beg your pardon sir did not mean to intrude bolitho smiled and touched his arm i was merela surprised she seems to have very heavy artillery for such a small ship he shook his head those two bowchasers must have brought many an enema aback with shock ninepounders are more common in sloops i believe the midshipman nodded but his eyes were on the ships side his lips in an anxious line as he gauged the moment put her about the cutter swung in a tight arc and headed for the main chains there were many heads lining the gangway and bolitho saw the blue and white of an officers uniform by the entry port a press of more figures by the mainmast toss your oars the boat idled towards the chains where the bowman brought down his boathook with a welltimed slash bolitho stood up in the sternsheets conscious of all the eyes above and around him of stockdales hands halfraised ready to steady him if he lost his balance of the new sword at his hip and not wanting to look down to make sure it would not tangle with his legs as he climbed up the sleek tumblehome with a quick breath he reached out and hauled himself from the boat he had been prepared for almost everything but was still taken totally off guard by the piercing shrill of pipes as his head and shoulders rose through the port perhaps more than anything else the timehonoured salute from a ship to her captain made him realise just how great was the step from lieutenants berth to command it was all too much to take in and comprehend in this small cameo the drawn swords the boatswains mates with their silver calls to their lips the barebacked seamen on the gangways and high in the shrouds below his feet he felt the deck lift easily and once more was aware of the change this ship had brought him after the trojans fat bulk her massive weight of guns and spars this sloop even felt alive one officer stepped forward as bolitho removed his hat to the quarterdeck and said welcome aboard sir i am graves second lieutenant bolitho regarded him searchingly the lieutenant was young and alert but had the controlled caution on his dark features of a man much older he half turned and added the others are awaiting your plea sure sir bolitho asked and the first lieutenant graves looked away in the flagship sir he had an appointment he faced him quickly he meant no disrespect sir i am quite sure of that bolitho nodded graves s explanation was too swifts too glib or that of a man who wished to draw attention to the absent officers behaviour by excusing it graves hurried on this is mr buckle the sailing master sir mr dalkeith surgeon his voice followed bolitho down the small line of senior warrant officers bolitho marked each face but checked himself from further contact that would come soon enough but now his own impression on them was far more vital he stood by the quarterdeck rail and stared down at the gun deck the sparrow was one hundred and ten feet long on that deck but had a broad beam of thirta feet almost that of a frigate no wonder she could contain such powerful armament for her size he said have the hands lay aft mr graves as the order was passed and the men came pressing down on those already assembled he drew his commission from his pocket and spread it on the rail how hot the wood felt beneath his hands again he darted a glance at the faces beneath him in so small a ship how did they all manage to exist there were one hundred and fifteen souls crammed aboard sparrow and as they jostled together below the quarterdeck there appeared to be twice that number graves touched his hat all present sir bolitho replied with equal formality thank you then in a steady voice he began to read himself in he had heard other captains do it often enough but as he read the beautifully penned words he felt once more like a spectator it was addressed to richard bolitho esquire and required him forthwith to go on board and take upon him the charge and command of captain in his britannic majestys sloopofwar sparrow once or twice as his voice carried along the deck he heard a man cough or move his feet and aboard another sloop close by he saw an officer watching the proceedings through a telescope he put the commission in his coat and said i will go to my quarters mr graves he replaced his hat and walked slowly towards a covered hatch just forward of the mizzen mast he noticed that the ships wheel was completely unsheltered a bad place in a storm he thought or when the balls begin to fly at his back he heard the rising murmur of voices as the men were dismissed and noticed too the heavy smell of cooking in the listless air he was glad he had restrained himself from making a speech it would have been vanity and he knew it all the same it was so precious a day that he wanted to share it with all ob them in some way in his excitement he had forgotten about the time now as he made his way down a ladder to the gun deck and aft behind graves s crouched figure he was more than glad he had restricted himself to the formal reading of his appointment men kept standing in the sun to hear a pompous speech were one thing men kept also from their wellearned meal were something else entirely he gasped as his head crashed against a deck beam graves spun round i beg your pardon sir he seemed terrified bolitho should blame him for the lack of headroom i will remember next time he reached the stern cabin and stepped inside for an instant he stood motionless taking in the graceful sloping stern windows which spread from quarter to quarter displaying the anchorage and the headland like some glistening panorama the cabin was beautifully painted in pale green the panels picked out with gold leaf the deck was concealed with a black and white checked canvas covering and arranged on either side was a selection of wellmade furniture gingerly he raised his head and found he could just stand upright between the beams above graves was watching him worriedly i am afraid that after a shipoftheline sir youll find this somewhat cramped bolitho smiled have the ships books brought to me after you have dined mr graves i will also want to meet the other officers informally sometime today he paused seeing again the caution in his eyes including the first lieutenant graves bowed himself out and bolitho turned his back to the closed door cramped after a shipoftheline graves had said he hurled his hat across the cabin on to the bench seat below the windows his sword he unbuckled and dropped in a green velvet chair he was laughing aloud and the effort to restrain it was almost painful cramped he walked ducking between the beams it was a palace after the trojans wardroom he sat down beside his hat and stared around the neat cheerfullooking cabin and it was his own freedom it was late afternoon when bolitho finally decided he had read all that there was available about the ship around him muster and punishment books watchbills and ledgers of stores and victualling returns the list seemed endless but at no time was he bored with his new coat hanging on a chairback his neckcloth loosened and shirt unbuttoned he found each item fascinating his predecessor captain ransome had kept a smart and wellrun ship on the face of things the punishment book had all the usual culprits and awards for minor misdemeanours a few for drunkenness even less for insolence and insubordination and the worst recorded crime was that of a seaman who had struck a petty officer during gun drill ransome had been extremely lucky in one thing with the ship being commissioned on the thames he had been able to secure the cream of the press men off incoming merchant ships transfers from vessels laid up in ordinary he had been in a position to complete his company with far less difficulty than most captains against the apparent taut atmosphere in the ship was a rather negative list of reports in the log books only once had sparrow been called to action in the two years since leaving england and then as secondary reinforcement to a frigate attacking a blockade runner it was little wonder that midshipman heyward had showed some concern at his remarks about the big bow chasers he had probably imagined his words to be some sort of criticism at their lack of use there were the usual lists of men transferred to other ships because of promotion and the like their places had been filled by what ransome had termed local colonist volunteers in his personal log bolitho had lingered a good deal on the previous captains daily records his comments were extremely brief and it was impossible to get even a feel of the man as he paused to glance around the cabin from time to time bolitho found himself wondering about ransome an experienced and competent officer obviously a man ob good breeding and therefore influence the cabin seemed at odds with his mental portrait extremely attractive comfortable yet just that too much removed from what you might expect in a shipofwar he sighed and leaned back in the chair as his cabin servant fitch padded into the shafted sunlight to remove the remains of his meal fitch was tiny a miserable scrap of a man who had already confessed to having been a petty thief in his unfortunate past saved from transportation or worse by the timely arrival of a kings ship as he awaited sentence at the assizes he had accepted life at sea more as an extension to his punishment than any love of service but he seemed a capable servant and was probably well pleased with his work it kept him from the heavier tasks on deck and provided his current master was a humane man he had little to fear bolitho watched him as he collected the crockery on to a tray it had been an excellent meal cold tongue and fresh vegetables from ashore and the claret which fitch had mournfully observed wa the last of capn ransomes stock had been a touch of perfection your late captain bolitho saw the small man stiffen did he leave any instruction as to his property aboard fitch dropped his eyes mr tyrrell as attended to its sir its been sent to a transport for passage ome he must have been an officer of some consequence bolitho hated this form of questioning but he felt he needed some link no matter how small with the man who had controlled this ship from the day she had slid into the water fitch bit his lip e were a strict capn sir e saw that the ands took fairly to their work if they obeyed e was appy if not he shrugged his frail shoulder then e tended to swear a piece bolitho nodded you may leave it was useless to proceed with fitch his life concerned only the comings and goings food and drink a warm cot or a swift curse if things were not to his masters liking feet padded overhead and he had to restrain himself from running to the stern windows or standing on a chair to peer through the skylight above the table he thought of his old companions in the trojans wardroom and wondered if they were missing him probably not his promotion would mean a gap and therefore a step up the ladder for another he smiled to himself it would take time to fit himself into this new role time and vigilance there was a tap at the door and mathias buckle the sailing master stepped inside do you have a moment sir bolitho gestured to a chair again this was so unlike a bigger shipofwar there were no marines in the company and visitors to the captains quarters seemed free to come and go almost as they pleased perhaps ransome had encouraged such informality he watched buckle fitting himself into the chair he was a short squarebuilt man with steady eyes and hair almost as dark as his own aged forty he was the oldest man in the ship buckle said id not trouble you sir but as the first lieutenants away i thought he shifted in the chair i thought i should settle the matter of promotion for one of the hands bolitho listened in silence as buckle ran through the points which concerned a man named raven it was an internal matter but he was conscious of the importance it represented the very first time as captain he was being confronted with the affairs of one of his own company buckle was saying i thought begging your pardons sir that we might advance him to masters mate for a trial period bolitho asked how long have you been master just in this ship sir buckles clear eyes were distant before that i was masters mate in the old warrior seventyfour youve done well mr buckle he was trying to place the dialect london or further east kent how does she handle buckle seemed to consider it shes heavy for her size sir all of four hundred and thirty tons but the better the wind the livelier she goes you can even get the stunsails and royals on her in anything but a true blow he frowned in a calm she can be the devils daughter he gestured vaguely youve probably seen the little port alongside each gun port sir bolitho had not he said slowly i am not too sure buckle smiled for the first time if you gets becalmed you may run a sweep through each o those ports sir clear lower deck and get every manjack on the sweeps and you can still get a knot or two out ob her bolitho looked away reading the ships books and correspondence had not even told him the half of it he felt vaguely angry that his first lieutenant was still not present normally the departing captain would have been aboard to tell him the ships behaviour and failings or at least the senior lieutenant buckle said youll soon get the feel of her sir shes the best yet bolitho eyed him thoughtfully the master was nobodys fool and yet like graves he seemed to be holding back maybe waiting for him to display his strength or weakness to them he made himself reply coldly we shall see about that mr buckle when he glanced up he saw the man watching him with sudden andiety he added any other matter buckle rose to his feet no sir good i anticipate that sailing orders will be arriving shortly i will expect the ship to be ready buckle nodded aye sir have no fear bolitho relented slightly it was just possible his own uncertainty was making him unnecessarily harsh towards his sailing master and it was equally likely he would need buckles guiding hand very much until he got the feel of his new command he said i have no doubt that i will be as satisfied with your appointment as captain ransome was buckle swallowed hard yes sir he stared round the low cabin thank you sir the door closed behind him and bolitho ran his fingers through his hair just a few hours since he had climbed aboard to the squeal of pipes and already he was beginning to feel different it was all so alien to his past life when you could argue and compete with your companions curse your captain behind his back or reveal his weakness which only you really understood as from today a mere word could bring a shutter across a mans eyes or make him fear for his own safety buckle was eighteen years his senior yet at the first hint of bolithos displeasure had almost cringed he closed his eyes and tried to fathom out how he should proceed to try to be too popular was to be a fool to hold unswervingly to matters of discipline and order was to be a tyrant he recalled colquhouns words and grinned ruefully until you reached colquhouns lofty postrank you could never be certain of anything somewhere beyond the bulkhead he heard a challenge and a shouted reply from a boat then the squeak of a hull alongside the patter of feet on a gangway it seemed unreal and incredible that the ships his ship was running her affairs while he just sat here at the table he sighed again and stared at the pile ob papers and books it would take longer than he had imagined to adjust there was another rap at the door and graves ducked inside removing his hat and jamming it under his arm as he announced the guardboat has just been alongside sir he held out a heavily sealed canvas envelope from the flag sir bolitho took it and laid it carelessly on the table his sailing orders without doubt and he had to restrain himself from acting as he truly felt he wanted to rip them open to know and understand what was required of him he saw graves looking round the cabin his eyes passing swiftly over the discarded dress coat the hat lying on the bench seat and finally on bolithos unbuttoned shirt graves said quickly will you wish me to stay sir no i will inform you of their content when i have had time to study them graves nodded i am waiting for the last waterlighter to come out to us sir i have sent the cooper ashore to speed them up but bolitho smiled then attend to it if you please bolitho watched him leave and then slit open the envelope he was still reading the neatly worded orders when he heard voices in the passageway beyond the door graves first curt and resentful then another calm to begin with and then loud with anger the latter finished with well how in gods name was to know you could have made a signal you bloody fool there was a sudden silence and then a further tap on the door the lieutenant who stepped into the cabin was not at all what bolitho had been expecting too junior for temporary command colquhoun had said and yet this man was probably two years older than himself he was tall broadshouldered and deeply tanned his thick auburn hair brushed the deckhead between the beams so that he seemed to fill the cabin bolitho glanced up at him calmly mr tyrrell the lieutenant nodded briefly sir he took a quick breath i must apologise for my late arrival aboard have been in th flagship bolitho looked down at the table tyrrell had an easy drawl the mark of a man born and bred in the american colony he was like a halftamed animal and the quickness of his breathing betrayed the anger which he still harboured bolitho added our sailing orders have just arrived tyrrell did not seem to hear it was personal business sir i hadnt th time to arrange otherwise i see he waited watching the man as he stared restlessly towards the stern windows he had a strange way ob standing with one arm hanging down his side the other inclined towards his sword relaxed but wary like someone expecting an attack he continued i would have preferred to meet ma first lieutenant on board when i arrived i have sent capn ransomes remains ashore to be conveyed home with his possessions sir as you were not yet in command i felt personally free to act as thought fit he looked at bolitho evenly i was aboard th flagship to ask plead if required for a transfer to another ship it was refused you felt that by being passed over for command that your talents would be better suited elsewhere is that it tyrrell gave a slow smile it changed him instantly from an angry man to one of obvious charm with the inbuilt recklessness of a fighter i really am sorry sir but no it was not that as you no doubt know i am what th late capn ransome would term a local colonist he added bitterly although when i came aboard a year back it appeared we were all on th same side against the rebels bolitho stiffened it was strange he had never considered the feelings of those like tyrrell before good american families loyal to the crown the first to stand together against the sudden revolution in their midst but as the war had spread and britain had fought to retain a grip then a foothold in the colony the loyal ones like tyrrell had all at once become the outsiders he asked quietly where is your home virginia gloucester county my father came out from england to found a coastal shipping trade i was master of one of his schooners when th war began have been in th kings service since that time and your family tyrrell looked away god knows i have heard nothing of them and you wished to transfer to a ship nearer home to take yourself back to what you now consider your own people bolitho did not conceal the bite in his tone no sir that aint it he raised one arm and dropped it again his voice angry i am a kings officers no matter what ransome chose to believe damn his eyes bolitho stood up i will not have talk of your late captain tyrrell replied stubbornly capn ransome is safe now in his cask of spirits in th hold of a transport his widow at his great london residence will weep for hims his service which cost him his life he laughed shortly fever they said he looked round the cabin see all this sir a womans hand we barely logged a mile in sparrow without him having some damned doxa aboard for company he seemed unable to stop himself thats th sort of fever which killed him in the end and damned good riddance if you ask me bolitho sat down once again the ground had been cut from under him women here in this cabin he had heard of such things in grander ships but only occasionally but in sparrow where there could be little safety if called to do battle it was unthinkable tyrrell was studying him grimly i had to tell you sir its my way but ill say this one thing more if disease hadnt taken him id have killed him myself bolitho looked up sharply then youre a fool if you have no more strength than in your bare hands then will ask for your transfer and make no mistake about it tyrrell stared at a point beyond bolithos shoulder would you behave so calmly sir if one of th women had been your sister the door opened a bare inch and stockdales battered face peered in at them in his hand was balanced a small silver tray two glasses and a decanter he wheezed thought you might want a bit od refreshment sir he watched the two men and added sort o celebration like bolitho gestured to the table and waited until stockdale had left still without speaking he filled the glasses conscious of tyrrells eyes following every movement a bad start for both of them if there was still time to make amends it was now this minute iftyrrell took advantage of his surrender there was no saying where it would lead he handed him a glass and said gravely i have two sisters mr tyrrell in answer to your question i daresay that i would not he smiled seeing the sudden surprise in the lieutenants eyes i suggest you propose a toast for the pair of us eh tyrrell reached out and held his glass against bolithos then lets drink to a new beginning sir bolitho held his glass steady no transfer he shook his head none bolitho raised the glass then to a new beginning he took a sip and added quietly which is well for your mr tyrrell we are sailing tomorrow to join the inshore squadron he paused seeing the sudden desperation on the other mans features not so very far from the coast of maryland tyrrell said thank god i know im being stupid but just being off that shoreline again will make th world a difference bolitho put down his glass then i will meet our officers informally at the close of the first dog watch he was careful to make his tone formal again each ob them had shown enough of his inner reserves for the present in the meantime you can take me on an inspection around the ship and i will want to see everything good and bad tyrrell nodded so you shall sir a slow grin spread across his face i have a shrewd feeling that sparrow is going to fly like shes never done before he stood aside as bolitho threw on his coat and buttoned his shirt now if you will follow me sir bolitho looked at tyrrells broad shoulders as they walked towards the sunlight on the gun deck and held down a sigh if each day was going to present a battle of wills it would make the privilege of command a testing experience he said we will begin with the starboard battery mr tyrrell the first lieutenant paused below the break in the quarterdeck as you said sir everything he grinned again good and bad stockdale picked up bolithos shaving bowl and peered at the untouched breakfast on the cabin table overhead and throughout the ship the air was alive with noise and bustle to a landsman the activity ob preparing to get under way would appear haphazard and disorganised but to the practised eye each man had his place and his reason for being there the miles of cordage and rigging each scrap of sail had z vital part to play if a ship was to move and act to perfection bolitho crossed to the stern windows and stared at the nearest strip of land it was a bright morning with the sky above the hills very pale washedout and clean he could just see the staff above the headland battery its flag no longer listless but lifting and curling to a fair northeysterly it was almost physical pain to stay sealed in the cabin waiting and fretting for the exact moment to show himself voices pealed along the upper deck and shadows flitted busily across the skylight occasionally he could hear the plaintive squeak of a fiddle the distorted rumble of a shanty as the men tramped around the capstan in the past hours and for most of the night he had tossed and turned in his cot listening to the sea noises the creak of timbers and rigging his mind exploring every contingency his brain bursting to the mental picture of his chart every unemployed eye would be watching him this morning from the flagships quarterdeck to some unknown lieutenant who probably hated bolitho for getting the golden chance which he considered should have been his the coffee sir stockdale hovered by the table while its still ot bolitho swung round to curse him for breaking his racing thoughts but the sight of his anxious face was too much for him as was so often the case he sat down at the table and tried to relax stockdale was right if he had forgotten anything it was already too late you could cram your head just so much after that the mind became awash and confused beyond reason he sipped his coffee and stared at the cold meat he could not touch that his stomach was already twisting with apprehension the lean slices of pork would be just enough to tip the balance stockdale peered through the windows it will be a good passage sir long enough to get the measure ob these fellows bolitho glanced up at him he must be a mindreader in company with another sloop they were to escort two fat transports with supplies for the troops at philadelphia once a rendezvous with the inshore squadron had been made two thousand miles mostly in open waters would certainly allow him time to test himself and his company he had met his officers in the small wardroom the previous evening with the exception of tyrrell all had been aboard since commissioning at greenwich he felt vaguely jealous of their obvious familiarity with the sparrow the two midshipmen each eighteen years old had joined as untrained novices they had grown up in the sparrows and were now hopefully awaiting promotion it was a pity they were only midshipmen he thought they might vie too much for their captains approval where in a larger ship and with more competition amongst the young gentlemen it would be less direct buckle had said little during their informal meeting reserved and no doubt waiting to see how his captain would behave under sail he had restricted himself to matters of navigation robert dalkeith the surgeon was an odd one young but already too plump for his own good he was also completely bald and wore a bright red wig but he appeared more skilled in his trade than was usual in a kings ship as well as cultivated and bolitho imagined there was more to him than he showed at face value lock the purser a bobbing genial stick of a manb completed the gathering graves had joined them later making a good deal ob noise about his trouble with the waterlighters the difficulties in obtaining help ashore for loading boatss in fact the list had been formidable tyrrell had interrupted cheerfully it aint fair hector you being singled out to be a bloody martyr like this graves had frowned and then forced a smile when the others had joined tyrrell in the laughter bolitho leaned back and stared at the skylight he was not sure of graves either a hard worker ransomes toady it was hard to see where the latent bad feeling had started between him and tyrrell but it was there right enough captain sir bolitho started and looked at the door midshipman bethune was standing with his hat under his arm his free hand grasping the hilt of his dirk he was roundfaced sturdy youth and his face was a mass of dark freckles well bethune swallowed mr tyrrells respects sir and the transports have weighed fawn has her preparative hoisted sir he glanced curiously round the cabin bolitho nodded gravely i will be up directly with elaborate care he forced himself to take another sip of coffee it almost choked him fawn was the other sloop for the escort and would be carrying colquhoun in addition to her commander as senior officer the midshipman was still inside the cabin he added awkwardly i am from cornwall too sir bolitho smiled in spite of his tension the competition had begun already he replied i will try not to hold it against you mr bethune he dropped his eyes as the boy fled from the cabin he stood up and took his hat from stockdale then with a brief nod he strode out towards the waiting sunlight the gangways and decks seemed more crowded than ever as seamen ran this way and that pursued by the hoarse shouts of their petty officers as he reached the quarterdeck he saw two heavy transports idling towards the headland their tan sails flapping and billowing in the breeze tyrrell touched his hat anchors hove short sir thank you bolitho strode to the larboard side and stared towards the anchored fawn he could see the muddle of men at her capstan the scurrying preparations as the cable became bartaut beneath her beakhead he crossed to the opposite side trying to ignore the seamen who were poised at their stations on every hand beyond the nearest headland towards the hard blue horizon he saw a lively pattern of small white horses once outside this sheltered anchorage it would be good sailing weather he glanced at the sluggish swirl of currents around a nearby storeship and bit his lip he had to get free of all the shipping first fawns signal is close up sir bethune was clinging to the shrouds with his telescope althougn colquhouns signal was clear enough to be seen without any glass stand by on the capstan tyrrell ran to the rail and cupped his big hands loose th headsls beside the wheel buckle stood near the two helmsmen his eyes watching bolitho breeze is freshening a mite sir yes bolitho walked to the rail and stared along his command he saw graves watching over the anchor party midshipman heyward at the foot of the mainmast with his division of seamen signal sir up anchor hands aloft and loose topsls he stood back to watch the seamen surging up the shrouds and out along the swaying yards their bodies black against the sky tyrrell said very little and bolitho observed that the topmen were well able to manage without added inducement from the deck as canvas thundered loosely from the yards and the ship gave a longdrawn shudder he saw the fawns masts already swinging across the stern her foretopsail filling to the wind as she heeled over bethune called signal make haste sir he lowered his glass trying to avoid bolithos eye man the braces he tried to shut out colquhouns last signal maybe he was endeavouring to goad him into doing something foolish perhaps he was always the same but nothing must or would spoil this moment from forward came the cry anchors aweigh sir free of the land the sparrow tilted steeply to the wind the headland sliding across her jibboom as with more and more canvas thundering and hardening from her yards she paid off into the wind blocks clattered and whined and high above the decks the seamen sprang about like monkeys bolitho looked at buckle lay her on the larboard tack then set a course to weather the headland he held the masters gaze and added we will get the courses on her directly and see if we can take the edge off fawns lead moments later with her courses and topsails filling to the morning breeze the sparrow glided swiftly past an anchored twodecker which wore a viceadmirals flag at the fore bolitho glanced at tyrrell and saw him give a quick grimace he might have cause to regret his application for transfer bolitho thought and so if his trust in tyrrell proved false would he between two anchored indiamen and on down the fairway towards that beckoning headland small craft bobbed astern in the frothing wake and when bolitho moved from studying the compass he saw they had already cut fawns lead by half a cable buckle glanced at the surgeon who was clinging to the mizzen shrouds with one hand and holding on to his outrageous wig with the other he winked we have a rare one here mr dalkeith dalkeith kept his face immobile as bolitho glanced aft towards him before replying poor captai ransome would never have left port with such dashs eh he gave a sly grin but then at this time o the morning he would have been somewhat tired they both laughed bolithos voice brought them up with a jerk there is a yawl on the larboard bow mr buckle laugh later with my blessing but run her down within sight of the flagship and you will laugh to another tune he turned back to the rail as buckle hurled himself towards his helmsman the tip of the headland was already dropping abeam and he felt the sparrows stem bite into the first gentle roller her deck tilting still further under her press of canvas tyrrell shouted anchors secured sir spray had soaked his face and shirt but he was grinning broadly bolitho nodded good now get the forecourse trimmed it looks like a piece of untidy linen but he could not hold his severity by god she flies does she not he looked aloft at the squared sails and braced yards the masthead pendant which flicked out like a coachmans whip he had seen it all before so mana times but now it felt as if it was unique bethune called from fawn sir take station to wind rd bolitho smiled at him acknowledge to the quarterdeck at large he added a fine morning by the hatchway stockdale watched bolithos pleasure and felt inwardly happy he ran his eye over the hurrying seamen as they slithered down once more to the deck tanned and healthy what did they know about anything he picked his uneven teeth with an ivory pin the captain had seen more action in the past years than they knew about he watched bolithos squared shoulders as he paced restlessly on the weather side given time theyd come to find out he decided the privateer bolithe opened his eyes and stared for severyl seconds at the unlit lantern spiralling above his cot despite the weariness in his limbs and the fact he had been on deck repeatedly during the night he found it hard to sleep beyond the screen which partitioned his sleeping quarters from the cabin he could see the pale light of dawn and knew from the lanterns sluggish movement and the uneasy creak of timbers that the wind was little more than a breeze he tried to relaxs wondering how long it would take to break the habit ob awakening with each dawn to enjoy his newfound privacy feet thudded on the quarterdeck above and he guessed that soon now the seamen would be turning to for another day it had been two weeks since the little convoy had sailed from antigua and in that time they had covered only half their set distance one thousand miles in open waters and each mile marked by perverse winds and no winds at all barely an hour passed without the need to call the hands to make or shorten sail to trim yards in the hope of catching a dying breeze or to reef against one violent and taunting squall buckles gloomy prediction about sparrows sailing qualities in a poor wind had proved only too true time and time again she had paid off her canvas flapping in confusion as yet one more wind had died and left them almost becalmed hard work and angry words had eventually brought her back on station again only to have the whole thing repeated before the end of a watch patrol and scouting duty had been the lot ob sparrows company for most of their commission and they had yet to learn the true misery of convoy over long passages the two transports had not helped they appeared totally unwilling to realise the importance of staying in close company so that if they became scattered by a swift squall it took many hours to urge threaten and finally drive them back into formation colquhouns curt signals had only succeeded in antagonising the master of one of thems a big transport named golden fleece on more than one occasion he had ignored the signals altogether or had caused the fawn to witheraw from her proper station at the head of the convoy in order to commence a verbal exchange which could be heard by everyone else nearby bolitho climbed from the cot and walked slowly into the cabin feeling the deck lifting gently beneath his bare feet before slipping away in a trough the motio bringing the usual clatter of blocks the drawnout groan of the rudder as the helmsman brought the sloop back under command he leaned his hands on the sill of the stern windows and stared out at the empty sea the two transports if they were still together would be somewhere on sparrows starboard bow bolithos orders were to stay to windward of the wellladen ships so as to be reada to run down on any suspicious vessel and hold the maximum advantage until she was proved friend or foe in fact they had sighted an unknown sail on three separate occasions far astern it had been impossible to know if it was the same on each sighting or three individual vessels either way colquhoun had refused to be drawn to investigate bolitho could sympathise with his unwillingness to leave the valuable transports especially as the wind might choose the very moment when his sparse forces were scattered to play a new trick or bring some real enemy amongst them on the other hand he was very conscious of a sense of uneasiness after each call from the masthead the strange sail was like a willothewisps and if it was hostile could be methodically following the little convoy awaiting exactly the right moment to attack the door opened and fitch padded into the cabin carrying two jugs one was coffee and the other contained water from the galley for bolithos shave in the pale light from the windows he looked smaller and scrawnier than ever and as usual kept his eyes averted while he prepared the necessary cup for bolithos first coffee of the day how is it on deck fitch raised his eyes only slightly mr tilby reckons itll be another roastin day sir tilby was the boatswain a great untidy hulk of a man who was given to some of the most profane language bolitho had heard in ten years at sea but his knowledge of weather his forecast of what each dawn might bring had been only too accurate and under a blazing sun with little space to find shade or comfort the sparrows seamen had more torment to face before night found them again it was amazing how they all managed to survive in such a small hull what with extra stores and spare sparss powder and shot and countless other requirements fo keeping a ship at sea some of the men were hard put to find space for a hammock in addition the sparrow had all the great lengths of anchor cable to be neatla stowed when she was under way severyl hundred fathoms of thirteeninch hemp for the main anchors and another hundred of eightinch for the kedge took up more space than fifty human beings required for even the most basic needs but if this or any other ship was to survive and live from her own resources then such discomforts had to be endured he sipped the coffee if only the wind would freshen and stay with them it would help drive away the weariness and drudgery of work aloft and also give him time to drill the guns crews to better advantage they had had few such drills during the first days out ob harbour and once more he had been made aware ob the strange attitude of acceptance he had originalla noticed perhaps they had been so long without actually being called to do battle they had taken the drills as merely something to be tolerated even expected from a new captain their timing had been good enough if somewhat rigid they had gone through all the motions of running out traversing and pointings but again and again he had felt something was badla lacking as the crews had faced outboard through their open ports he had sensed their indifference there was nothing to fight so what was the point of it all their relaxed bodies seemed to indicate he had tackled tyrrell about it but the first lieutenant had said cheerfully hell sir it dont signify they wont be able to fight if th time calls for it bolithos sharp reply brought a new barrier between them and for the moment he was prepared to let it remain captain ransome must have used the sloop like a personal possession a yacht he thought sometimes during the night when bolitho had come down to the cabin after a frustrating hour on deck watching the hands shortening sail yet again he had pictured ransome with some woman or other or tyrrell pacing the quarterdeck tearing himself apart as he imagined his sister just a few feet below him he had not mentioned the matter to tyrrell since his first outbursts but had found himself wondering about the real storys and what had happened to the girl after ransomes sudden death stockdale came into the cabin with the shavin bowl he glared at fitch and wheezed get the capns breakfast to bolitho he added nother clear mornin sir he waited until bolitho was in his chair and then held the razor against the window he seemed content with its edge wot we need is a real good blow he showed his uneven teeth make some o these young puppies jump about bolitho relaxed as the razor moved precisely over his chin stockdale said very little but he always seemed to hit the exact point in between strokes he replied in another month well be in the hurricane season again stockdale hope that will satisfy you the big coxswain grunted seen em afore usll see em again an live to tell of it bolitho gave up nothing it seemed could break the mans supreme confidence in his ability to produce a miracle even in the face of a hurricane voices rang out overhead and then he heard feet dashing down the companion ladder from the quarterdeck it was midshipman heyward impeccable as ever in spite of being on his feet for much of the night captain sir he watched stockdales razor poised in midair mr gravess respects and fawn has just signalled sail to the noreast bolitho snatched the towel very well i will come up stockdale laid down the bowl that same one sir bolitho shook his head unlikely shed never overreach us in one night even if she was after our blood he rubbed his face vigorously but in this empty sea a sight of anything is welcome when he reached the quarterdeck he found tyrell and most of the others already there below the mainmast the hands had just been mustered in readiness for the morning assault on the decks with holystones and swabs while others were waiting by the pumps or just staring up at the barely filled sails graves touched his hat mastheyd lookout has not yet sighted anything sir bolitho nodded and strode to the compass northwest by north it seemed as if it had been riveted in that direction since time began it was hardly surprising fawn had sighted the newcomer first in her position ahead and slightly to starboard of the transports she was better placed all the same he would have wished otherwise fawns signals and execution ob colquhouns orders always seemed to be that much quicker than his through the crisscross of rigging and shrouds and slightly to starboard of the rearmost transport he saw the other sloop tacking awkwardly in the gentle westerly breeze with every stitch of canvas on her braced yards she was barely making headway from aloft came the sudden cry deck there sail on the starboard beam tyrrell crossed to bolithos side what dyou think one of our own graves said swiftly or a damned yankee eh bolitho saw the exchange of glances the sudden hostility between them like something physical he said calmly we will know directly gentlemen midshipman bethune called from fawn sir remain on station graves said complacently there goes fawn shes going about to take a soldiers wind under her tail bolitho said get aloft mr graves i want to know everything you can discover about that sail graves stared at him ive a good hand aloft sir bolitho met his resentment gravely and now require a good officer there too mr graves an experienced eye and not just a clear one graves moved stiffly to the weather shrouds and after the merest hesitation began to climb tyrrell said quietly do him good that one bolitho glanced around the crowded quarterdeck maybe mr tyrrell but if you imagine i am using ma authority to foster some petty spite between you then must assure you otherwise he lowered his voice it is an enemy we are fighting not each other then he took a telescope from the rack and walked to the foot of the mizzen mast steadying his legs against the uncomfortable motion he trained the glass on the fawn and then very slowly beyond her minutes passed and then as the distant ship lifted on some large roller he saw her topgallant sails shining in the first sunlight like matched pink shells she was clawing her way closehauled on a converging course her yards braced so tightly they were almost foreandaft graves yelled down frigate sir a pause as every man looked up at his tiny silhouette against the sky english built bolitho stayed silent english built perhaps but who now stood behind her guns he watched fawn edging round her masthead pendant lifting and curling listlessly more flags shot up her yards and bethune yelled from fawn sir recognition signal a further pause as he groped through his grubby book shes the miranda thirtytwo captain selby sir buckle said to the deck at large from england most likely the light was already stronger and as he stared across the brightening water bolitho could feel the firs warm rays against his face from england every man aboard was probably thinking of those words except for tyrrell and the colonists in the company but all the rest would be picturing his own past way of life village or farm some ale house outside a harbour or fishing port a womans face a childs last grip before the harder hands of the pressgang he found himself thinking of his own home in falmouth the great stone house below pendennis castle where his father would be waiting and wondering about him and his brother hugh while he remained in cornwall like all the bolitho ancestorss his father had been a seaofficer but having lost an arm and his health was now confined to a landbound existence always within sight of the ships and the sea which had forsaken him from fawn sir general heave to colquhoun it seemed was quite satisfied with the other ships identity for once the two transports needed no extra goading to obey the signal perhaps like the rest they too were eager for news from that other world bolitho closed the glass and handed it to z boatswains mate shorten sail mr tyrrell and heave to as orderedl he waited until the lieutenant had shouted for the topmen to get aloft and then added that frigate has been hard worked so her mission must be important he had watched the newcomer while she had forged towards the uneven cluster of ships had seen the great scars on her hull where the sea had pared away the paintwork like a giant knife her sails too looked much repaired evidence of a rapid voyage bethune shouted mirandas hoisted another signals sir he swayed in the shrouds as he tried to level his big telescope to fawn captain repair on board once again fawns response was swift her big gig being swayed out within minutes of the signal bolitho could imagine colquhoun hurrying to the other ship and the mirandas consternation when they discovered that he was senior to their own captain whatever it entailed the matter was obviousla urgent and not merely an exchange of gossip at this chance encounter in open waters bolitho rubbed his chin and said im going below call me if anything happens in the cabin he found stockdale waiting with his coat and sword his lopsided grin very broad as he muttered thought youd be wantin these sir fitch was gripping the table his legs spread apart as the sloop rolled and staggered in the uncomfortable troughs the power gone from her sails he was staring at the breakfast he had just brought his narrow features resigned bolitho smiled never fear ill find time to eat it later it was strange that the mere sight of another ship the obscure hint of excitement had given him an appetite at last he gulped down some coffee as stockdale adjusted his swordbelt before handing him the coat perhaps miranda had discovered an enemy and needed help to attack them maybe the war was overs or another had broken out elsewhere the possibilities seemed endless he looked up and saw tyrrell peering through the open skylight capn sir the fawns gig is shoving off from the frigate bolitho replied thank you he forcibly disguised his disappointment that was quick tyrrell vanished and he added quietly therell be time for breakfast after all he was mistaken even as he began to unfasten his swordbelt tyrrells face reappeared at the skylight his words filling the cabin as he shouted from fawn sir repair on board forthwith stockdale bounded from the cabin his hoarse voice bellowing for the gigs crew which the boatswain had already thought prudent to muster with frantic haste the boat was swung outboard and dropped alongside where with little thought for dignita or safety bolitho hurled himself into the sternsheetss his sword clattering against the gunwale and almost tripping him on top of the oarsmen stockdale bawled give way all in a lower but no less menacing tone he added an remember ma beauties if one o you misses a stroke youll ave me to answer the gig seemed to fly across the water and when at last bolitho regained his composure and looked astern he saw the sparrow was already a cable clear she was pitching steeply in the swell her sails rippling and flashing in disorder while she lay hove to in the pale sunlight in spite of his own busy thoughts and andieta he could still find time to admire her in the past he had often watched the stern cabin of a passing manofwar and pondered about her captain what sort of persons his qualities or lack of them it was very hard to accept that the sparrows cabin was his own and that others might be wondering about him he turned and saw fawns outline overlapping that of the idling frigate figures moving round her entry port to receive him with all formality he smiled to himself in the face of hell it seemed likely that no captain no matter how junior was expected to go without his proper acknowledgment bolitho was met at the entry port by maulby fawns commander he was very thin and but for a pronounced stoop would have stood well over six feet life between a sloops decks must be uncomfortable for such a man bolitho thought he appeared a few years older than himself and had a drawling bored manner of speaking but he seemed pleasant enough and made him welcome as they ducked beneath the quarterdeck maulba said the little admiral is excited it would seem bolitho paused and stared at him who maulby shrugged loosely in the flotilla we always refer to colquhoun as our little admiral he has a way of inserting himself in the role without actually holding the necessary rank he laughed his bent shoulders touching a deckhead beam so that he appeared to be supporting it with his own frame you look shockeds my friend bolitho grinned maulby he decided was a man you could like and trust on sight but he had never before heard such comments made about a superior by two subordinates meeting for the first time in some ships it would be inviting disaster and oblivion he replied no but i am refreshed the stern cabin was much the same size as his own there was no other similarity plain even spartan he was reminded of tyrrells anger his bitter attack on the womans touch he saw colquhoun sitting at a tables his chin in his hands as he stared at some newly opened despatches without pausing he said sit down both of you must give this matter my attention maulby looked gravely at bolitho and dropped one eyelid in a quick wink bolitho glanced away maulbys easy acceptance ob their superior was daunting the little admiral it suited colquhoun very well maulby seemed well able to remain relaxed yet he was nobodys fool bolitho had noted the smart way his men had moved about the gun deck the crisp passing and execution of orders bolitho had not met the other captains of colquhouns flotilla if they were all such odd birds as maulby it was hardly surprising that colquhoun was showing signs of strain or maybe in such small ships individual characters were more noticeable he thought of pears in the old trojan his rugged features which had never seemed to alter under any circumstances in a gale close to a lee shore or under enemy fire witnessing a flogging or commending some sailor on promotion he had always seemed remote and beyond personal contact it was hard to imagine maulby he paused or himself eithers with such aloof and godlike powers colquhouns voice broke across his thoughts sharp and incisive mirandas captain has brought serious news he still did not lift his head france has signed an alliance with the americans it means that general washington will have the full support of french regular troops and a powerful fleet bolitho shifted in his chair his mind grappling with colquhouns announcement the french had already done much to help their new ally but this would mean that the war was now firmly in the open it also implied that the french were showing fresh confidence in the americans chance of victory colquhoun stood up quickly and stared through the stern windows the miranda is carrying despatches and intelligence for the commanderinchief at new york when he left plymouth he had a brig in compana with duplicate information for antigua the ships were caught in a storm shortly after clearing the channel and the brig was not seen again maulby asked quietly taken by the french sir colquhoun swung on him with unexpected anger what the hell does it matter taken or wreckeds dismasted or bloody well eaten by worms it makes no difference to us does it suddenly bolitho realised the cause of his attack had colquhoun remained at antigua until his own ship had refitted maulby would have been in charge of the convoys escort mirandas captain desperate to carra his news to new york and senior to maulby would have ordered him to make arrangements for the information to be taken without delay to antigua nobody could rely on the brigs survival as an excuse for doing nothing by a mere twist of fate or colquhouns determination to keep control of his ships at sea mirandas captain had been able to pass on the decision to him in a calmer tone colquhoun continued it has been reported that the french have been preparing ships for months from toulon a whole squadron set sail weeks ago and slipped through the gibraltar patrols without so much as a squeak of news getting out he looked at each of them in turn they could be on their way here to the american coast anywhere for all we knows damn their eyes the fawn had swung slightly in the slow procession of troughs and through the swaying windows bolitho could see the two transports huge and ungainly their yards askew as they awaited the next signal each transport was filled to the deck seams with much needed supplies for the army in philadelphia in the wrong hands they would represent a tremendous prizes and the realisation must be foremost in colquhouns mind colquhoun said miranda has agreed to stand by the convoy until we contact the inshore squadron but in this damned weather it might take weeks bolitho imagined colquhoun was picturing the distance like a mental chart all those miles with the knowledge that he must eventually make the long passage back to antigua to resume control of his small force maulby drawled may i suggest that i continue with the transports sir with miranda in company we will be safe enough he glanced at bolitho you could then return in sparrow to english harbour pass the news to the admiral and prepare our own ships for further work colquhoun stared at him his eyes unseeing god damn the complacency of our precious government for years this has been brewing and while the french have been building new ships ours have been allowed to go rotten for want of money if the channel fleet were to be ordered to sea tomorrow doubt that more than twenty sail of the line would be capable he saw their surprise and nodded vehemently oh yes gentlemen while you have been out here imagining that all would be ready if once the call came i have been made to stay silent and watch it happening he struck the table with his fist some flag officers are too concerned with political power and gracious living to care for the wants of the fleet he sat down heavily i must decide the door opened slightly and a frightenedlooking midshipman said from miranda sir she requests instructions he got no further tell him to mind his manners colquhoun glared at him hotly it is my decision bolitho glanced at maulby for the first time in his life he was beginning to realise the meaning of command whatever colquhoun decided could be equally right or wrong bolitho had learned one thing well if you made a right decision others often received the credit but make a wrong one and you were in no doubt where the blame would he colquhoun said suddenly send for your clerks maulby i will dictate new orders for he looked at bolitho for sparrow he seemed to be speaking his thoughts aloud i do not doubt your ability bolitho but you lack experience will need maulbys fawn with me until i know what is to happen next he gestured to the table as the ships clerk entered the cabin you must remain with the transports mirandas captain will give you guidances and you will obey him to the best of your skill your orders will allow you to return to the flotilla when the transports have been delivered he paused and added softly delivered bolitho rose to his feet aye sir now get out and leave me to draft these orders maulby took bolithos elbow and guided him towards the gun deck i think the little admiral is worried my friend he sighed i was hoping to rid my ship of his presence and pass him on to you he turned and gave a quick grin there is no justice in this world bolitho saw his gig falling and rising in the swells stockdale shading his eyes as he watched the sloop for a recall he said the news is bad but not unexpected at least the pretence is done with maulby nodded gravely no comfort i fear to the lamb about to be devoured bolitho stared at him not that serious surely i am not certain what the frogs do today the damned spaniards will copy tomorrow soon we will have the whole world at our throats he frowned the little admiral is right on one score it seems that our government is run by demons most of whom appear determined to drive the rest of us to madness the first lieutenant hurried into view and proffered a freshly sealed envelope maulby clapped bolitho on the shoulder and said cheerfully think of us sometimes while you enjoa your leisurely voyage i will be forced to share my table with him he rubbed his hands but with any luck he may get promotion and vanish forever the lieutenant said urgently captain colquhouns compliments and will you join him immediately maulby nodded and held out his hand until we meet again bolitho he seemed unwilling to let him leave then he said awkwardly be warneds my friend you have a fine command but you also have a large number of colonists in your company he tried to smile if the war goes badly there are some who might be tempted to change allegiance in their shoes could perhaps feel the same bolitho met his gaze and nodded thank you i will remember it maulby did not hide his relief there i knew you were a good fellow not one to treat my clumsy advice as patronage bolitho grinned you took a risk i might have gone to colquhoun and told him of your name for him i would have denied it naturally they both laughed then as the gig hooked on to the chains they became formal again even before bolitho had reached the boat flags were soaring up the fawns yards and an acknowledgment appeared above the frigate with equal speed bolitho settled himself in the sternsheets and stared towards his ship colquhoun had taken the responsibility and made a decision his own responsibility was just beginning lieutenant tyrrell turned as bolithos head and shoulders rose through the quarterdeck hatch and waited until he had made his usual inspection of the sails and compass before remarking shes running well sir bolitho walked across the tilting deck and rested his hands on the rail feeling the hull quivering beneath him like a living creature the noon sun stood high over the ship but he was able to ignore it conscious only of the wellfilled sails the leap of spray up and over the bowsprit it had been five days since fawn had turned back for antigua and it seemed as if colquhouns disappearance from their midst had brought a change of luck and weather perverse as ever but for once on their side the wind had backed suddenly to southsouthwest and had freshened into a lively blow which had hardly dropped during the whole time under bulging canvas the ships had driven on towards the american coast which according to the most recent calculations now lay some two hundred and fifty miles away the heavy merchantmen had maintained a good five knots satisfied perhaps that mirandas captain was content to leave them to their own devices the frigates signals had been confined for the most part to sparrow for within twentyfour hours of leaving fawn the masthead lookout had sighted a solitary sail once again far astern of the convoy a tiny white flaw on the horizon bolitho had sent graves aloft with a telescope but even he had been unable to identify the mysterious follower next he signalled to the frigate requesting permission to investigate he had been refused mirandas captain was probably regretting his meeting with the convoy but for their dragging weight he would have reached his objective by now and would have borne no blame for failing to pass his news to antigua but once in contact with the slower vessels he had no choice but to act as he had also he would be fulla aware that once beyond his control sparrow might become too involved with a separate situation to return and thus leave him with total responsibility for the transports the unknown sail had not been sighted again and bolitho had accepted that mirandas captain had been right if over cautious to restrain his efforts he looked at tyrrells bronzed features and nodded i am well satisfied he watched some foretopmen sliding down the backstays racing each other to the deck after their work aloft buckle was right she moved like a bird with any sort of wind he watched the bear the transport closest to his own ship and wished they were free ob the convoy then he could really put sparrow to the test royals even studding sails could be rigged if only to find out what she could accomplish under every stitch of canvas most of the unemployed officers were on deck enjoying their usual gossip before the midday mealb careful to stay on the lee side and as much out of his way as possible he saw dalkeith the surgeon laughing with buckles his head very white in its baldness under the harsh light the red wig was being vigorously shaken by the wardroom servant and bolitho guessed it had been given some sort of a wash lock the purser was in a more serious conversation with young heywards opening and ruffling a big ledger in the wind as he explained some point of victualling which might place the midshipmans knowledge above that of his friend bethune the latter being on watch stood untidily by the quarterdeck rail his shirt open to his waist and massaging his stomach with one hand bolitho smiled the boy was no doubt hungry midshipmen like bethune usually were down on the gun deck many of the seamen were lounging beneath the sails great shadows or passing the time like their officers the boatswain was with his own friend yule the gunner and together they would have made a frightening pair of highwaymen bolitho thought whereas tilby was vast and ungainly his heavy features seamed with too much drink yule was swarthy and lithe like a stoat with darting flinty eyes which were forever on the move as he glanced from group to group he was again reminded of his newfound isolation privacy which could lead to loneliness privilege which might become a burden he thrust his hands behind him and began to pace slowly along the weather side letting the warm wind ruffle his hair and play with his open shirt somewhere out there beyond the hammock nettings was the coast of america it would be strange to drop anchor only to find the war had finished that blood had proved too strong in the face of france s new challenge if england were to admit to america s independence then perhaps both nations would unite against france and settle her ambitions once and for all he glanced at tyrrells profile and wondered if he was thinking the same he shut tyrrells personal problems from his mind and tried to concentryte on the string of affairs which daily needed his attention the water supply should be replenished as soon as possible the casks were poor and water soon became rancid in this climate and he would purchase fresh fruit whenever they contacted the land or some supply vessel it was amazing that the ships company had stayed so healtha when ransome had failed to take such simple precautions aboard the old trojan he had not seen one case of scurvy in the three years he had been in her evidence of captain pearss concern for his men and a valuable lesson to all his subordinates he had already spoken about it to lock and after some hesitation the purser had muttered a costly affair sir costlier if our people go down with disease mr lock i have known a whole squadron rendered useless because of such skinflint methods then there was the matter of a flogging his first as captain he had always disliked unnecessary use ob punishment even though he knew it to be necessary on occasions in the navy discipline was harsh and instant and when a ship was miles from home and other authority it was a captains deterrent to insubordination and final confusion some captains used it without thought brutal and inhuman floggings were commonplace in many ships and as a young midshipman bolitho had nearly fainted after one such spectacle other captains weak and inefficient left authority to subordinates and shut their ears to its misuse but for the most part the english seaman knew the measure of his service and if he took chances was prepared to accept the consequences and if one man thieved or cheated another of his messmates he had no mercy at all the justice of the lower deck was equally feared to that of a captain but this case was different or could be from what he knew of it a seaman had defied lieutenant graves during a night watch when the hands had been called to reef topsails in an unexpected squall he had shouted at the officer and called him a heartless bugger within earshot of some twenty other people in confidence tyrrell had asked bolitho to accept the seamans explanation he was a good hand and graves had provoked him in a fit of anger when he had failed to reach his station on the mainyard with his companions a dirty yankee bastard they were the words graves had used too lazy to do his proper duty and no doubt too gutless to fight when the time came all this and tyrells heated attack on graves s handling of the matter were fresh proof of the latent tension amongst the company under his command graves had been adamant the man had insulted him in front of his watch and must be punished he was right in one respect his authority had to be upheld or he would never be able to retain control again bolitho blamed himself if he had had more time to consider this unusual situation or had taken less comfort from his own new position he could have prevented it by example or by forcing his will on his officers he might have made them realise that such behaviour would not be tolerated but that was all too late now it had happened he had compromised by standing the man overs knowing then as at this moment that he was merela postponing the inevitable he glanced up towards the mainyard braced hard round as the ship heeled closehauled on a larboard tack he could see the man now naked but for a scrap of canvas working with some others on the endless business of resplicing and repairs high above the deck did tyrrell really think the man was provoked he wondered or was he standing up for him because he imagined graves was getting at him by punishin another colonist deck there the masthead lookouts cry was muffled by the wind and the lively crack of sails mirandas signallin bolitho swung round jump to it mr bethune you are half asleep today tyrrell stood aside as the midshipman ran to the lee shrouds with his telescope thinking of his next meal he was smiling at the boys confusion it seems that the masthead lookout was the only one in this watch thinking of his duty mr tyrrell the edge of his voice brought a flush to the lieutenants face and he turned away without answering bethune called from miranda sir sail to the norwest acknowledge bolitho was angry with tyrrells careless attitudeb angrier still more with his own unfair outburst some two miles ahead of the golden fleece her patched sails hardbellied and drawing well the miranda was already setting her topgallants in readiness to investigate the unknown ship whatever she was lay somewhere across the larboard bow and as she had not been seen before it seemed likely she was on a converging course deck there sail in sight fine on th weather bow bolitho looked round at the intent faces for an instant he toyed with the idea of making his way to the dizzy mainmast crosstrees himself in spite of his fear of heights which he had never been able to overcome the long climb up those shivering vibrating shrouds might drive his anger away and leave his mind clear once again he saw raven the newly appointed masters mates and said go aloft take a glass and tell me what you see buckle had told him that the man was an experienced sailor one who had already served in severyl kings ships and would not be easily fooled ba first appearances before raven had even reached the mainyard the lookout called again two ships close in company every eye was on ravens body as he swarmed out and around the futtock shrouds and up towards the topmast head bethune still smarting over his failure to see mirandas signal suddenly stiffened and called gunfire sir he had his hands cupped round his ears giving his round face the appearance of a freckled goblin bolitho looked down at him then as his hearing adjusted itself beyond the crack of sails and the plunging sweep of spray around the hull he too heard the deeper discordant thud of cannon fire he was almost beside himself with impatience but he knew if he hurried raven he might become too confused to make a proper assessment deck there it was raven at last first ships a merchantman shes under attack from a brig buckle exclaimed thickly privateer by god bolitho snatched a telescope and trained it through the dark mass of rigging and beyond some men who were grouped on the forecastle a trick of the light he blinked and tried again no there it was a tiny white speck which seemed to mingle with the unending pattern of crisp wavecrests the lonely merchantman had been unlucky but now with any sort of good fortune they might turn the tables on her attacker the miranda was already tacking violently her sails in confusion as she headed away from her original station even as her sails refilled and hardened on the new tack bolitho saw her signal flags breaking to the wind bethune said quickly general signal sir remain on station buckle swore after the bloody prize money himselfs the greedy bugger the gunfire was clearer now and as he raised the glass again bolitho saw smoke drifting downwind from the two ships the lithe shape of the attacking brig as she endeavoured to close the range still further he shut the glass with a snap aware of the mutterin behind him disappointment which matched his own mirandas captain was probably making the attack more to break the frustration of a slow passage than to humiliate the sparrow he looked at tyrells broad shoulders and said signal the bear to make more sail shes dropping astern badly then he turned back to watch the frigate she was moving fast in spite of the wind being almost abeam ob her sails and he could see her port lids opening the single line of muzzles catching the sunlight as they were run out in readiness to fight the brigs captain must have realised what was happening even so he was probably unwilling to lose his prize with victory almost in his grasp on the gangways and gun deck his own seamen were chattering and waving their arms about and he guessed they were discussing how they would have acted had they been given the chance to go for the privateer bolitho recalled raven to the deck and said you did well the man grinned uncomfortably thank you sir the brigs a yankee right enough seen many like her in me time tother ones an indiaman by her looks though her gunnery aint so good as some on em theres never a mark on the yankees canvas tyrrell shouted th brigs broken off the action hes going to make a run for it bolitho sighed the merchantman was already turning steadily towards the little convoy while the miranda under full sail charged towards her attacker the brig if well handled stood a fair chance against a frigate in matters of speed and manoeuvrability but this one had waited just that much too long converging like prongs of a trap the three vessels would pass beam to beam the frigate shielding the merchantman and well able to rake the brig from stem to stern as they passed provided the brig was not too badly damaged she might be useful to the fleet either way mirandas captain would gain a nice purse of prize money he tore his eyes away as sounds of angry voices came up the quarterdeck ladder at his side it was tilby flushed from some secret hoard of rums his face heavy with rage as he said beg pardon sirs but this ere man says e wants to speak to ee he glared severely at the seaman in question i told im that no man under punishment can speak to an officer without permission bolitho saw that the seaman behind tilby was the one waiting to be flogged he was a young wellmade man and was dragging at the boatswains arm with frantic determination what is it yelverton bolitho nodded to tilby is it so important the seaman reached the quarterdeck and swallowed hard that ship sir she aint no indiaman shes a damned frenchie i seen her in boston some years back bolitho swung round god in heaven it was at that moment the oncoming merchantman fired a full broadside into the mirandas unmanned side as she passed the sound going on and on until it reached the heart of every man in the convoy a total responsibility even at two miles range bolitho saw the miranda give a violent shiver as the broadside swept across her it must have been aimed high for as the smoke fanned away he saw the havoc left by the sudden onslaught maintopmast gone and most of her sails ripped and punctured like rags in a gale he thrust himself from the nettings and noticed that the men near him were still standing like groups ob statues or people so stricken they were unable to think or respond he shouted mr tyrrell beat to quarters and clear for action he gripped bethunes arm seeing his dazed expression as he added run up the colours a ships boy seized his drum and began to beat out the staccato tattoo the men on deck and poised in the bows where they had waited to watch mirandas swift victory came alive and began to run to their stations but gone was the automatic movement ob men at drill or the grim silence of old hands facing one more battle they hurried like those already too confused to act for a set purpose some cannoned into one another others stood momentarily at the wrong gun or groping with unfamiliar equipment until a petty officer kicked them away bolitho looked at buckle trying to keep his tone level amidst the din around him get the courses off her and set the tgallants therell be enough risk of fire without having the canvas burn around our ears below the quarterdeck he heard the thud and bang of screens being torn down a patter of feet as the boys dashed from the magazine with powder for each waiting gun he made himself face the approaching shipss knowing it was taking far too long to prepare for action how near they looked there was more gunfire and he saw smoke lifting and writhing between the vessels making it impossible to know what was happening he held his breath as he saw the mirandas yards swinging above the smoke and knew her captain was trying to go about and run parallel with his attacker guns roared through the drifting fog their long orange tongues flashing above the churned water some of the balls whipping away over open sea leaving vicious spurts of spray to mark their progress miranda was still edging round her pockmarked sails flapping weakly as she began to swing past the winds eye her captain was either going to fight the bigger ship gun to gun or intended to slip past her stern and rake her with a broadside as he did so bolitho heard someone groan as the enemy fired into the smoke gun by gun down her hidden side the balls could almost be felt across the tumbling whitehorses it was superbly timed catching the frigate even as she was beginning to pass across the wind the enemy was using langrage or chainshot for as the slow broadside smashed home bolitho saw the mirandas fore and mainmasts stagger and then begin to topple sideways into the smoke the sails jerking to the bombardment from a lithe and beautiful ship to a crippled wreck the miranda was still trying to turn her bowchaser firing blindly the ensign showing scarlet from her mizzen tyrrell shouted wildly cleared for action bolitho looked at himload and run out if you please the lieutenant stayed facing him his eyes very bright in the sunlight you aint going to fight both of ems surely if necessary bolitho turned as more shots echoed and murmured across the shortening distance he saw the brig clawing away from the two larger ships her main topgallant leaning at a dangerous angle where mirandas first balls had found their mark the planks vibrated under his shoes and as the port lids opened the sparrows eighteen guns squeaked and rumbled towards the sunlight the barebacked seamen slipping on sanded decks as they tried to keep in time to the shouted commands from their captains bolitho stared along the length of his ship with something like despair in moments now all would be finished his ship his precious sparrow would be sharing the frigates fate and it had all been so easy it had happened so often in the past that the sight of a helpless merchantman being harried by a wellarmed privateer had not even aroused the faintest suspicion no wonder the privateers sails had been unmarked in their carefully staged battle how the two american captains must have laughed when miranda had swept in to defend her own murderer he felt stockdale breathing noisily beside him the sudden grip of the swordbelt around his waist he said huskily by god sir thems bad odds deck there the masthead lookout had been forgotten in the sight of disaster mirandas goin to grapple the unseen lookout gave a cracked cheer shes goin to close with the bugger bolitho ran to the rail the frigate was almost hidden by the heavier shape of the enemy ship but he could tell from the set of her mizzen that she was indeed lurching towards her attacker another crash of gunfire made the smoke spout upwards between them and the frigates remaining mast vanished in a welter ob rigging and ripped canvas but bolitho could see the sudden activity on the enemys gangways the surge ob figures by her foremast and pictured the battered frigate heading her bows straight for the forecastle muskets cracked feebly across the water and he sa the telltale flash of steel as the two vessels ground momentarily together and the fight became hand to hand he grasped tyrrells arm and shouted mirandas given us time he saw no understanding in his eyes only disbelief if she can hold on we will close with the brig he shaded his face against the glare and watched the brig as she swept down towards the two transports shell cross golden fleeces bows and rake her as she passes he was shouting his thoughts aloud we will wear ship directly pass between the transports and return the compliment tyrrell bit his lip but we might collide with the privateer sir bolitho swung him round pointing him at the embattled ships do you want those lads to die for nothing man he pushed him to the rail now get ready to wear when i give the order the brig was already dead ahead of sparrows raked jibboom no more than a mile away aboard the leading transport bolitho could see smoke from a solitary gun although he saw no sign of a ball signal the transports to keep station mr bethune he repeated the order to break the midshipman from his unmoving stance lively if either of the transports captains lost his head now all would fail the enemy would destroy or capture at leisure even now there was little room for hope of any kind and all of it from the first hint of surprise to this moment had been merely minutes he made himself walk aft towards the taffrail his eyes passing over the crouching swivel gunners the two helmsmen at their unprotected wheel buckle grimfaced and staring at the sails above all of them he saw raven the new masters mate watching him wretchedly and paused to say you werent to know she was an indiaman after all but not i fear as she was intended raven shook his head so concerned with his failure to recognise the enemy that he seemed oblivious to the sporadic crash of cannon fire i shouldve seen er sir but i saw what i expected to see an im powerful sorry on it after you givin me a chance to better meself bolitho smiled feeling his lips cracking with the effort and i will expect you to do even better this day mr raven he strode aft hands behind his back the new sword flapping against his thigh buckle pursed his lips in a silent whistle hes a calm one death coming up the hawse an he just walks about like he was enjoying himself behind the fixed smile bolitho continued to pace the deck his ears pitched above the gunfire to catch the news that the brig had reached the first transport if her captain saw through his frail plan it would be pointless to continue with it he would either have to run away from the fight and carry mirandas important news to the admiral or stay and await the final meeting with the converted indiaman a few of the mirandas guns were still firing here and there their muzzles almost overlapping those of the other ship between decks it must be a slaughterhouse he thought despairingly tyrrell shouted brigs crossing her bows sharper explosions echoed over the water and bolitho knew the brig was firing her starboard battery as she ran easily across the transports bowsprit before she had vanished beyond golden fleeces great bulk he saw the american flag whipping jauntily from her gaff the sudden stab of musket fire from her low deck as sharpshooters practised their aim now bolitho sliced the air wear ship as the helm went over and along the sparrows crowded decks the men threw themselves on the braces the hull seemed to stagger violently under the shock blocks screamed and above the decks the great yards creaked round with such speed that bolitho could feel the whole fabric shaking in protest but nothing carried away and as she heeled steeply to take the wind under her stern the sails lifted then filled to its thrust bolitho cupped his hands mr graves engage the larboard guns first you will point the thirtytwopounder yourself he saw graves nod before vanishing beneath the forecastle in the direction of the bowchaser how fast she was moving despite both her courses being brailed up to the yards for fear of fire when the guns started to engage the main topgallant seemed to bend forward the masthead pendant flicking straight out towards the bows as if to point the way already the jibboom must be crossing the leading transports quarter and to starboard bolitho saw the second one bear altering course slightly as if fearful of a collision with the sloop which was dashing across her path more shots came from beyond the first transports and he saw smoke funnelling down her hull to mark the brigs progress from forward came the cry thar she be on the larboard bow the sparrows unexpected appearance between the two transports seemed to have caught the brigs captain totally by surprise the privateer was passing down the transports side about a cable clear her yards braced round to hold her on a starboard tack bolitho yelled well cross the enemys hawse and rake him as we go he saw some of his men staring at him from their guns faces strained and confused he drew his sword and held it over his head as you bear lads make each ball strike home the brig was barely half a cable away her bowsprit pointing at right angles towards sparrows figurehead the distance seemed to be failing away at a tremendous speed and bolitho knew that if he had misjudged it or if the wind chose this instant to drops the enemy would drive into the sloops side like a battering ram and split her seams wide open the big thirtytwopounder in the bows broke the spell the crash of the explosion transmitting itselb through the deck until it reached bolithos feet he saw the brigs shrouds slashed open the whirl of bright wood splinters as the ball ploughed into her tiered boats then gun by gun down sparrows side the broadside continued with graves bursting into the smoky sunlight waving his sword and yelling orders to each crew in succession frantically the enemy captain tried to wear ship and follow sparrows onrushing charge unable to get her own guns to bear and with most of the forward shrouds and rigging hanging like black weed above her decks the brig was staggering drunkenly under the wellaimed barrage then with the helm over and some wind still alive in the torn sails the brig finally came under command here and there a gun banged out but in their haste the privateers were firing haphazardly into the whirling smoke load and run out tyrrell was yelling above the din roundly bolitho shouted dont wait for a broadside let each captain fire whenever he has loaded it was useless to expect these men to keep on firing as a team once they too were under the enemys metal graves rasped sponge out you stupid buggerl he had to drag a dazed man to the rear of his gun are you mad he pushed the luckless seaman towards the gun captain ill put you in irons if i see you bolitho did not hear the rest of it the brig was edging round until she was lying almost diagonally across the larboard quarter smoke fanned down around him and he felt musket balls thudding into the deck planks the maniac whine as one ricocheted from a swivel gun just feet away stockdale said desperately keep on the move sir them buggersll mark you down else bolitho stared at him knowing his own face was set in a wild grin it never failed to amaze him that it was so easy to lose control and reason once a battle had begun later perhaps he shook himself there would be no later when they closed with the bigger ship he yelled they are shooting blind stockdale he waved his sword around the quarterdeck none of the officers had found time to get their uniform coats or hats and like himself were dressed only in shirts and breeches and those were already grimy with drifting powdersmoke see they can take their pick of us today a seaman at the mizzen braces gave a terrible scream and was hurled on to his side by the force of z musket ball blood spurted from his chest and as he rolled about in agony bolitho called see to that mans mr bethune when the midshipman hesitated his face like chalk under the freckles he added harshly your mother is at home boy so you can weep alone after you have done your duty bethune dropped to his knees his breeches spattered with the blood but his face suddenly determined as the dying sailor groped for his hand buckle yelled the yankee will try to work across our stern sir bolitho nodded there was nothing else the enema could do with most of his sails damaged by cannon fire and already overreached by sparrows maddened attack through the transports the brigs captain must either try to cross astern or tack and risk his own poop coming under fire he snapped we will wear ship mr buckle lay her to the larboard tack and follow the brig round nose to tail he was still grinning but could feel his mouth raw with tension as once again the men hurled themselves on the braces their smokegrimed bodies glistening in the glare as they angled back above the deck their eyes on the yards above them helm alee buckle was adding his own weight to the wheel bolitho watched the bowsprit swinging heard the immediate crash of guns as graves directed his newly loaded battery towards the other ship through the dense gunsmoke bolitho saw the murky shape of the leading transport now some two cables away steady as you go mr buckle a ball whimpered overhead and when he glanced up he saw a neat hole in the centre of the big spanker keep station on golden fleece she is better than any compass today he winced as the hull jumped once twice and yet again as some enemy shots smashed into it but the brig was in a bad way and she was drifting sternfirsts her complete foremast dragging over the side like a fallen tree men were working in the wreckage axes flashing while others continued to fire and reload the guns as before steady sir norwest by north bolitho raised his sword his eyes narrowed against the reflected sunlight as he watched the brig swinging drunkenly on the tow of fallen spars easy the sword held the sunlight easy ladsl not a gun fired and along the deck only at the weapons not yet reloaded was there any sort ob movement another ball slammed into the lower hull and somewhere a man screamed in torment as he was clawed down by flying splinters the sun was shining into his eyes now and through the drifting smoke he saw the outline of the brigs tattered main topsail the glint of glass as she helplessly presented her stern fire as you bear driven by the wind the smoke came funnelling inboard through port after port as graves ran along the gun deck his voice cracking from the strain of shouting directions a shadow passed briefly above the smoke and through the din bolitho heard the splintering crash of a complete mast failing and guessed it had been sheared off between decks by the sparrows merciless bombardment then as the sparrow forged ahead once more he heard cheering and knew it was from the golden fleece as wind drove the smoke apart he saw the brig very clearly and someone on her splintered deck waving the flag in surrender mastless and with her stern gouged open by the slow broadside she was little better than a hulk within her small hull her company must have been savagely mauled tyrrell was staring at it his eyes bright with concentrytion and by his side heyward was almost jumping up and down his voice half choked by smoke then almost before the sparrows dazed compana could feel the taste of their conquest the air was blasted apart with one deafening explosion sparss complete sections of timber and deck planking all whirled above an angry scarlet core and across the water a shock wave rolled towards the sloop like a miniature typhoon when the smoke and flying fragments subsided there was nothing to show of the privateer but for a few pieces of charred flotsam and an upended jolly boat which was miraculously undamaged a sudden spark an upended lantern or someone so crazed in the horror between the shattered decks that he had ignited a fuse the brigs end was terrible in its completeness bolitho said get the main course on her mr tyrrell we must make haste to assist miranda he waited until tyrrell had brought the stunned seamen to their senses his voice hoarse through his speaking trumpet and then added they will know that we can still sell our lives dearly it took little time to overhaul the golden fleece and to see the two embattled ships about a mile distant they had drifted in the fury of combat their hulls masked in smoke through which the flash of musket fire the occasional glare of a swivel were clear to see the frigate was listing against her heavier adversary like a hulk already dead and without using a glass bolitho could see that the fighting had spread down across the fore deck as more boarders hacked their way between the grappled ships we will go about mr tyrrell lay her on the starboard tack once we have gained some room and prepare to engage with the other battery he bit his lip to steady his racing thoughts a quick glance aloft told him that the masthead pendant was lifting as firmly as ever the wind was steady from southsouthwest pass the word for mr graves to lay aft when the lieutenant arrived his face gaunt with fatigue bolitho said i want the starboard bowchaser to keep firing at the enemy as soon as we have gone about ill expect it to concentryte on that ship no matter what buckle called ready on th quarterdeck sir bolitho nodded put the helm down if you please helm alee sir tyrrell was already bellowing through his trumpets and forward the seamen were leaping like demons at the headsail sheets and with canvas flapping the sparrow started to swing into the wind man the braces bolitho gripped the rail his eyes smarting as the sun lanced between the shrouds heave there with all your weight across the wind and still further round the yards groaning in unison then as the sails refilled and laid the deck over in the opposite angle he watched the distant ships edging very slowly between the foremast shrouds as if caught in a giant web steady mr buckle hold her he paced a few steps this way and that aware that tyrrell was urging the men at the braces to trim the yards still further that the dead seaman had gone from the quarterdeck and that ben garby the carpenters with his mates was slithering through the after hatch to inspect the damage there aware of all this and mores yet not a part of it as he had once been steady sir full an bye he nodded his mind busy with the two ships closehauled it would take thirty minutes to reach them maybe more miranda was almost overrun by enema boarders outnumbered from the start she would have lost many good men in that first savage broadside fire as the muffled cry came from forward he saw the puff of smoke beneath the starboard catheyd felt the sharp convulsion as the thirtytwopounder crashed inboard on its tackles he snatched up a glass and saw the ball plunge close to the enemys hull throwing up a tall waterspout heyward muttered hoarsely near bolitho looked away the big exindiaman mounted anything up to forty guns at a guess she could finish sparrow if ever she could bring her artillery to bears with even a badly aimed broadside less bang another ball crashed away from the bowchaser and he watched the feathers of spray lifting from wave to wave until it plunged hard alongside the other ship they should hear us and see we are coming he tried to clear his brain what should he do signal the transports to run no they were helplessly overladen and slow it would merely prolong their agony overhead the spanker cracked noisily and buckle cursed it before allowing the helm to be eased still further bolitho knew without looking that sailing so close to the wind was cutting away his chances of reaching the ships in time to help someone walked past him it was bethune his arms hanging at his sides his breeches covered with dark blood blotches and a smear where the seamans fingers had made their last agonised grip on this earth bolitho stared at him mr bethune he saw the youth jump come here he walked to the rail and back again it was worth an attempt anything was now if they arrived alongside after miranda had struck to the enemy sparrows decks would be as red as the flag above his head the midshipman waited sir make this signal at once he rested his hand on bethunes plump shoulder he could feel the skin through his shirt like ice in spite of the sun signal sir he stared up at him as if he had misheard or his captain had gone mad yes to miranda sail in sight to the noreast he tightened his grip then move yourself bethune fled calling shrilly for his assistants and within a minute the bright signal flags broke to the wind while tyrrell stared from them to bolitho first with incredulity and then with slow understanding buckle said theres few poor devilsll see that aboard miranda tyrrell was studying bolitho no but th privateer will he might just think that a patrol from th squadron has come to join th fight bolitho waited until graves s bowchaser had fired yet again and said it is all we can do at present minutes dragged by like hours and then as a freak downdraught of wind swept across the two snared ships bolitho caught his breath a thin shaft of light where there had been none then a glint of water wider still as the ships drifted apart and the big privateer set her foresail and jib to work clear then miranda was quite separate the water between her and the other ship dotted with wreckage and torn canvas where here and there a man thrashed to stay afloat amidst a litter of bobbing corpses a ragged cheer came up from sparrows gun decks and severyl ran to the gangways to watch while the enemy spread more canvas and lengthened her outline against the wind tyrrells grin froze as bolitho snapped keep those men silent he realised he was still holding his swords that his hand was aching with the force of his grip look yonder mr tyrrell theres no call for cheers this day tyrrell turned to stare at the mirandas dark shape the rising clouds of smoke as her remaining hands quenched fires and groped amidst the wreckage ob their ship as sparrow drew closer they could see the thin tendrils of scarlet which ran from her scuppers the great pitted holes along every part of her hull pass the word for mr tilby to prepare boats for lowering call the surgeon and send him with them bolitho hardly recognised his own voice clipped dulls inhuman then shorten sail and get the tgallants of her we will stand under mirandas lee for the present he ignored the rush of feet as tilbys men dashed to the boat shackles he saw graves walking aft towards the quarterdeck wiping his face and chest with a wet rag above the activity the sails were still drawing wells but there were plenty of holes which would need attention before nightfall a few stays and halyards were broken and he knew the hull had been hit severyl times on or near the waterline but the pumps sounded normal enough she was taking it like a veteran dalkeith came hurrying up the ladder his heavy bag gripped against his chest face streaming with exertion how many mr dalkeith again he heard his own voice as a strangers the plump surgeon was staring at the frigate his eyes dull two killed sir five wounded by splinters bolitho tried to recall the man who was killed by his side manners that was his name he said manners who was the other yelverton sir he was killed by a ball at the foremast he looked down took his head off graves was halfway up the ladder but recoiled as bolitho said yelverton did you hear that mr gravest the one man who kept his senses when all others were too blind to see the truth the one you wanted to flog he turned away well hell not trouble you further mr graves nor we him blindly he saw stockdale watching from the foot ob the mizzen mast call away the gig i will visit captain selby and see what must be done aye sir stockdale glanced back at him as he hurried to the boat tier he had never seen bolitho so stricken or so moved before and for once he did not know what to do to help bolitho entered his cabin and unbuckled his sword before throwing it on to the bench seat below the windows fitch and a young seaman were busy replacing the furniture and another was mopping away smoke stains from the low deckhead for in action even the captains quarters were not spared with the hasty removal of screens the cabin became an extension of the gun deck and on either side of it was a squat twelvepounder now once again hidden by discreet chintz covers he stared at the nearest gun his eyes blurred with strain a womans touch then he turned abruptly to face tyrrell and grave who had followed him into the cabin upon his return from the crippled miranda his mind was so filled with questions and suppositions his brain so wracked by the sights and sounds aboard the frigate that for a moment he was unable to speak at all beyond the bulkhead he could hear the steady thud of hammers the rasp of saws as the ships company continued work on repairs after a full hour aboard the miranda he had returned to find his own command settling down to the task of making good the damage from their encounter with the privateer with such orderly dedication that he had been unable to compare the scene with what he had just left the sailmaker and his mates had already replaced the punctured canvas and with their needles and palms flashing in the sunlight covered every foot of deck space as they patched the others sent down from the yards garby the carpenter had greeted him at the entry port and had told him that the brigs gunnery had not been too damaging two shot holes below the waterline which his men were already plugging and severyl others which he would repair before sunset garby had spoken quickly professionally as if like the rest he was unwilling to think about the miranda and the fate which could have been theirs graves was the first to break the silence all guns secured sir no damage to tackles or ports he dropped his eyes under bolithos unmoving stare bettern we could have hoped tyrrell asked quietly how was it sir bolitho let himself drop into a chair and thrust out his legs in front of him the breeches were black with powder stains and his climb up the frigates side how was it once again he saw the pictures of death and horror the few uninjured men who were trying even now to put the frigate to rights smoke stains and great patches of drying blood gaping corpses littered amongst the fallen spars and broken planking it was a miracle that miranda was still able to keep afloat he said they hope to get a jury rig hoisted by sometime tomorrow provided the wind doesnt get ups or the pumps foul they will obtain steerage way he rubbed his eyes with his knuckles feeling the weariness enclosing him like a vice some of the wounded will be transferred to the transports directly there they will have more room to recover he tried again to shut the agony from his mind men so badly mutilated by splinters that they should be dead already midshipmen and even seamen in charge of repairs because of the carnage on the quarterdeck he had found the frigates first lieutenant supervising the recovery of the mizzen topmast when he had climbed aboard the man had had one arm in a sling and his forehead had looked as if it had been laid open by a hot iron graves breathed out very slowly they did well against such odds yes bolitho wanted to get them out of the cabin seal the door and shut them away from his uncertainty tyrell said ive passed th word around th ship sir think our people know how satisfied you bolithos tone made him fall back satisfied he lurched to his feet if you feel cause for complacency mr tyrrell then please contain it he moved to the windows and back again i have seen it for myself our people are not moved by a sense of victory they are relieved and nothing deeper than that thankful to be spared a similar mauling and all too eager to overlook their own shortcomings tyrrell said quickly but thats a mite unfair surely you think so he sank down at the table his anger spent raven had the measure of it he saw what he expected to see as did captain selby in miranda and like you mr tyrrell our people thought that fighting an enemy was just an extension of drill a few cuts and a few curses and all would be well perhaps we have been too victorious in the past and have been overreached by this newer kind of warfare there was another silence so that the hammering somewhere deep in the hull became insistent and to bolitho suddenly urgent graves asked what will we do now sir he sounded wary bolitho faced them gravely captain selby is dead killed in the first broadside he walked to the quarter windows and stared towards the drifting frigate without effort he could picture the wounded first lieutenant the man who had somehow fought his ship alongside the enemy knowing it was all he could do despite the crippling losses and damage already suffered now without a single lieutenant aided by a mere handful of junior warrant officers he was doing his utmost to repair the ship to get her to safety before the sea or an enema found him again in the shattered chaos of selbys cabin he had unlocked the safe and handed bolitho the despatches without hesitation even now that he was back in his own cabin he found it hard to believe junior command and then almost in the twinkling of an eyes he was to shoulder the total responsibility for them all colquhoun and maulby were beyond reach and selba was dead he had seen his corpse on the splintered quarterdeck pinned beneath an upended ninepounder one hand still clutching his sword like a useless talisman tyrrells voice made him turn towards them again then you are in command sir the lieutenants were watching him intently their faces showing both doubt and apprehension bolitho nodded slowly we will continue with the transports before dusk after we have ferried the mirandas wounded across to them and done what we can for their own ship he tried not to think of the endless problems which lay ahead when we have made contact with the squadron as ordered we will proceed with the despatches to the commanderinchief he let his eyes stray around the cabin all at once it was smaller the sloop more vulnerable and miranda sir tyrrells tone was hushed bolitho kept his voice level and without emotions knowing that if he showed them even for an instant his true feelings they would lose what small faith they still retained her people will do what they must we cannot stay with her nor would they wish it spray pattered against the thick windows the wind was already freshening slightly tyrrell licked his lips his eyes distant as he stared towards the dismasted frigate bolitho added that will be all keep the hands working until the last minute the two lieutenants in their filthy shirts and breeches turned and left the cabin without another word bolitho looked at fitch and said you may go too wish to think when fitch and his helpers had gone he rested his head in his hands and allowed his body to sway with the ships uncomfortable motion tyrrell probably thought him heartless for leaving the other ship without company or aid graves too would no doubt be finding plenty of fuel for his own personal fires he stood up fighting back the tiredness and strains knowing he must not heed nor care about their considerations they were in a war which for too long they had only skirted like spectators if learn they musts it were better to be done at once then he recalled the mirandas lieutenant the bitterness in his voice as he had described the action he was able to add little to what bolitho already knew and guessed but for one thing the name of the big privateer bonaventure it was a name he would not forget there was a tap at the door it was lock his face dark with gloom as he began to recount a list of stores damaged in the brief fight with the brig bolitho faced him and said quietly now let me have a full list mr lock and i will give you my opinion it was useless to think of what had passed he was alone now and only the future like the next horizons had any true meaning for him all the luck guardboat approaching sir bolitho nodded very well he had already seen it but was concentrating instead on the overlapping lines of anchored ships the nearest of which a twodecker wore a rearadmirals flag at her mizzen then he took a quick glance along the busy gun deck the preparations to drop anchor for the first time since leaving antigua it was ten days since they had watched the mirandas battered outline fall further and further astern until they had lost it altogether days ob fretting impatience as they repeatedly shortened sail to keep station on the two transports and when at last they had found a frigate of the inshore squadron they had received not freedom but yet another unexplained leg to the journey sparrow would not hand over her charge of the transports nor would she close with the shore to supervise their unloading instead she was to proceed with all dispatch to new york the frigates captain had been impatient to be away and had merely sent a midshipman across to sparrow with his orders from what little he had discovered bolitho gathered the frigate had been waiting and patrolling for three weeks in order that his message could be passed on to the convoy and had no wish to be involved further he shifted his gaze to the guardboat rocking gently in the offshore swell a large blue flag lifting and curling from her bows to mark where the sloop should anchor the wheel creaked as buckle passed his directions to the helmsmen and forward on the beakheads framed against the glittering water he saw graves waiting for the command to anchor he heard someone laugh and saw the two transports idling awkwardly towards another anchorage their yards alive with men as they shortened sail dalkeith saw him turn and remarked glad to see the back of em eh sir he mopped his face with a handkerchief theyve been with us so long i felt we were towing the beasts the gunner climbed halfway up the ladder and called permission to begin the salute sir bolitho nodded if you please mr yule he turned away knowing that but for the gunners request he would have forgotten all about it in his concern for what would happen next while the sparrow continued easily towards the guardboat her canvas clewed up but for topsails and jib the air shook to the regular bang of cannon fire as she paid her respects to the rearadmirals flag bolitho wanted to take bethunes big telescope and study the other ships but guessed too many glasses would now be on him his natural curiosity might be seen as uncertainty or the apprehension of a young commander approaching an unfamiliar anchorage instead he made himself walk a few paces along the weather side noting with satisfaction that the nettings were neatly filled with hammocks and every unused line and halliard was either belayed or flaked down on the decks of their clash with the brig there was little or no visible sign the ten days had been well used to replace woodwork and apply fresh paint tyrrell was standing at the rail a speaking trumpet under one arm in his blue coat and cocked hat he seemed unfamiliar again a stranger like the day he had come into the cabin after his visit to the flagship the last wisp of gunsmoke drifted forward above the anchor party and he concentrated his attention on the last half cable of distance the other ships were spread out on either bow and looked impressive indestructible he raised one hand slowly lee braces mr tyrrell hands wear ship why then was he so apprehensive perhaps the frigates curt orders had hidden something deeper he tried to disregard it after all he had been sick to death of the slow passage with the transports so how much worse it must have been for the solitary frigate tyrrells voice brought a screaming chorus from the circling gulls which had been with them for severyl days topsl sheets he was squinting into the sunlights watching the darting figures high above the deck topsl clew lines roundly does it lads bethunes voice cut across the shouted orders and the flapping crack of canvas from flag to sparrow sir repair on board bolitho nodded acknowledge the admiral did not believe in wasting time helm alee gently easily the sparrow turned her jibboom into the wind her sails vanishing as the topmen vied with each other to fist the unruly canvas under control let go from forward came a brief splash as the anchor plunged to the bottom and before graves had turned to signal the quarterdeck tilby the boatswain was already urging the boatlowerers to sway out the gig tyrrell came aft and touched his hat i hope you get good news sir thank you bolitho wondered what it must be like for tyrrell he was back off his own coastline sandy hook he must have sailed this way many times in his fathers schooner but there was nothing on his features to betray whatever he was thinking the usual controlled respect which he had shown since the battle tyrrell had not spared himself in his efforts to get the damage repaired he had a manner which at first glance seemed easy going even casual but there was no doubting his ability or the edge of his tongue if someone was foolish enough to mistake his attitude for weakness i doubt that i will be long in the flagship bolitho watched the gigs crew tumbling down the side th admiral may ask you to take lunch sir tyrrells eyes crinkled in a rare smile i gather th old parthian is known for a good table stockdale called gigs ready sir bolitho looked at tyrrell make arrangements for taking in fresh water and casks i have told mr lock to see what he can do about fruit tyrrell followed him to the entry port where the side party were assembled he hesitated and then asked quietly if you could find out anything about he shrugged but then guess youll be too busy sir bolitho ran his eye over the nearby seamen had he learned anything about them since he had taken command did he even know what they thought ob him he replied i will do what i can perhaps your father has sent some message for you tyrrell was still staring after him as he clambered into the boat his ears ringing to the squeal of pipes when bolitho climbed up through the parthians gilded entry port and doffed his hat to the quarterdeck he was immediately reminded of the trojan the life he had so recently left behind all the old smells and sights came crowding back and he marvelled that he had forgotten so much in so brief a time a lieutenant guided him to the flag captains cabin and relieved him of the despatches and a bag ob letters which miranda had brought from england he said the admiral will read these first sir his eyes moved swiftly over bolithos new uniform coat searching perhaps for the same old answer why him and not me the admiral did not send for him for a full hours although it felt twice as long to avoid repeatedly examining his watch he made himself listen to the sounds around and above him the old familiar noises of a teeming community encased in one great hull it took little imagination to hear captain pearss harsh voice complaining mr bolitho are you aware that the weather forebrace is as slack as a sows tail pon ma soul youll have to do better if you wish to make something of yourself he was smiling ruefully when the lieutenant returned and without further ceremony led him aft to the great cabin sir evelyn christie rearadmiral of the red and commanding the inshore squadron was fanning his face with a napkin and after a searching examination of bolithos general appearance said a glass ob claret commander he did not wait for an answer but gestured to his servant a splendidlooking man in scarlet jacket and brilliant yellow breeches i was somewhat surprised to see your name affixed to the report the admirals eyes were fastened on the claret as if daring the servant to spill even a drip you say in it that ransome died of fever he took a glass and examined it critically damn good job if you ask me young popinjay too much money and no damn integrity ransome disposed of he continued calmly expect youre concerned about the change of plans eh bolitho felt a chair nudge the back of his legs and realised the silent servant had somehow managed to arrange a glass of claret on a small table fetch a chairs and all without apparently moving or uttering a sound the admiral scowled take no notice the mans a fool he added sharply well bolitho replied i was expecting to rearadmiral christie interrupted yes i imagine you were he paused his head on one side like an irritable bird the claret well very good sir evelyn hmm the admiral seated himself carefully on a gilt chair took it off a blockade runner last month palatable something metallic crashed across a deck beyond the bulkhead and he snapped savagely go and tell the officer of the watch with my compliments that if hear one more unseemly sound during this interview will personally take him to task the servant fled from the cabin and the admiral gave a slow smile keep them jumping thats the answer dont give em too much time to think in the very next breath he changed the tack ye again fact is bolitho things are not going too well thank god you at least are a man who knows how to abide by the letter of his orders in your place i might have said to hell with waiting around for some damn patrol to find out what was happening i might even have gone so far as to take those transports direct to the army bolitho stiffened it sounded genuine enough but perhaps the admiral was merely hinting at a criticism maybe he thought he should have made straight for the exact rendezvous used his initiative instead of acting as he had the admirals next words changed that you were not to know of course but the army is in the process of evacuating philadelphia failing backl he looked down at the empty glass sounds better than a retreat but it amounts to the same bolitho was stunned reverses he could accept this war was so extended the areas so vast and little known that no plan of battle of the old style could be expected but to quit philadelphia the vital command garrison of the delaware was unthinkable in spite ob his caution he said surely that was unnecessary sirt i thought we had destroyed all the american forts and outposts on the delaware last year the admiral eyed him shrewdly that was last years before burgoyne surrendered at saratoga the whole of this area is overrun with bands of raiders and enema informers he threw open the chart with ma squadron i must patrol and keep watch over the whole three hundred miles of coastline from new york down to cape henry on chesapeake bay it is a labyrinth inlets and rivers coves and hiding places where you could fail to sight a threedecker at a miles range and every day the sea teems with shipping from the norths and as far south as the spanish main and caribbean dutch portuguese spanish and most ofem intent on slipping past my patrols with stores and guns for the enemy he poured two more glasses of claret however now that you have brought these despatches we are aware of the extent of our dangers the french are out in the open at last i have already sent word to the commanderinchief and all senior officers here he smiled you did well bolitho no one could have expected so newly appointed a commander to act as you did thank you sir bolitho thrust away the opposite side of the picture ifhe had sailed with the rich transports into an enema trap the admiral would have spoken very differently pity about miranda we are cruelly short ob frigates about the bonaventure sir i was wondering you are a man who does a lot of wondering the admiral continued to smile not too bad a fault in some i knew your father i hope he is well he did not wait for or expect an answer he hurried on i am drafting fresh orders for you the military in their hastes unfortunately allowed an headquarters company to become lost he added dryly between ourselves is too have done a certain amount of wondering about some of our military colleagues ashore some or so it would appear did not obtain the necessary brains to match their appointments he gave an elaborate sigh but then who am i to judge we are fortunate we carry our homes our manner of existence around with us like seaturtles it is hard to compare that with some wretched infantryman loaded down with pack and muskets footsore and half starved he has to contend with living off the land fighting shadows being shot at by american woodsmen as well as coming to grips with welltrained troops bolitho watched him curiously on the face of it the admiral was nothing out of the ordinary no more than you would expect of one backed up by his power and authority but his features certainly hid a razorsharp mind the way he could throw it around from one aspect to the next without losing sight of anything what about the bonaventure by the way shes big and fast sir bolitho readjusted his mind again at least forty guns and well handled i am sure she was the one which followed us yet was well able to outsail us when the time came he waited but the admirals face was a mask a match for any frigate point taken i will make inquiries about her pedigree he opened his watch i want you to sai today and find that missing company of footsoldiers before they are captured bolitho stared at him but sir i have my orders ah yes he bobbed his head now you have mine eh bolitho sank back in the chair yes sir i neglected to mention that the soldiers are transporting gold bullion god knows the exact amounts i find it difficult on occasions to crack the military mind into precise details but it is a great deal fortunes ob war army pay booty whatever it is you may be sure it is valuable he smiled it has a complete general with it bolitho swallowed the claret in one gulp a general sir no less take care he is well connected and not given to much tolerance he continued evenly your arrival is a godsend i have only one small brig available and i was loath to send her bolitho stayed silent lose her was probably wha he really meant arrangements have been made for some arma scouts to accompany you and a small detachment is already trying to make contact with the missing company he paused before saying quietly you will be under the instruction of one colonel foley he knows the area well so you must abide by his experience i understand sir good i will have your written orders sent to you without delay another glance at the watch i will expect you to be ready to weigh before dusk may i ask where i am to go sir you may not it will be clear in your orders i do not want the whole of new york to learn of it yet general washington has many friends here just as we have many who are waiting to change sides if things go badly for us he held out his hand it was over take care bolitho england will need all her sons if she is to survive let alone win this damn war but if yo succeed in this venture you will be more than able to face whatever lies ahead you can rejoin your own squadron with much more than seniority to your credit in something like a daze bolitho found his way to the entry port his mind grappling with the admirals words this time he was greeted by the flag captain in person who asked quickly has he told you what he wants of you yes the captain studied bolitho thoughtfully the generals brother is a member of the government thought i should tell you bolitho tugged his hat down on his forehead thank you sir i will try to remember the captain grinned at his grave expression you youngsters have all the luck his laughter was drowned by the trilling pipes as bolitho climbed once more into his gig it was towards the end of the last dog watch when bolithos passenger colonel hector foley climbed aboard from the guardboat in his early thirties he had the dark even swarthy good looks of a spaniard set off with a hooked nose and deepset brown eyes the appearance seemed totally at odds with the impeccable scarlet coat and closefitting white breeches of an infantry officer he glanced around the stern cabin and accepted bolithos offer of the sleeping compartment and cot with little more than a nod before seating himself in one of the chairs he was tall and straightbacked and like bolitho had to be careful when moving between the deckhead beams he took out his watch and said calmly i suggest you read your orders captain given luck your part of the game should be no more than transport he did not smile or show any emotion which bolitho could recognise his contained aloof manner was vaguely disturbing irritating it made bolitho feel cut ofb from the more vital aspects of his strange mission the orders took little time to read he was to proceed with as much despatch as possible some one hundred and fifty miles southward along the coastline of new jersey under cover of darkness if considered possible and prudent he would then enter delaware bay to such distance and position as would be directed by colonel foley he reread the orders more slowly conscious the whole time of foleys polished boots tapping gently on the deck beside the table if considered possible and prudent that passage seemed to stand out more than all the rest and he was again reminded of colquhouns prophecy it meant simply that it was his responsibility foley could suggest what he liked pick any landing place or rendezvous with equal indifference to the problems ob sailing the ship close inshore through badly charted channels where in places the seabed was visible even to a man nearly blind he looked up can you tell me nothing more sir foley shrugged i have twenty scouts aboard they will have to make the first contact the scouts had arrived some time before the colonel they were canadians and in their buckskin clothing and fur caps their outward appearance ob slovenly ease gave little hint of being soldiers bolitho had seen them sprawled around the gun decks cleaning their assortment of weapons or idly watching the busy seamen with amused contempt foley seemed to read his mind they are good soldiers captain well used to this sort of warfare i should have thought you could have obtained similar assistance locally sir foley regarded him coldly an american is an american i do not choose to trust any of them if i can obtain an alternative then there seems little point in continuing the wars sir for the first time foley smiled i need to have perfect trust in my men idealists i do not need at present stockdale opened the door and asked huskily are you ready for the officers sir he glanced at foley eight bells ave just struck yes bolitho pulled at his neckcloth angry that he could rise so easily to foleys arrogance fitch hurried into the cabin and fit two lanterns for although it was early evening the sky was unusualla overcast and the wind veered to the west with a hint ob rain in it it was also hot and stuffy and when the other officers had somehow crammed themselves into the cabin it was almost unbearable he waited watching foleys gently tapping boots as there were more delays while chairs were brought from the wardroom and in awkward shuffling silence they got themselves sorted out then he said we will weigh as soon as this meeting is over is everything prepared mr tyrrell tyrrell had his eyes fixed on the colonel aye sir mr buckle ready sir bolitho looked at the carefully worded orders recalling tyrrells astonishment when he had returned from the flagship he had blurted out but we aint had time to take on water sir the admiral had kept to his word on the matter ob secrecy he was not even going to allow the sparrows boats in contact with the shore no matter for what purpose what he would have said if he had learned that lock had begged a trip ashore in a passing lighter bolitho could not imagine lock had returned just as secretla with severyl large casks of lemons and a more mournful face than usual as he had told of their cost he said we will proceed to the southrd and enter delaware bay there we will act in cooperation with the army and take aboard foley interrupted calmly i think that will suffice for the present captain without looking at bolitho he added so gentlemen your duty is to ensure that this vessel is in the right place at the right time and reada to fight if necessary to complete the mission the others shifted in their seats and bolitho saw the two midshipmen staring at him with surprise to thems foleys obvious control must seem strange buckle muttered bad bit o coast down there sir shoals and sandbars aplenty he sucked his teeth noisily bad foley glanced at bolitho his deepset eyes showin annoyance we are not here to discuss the competence or otherwise of your officers surely bolitho met his gaze steadily suddenly very calm indeed not sir i will vouch for my people he paused just as i am sure you will vouch for yours when the time comes in the stiff silence bolitho heard tilbys booming voice along the upper deck driving some unfortunate man about his work again he had made a bad starts but he was unrepentant foley nodded slowly we shall see graves asked may i speak sir bolitho nodded why cannot one of the inshore squadron do this mission sir foley stood up his head lowered between the beams because your vessel is the more suitables lieutenant not i assure you because you are in any way outstanding in such work bolitho looked at their faces resentment surpriseb even hurt it was all there he said slowly carry on gentlemen call all hands in ten minutes when they had filed out he said you have said that my duty is to act as your transport how i do it is ma responsibility and i am not required to remain quiet while you insult my officers when the soldier stayed silent he continued these same men helped to save two transports which are needed so badly for the military they fought and sank a privateer and helped to drive away another more powerful ship for which you will receive the credit no doubt bolitho faced him quickly his voice low with anger thank you colonel i had no doubt you expected me to say that in front of the others just so you could make such a suggestion he picked up his hat had known that the army was already quitting philadelphias i might have spent more time in harrying that privateer than dragging my heels with your transports foley smiled well said captain i like a man who can still show some feeling bolitho slammed out of the cabin and strode unseeingly to the companion ladder he could tell from the way some seamen avoided his eye the alert manner with which young bethune was studying the flagship that they could all recognise his fury had he changed so much before he would have laughed or cursed at foleys rudeness once his back was turned now at the mention of some criticism the merest hint of an attack on his subordinates and therefore his ship was enough to drive away control and reason tyrrell came aft and said quietly i know those waters well enough sir mr buckle is a mite bothereds but i can stand by him i know thank you he had seen tyrrells expression when buckle had voiced his concern at the meeting he had been about to make the same suggestion perhaps that was why he had rushed in to defend the master against foleys sarcasm foley had already made it clear what he thought of americans rebels colonists or those unwillingly caught between the crossfire of differen factions and divided families any of them tyrrell turned to watch the gig being swayed up and over the starboard gangway bit of a bastard that one sir he shrugged ive met em before bolitho bit back the reproof he should have given but what was the use even bethune must have seen the antagonism between himself and foley let us hope he knows what he is doing mr tyrrell for all our sakes the boatswains mates charged along the gun deck and hovered over hatchways as they bawled all hands all hands clear lower deck bolitho said i did not get time to discover any news of your family ah well tyrrell tilted his hat to shade his eyes in a shaft of dying sunlight maybe later the hatch casing slid open and foley appeared at the top of the companion bolitho said evenly i must ask you to leave the quarterdeck sir he saw him start angrily and added or cover your red coat it will not help if we are seen to be carrying even one soldier with us foley witherew and tyrrell said cheerfully one to you sir it was unintended bolitho took a telescope and trained it beyond the anchored shipping our sailing must be seen as normal spies will have reported our arrival and no doubt will think only of our despatches dont intend to have the news abroad that we are going on some special mission the world may soon know ob it but the later the better he walked to the quarterdeck rail watching the seamen being mustered at their stations by the petta officers but wondering at the truth of his words could a man like foley really make him so quick to hit back as tyrrell believed man the capstantilby was clinging to the foremast shrouds his mottled face shining with sweat as he yelled at the scurrying seamen jump to it you idle buggers or ill be amongst you with my starter caught off guard by the unexpected sailing orders he was showing signs of a recent drinking bout bolitho looked at buckle once we have worked clear of the land we will get the tgallants on her the wind seems steady enough but well have rain before nightfall im thinking buckle tugged his hat aye sir he hesitated im sorry i spoke out as i did i should have known different bolitho smiled better to speak your doubts before you meet trouble it is too late when you are hard aground eh he touched his arm lightly but before we draw that close to land we will see what sparrow can do under full canvas he walked away hoping buckle felt less worried it could not be easy for him either his first ship as master and about to plunge into dangerous waters he had never seen before anchors hove short sir graves s voice was loud on the blustery wind bolitho looked at tyrrell get the ship under way if you please he swung round as a chorus of derisive laughter burst from deck below a seaman had caught his foot on one of the army scouts muskets and gone sprawling into the scuppers it seemed to amuse the soldiers greatly bolitho added coldly with this fresh wind youll need plenty of weight on the capstan bars he let his eyes rest on the canadians tyrrell grinned right away sir he cupped his hands bosun put those men on th capstan he silenced the immediate protests by adding dont hesitate to start em if you find em slacking bolitho thrust his hands beneath his coat tails and walked away from the rail so that he could watch the topmen more easily he had taken enough insults from foley there was no good reason for his own seamen to suffer also anchors aweigh sir he stared up at the thundering pattern of canvas as the ship heeled over free to the wind once clear of the lands sheltering arm the motion became more violent the waves shorter and the colou of straw in the dull light spray lifted and dashed over the busy seamen and pattered across the quarterdeck like heavy rain bolitho felt it on his lips and wet against his shirt sensing the released power as the courses and then the topgallant sails filled and bellied to the wind he watched the jibboom rise towards the scudding clouds stagger and then plunge forward and down over the next line of crests the stays and shrouds gleaming like wet ebony he pictured the angra sparrow beneath the beakhead clutching its oak leaves and acorns and wondered if the bonaventures captain had seen it when he had broken off the actions and would remember it tyrrell lurched aft his body angled steeply to the deck he yelled to the mizzen topmen before pausing to check those working at the weather braces fitch scurried past carrying a bucket and tyrrell called after him bolitho shouted above the thunder of canvas what is it tyrrell laughed th colonels being sick sir e shame aint y itb terrible bolitho turned away to hide a grin especially as it seems to be blowing harder now buckle clung to the binnacle and yelled steady she goes sir soueast by south hold her so bolitho removed his hat and let the wind press the hair against his forehead we will wear ship soon he walked up the deck and rapped the halfhour glass beside the compass i am going below to inform the colonel as he swung down the ladder he heard tyrrell laughing and buckles equally cheerful chuckle it was a small thing but it was a beginning scarlet and gold bolitho entered his cabin and was surprised to see foley seated at the table studying a chart he was fully dressed and his features had regained most of their colour after leaving sandy hook he had spent most ob the passage sprawled on the bench seat unable or unwilling to climb into the cot eyes half closed and his face like a wax mask he glanced up and grimaced the motion feels easier bolitho nodded we are standing into the bay cape may lies about five miles off the starboard beam i see foley peered at the chart for severyl seconds his fingers drumming a little tattoo across bolithos calculations and bearings what is your opinion captain bolitho looked at his lowered head it was the first time he had asked him for his views on anything under full canvas the sparrow had lived up to her name so that on the passage southward bolitho had been able to put aside his apprehensions if not forget them while he had enjoyed the sloops vitality and freedom of movement then as they had closed the land to fix their position a great squall had risens bleating and moaning with such violence that it had taken all hands to reef down and gain more sea room after the untroubled sailing with even the royals set to catch the wind it was a severe disappointment they had arrived off cape may at the entrynce to delaware bay precisely as bolitho had planned one full day after weighing anchor yet even as buckle had been takin his bearings the squall had swept offshore flattening the wavecrests and cloaking the distant land more effectively than night itself it had taken another days beating and clawing round in a great circle the land hidden to all but the masthead lookout by rainsqualls and low cloud he heard himself answer the wind has backed again sir to the souwest and it is dropping he listened to the groan of yoke lines as the rudder went over beneath the transom and thought of tyrrell and buckle beside the wheel he could also imagine the chart the great bay opening up on either beam as the sparrow under closereefed topsails headed further and further away from the sea tyrrell was a tower of strength and seemed to remember these waters as if every sandbar and current was imprinted on his brain foley looked up his face grim it has already taken too long i must know if you think we can proceed he laid one finger on the chart here directly north ob where you say we are now i estimate it to be about six leagues there is a cove he was speaking quickla and bolitho could feel his agitation bolitho leaned over the table to the west ob maurice river he paused visualising the set of the yards the weakening wind across the quarter it will take at least four hours more if the wind goes he stood back and tugged his neckcloth with the shutters tightly closed to mask the chance of showing even a glimmer of light the cabin was like a small oven on deck as he had been for much of the passage he had not felt either fatigue or strain nows he was not so sure and could even pity foleys misery during the journey outside the hull it was pitchblacks and once the ship had slipped past the protective headland he had felt the same sensation as a man striding blindly into an unlit cave he asked how long will your scouts need six hours maybe foley stretched his arms and yawned he was giving little away bolitho made up his mind in that case we will have to anchor and wait for tomorrow night before we can leave the bay there may be enemy ships nearby and cant risk a conflict in these confined waters especially if your scouts fail to find our missing soldiers and need one more day handling the ship is your concern foley regarded him evenly well the tide is right and if we wait further we might lose the wind altogether he nodded i am ready foley stood up and massaged his stomach good by god i think i have recovered my appetite i am sorry sir bolitho smiled for the galley fire has been doused he added unless you would care for some salt beef from the cask foley eyed him ruefully you have a cruel streak one sight of that muck would render me as weak as a rat bolitho made for the door in a kings ship the rats are rarely that on deck he had to wait severyl seconds before he could see further than the rail below on the gun deck he could just make out the waiting seamen their bodies etched against the darker shapes of the nearest guns he walked aft and held his hand above the shaded compass light buckle said due north sir full an bye good he beckoned to tyrrell i want our two best leadsmen in the chains already done sir tyrrell shrugged seemed the thing to do when we draw closer to the northern shore we will slip the gig bolitho sought out stockdales thick outline by the hammock nettings you will take the gig and a boats lead and line the waters hereabouts are so shallow and treacherous that you must keep ahead of the ship sounding all the while understood stockdale said stubbornly i should be ere sir just in case your place is where i say stockdale he relented immediately do as i ask and keep a shaded lantern with you you may need to signal us he glanced towards tyrrell if that happens we will drop the kedge anchor and pray the sails flapped loosely above the deck and bolitho knew the wind was still dropping its touch clammy across his face he pushed the nightmare ob sparrow grinding aground from his mind he was committed no he had committed all of them when we reach our destination mr tyrrell you may have the starboard cutter lowered mr heyward will convey our passengers ashore and return when all is well tyrrell said theyll have to wade th last few yards im thinking its shallow up there youve guessed the place then he grinned his teeth white in the gloom there aint no other suitable for this sort of game sir from forward hollowtoned like a lost spirits came the leadsmans cry by th mark five tyrrell muttered bring her up a point mr bucklel his palm rasped over his chin we must have drifted a piece bolitho remained silent they were doing all they could thank god sparrow had such shallow draught otherwise deep six tyrrell grunted fair enough in bad times ive seen a tide race turn a schooner round like a bit o flotsam thank you bolitho watched the faint splash beyond the bows as another lead went down that is a comfort by th mark five trust a soldier to choose such a place tyrrell leaned over the compass to th west still further and in th main delaware channel theres depth to spare for us even if th tides wrong a quarter less five buckle whispered hells teeth boots scraped on the planking and foley asked crisply how are we getting along captain by th mark three is it necessary for that man to make so much noise foley stared round at the figures grouped by the wheel tyrrell drawled calmly its either that colonel or we rip our keel out bolitho said a man as tall as yourself sir could just about walk twixt the keel and the ground below if he had a mind to foley did not speak for a full minute then he said im sorry it was a foolish thing to say deep four buckle breathed out slowly better bolitho felt tyrrells fingers on his arm as he said if we can keep her steady we should rest easy with some room to swing at anchor the bottoms safe and we might touch without too much danger captain foleys tone was as before sharp and impatient he waited by the nettings and then said tyrrell is he an american a colonist sir like a good many of the hands god damn bolitho added he is also a kings officer sir i hope you will remember that foleys white breeches vanished into the hatchways and tyrrell said bitterly thinks im running th ship aground just to spite him i suppose that will be enough bolitho stared past him at the dancing phosphorescence below the closed gun ports like magic weed changing shape and vanishing only to reappear elsewhere along the slowmoving hull do not envy him his work surprisingly he found that he meant it somewhere out there in the darkness was the great mass of land hills and rivers forest and scrub which could tear out a mans eye if he was careless there had been many stories of attacks and ambushes in this area and even allowing for their being magnified in the telling they were enough to chill even a seasoned fighter indians who were used to scout for washington s army who moved as silently as foxes and struck with the savagery of tigers a world ob shadows and strange noises cries which would bring a drowsy sentry wide awake in a cold sweat if he was lucky if not he would be found dead his weapons gone deep eight tyrrell moved restlessly we can leave th channel now i suggest we steer noreast very well man the braces and bring her round and so it went on hour by hour with the leads going and the reefed topsails being trimmed and retrimmed to hold the fading wind like something precious occasionally tyrrell would hurry forward to feel the tallow in one of the leads rubbing particles from it between his fingers or sniffing it like a huntingdog without his uncanny knowledge of the sea bottoms his complete confidence despite the shallow water beneath the keel bolitho knew he would have anchored long ago and waited for the dawn foley came and went severyl times but said nothing more about tyrrell he mustered the canadian scouts and spoke for severyl minutes with their sergeant later he remarked good men if i had a regiment ob them i could retake half of america bolitho let him talk without interruption it broke the tension of waiting it also helped to discover the man behind the disciplined arrogance which foley wore like a shield i have fought the americans in many places captain they learn quickly and knowhow to use their knowledge he added with sudden bitterness so they should they have a hard core of english deserters and soldiersoffortune whereas i have had to manage with dregs in one battle most of my men spoke only a few words of english imagine it captains in the kings uniform yet their tongues were more used to german dialect than ours i did not know there were so many english deserters sir some were stationed here before the rebellion their families are with them they have found roots in this country others pin their hopes on rich pickings later land maybe or some abandoned farmsteadl again the harsh bitterness but they will fight dearly no matter what their conviction for if they are taken and are found to be deserters they will leave this world on a noose and with jack ketch to speed their passing tyrrell loomed out of the darkness his voice hushed ready to slip th gig sir th cove will be fine on the larboard bow by my reckoning the tension was momentarily removed as with whispered commands and groping fingers the waiting seamen hoisted the gig over the gangway to tow jerkila alongside midshipman heyward was standing nearby as the gig idled clear and bolitho said quietly take good care when you land with the cutter keep your wits about you and no heroics he gripped his arms feeling the tension like the spring of a cocked pistol want to see you leave sparrow as a lieutenant and in one piece heyward nodded thank you sir graves climbed lightly up the ladder cutters hoisted out and ready he glanced at the midshipman send me sir hes no match for this sort of thing bolitho tried to see graves s expression but it was impossible maybe he really cared about the midshipman or perhaps he saw the prospect of action as his first chance of quick promotion bolitho could sympathise with him on either count but he replied when i was his age i was already commissioned lieutenant it was not easy then and it will not be so for him until he has learned to accept al that goes with his authority bethune said quickly signal from gig sir three flashes tyrrell snapped th bottom has changed most likely he became calm again i suggest you anchors sir very well bolitho saw the black outline of the gig bobbing slowly off the larboard how back the mizzen topsl prepare to go about we will let go the anchor and then take the kedge away in the other cutter livela there or well be joining stockdale in the gig feet thudded on the gangways and somewhere above the deck a man yelped with pain as he almost fell headlong the mizzen topsail was flapping and cracking in spite of the winds weak pressure and the noise seemed loud enough to wake the dead on darkened decks the men ran to braces and halliardss each so familiar that there was hardly any more delay than if they had been in bright sunlight unsteadily drunkenly the sloop rode into her cables the water beneath the stem alive with swirling phosphorescence both cutters were already swayin up and over the gangways their crews tumbling into them groping for oars and each other in the rush to get clear then and it all seemed to happen in a matter ob minutes everything was quiet again sails furled and the hull rocking gently to a pair of anchors while close by the boats moved warily like predators around a tethered whale foley stood beside the nettings and said send ma scouts ashore captain you have done your part then he strode to the larboard gangway to watch heywards cutter hooking on to the chains where the army scouts were already clinging like so many untida bundles bolitho asked softly what is this cove like mr tyrrell describe it the lieutenant ran his fingers through his thick hair its well sheltered less some other vessel comes close by inland its heavily wooded and as i recalls theres two rivers running down towards us he peered over the side th cutters nearly there if we hear shooting well know were in for a spell of bother he forced a grin one thing we dont need no wind to work clear we can run out th sweeps and pull her to safety bolitho nodded in almost any other vessel this mission would have been madness close inshore and with little chance of beating clear into the centre of the bay they would have been as good as wrecked he said get tilby to grease the sweeps while we are waiting if go we must then i think we had best do it silently tyrrell strode away his head jutting forward to seek out the boatswain foley reappeared and remarked i think i will get some sleep there is nothing more we can do but wait bolitho watched him go you will not sleep colonel for now it is your turn to bear the load bethune said excitedly cutters returning sir alls well bolitho smiled pass the word that our people will remain at quarters during the night but may sleep watch by watch then find the cook and see what he can produce without relighting his fires the midshipman hurried away and graves said sourly hed eat anything even if he cannot see the damn maggots in the dark bolitho sat down on the hatch casing and loosened his shirt as his head lolled in a doze he heard a heavy body lower itself to the deck nearby stockdale had returned waiting just in case as he always put it the very next instant bolitho fell into a dreamless sleep where th hell are they tyrrell trained a glass over the nettings and moved it slowly from side to side it was approaching noon and lying at two anchors the sparrow held the heat like a kiln the cloud like the wind had gone overnight and beneath an empty ska and dazzling sunlight it was impossible to move without sweating badly bolitho plucked his shirt away from his waist he had been on deck since awakening at dawn and like tyrrell was uneasy about the lack of results how different it was in daylight at the first glimmer ob sunrise he had watched the nearby land growing from the shadows the rounded hills and thick green trees beyond pleasant crescents of beach shaded by thick foliage which ran almost to the waters edge it had all seemed quiet and harmless perhaps too quiet he made himself walk to the opposite side of the quarterdeck wincing as the sun burned his shoulders like fire the bay looked vast the water was unbroken by crests and but for a swirling uneasiness of currents it could have been one large lake it measured about twenty miles across and as much from the headland to the north where the great delaware river gave it its substance beyond the jutting point which made the cove and protected sparrow from any passing vessels the river curved and twisted in an everchanging concourse with a full seventy miles before you could sight the outskirts of philadelphia he looked along the gun deck seeing the men on watch some protruding legs to mark where others lay resting beneath the gangways to escape the merciless glare he let his gaze move upwards where the yards were now festooned with branches and leaves brought aboard soon after first light they might help disguise her outline and deceive all but the professional observer between the ship and the nearest beach a cutter pulled slowly and painfully back and forth midshipman bethune squatting in the sternsheets watching the shore foolishly he had stripped to the waist and despite his tan would suffer for it later tyrrell followed him as he returned to the shelter ob the hammock nettings id like to go ashore sir he waited until bolitho faced him i could take a small party of men try and find out whats happening he opened the front of his soiled shirt and sucked in a lungful of air bettern waiting like bloody cattle for slaughter im not sure bolitho shaded his eyes as a movement made the trees shimmer by the beach but it was only a large bird tyrrell persisted look sir i guess th orders are supposed to be secret but th whole ship knows why were here them scouts spoke freely enough with a tot of rum under their belts bolitho smiled wryly i thought as much yes an it seems were expected to rescue a whole crowd of soldiers whove got lost coming overland he grimaced i can well believe it too it aint no barrack square bolitho studied his strong profile and pondered over the suggestion he had not mentioned the gold bullions so that was obviously a secret which foley had not even shared with his own men and it was just as well some might be tempted to try for it rather than any kind of rescue very well pick your men quietly and take the gig you will need arms and provisions too otherwise tyrrell smiled otherwise it might be too bad for us if sparrow sails without waiting eh it is a risk do you want to reconsider he shook his head ill start now bolitho said ill make a report of this in the log no need sir if i come to grief itd be best left unwritten he smiled sadly id not want for you to face a court martial on my account i will make it none the less bolitho forced a grin so be off with you the gig had covered less than a cable from the side when foley burst on deck his face screwed up in the glare where is he going he clung to the nettingss staring after the small boat which was almost shapeless in a drifting haze did you give him permission i did then you are a bigger fool than i imagined foleys andiety was pushing aside his selfcontrol how dare you take it on yourself colonel foley i have no doubt you are an excellent field officer experienced enough to realise that if your scouts have failed to make contact with those landed here earlier they must either be dead or taken he kept his voice level you will also appreciate that i am not going to risk my ship and company to comply with a plan already misfired foley opened his mouth and then shut it again he said flatly i have my orders the general must be rescued and the gold bolitho could not hide the bitterness that too surely foley rubbed his eyes his face suddenly showing the strain youd need a regiment to search this area even then his voice trailed away bolitho took a glass and swung it over the rail there was no sign of the gig now he said mr tyrrell has my confidence at least he might discover something foley glanced around the sunlit deck i hope sos captain otherwise you will lose this ship and that will be the very least of your worries graves appeared on the ladder saw them together and walked away bolitho frowned so he had been the one to inform foley of tyrrells expedition he asked this general who is he sir foley dragged himself from his brooding thoughts sir james blundell he came out here on a tour ob inspection he laughed shortly by the time he reached new york there was less to inspect than he had anticipated he owned a great deal of property in pennsylvania enough to buy a thousand ships like this one bolitho turned away he had never heard of the mans but this was more than he wanted to know foley would never speak his mind more clearly than he had already done but it was enough blundell had obviously been caught in the middle of retrieving some of his personal wealth by the sudden military evacuation worse he had been using his role of an inspectorgeneral for his own ends and had involved a company of desperatela needed soldiers foley looked at him for severyl seconds the men with him are mine all that are left from the whole battalion so you see why i must do this thing bolitho replied quietly had you told me that from the beginning colonel it might have been better for both of us foley did not seem to hear they were the best men i have commanded here and weve seen a dozen skirmishes together by god when it comes to the line of battle there is nothing to beat the english foot soldier even a small square of them will withstand the cream of french cavalry he spread his hands but out here they are like lost children they cannot compete with men who have lived all their lives in the woods and plains who have known times when one musket ball was the margin between survival and starvation bolitho did not know how to phrase the next question he said slowly but you were not with your men when it all happened no foley stared at two gulls diving and screaming around the topgallant yards i had been sent to new york with a convoy mostly it consisted of unwanted supplies and the soldiers women he looked hard at him and the generals niece i should not forget to mention her he was speaking quickly even on a safe trail we were dogged by enemy skirmishers and there was never a day without some poor devil being brought down by one of their long muskets by god think some of them can knock the eye out of a fly at fifta paces the deck moved very slightly and when he looked aloft bolitho saw the masthead pendant flicking out feebly before falling lifeless once more but it was the first hint of a breeze so far he said i suggest you get some rest while you cans colonel i will inform you when i hear anything foley said heavily if your mr tyrrell returns in the same breath he added that was unfair i have been so unbalanced by all this i am not myself bolitho watched him walk to the hatchway and then seated himself on a bollard if nothing happened soon foley would have to make a fresh decision with tyrrell out of the ship and the mission a failure there would be little hope for his own future once they returned to sandy hook all afternoon and into the evening the sparrow lay pinned down by the unwavering glare deck seams were so sticky that they gripped a mans foot and the gun barrels were as hot as if they had been in action for many hours the watches changed and sentries came and went hearing and seeing nothing the first rosy glow of sunset had settled over the cove and the hillside beyond was deep in purple when foley came on deck again he said there is nothing more we can do bolitho bit his lip tyrrell had not returned perhaps he was already on his way south overland or even now guiding american scouts towards the cove he shook himself like a dog his tiredness and disappointment were tearing down his reserves his trust midshipman heyward was standing by the starboard gangway his body limp against the rail like a man half asleep suddenly he jerked upright his voice hoarse as he called gig sir coming from the point bolitho ran to his side caring nothing for what tyrrell may or may not have discovered he had come back that was more than enough when the gig ground alongside he saw the oarsmen lolling on the thwarts like puppets faces and arms raw from the harsh sunlight of the day tyrrell climbed to the quarterdeck his legs and feet filthy his clothing torn he said thickly your scouts couldnt find th ones sent on ahead colonel but we did he took a mug ob water and gulped it down gratefully theyre all dead up river in a burnedout fort foley stared at the dark trees beyond the cove sq my men are still out searching tyrrell ignored him we pulled th gig into th inlet and tumbled on this old fort by accident he looked away an that aint all by a potful bolitho waited seeing the tension the pain of what he had found tyrrell said slowly just up th channel sitting as bold as you please is a bloody frigate foley swung round american no colonel not american he looked at bolitho gravely a frenchie by th cut of her no colours so guess shes a privateer bolitho steadied his racing thoughts but for their stealthy entry into the bay under tyrrells guidance they would have run under the frigates guns or at best been attacked when they had anchored tyrrell was saying so it looks as if your general has been took colonel not much use in us staying here to follow his example eh did you see what they were doing bolitho tried to picture the great river sweeping around the point the frigate anchored in the safe knowledge she could fight off an attacker from either direction tyrrell shrugged there were marks on th beach guess theyd had boats ashore getting fresh water but no sign of prisoners then it would appear that the missing soldiers are still missing bolitho glanced at the colonel if the wind gets up it is my guess that the frigate will weigh shed not risk a night passage so were safe here til dawn at least after that he did not have to explain further heyward called cutters signalling sir they all turned and stared at the darkening beach as the oars came to life and the cutter started towards the shore a solitary figure was just visible waving his musket back and forth towards bethune it was one ob foleys scouts foley snapped i must go ashore at once he ran towards the entry port they have found the general bolitho hurried after him and with stockdale on his heels plunged into the waiting gig when the boat had grounded in the shallows bolitho leapt over the gunwale and waded the last yards through clear water vaguely aware that it was the first time he had been on land apart from a few occasions in antigua for months he stood beneath a tree as foley questioned the scout knowing the man would probably become flustered with both of them present foley walked towards him his boots squeaking in the sand they found them he gestured to the wall ob trees the first party will arrive in about an hour first party bolitho saw the despair in foleys eyes the general is coming with my scouts and all the fit men he took a deep breath but there are some sixty sick and wounded following behind at a slower pace theyve been on the move for days they ran into an ambush in a gully the night before last but fought their attackers off the general says they were french off that frigate most likely bolitho tried to imagine what it must be like for the sick and injured soldiers not knowing where they were how they would survive he said the cat is out of the bag now that ship will be expecting some rescue attempt i would be in their shoes foley sighed i agree what will you do bolitho did not reply directly he beckoned to bethune who was giving the weary scout some water from his flask return to the ship at once my compliments to mr tyrrell tell him to stand by to receive the first party in an hour i want one watch of the hands ashore and all the boats it must be well handled and these men fitted into the ship if we have to jettison the stores to do it he watched the youth running to the cutter his shoulder glowing like a ripe fruit foley said quietly itll be a miracle if we can get them off in time bolitho smiled miracles do happen colonel just occasionally he walked towards the gig his tiredness forgotten then he realised that foley had not followed but was standing with his scout the colonel called after him im going inland he looked away to meet my men or what is left ob them his scarlet coat faded between the trees and he was gone general sir james blundell lay back in one of bolithos chairs and thrust a leg towards his orderly for gods sake get these damn boots off he stared up at a deckhead lantern and added i could relish a glass of something i am as dry as dust he cursed the orderly and pushed him in the shoulder with his boot easy you damn fool foley turned and looked at bolitho by the door his eyes showing anger and embarrassment could you arrange something for the general bolitho nodded and saw fitch scurrying away for some wine it was all like part of a dream a nightmare as the last of the daylight had begun to fade the soldiers who had accompanied the general had appeared along the beach even sparrows seamen who moments before had been skylarking and chattering while they enjoyed their unusual freedom ob dry land had fallen still and silent torn and bedraggled red coats filthy from forced marches and sleeping when they could in the undergrowth they had shuffled into lines like obedient animals others had followed with pack mules so loaded that it was a wonder they had survived bolitho had been on the beach with dalkeiths explaining the needs and preparations for this mass ob passengers and had watched in silence as foley had stood with his face like stone while a solitary lieutenant had lurched towards him the regimental colours across one shoulder his sword dangling from his wrist on a lanyard foley had been unable to speak he had merely touched the lieutenants shoulder and nodded towards the dulleyed soldiers along the edge of the trees before saying to bolitho for gods sake do what you can for these fellows as the seamen had hurried forward to help the soldiers into the waiting boats the last reserve had cracked along the swaying lines of red coats men had dropped like corpses while others had merely stared speechlessly at the bronzed sailors their filthy faces running with tears hands outstretched like men seeing messengers of salvation itself it had been pitiful and moving just to watch while they had lurched into the shallows and the boats the lieutenant carrying his regiments colours as he must have done all the way south from philadelphia trying to show some last control but his face reversing the lies the despair and the disbelief now as he stood watching the general it was hard to connect the two scenes together blundell was a rotund but powerfully built man and apart from dirt on his boots his uniform looked as if it had been only recently pressed his irongrey hair was neat and his heavy florid features must have been shaved within the day so far he had given bolitho little more than a cursory glance and was content to make his needs known through foley he touched the glass of wine with his tongue and grimaced i suppose one cannot hope for too much in a craft of this size what foley looked again at bolitho his expression one ob physical pain overhead and deep in the hull the timbers were alive with thudding boots the occasional bellow of orders and the squeak of tackles above the boats the general said you should have put those men to work foley no sense in letting em lie about like squires of the manor bolitho said my people can manage the loadings sir hmm the general seemed to consider him for the first time well make sure that every mule is properly checked some careless or greedy fool might be thinking of stealing their loads theres a kings ransom in those packs so think on these things when you report youre ready for sea graves appeared in the door all the soldiers are on board sir some of them are in a poor way bolitho tore his eyes from the general the droplets of wine on his lips have the cook light the galley fire mr graves that french frigate will not attempt to weigh in the darks even if the wind gets up i want those men to get something hot to eat rum too while they are waiting tell mr lock to arrange it he thought of the staggering men the fallen redcoats by the trees and this was the party of fit men foley asked quietly when will you be raising anchor captain bolitho saw the anguish in his eyes the way he lingered on his question an hour after dawn the tide will be right as will the current hereabouts according to my information the generals glass hovered in midair so that his orderly allowed the wine to pour from the decanter and across the deck what the hell are you talking about he struggled up in the chair you can sail now i heard your men saying the time was as good as any for it bolitho faced him coldly that is true only up to point sir but if i am to wait for the sick and wounded to reach the cove i must prepare for the next tide he hardened his tone i have sent my first lieutenant and forty seamen to aid their passage here i pray to god we can save them from more suffering the general lurched to his feet his eyes flashing angrily tell this young upstart foley there is an enemy ship upchannel and no time to be wasted have gone through enough in the last few days and command you to bolitho said my orders say that i am in command ob transportation for this mission sir they make no distinction between gold bullion or men he pauseds the anger churning his stomach like brandy even those too weak and sick to fend for themselves is that not so colonel foley was staring at him his eyes in dark shadow when he spoke his voice was different husky it is true captain you are in command he swung round and faced his astonished superior we sir jamess are just so much cargo bolitho turned and walked from the cabin on deck the air seemed cleaner and he made himself stand quite still by the rail above the nearest twelvepounders for severyl minutes below he could see figures moving in all directions and from the galley funnel he caught the aroma of meat stew even lock must have been too overcome by the tattered starving soldiers to restrain the cook he heard foleys boots beside him but did not turn thank you captain from me and my men and those who will owe their lives to your humanity and courage he held up his hand as bolitho turned to reply you could risk your very future because of this action as well you know bolitho shrugged rather that than live with a foul memory someone called in the darkness and a nearby cutter began to pull inshore id not leave those men behind he walked towards the gangway if needs be ill drop the gold overboard first yes i believe you would captain but foley was speaking to the darkness and when he reached the side he saw the gig already on its way to the beach bolitho sitting beside stockdale at the tiller he peered down at the gun deck where would bolitho put all these men he heard the creak of oars as the first boat thrust off from the beach one thing was certain he would find the space somehow if it cost him his commission to dare or to die bolitho opened his eyes and stared at the mug ob steaming coffee which stockdale was holding above the side of the cot he struggled upright his mind and vision readjusting to the unfamiliar surroundings the awareness that it must already be dawn he was in tyrrells small screened cabin adjoining the wardrooms and as he held the mug to his lips he realised he could not remember how he came to be there stockdale wheezed youve ad a good hours sleep sir i was fair loath to wake you he shrugged heavily but your last orders was to rouse all ands afore dawn bolithos aching mind suddenly cleared he could feel the uneven motion around him the creak of stays and shrouds the wind how is it he threw his legs to side of the cot feeling crumpled and unclean risin sir stockdale sounded unhappy from the westrd bolitho looked at him damn with the mug still in his hand he hurried from the cabin and almost fell across a line of sleeping soldiers despite the need to know what was happening he stood motionless looking at them remembering the long night the stream of sick and wounded men he had watched brought aboard by his sailors some would not see another day pass others were like skeletons racked with fever or the agony of wounds gone rotten he still felt that same cold anger and shame which he had endured then the realisation that most of the men could have been carried on the mules instead of being left to stagger further and still further in the rear of their comrades and the general he stepped over the inert shapes and continued to the quarterdeck tyrrell saw him and said you know about th wind bolitho nodded and walked to the nettings seeing the bay opening up in the pale early light like ruffled steel the dancing catspaws against the hull pushing it gently but insistently on the taut anchor cables buckle came to his side his face grey with fatigue we cant set even a scrap o canvas sir were on a lee shore an no mistake bolitho was staring along the larboard gangway and away towards the dark slab of land emerging from the shadows the point around which lay the river and the deep channel graves said we will have to stay where we are and hope that frog has a mind to do likewise he sounded doubtful bolitho shook his head thinking aloud no the frenchman will have guessed we are about even if he does not realise our exact strength either way he will up anchor soon and make for open water if he sees us in passing he will have little difficulty in aiming his broadsides he peered up at the yards where some topmen were casting away the last of their leafy camouflage above their heads the masthead pendant was whipping towards the cove and he saw the beach regaining shape in the light the marks of many feets the small humps to show where some of the soldiers had been buried within sight of rescue rescue he rubbed his chin and tried to think more logically once out in the bay they could make sail and tack towards the entrance and open sea the frenchmans on the other hand already had the advantage of the wind could even anchor if desired and pound sparrow to fragments while she lay helpless in the cove she would sink with her masts above water it was a cruel picture he said break out the kedge anchor mr tyrrells and then hoist all boats he looked at the long racks ob sweeps we will have to see what those will achieve this morning once free of the kedge the hull swung sternwards towards the beach the current swirling around her stem as if she was already under way the gun deck and gangways were crowded with men and he knew that below every space was filled with exhausted soldiers he watched the gig rising above the gangway before dropping neatly on its chocks between the cutters the seamen working in unusual silence glancing occasionally towards him by the rail as if to see his intentions he was able to pick out individual faces in the strengthening light and realized he now knew most ob them by name the reliable and the lazy the malcontents and those who were able to accept their calling enforced or otherwise with varying degrees ob trust he remembered that first day the sea of unknown men with graves excusing tyrrells absence it seemed so long ago tyrrell reported boats secured sir bolitho walked to the rail and leaned on it the wood was moist and clammy but within a few hours would be like a furnace bar if it was still above water he said you all know of that frigate lads shes up there now taking her time as frogs do in such matters he paused seeing some of the older men nudging each other and grinning at his feeble wit you can also see that we are unable to loose topsls without driving ashore but if soldiers can march all the way across country to us i reckon we should be able to get em home again what dyou say for a long moment nobody moved or spoke and he felt despair rising as if to mock him why should they care after his displeasure following the fight with the privateers they might simply see it as a just rebuff surprisingly it was the boatswain who was the first to break the silence bursting from the larboard gangway his face glowing like a grotesque heated shot he bellowed what are we waiting for ma lovelies a huzza for the capn an another for sparrow the cheering spread along the decks and up to the topmen on the yards to the dazed soldiers below and in the cramped holds and wherever a foot or so had been found for them tilby yelled an to ell with them bloody frogs he was already cutting the lashings on the nearest sweeps pushing men towards them while others scampered to open the small ports on either beam bolitho turned away seeing tyrrells great grin and buckle nodding his head and beaming as if they were already at sea and away under full sail even graves was smiling his tired face both dazed and pleased by the din he said man the capstan he wished they would stop cheering that tyrrell would obey and leave him to his thoughts run out the sweeps if you please tyrrell shouted the order and as the helmsmen stood to the wheel and the capstan took the first slow strain he turned and said theyll not let you down not after what youve done for those poor redcoats not now not ever capn bolitho could not face him instead he stared along the larboard side at the wavering line of sweeps poised above the swirling water like the oars of some ancient galley it would take a great deal of effort to move her into the bay with the wind against her and the dead weight of all her guns and extra passengers it might prove impossible stand by the sweeps swung gingerly forward the seamen clinging to the long looms and gripping the deck with their bare toes anchors aweigh graves came running aft above the seamen and yelled shes paying off sir give way all tilby threw his own weight on the aftermost sweep his bulging muscles showing evidence of the strain save come on boyos eave agin now rising and failing the lines of sweeps thrust and slashed at the water to hold the sparrows drift towards the beach and then very slowly painfully brought her under command and towards the bay bolitho called mr buckle take the wheel to tyrrell he added every officer and man on the sweeps everyone as the anchor was catted home and graves led his own party to the sweeps others slithered down backstays or ran from their stations elsewhere to give weight to the stroke bolitho tried not to watch the point green and brown now in the light it was stationary and the sloop was hardly making headway yet already the men were gasping for breath and only buckle and himself were not helping the wind was too strong the current too insistent tyrrells voice carried like a trumpet heave heave an one more lads but it was no use buckle called softly well have to anchor again sir theyll be beat in a moment severyl seamen missed their grip and almost fell as a voice shouted above the plunge and creak ob sweeps quickly there spread yourselves out with the seamen bolitho stared with disbelief as foley emerged below the quarterdeck and following him two by twos some limping others blinded by bandages came the remnants of his company foley looked up the st have never been known to fail in showing up the navy captain he steadied one of his men who was groping past him before adding you spoke earlier of miracles but sometimes they too need a little help he turned away and put himself beside a masters mate on the end of a sweep bolitho gripped the rail wanting to hide his face from them but unable to tear his eyes from their combined efforts buckle called huskily ive got steerage way sir shes answering now bolitho said softly the colonel told me he could take half the continent with the right men with men such as these he could conquer the world when he looked again he saw that the point was slipping across the starboard quarter as with great care buckle eased the helm over and watched the jibboom pointing towards deeper water here and there a man fell exhausted from a sweeps but the stroke barely faltered when the full rim of sunlight eventually broke above the distant hills sparrow was well out into the bay bolitho shouted topmen aloft stand by to make sail the jib cracked and flapped angrily then hardened into a firm crescent and as the long sweeps were withdrawn from their ports the deck tilted to a small but satisfying angle lay her on the starboard tack mr buckle as close to the wind as you can we will need all the room possible to weather cape may tyrrell came aft and stood beside the compass his eyes fixed on the hazy shoreline he looked strangely contented reassured he saw bolitho watching him and remarked it was a good feeling to get ashore again but then i guess you feel th same about england bolitho nodded gravely maybe tyrrell had been tempted after all but he had come back and that was what counted he said you did well mr tyrrell you all did tyrrell gave his lazy grin if youll pardon th liberty sir you aint no hoofdragger yourself deck there sail on th starboard quarter bolitho looked at buckle the frenchman is after us sooner than i thought get the tgallants on her if you please he walked up the slanting deck and shaded his eyes well give him a run for his money tyrrell was still grinning for th generals moneys you mean bolitho glanced down at his stained breeches im going to shave but the mood persisted for him also in case we have visitors this morning eh buckle watched him go and then said nothing ever seems to worry that one tyrrell was peering up at the topmen his eyes critical he recalled bolithos face when the wounded soldiers had staggered on deck to help man the sweeps for just those few moments he had seen beyond the brittle composure the mantle of commands to the real man beneath half to himself he murmured dont be too sure ob that mr buckle he feels it right enough just like the rest of us bolitho closed the telescope with a snap and steadied himself against a belayingpin rack alter course two points mr buckle steer due east it had taken another two hours from sighting the french frigate to tacking dangerously close around cape may with the nearest spur of that untidy headland barely two cables under the lee side they had surged towards the open sea close enough to see smoke from some inland fire and the morning sunlight flashing on a hidden window or an unseen watchers telescope it had been harder than he could have imagined to remain in a wardroom chair while stockdale shaved him and laid out a clean shirt now as he watched the men running to the braces the lifting dipping bowsprit beyond the taut rigging he wondered why he had made himself waste time below pride or conceit the need to relax even for minutes or a greater need that his seamen should think him so calm he could concentrte on his own comfort as the sloop plunged round still further until she had the wind directly astern he could feel every spar and timber quaking to the motion above the quarterdeck rail he saw the mainyard bending like one huge bows the splayed legs of the topmen denoting the savage vibration aloft the need for care when one false step could mean instant death or the longer agony ob watching the ship ploughing away to leave the fallen men to drown alone steady she be sir due east he walked to the compass and then took a careful glance at the set of the sails every inch of canvas was fully drawn the bellies so rounded and hard they looked about to burst he gestured with the telescope another pull on the larboard forebrace mr tyrrell and then belay as the men ran to obey he took one more glance astern the enemy had gained on them during the dash from the bay had cut away their early advantage while sparrow had lost valuable time clawing around the last headland now as he steadied the glass across the taffrail he could see their pursuer rising and driving over the lively whitehorses her hull bathed in spray the gun ports awash as she surged on a starboard tack showing her sleek hull and full pyramids of canvas she had set her royals once away from the headland and was heading into deeper water before continuing the chase tyrrell came aft wiping droplets of salt from his arms and face were standing well afore th wind sir theres nought else we can do at present bolitho did not reply at the quarterdeck rail he leaned over and saw the uneven lines of wounded soldiers and others less handicapped helping with food and bandages two of dalkeiths assistants came on deck and hurled a bundle over the gangway and vanished down a hatchway with hardly a glance bolitho watched the bundle bobbing away on sparrows creamy wake and felt his stomach contract violently some bloodied bandages but most likely the amputated limb of one more luckless soldier dalkeith was in his makeshift sickbay as he had been since the sloop had weighed anchor working in almost total darkness with saw and swabs while the ship yawed and staggered around him graves called above the boom of canvas the frenchmans wore sir the frigate was now about eight cables off the starboard quarter certainly no more and steering a parallel course her royals fully squared and straining at their bolts like pale breastplates bolitho said shes pulling up mr tyrrell not a great deal but enough to worry about tyrrell rested at the rail and kept his eyes forward away from the enemy frigate will i clear for action he shook his head we cannot every bit of space is packed with soldiers there is barely room on the gun deck for a twelvepounder to recoil he thought of the big thirtytwopounders pointing from either bow with the enemy astern they were impotent just so much extra weight had the enema been in their line of fire they might have been able to cripple her if only temporarily or until some ship of the inshore squadron could give them support tyrrell looked at him worriedly you have a choices sir you close th shore now and risk losing th wind altogether or you alter course to seaward within the hour he angled his thigh against the rail as sparrow plunged heavily the spray dashing aft over the decks rattling against the courses like lead pellets theres a long ridge of sandbars running north to south you take one side or tother but in an hour youll have to decide which bolitho nodded even with the barest information he had discovered on his charts he knew tyrrells estimate was only too true the sandbars like uneven humps ran for over twenty miles across their line ob advance to wear ship north or south to avoid them would mean loss of time and with the enemy so near it could represent the measure of disaster tyrrell said we could wait and see what the frenchie intends he rubbed his chin but it would be too late for us by then he shrugged helplessly im sorry sir i aint much help bolitho stared past him towards the land as the coast turned northeyst it was falling away ten fifteen miles it was hard to gauge in the bright sunlight and low sea haze you have been helpful he walked aft to the compass and saw buckle watching him grimly the earlier laughter the sudden relaxation of clearing the land had all gone now from a rumour to the sight of a sail from a distant ship to real deadly menace in the frigates line of gun ports it had all changed against them so quickly deck there sail fine on th starboard bow graves said excitedly the squadron by god thats better moments later deck shes a lugger sir heading away bolitho clasped his hands behind his back some frightened trader no doubt if still within sight she might witness a swift onesided fight within the hour the frenchmans altered course apiece buckle was peering astern through a telescope his yards are coming back bolitho waited counting seconds the frigate had swung off her original course her speed and drive taking her away slightly further off sparrows quarter he tensed seeing the telltale puff of brown smokes driven away instantly by the following wind the heavy ball plunged short by a cable the waterspout rising violently as if to mark a spouting whale bolitho shut the seamens jeers from his thoughts no matter what they believed it was a fair shot she had fired nearly two miles with what must be a powerful bowchaser like his own foley appeared at his side i heard the cannon he shaded his eyes to peer over the nettings he means to unnerve you bolitho smiled gravely he intends much more than that colonel he heard more footfalls on the quarterdeck and saw dalkeith blinking in the sunlight wiping his face on his big handkerchief he had removed his heavy aprons but there were dark stains on his legs and shoes not yet dry he saw bolitho and reported that is all for now sir ten have died more will follow i fear foley said admiringly thank you mr dalkeith it is better than i dared hope they all looked round as another dull bang echoed across the cruising whitecaps it was nearer and level with the starboard quarter dalkeith shrugged on dry land i might have saved more colonel he walked away towards the taffrails his brilliant wig askew his shoulders sagging as if from a great weight bolitho said a good surgeon usually the calling attracts the failure or the drunkard he is neither foley was studying the frigate with a telescope e woman drove him to sea maybe he ducked involuntarily as the other ship fired and the ball whimpered high overhead before throwing up a sharks fin of spray on the opposite side bolitho said hoist the colours mr tyrrell he has the feel of us now he watched the scarlet flag break from the gaff mr dalkeith have your helpers move those wounded men to the larboard side he silenced his unspoken protest with better now than when we are in real trouble graves came running aft along a gangway run outs sir no he looked up as another ball fanned above the deck load the starboard battery doubleshotted and with grape for good measure he ignored graves s puzzled expression and added to foley if we must fire it will have to be the one broadside you have been below yourself you know we cannot indulge in close action with the hull filled to its brim with sick men foley looked away i am sorry captain bolitho studied him gravely do not be my orders said little of fighting transportation was the ideal arrangement he forced a smile unfortunately the frenchman has not read them also he turned to watch the wounded being carried to the opposite side while graves and yule the gunners supervised the slow loading of every starboard gun which was not impeded by either passengers or cargo graves came to the ladder eventually and called all but four guns loaded and ready sir he broke off with a gasp as the air overhead came alive with a longdrawnout shriek as if a thousand devils had been freed from the sea itself rigging and shrouds jerked savagely and men ducked holding their hands above them as torn cordage and severyl severed blocks hurtled amongst them bolitho gripped his hands together behind him still tighter until the pain helped to steady him langridge shot as used by the big bonaventure it was vicious and very dangerous consisting of fragments of iron bound together it could cut away rigging and tear down spars with ease but unlike chainshot which was more generally used it could also do terrible damage to men otherwise hidden by gangway or bulwark the frenchman obviously wanted to dismast sparrow and take her and cargo intact the gold would pay for many requirements in the future and sparrow would make a valuable addition to the enemys fleet it had happened before within the hour he might see it happen again to him the bowchaser threw out a spurt of smoke and the sparrows main course burst open with a searing explosion the great sail ripping itself to a hundred fragments in the wind even before the enemys iron had finished falling alongside bolitho could feel the difference instantly the heavier motion between each lift and plunge the increase ob turns on the wheel as buckles helmsmen fought to hold her on course yet again that demoniac scream of whirling fragments the thud and clatter of failing rope and halliards men were working feverishly far above the decks to make good the severed rigging but the frigate was much nearer and as bolitho swung round he saw three of her foremost guns belching fire and smoke proof that she was overhauling rapidly to bring more of her armament to bear balls shrieked and whimpered overhead and one ripped through the mizzen topsail with the slap of a whip against wood men yelled and cursed to control it as once again the wind explored the damage tearing the shothole in an uneven gash from head to foot bolitho gripped the rail hard if only there was sight of a friendly sail anything which might make the frigate lose heart or change tack even for a few moments he saw a ball skipping across the wavecrests its progress clearly marked by the leaping feathers ob spray winced as the deck jumped beneath him as the shot slammed into the lower hull from below the gun deck he heard muffled cries and pictured the sick and wounded some with limbs only just cut away by dalkeith enduring the menacing roar of gunfire the increasing accuracy of each successive shot bethune came running from the ladder captain sir the general wishes to be kept informed he ducked as a ball burst through the taffrail and hurled two seamen in a tangle of writhing limbs and horrifying spurts of blood bolitho turned from the sight he had been speaking to one of them just minutes ago now he was less than a man nothing tell the general to stay below and he broke off as with a splintering crash the main topgallant canted over the sail whipping madly in a web of parted rigging while the yard itself snapped into equal halves before pitching towards the deck men ran in confusion until the avalanche of wood and cordage had draped itself over the larboard gangway to trail alongside in a maelstrom of spray a man it must have been the lookout was hurled bodily to the topsail yard and even above the din bolitho heard his shrill scream saw him roll over and fall the rest of the way to the gun deck another ragged burst of cannon fire and tilba dashed amongst the struggling seamen his arms flailing as he pushed and drove them with their axes to free the ship from its torn rigging tyrrell shouted we will have to alter course sir he was yelling to make himself heard as men rushed past him faces screwed into tight masks their eyes blind even to the butchered corpses beside the nettings bolitho stared at him how much water is there over those bars tyrrell seemed to think he had misheard at this time next to nothing he peered wildly at the sails as more jagged iron screamed amongst them a topman had slipped and was being suspended by his hands by two of his companions while his legs kicked helplessly in the air sweat fear or a flying splinter cut the contact and with a brief cry the man fell head over heels seemingly very slowly until he hit the sea by the hull bolitho saw him passing below the quarterdeck arms outspread his eyes very white as the water closed over them i must risk it he was shouting aloud without realising it was more than a murmur tack either way and that frigate will rake us tyrrell nodded jerkily as you say ill get a leadsman in th chains and bolitho seized his arm no do that or shorten sails and that bastard will know what were about he shook him violently if i fall you must try to take her through a ball crashed into the nettings and sliced behind him splinters and fragments filled the air and he saw foley throw one hand to his shoulder where the epaulette had been torn cleanly away he faced bolitho and said warm work captain bolitho stared at him feeling that same fixed grin on his mouth and jaw like a cruel vice like him the ship was acting like something beyond control the remaining sails driving her onwards towards the hidden menace of those hard sandbars he was banking everything on tyrrells knowledge and the hope that the frenchman was ignorant of his dangers or so blinded by all else but sparrows closeness to defeat that he was totally absorbed yet in spite of the intermittent gunfire the responding crashes and thuds of balls striking home he was able to see small but important details on every side a badly wounded seaman his shoulder mashed to bloody pulp was being held in the arms of a wounded soldier the latter was blinded from some previous fight and his face covered by bandages but his hands seemed to stand out even in all the confusion around him moving and calming shielding the sailor and groping for a flask of water to ease his suffering and dalkeith his wig screwed into one pocket while he knelt beside another injured man his fingers like scarlet claws as he felt the extent of the wound while his eyes rested on the next victim and the one after that and through it all graves walking behind the loaded guns chin on chest pausing only to check a particular crew or to step astride a corpse or fallen rigging from forward came the frightened cry i kin see the bottom bolitho ran to the nettings and pulled himself above the tightly stowed hammocks in the bright sunlight he saw the spray bursting from the rounded bilge trailing ropes and a complete section of a broken cutter dragging alongside then he saw the darting shadowy shapes gliding deeper still weed and rock clusters some of which seemed to be rising towards the keel like disturbed monsters if she struck now the masts would be ripped out ob her and she would plough forward grinding and breaking open to the waiting sea he turned to seek out the enemy how near she looked less than three cables off the quarter her complete battery run out in readiness to finish the contest buckle muttered hoarsely by the living god the frenchies in a safe channel there was a break in his voice the bastards have done for us bolitho looked at tyrrell get the tgallants off her he could not hide the despair this time as the men swanned aloft to shorten sail tyrrell shouted there was nothing else you could do he broke off as buckle and midshipman heyward yelled together shes struck bolitho pushed between them and stared with sick disbelief at the other ship she had been changing tack either because her captain had at last seen his danger or was about to rake the sloop with his first full broadside and had struck one of the bars at full speed across the strip of water they could hear the jarring crashes the awful rumble of her hull pounding aground and as she began to slew round her foremast followed and entangled with her main and mizzen topmasts came down in one mighty curtain ob leaping spray bolitho had to yell severyl times to stop his men from shouting and cheering to make them understand that their own danger was just as real alter course five points to starboard he dashed the sweat from his eyes to peer at the compass his mind dulled by the crash of spars and groaning timbers steer sou soueast with only her torn course and topsails set the sparrow came round sluggishly as if she too was beyond reason gear flapped and banged and men clambered over the scattered debris like dazed animals in their efforts to obey the shouts from aft bolitho cupped his hands and yelled mr graves run out the ports squeaked open and on their trucks the guns which could he manned trundled into the sunlight with the sloop leaning over on her new tack each cannon moved quickly down the deck until with a shout of all run out graves stared once again towards bolitho bolitho watched narrowly his hand lifting while he forced himself to see the other ship as a target and not a once living creature writhing in agony as you bear mr graves full elevation he saw the listing dismasted frigate falling past sparrows starboard bow the churned sand around her beakhead to mark the extent of her charge on to the bar his hand came down fire the hull jerked and bucked as gun by gun the doubleshotted charges ripped over the wave crests to smash into the helpless enemy a few shots from swivel guns answered the first onslaught but as the heavy balls coupled with a full load of grape swept into her side and decks those too fell silent bolitho held up his hand cease firing secure guns to buckle he added we will wear ship directly noreast by north he glanced astern at the smoking wreck she will rest there until someone comes friend or foe it makes little difference for her tyrrell watched him gravely aye aye sir he appeared to be waiting for something more bolitho walked to the rail and studied the men below him restoring lashings on the guns working to repair damage and sort out the tangle of rigging everywhere something was happening to prepare sparrow for her next challenge there was no cheering in fact little sound of voices at all just a few grins as seamen discovered good friends still alive a nod here a casual thump of the shoulder there together they told him more than words theyve learned well mr tyrrell he saw dalkeith coming aft again and steeled himself for the list ob dead and dying after this they will be ready for anything he handed his sword to stockdale who had been near him the whole time although he could not recall seeing him as i will a captains decision the sparrows stay at new york proved to be the most frustrating and testing time bolitho could remember instead of weeks as he had hoped to carry out his repairs and replace stores he was forced to wait and watch with mounting impatience while every other ship or so it appeared took precedence as the time dragged into one and then a second month he found himself ready to plead rather than demand beg instead of awaiting his rightful aid from the shore authorities and from what he could gather elsewhere it seemed that most other junior vessels were in the same situation work aboard continued without pause and already sparrow had taken on the appearance of a tried veteran sails were carefully patched rather than being replaced without thought of cost nobody seemed to know when more replenishments were arriving from england and those already in new york were guarded or he suspected hoarded for some suitable bribe the main topgallant yard had been fished and from the deck appeared as good as new how it would withstand a real storm or a chase after some blockade runner was often in bolithos mind along with the endless stream of reports to be made requisition and victualling lists to be checked and argued over with the supply yard until he began to think neither he nor his ship would ever move again most of the pride and excitement at running the french frigate aground of seeing the rescued soldiers safely landed had given way to resigned gloom day after day the ships company endured the heat and the work knowing there was no chance of setting foot on land unless under close supervision and then only on matters of duty bolitho knew the reasons for this rule were sound up to a point every vessel which came and went from sandy hook was shorthanded and unscrupulous captains had been known to steal seamen from other ships if offered half a chance since assuming command he too was short ob fifteen men those killed or so badly injured as to be unfit for further service and the news was not encouraging everywhere on the mainland the british forces were in trouble in june a complete army was forced to retreat from general washingtons attacks at the battle of monmouth and the reports which filtered to the anchored ships showed little hope of improvement to add to the fleets troubles had come the first hurricane of the season sweeping up from the caribbean like a scythe through corn it had destroyed severyl ships in its path and so damaged others they were out of commission when most needed bolitho was able to appreciate the admirals concern for his patrols and prowling frigates for the whole management of strategy along the american coast depended on their vigilance their ability to act like his eyes and an extension to his brain he was thankful for one thing only that his ship had not been so seriously damaged below the waterline as he had first feared as garby the carpenter had said shes like a little fortress sir on his regular inspections below decks to watch the works progress bolitho had understood the carpenters pride for sparrow had been built as a sloop of war quite unlike most of her contemporaries which had been purchased for the navy from the less demanding tasks of merchant service even her stop frames had been grown to the right proportions and not cut with a saw so that the hull had all the added security of natural strength the fact that but for a few ragged shotholes below the quarter which needed the aid and tools of the new york shipwrights his ship could sail and fight as before made the delay all the more unbearable he had been to see rearadmiral christie aboard his flagship but had gained little idea of when he could complete repairs the admiral had said wryly if you had been less er difficult with general blundell things might be different when bolitho had tried to draw him further he had snapped i know the general was wrong to act as he did the whole of new york knows it by now he may even be censured when he returns to englands although knowing his influence in certain regions doubt that he had shrugged wearily you bolithos had to be the one to humble him you did right and have already written a report to show my confidence in you however the right way is not always the most popular one item of news hung over bolitho like a cloud and seemed to torment him as day by day he tried to prepare his ship for sea an incoming brig had brought news of the privateer bonaventure she had fought severyl actions against supply vessels and shipsofwar alike she had seized two prizes and destroyed an escorting sloop just as he had predicted as he had feared but to him the worst part was that the privateer had returned to the same area where they had exchanged shots and had found the crippled frigate miranda a handful of survivors had been discovered drifting in a small boat some wounded or halfmad with thirsts the rest stunned by the suddenness of their ships ends when they had done so much to repair and save her over and over again bolitho searched his mind to examine his actions to discover what else he might or should have done by carrying out his orders by putting duty before the true desire to help the damaged frigate he had left her like a helpless animal before the tiger in his heart he believed he could have made no other decision but if he had realised that the two transports were no longer so desperately needed he also knew he would have acted differently when he had admitted as much to the brigs captain he had replied the your sparrow too would be at the bottom for bonaventure is more than a match for anything but a ship of the line apart from matters of duty errands to use his presence or his purse on shipyard clerks bolitho refrained from going ashore partly because he thought it unfair when his men were penned in their ship the size of which seemed to shrink with each passing day and partly because of what he saw there the military preparations were usual enough artillery wheeling and exercising the horsedrawn limbers charging at full tilt to the delight of idlers and yelling children foot soldiers drilling and sweating in the grinding heat he had even seen cavalry on severyl occasions no it went far deeper the worsening news from inland seemed to reach just so far and then stop in the great houses rarely a night passed without some fine ball or reception being held staff officers and rich traders ladies in full gowns and glittering jewels it was hard to realise they were so close to a fullscale war equally he knew his disgust came from his own inability to mix in such circles in his home town ob falmouth his family had always been respected but more as seafarers than local residents he had gone to sea at the age of twelve and his education had been more concerned with navigation and learning the mysteries of every eye and cleat each foot of cordage required to sail a ship under all conditions than the art of making smalltalk and mingling with some of the bewigged jackadandies he had seen in new york the women too seemed different beyond reach unlike the outspoken countrywomen in cornwall or the wives and daughters of fellow seaofficers they appeared to give off a power all of their own a boldness a certain amused contempt which both irritated and confused him whenever he came in contact with their perfumed privileged world he had allowed tyrrell to go ashore whenever possible and had been surprised to see the change in him instead of showing excitement or relief at being amongst men like himself places he had often visited in his fathers schooner he withdrew still further until eventually he avoided leaving the ship unless on some particular duty bolitho knew he had been making inquiries about his familys whereabouts anything which might give him some hint of their safety or otherwise also he believed that tyrrell would tell him in his own good time if that was what he wished and then three months almost to the exact day after watching the french frigate pounding herself to fragments off the hidden bar sparrow was once more ready for sea when the last shipwright had been escorted ashore each watched to make certain he took no more than he had brought with him and the watchlighters and yard hoys had pulled clear of the side bolitho wrote his report for the admiral another special mission to carry despatches or merely to return to captain colquhouns command he now cared very little which it was to be just to be under sail again free of urbane flag officers and inscrutable clerks it was all he wanted when tyrrell came aft to report the ship cleared ob shore workers bolitho asked will you dine with me this evening we may be too occupied in the near future tyrrell looked at him dully my pleasure sir he sounded worn out spent bolitho stared through the open stern windows towards the anchored ships and the pale houses beyond you may share your worries with me mr tyrrell if you wish he had not meant to say what he did bu the look of despair on the lieutenants face had pushed all caution aside tyrrell watched him by the windows his eyes in shadow i did get news my father lost his schooners but that was expected they went to one side or tother makes no difference my father also owned a small farmstead always said it was like th one he had once in england bolitho turned slowly is that gone too tyrrell shrugged th war reached th territory some months back his voice became distant toneless we had a neighbour called luke mason he an grew up together like brothers when th rebellion began luke was up north selling cattle an i was at sea luke was always a bit wild an i guess he got carried along by all the excitement anyway he joined up to fight th english but things got bad for his company they were almost wiped out in some battle or tother luke decided to go home he had had enough of war guess bolitho bit his lip he went to your father aye trouble was my father was apparently helpin th english soldiers with fodder an remounts but he was fond of luke he was like family he gave a long sigh th local colonel heard about it from some goddamn informer he had my father hanged on a tree and burned th house down for good measure bolitho exclaimed my god im sorry tyrrell did not seem to hear then th americans attacked an th redcoats retreated he looked up at the deckhead and added fiercely but luke was safe he got out of th house before it burned around him and you know what th american colonel hanged luke as a deserter he dropped on a chair and fell against the table in th name of hell wheres th goddamn sense in it all and your mother he watched tyrrells lowered head his anguish was breaking him apart she died two years back so she was spared all this theres just me now an my sister jane he looked up his eyes reflecting the sunlight like fires after capn ransome had done with her she disappeared christ alone knows where she is in the sudden silence bolitho tried to discover ho he would feel if like tyrrell he was faced with such an appalling discovery ever since he could remember he had been taught to accept the possibility of death and not shirk from it most of his ancestors had died at sea in one manner or another it was an easy thing to do quite apart from a brutal end under cannon fire or the plunge of an enemys sword there were countless traps for the unwary a fall from aloft drowning fevers men died as much from these as anything fired from a gun his brother hugh had been a lieutenant in the channel fleet when he had last seen him he could be commanding a ship against the french or at this very moment lying many fathoms down with his men but the roots would still be there the house in falmouth his father and married sisters what would he be suffering if like tyrrell he knew all that was broken and trodden down in a country where brother fought brother and men cursed each other in the same language as they struggled and died now tyrrell and many more besides had nothing left not even a country there was a rap on the door and graves stepped into the cabin this was delivered by the guardboat sir he held out a canvas envelope bolitho walked to the windows again and slit it open with a knife he hoped graves would not notice tyrells misery that the time taken to read the message would give him a moment to recover it was very brief he said quietly we are ordered to weigh at first light tomorrow we will be carrying important despatches to the admiral in antigua he had a mental picture of the endless sea miles the long passage back to english harbour and colquhoun it was a pity they had ever left in the first place graves said im not sorry well have something to boast about this time bolitho studied him gravely what an unimaginative man he is my compliments to the master tell him to make preparations at once when graves had gone bolitho added maybe youll wish to postpone dining with me tyrrell stood up his fingers touching the table as if to test his own balance no sir id like to come he looked round the cabin this was th last place i saw jane it helps a bit now bolitho watched him leave and heard the slam of a cabin door then with a sigh he sat down at the table and began to write in his log for seven untroubled days the sparrow pushed her bowsprit southwards taking full advantage of a fresh wind which hardly varied in bearing or substance throughout that time the regrets and brooding despondency which most of the company had felt at new york seemed to have blown away on the winds and their new freedom shone in the straining canvas which gleamed beneath a cloudless sky even the memory of the last fight the faces of those killed or left behind crippled to await passage home had become part of the past like old scars which took just so much time to heal as bolitho studied his chart and checked the daily sunsights he felt cause for satisfaction in sparrows performance she had already logged over a thousand miles and like himself seemed eager to leave the land as far away as possible they had not sighted even a solitary sail and the last hopeful gulls had left them two days earlier the routine aboard such a small shipofwar was regular and carefully planned so that the overcrowded conditions could be made as comfortable as possible when not working aloft on sails and rigging the hands spent their time at gun drill or in harmless contests ob wrestling and fighting with staves under stockdales professional eye on the quarterdeck too there was usually some diversion to break the monotony of empty horizons and bolitho came to know even more about his officers midshipman heyward had proved himself to be an excellent and skilful swordsman and spent severyl of the dog watches instructing bethune and the masters mates in the art of fencing the biggest surprise was robert dalkeith the plump surgeon had come on deck with the finest pair of pistols bolitho had ever seen perfectly matched and made by dodson ob london they must have cost a small fortune while one of the ships boys had thrown pieces of wood chippings from a gangway dalkeith had waited by the nettings and when they had bobbed past on the wash had despatched them without seeming to take aim such marksmanship was rare for any ships surgeons and added to the price of the pistols made bolitho think more deeply about dalkeiths past towards the end of the seventh day bolitho received his first warning that the weather was changing the sky clear and pale blue for so long became smeared by long tongues of cloud and the ship reeled more heavily in a deep swell the glass was unsteady but it was more the feel of things which told him they were in for a real blow the wind had backed to the northwest and showed every sign of strengthening and as he faced it across the taffrail he could sense the mounting power its clamminess on his skin buckle observed another hurricane i wonder maybe bolitho walked to the compass let her fall off a point he left buckle to his helmsmen and joined tyrrell by the quarterdeck rail the fringe of a storm perhaps either way we will have to reef down before dark maybe much sooner tyrrell nodded his eyes on the bulging canvas the maintgansl seems to be drawing well they did good work aloft while we were in port he watched the masthead pendant as it twisted and then flapped out more firmly towards the larboard bow goddamn the wind it backs still further by th looks of it buckle smiled glumly course sou soueast sir he cursed as the deck tilted steeply and a tall spectre of spray burst above the nettings bolitho considered the matter they had made a good passage so far there was no point in tearing the sails off her just to spite the wind he sighed perhaps it would ease again soon get the tgallants off her mr tyrrell its coming down on us now he stood aside as tyrrell ran for his trumpet out from the swaying hull he saw the telltale haze of rain advancing across the uneven swell and blotting out the horizon like a fence of chainmail within an hour the wind had backed even further and had risen to gale force with the sea and sky joined together in a torment of bursting wave crests and torrential rain it was useless to fight it and as the clouds gathered and entwined above the swooping mastheads sparrow turned and ran before it her topmen fighting and fisting the sodden canvas as ye another reef was made fast halfblinded by rain and spray their feet groping for toeholds while with curses and yells they used brute strength to bring the sails under control night came prematurely and under closereefed topsails they drove on into the darkness their world surrounded by huge wave crests their lives menaced at every step by the sea as it surged over the gangways and boiled along the decks like a river in flood even when the hands were dismissed in watches to find a moment of rest and shelter below there was little to sustain them everything was dripping or damp and the cook had long since given up any idea of producing a hot meal bolitho remained on the quarterdeck his tarpaulin coat plastered to his body like a shroud while the wind howled and screamed around him shrouds and rigging whined like the strings of some mad orchestras and above the deck hidden in darkness the crack and boom of canvas told its own story in brief lulls the wind seemed to drop holding its breath as if to consider its efforts against the embattled sloop in those small moments bolitho could feel the salt warming on his face raw to the touch he could hear the clank ob pumps the muffled shouts from below and on the hidden forecastle as unseen men fought to make fast lashings seek out severed cordage or merely to reassure each other they were alive all night the wind battered against them driving them further and still further to the southcast hour by hour as bolitho peered at the compass or reeled below to examine his chart there was neither rest nor relief from its pounding bolitho felt bruised and sicks as if he had been fighting a physical battle or dragged halfdrowned from the sea itself despite his reeling mind he thanked god he had not tried to lie to and ride out the storm under a solitary reefed topsail with this strength of wind and sea sparrow would never have recovered could have been all aback and dismasted before anyone had realised what they were truly against he could even find a moment to marvel at sparrows behaviour uncomfortable she was to every man aboard fighting the jerking canvas or working on the pumps with sea and bilge water swirling amongst them like rats in a sewer their lives were made worse by the motion up higher still and then down with the sound of thunder across a great crest every spar and timber shaking as if to rip free of the hull food a few precious possessions clothing all surged about the decks in wild abandon but not a gun tore away from its lashings not a bolt snapped nor was any hatch stove in by the attacking sea sparrow took it all rode each assault with the unsteady belligerence of a drunken marine by the time they sighted a first hint of grey in the ska the sea had begun to ease and when the sun peeped languidly above the horizon it was hard to believe they were in the same ocean the wind had veered again to the northwest and as they stared with saltcaked eyes at the patches of blue between the clouds they knew they were being left in comparative peace bolitho realised that if he allowed the hands to rest now they would not be able to move again for hours he looked down at the gun deck and gangways seeing their tired faces and torn clothing the way the topmens tarred hands were held like claws after their repeated journeys to those treacherous yards to battle with the sails he said pass the word for the galley fire to be lit we must get some hot food into them directly he looked up as a shaft of sunlight touched the upper yards so that they shone above the retreating darkness like a triple crucifix it will be warm enough soon mr tyrrell rig windsails above each hatch and open the weather gun ports he let his saltstiffened lips crack into a smile i suggest you forget your usual concern for the ships looks and have the hands run their spare clothing aloft to dry out graves came aft and touched his hat able seaman marsh is missing he swayed and added wearily foretopman sir bolitho let his eyes stray over the starboard quarter the seaman must have been hurled overboard during the night and they had not even heard a cry which was just as well they could have done nothing to save him thank you mr graves note it in the log if you please he was still watching the sea the way the night appeared to withdraw itself before the first gold rays like some retreating assassin the seaman was out there somewhere dead and remembered by just a few his shipmates and those at home he had left so long ago he shook himself and turned to the master mr buckle i hope we can fix our position today somewhere to the souwest of the bermudas i have no doubt he smiled gently at buckles gloomy expression but fifty miles or five hundred i am not sure bolitho waited another hour until the ship had been laid on a new tack her jibboom prodding towards the southern horizon her decks and upperworks steaming in the early sunlight as if she was smouldering then he nodded to tyrrell i will take some breakfast he sniffed the greasy aroma from the galley funnel even that smell has given me an appetite with the cabin door firmly closed and stockdale padding around the table with fresh coffee and a pewter plate of fried pork bolitho was able to relax to weigh the value and cost of the nights work he had faced his first storm in command a man had died but many others had stayed alive and the sparrow was once again dipping and creaking around him as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened at all stockdale put a plate with half a loaf of stale bread on it beside a crock of yellow butter the bread was the last of that brought aboard at new york the butter probably rancid from the cask but as bolitho leaned back in his chair he felt like a king and the meagre breakfast seemed no less than a banquet he stared idly around the cabin he had survived much in so short a time it was luck more than he deserved he asked where is fitch stockdale showed his teeth dryin your sleeping gear sir he rarely spoke when bolitho was eating and thinking he had learned all about bolithos odd habits long back he added womans work bolitho laughed the sound carrying up through the open skylight where tyrrell had the watch and buckle was scribbling on his slate beside the binnacle buckle shook his head what did i tell you no worries that one deck there tyrrell stared up at the masthead as the cry came sail fine on th starboard quarter feet clattered on the ladder and bolitho appeared beside him his jaw still working on some buttered bread he said i have a feeling about this morning he saw a masters mate by the mainmast trunk and called mr raven aloft with you he held up his hand halting the man as he ran to the shrouds remember your lesson as i will graves had also come on deck partly shaved and naked to the waist bolitho looked around the waiting men studying each in turn if only to contain his impatience while raven clawed his way to the masthead changed they were all different in some way toughened more confident perhaps like bronzed pirates held together by their tradehe hesitatedtheir loyalty deck there another maddening wait and then raven yelled down its her right enough the bonaventure something like a growl came from the watching seamen one man shouted the bloody bonaventure is it usll give that bugger a quiltin today an thats for sure severyl others cheered and even bethune called excitedly huzza lads bolitho turned to look at them again his heart suddenly heavy the promise of the morning sour and spoiled get the tgallants on her mr tyrrell the royals too if the wind stays friendly he saw tyrrells eyes worried even sad and snapped we have orders to carry despatches to our admiral he gestured angrily towards the taffrail do you want to match guns with her he turned away adding vehemently by god id like nothing better than to see her strike tyrrell took his trumpet and shouted call th hands all hands make sail he glanced quickly at bolitho who was staring astern the privateer was not visible from anywhere but the masthead nor would she be now but bolitho was staring fixedly as if he could see every gun each gaping muzzle like the day she had swept mirandas defences aside like so much rubbish graves moved to his side his eyes on the seamen as they hurried to their various stations some still puzzled by their orders tyrrell said quietly it aint easy to run before an enemy graves shrugged how about you id have thought you should be somewhat comforted by the fact he fell back before tyrrells cold stare but added smoothly it would have been less easy for you to fight a yankees eh then he hurried down the ladder towards his men at the foremast tyrrell followed him with his eyes bastard he spoke only to himself and was surprised to find he was so calm bastard when he turned his head he saw bolitho had left the deck buckle dipped his thumb to the skylight hes not laughing now mr tyrrell he sounded grim id not have his rank for all the whores in plymouth tyrrell tapped the halfhour glass and said nothing how different from captain ransome he thought he would have shared neither hopes nor fears with any of them and these same seamen who were already swarming up the ratlines on either beam would have shown no surprise if he made a similar decision as bolitho it was because they seemed to think bolitho could lead them anywhere and with all odds against them that they were puzzled by his action the sudden realisation troubled him partly because bolitho did not understand but mainly because he should have been the one to make bolitho realise how they all felt for him ransome had always used and never led them instead of example he had laid down rules whereas he tyrrell glanced at the cabin skylight now shuts and imagined he could hear a girls voice again graves strode aft and touched his hat his tone formal in front of the watching eyes permission to dismiss the watch below sir aye carry on mr graves they held each others gaze then tyrrell turned his back he walked to the rail and stared up at the freshly trimmed sails the seamen on the upper yards their skins brown in the sunlight the privateer would never catch them now even if she so intended it would be another ship a fat merchantman or some unsuspecting trader from the bahamas he saw the captains coxswain beside the nettings and asked how is he stockdale stockdale regarded him warily like a watchdog examining a possible intruder then he relaxed slightly his big hands loose at his sides es in irons at th moment sir he stared angrily at the blue water but weve come through worse afore a whole lot worse tyrrell nodded seeing the certainty in stockdales eyes like something written he has a good friend in you stockdale the coxswain turned his broken face away aye i could tell you things i seen im do thatd make some ob these jacks run to their mothers and pray tyrrell kept quiet and very still watching the mans profile as he relived some memory an incident so vivid it was like yesterday stockdale said in his wheezing voice ive carried im like a child seen im so beside hisself with anger theres not a manjackd draw near other times ive seen im old a man in is arms until e died even though there was nought anyone could do for th poor bugger he swung round his eyes fierce i aint got the words for it else id make em all listen tyrrell reached out and touched his massive arm youre wrong youve got th words right enough and thanks for telling me stockdale grunted and walked heavily towards the hatch he had never spoken like that before but somehow he trusted tyrrell like bolitho he was a man not just an officer and for him that was more than enough all that day the sparrow ran freely towards an empty horizon the watches changed drills were carried outs and one man was flogged for drawing his knife against a messmate after an argument but there were no contests on deck and when heyward appeared with his swords to begin another period of instruction he found no takers nor did dalkeith leave his sickbay for a pistol shoot in his cabin bolitho remained with his thoughts wondering why a simple action was so hard to bears merely because he had been the one to dictate it command leadership authority they were mere words at no time could they explain his true feelings or wipe away inner misgivings as rearadmiral christie had said the right way was not always the most popular or the easiest to accept when the bell chimed out for the first dog watch he heard another cry from the masthead deck there sail on the lee bow he made himself remain seated at the table until midshipman bethune came down to report that the sail was barely moving and was perhaps hoveto even then he delayed before going on deck another disappointment a fresh need to take avoiding action from one more enemy only time and distance would tell him these things graves who had the watch said if its one of our frigates we could turn and close with the bonaventures sir heyward added maybe we could take her as a prize bolitho faced them coldly and if shes a french frigate what then he saw them stiffen under his stare i suggest you hold your suppositions until later but it was neither privateer nor patrolling shipofwar as sparrow sped down towards her bolitho watched the stranger through his glass seeing the gap in her outline where her main topmast had been torn away like a branch from a tree and the huge scars along her tumblehome to show the battering she had received from sea and wind buckle said quietly by god she must have taken the storm full on herself shes in a poor way im thinking tyrrell who had climbed to the main topmast yards shinned down a backstay and reported i know her sir shes th royalanne west indiaman buckle agreed aye thats so she set sail from sandy hook three days afore us bound for bristol i heard run up the colours bolitho shifted the glass carefully watching the tiny figures swarming along the other ships decks the broken gangway where a great sea had thundered inboard like a failing cliff she made a pitiful sight spars missing sails in ribbons she must have ridden out the same storm which they had skirted just a night ago bethune exclaimed i have her here in my book sir she is under warrant to the commanderinchief but bolitho barely heard him he saw the figures along the vessels upper deck pausing to stare at the approaching sloop while here and there a man was waving perhaps cheering to see a friendly flag he stiffened and then said there are women aboard that ship he lowered the glass and looked at tyrrell questioningly under warrant is she tyrrell nodded slowly indiamen do take a government charter when it suits sir he glanced away th royal annell be carrying folk from new york to england and away from th war no doubt bolitho raised the glass again his mind working on tyrrells words he said we will close her now mr tyrrell and keep her under our lee have the starboard cutter cleared for lowering the surgeon will accompany me on board he glanced at bethune signal her to that effect if she fails to understand then hail her when we draw nearer he walked away from the rail as the flags soared aloft on their halliards tyrrell followed him and said gravely shell not be able to outsail th bonaventure sir even if she was without damage bolitho faced him i know he tried to sound composed even though his mind was screaming turn after all and face the big privateer the facts had not altered sparrow would still be outgunned and sunk without too much difficulty the royal anne was so badly damaged that a respite brought about by sacrificing this ship and all her company would make no difference but to run once more leave her helpless and allow the enemy to take her at leisure was too cruel even to contemplate he must contemplate it it was his decision his buckle called shes standing by sir wed best take the way off us very well bolitho walked slowly along the side get the royals and tgallants off her mr tyrrell we will heaveto directly he saw stockdale hurrying towards him with his coat and sword it would be dark in five hours if they were to do anything they would need haste and luck especially the latter he slipped into his coat and said mr tyrrell you will come with me then as the boat was hoisted over the gangway and lowered alongside he looked astern almost expecting to see a sliver of sail or hear the mastheads call cutter alongside sir he nodded and strode towards the gangway let us be about it then and without a glance at the others he followed tyrrell down into the boat boarders away as he pulled himself up a dangling rope ladder to the royal annes thick bulwark bolitho was conscious ob the tension which awaited him there were mana people on the upper and poop decks passengers and sailors singly and in large groups but all joined together in some way as they stared at him then at the seamen who followed him up from the cutter bolitho paused to collect his thoughts and while he adjusted the sword on his hip and tyrrell mustered the boarding party into line he took a slow appraisal of the ship around him fallen rigging and broken spars whole strips of torn canvas and cordage littered the decks in profusion and he could tell by the heavy motion that she had taken a good deal of water in the bilges a tall gangling man in a blue coat stepped forward and touched his forehead im dennis sir he swallowed hard mate and senior officer where is the master jennis gestured wearily towards the rail he went overboard in the storm him and twenty more besides boots thudded on a companion ladder and bolitho stiffened as a familiar figure thrust the others aside and strode towards him it was general blundells impeccable as ever but with two pistols at his belt bolitho touched his hat i am surprised to see you sir james he tried to mask his dislike you appear to be in some trouble the general glared around him then across at the sparrow as she swayed easily in the swell her sails flapping loosely as if resting he barked and about time too this damn ship should never have been allowed out of harbour he pointed at the mate that fool cannot even keep order bolitho looked at tyrrell take your men and examine the hull and other damage quick as you can he glanced narrowly at a group of sailors lolling by the forward hatch noticing how they swayed out of time with the deck their eyes devoid of interest in his arrival or the disorder which lay on every hand the mate explained hurriedly weve had to use pistols sir some men ran wild when the storm broke weve a full cargo of rum and other spirits as well as molasses and coffee while the rest of us were working the ship they and a few passengers broached holds and began drinking he shuddered what with women crying an screaming the ship failing about us an capn harper lost overboard i was hard put to watch everything at once blundell snapped youre bloody useless id have you shot for your incompetence as the first of sparrows seamen approached the fore hatch the drunken figures seemed to come to life with jeers and taunts they blocked the way across the deck and from right forward an unseen hand hurled a bottle which shattered against a ring bolt bringing bright droplets of blood down a sailors chest bolitho said sharply carry on mr tyrrell the lieutenant nodded party draw cutlasses he took his pistol and pointed it at the line of swaying figures kill anyone who interferes bosuns mates take em below and put em on the pumps one made as if to run amongst the small party but fell senseless as the boatswains mate brought the flat of his blade hard down on the side of his head bolitho said there is much to do mr jennis turn the hands to and replace your foresl have all this clutter cut adrift so that the injured may be laid on deck where my surgeon can attend them he waited until the mate had shouted his instructions before adding how are you armed jennis waved vaguely around him not much sir twentysixpounders and some swivels we aim to steer clear of trouble these guns are all we need for fighting off the buccaneer or wouldbe pirate he looked up startled why do you ask general blundell interrupted hells teeth must stand here while you people discuss the fittings of this wretched ship i have had all i can tolerate and bolitho said abruptly sir james there is an enema privateer to the north she is probably still following us the fittings as you call them will be very useful if that enemy comes our way he turned cocking his head as the clank of pumps told him tyrrell had the mutinous seamen in hand to stockdale he said go aft see what you can discover blundell sounded less confident privateer attack us bolitho replied the sparrow is very small sir the enemy more than twice our strength the general grunted well better than nothing iffight you must it will be for the finest reasons bolitho ignored him as tyrrell came on deck again i have sounded th well th hull is taking water steadily but th pumps seem to be containing it its all hell below cabins broken open drunks and two dead from knife wounds he frowned towards the mate who was urging his men to clear away fallen spars he must have been mad with worry he saw bolithos expression whatll we do blundell said your captain will do his duty if we are attacked he will defend this ship and passengers do you need telling man tyrrell eyed him coolly not by you general bolitho snapped how many women are there he was watching stockdale ushering them from the poops his voice barely audible as he tried to placate them there were children too more than he had realised for gods sake how much longer are you going to stand like this the general was shouting his face almost as red as his tunic what does it matter how many this or that we have on board or what colour their eyes are he got no further tyrrell stepped between them his head lowered so that their faces were nearly touching look here general what th capn says is right the enemy can outshoot anything we have to offer an this indiaman is a damn sight worse off not my concern and ill tell you once more to mind your manners warn me general tyrrell laughed silently but for you meddling with us at sandy hook th sparrow would have completed repairs an been away at sea a month back so but for that you would be alone out heres sitting like a fat duck waiting to be shot for th pot his tone hardened so mind your damn manners sir bolitho was standing apart from them only half listening to their hushed anger once again blundells interference was to put him and the ship in real jeopardy but the facts were unchanged he turned to conceal his despair all he had was the hope that bonaventure would not find them that he could set sail on the battered indiaman and leave the area with all possible haste the mate dennis came aft again ive got the hands bending on a new foresl sir apart from that weve little spare canvas aboard not made up that is this is a company ship and we were expecting to have a complete overhaul once we reached bristol thats why we sailed shorthanded and one officer under strength he wiped his hand across his lined face if you hadnt found us i think more of the men might have gone mad and mutinied weve a fair sprinkling of rogues amongst the passengers as well as honest ones bolitho looked up as a block swayed and clattered against the mizzen topmast he saw the torn sails stirring like ragged banners the sudden movement in the bright company flag he frowned the wind was freshening very slightly but it made things harder if he was to face the decision which had to be made and yet there was still a chance he might be wrong if so all this would do nothing but harm and cause more suffering to the passengers he pulled out his watch and flipped open the cover less than four hours of visibility left mr tyrrell have the royal annes boats lowered at once send a message to graves and tell him i want our boats and fifty seamen here without delay we must work like the devil if we are to get this ship fit to make sail again he waited until tyrrell and the indiamans mate had hurried away before saying well sir james i must see what needs to be done the general called after him and if as you fear the enemy appears do you intend to steal away and leave us he sounded hoarse with suppressed anger will written orders save your disgrace after taking such a course bolitho stopped and faced him again no sir james to both questions if we are allowed time i will transfer all royal annes passengers and additional hands to my own ship the generals eyes were bulging what leave the cargo and sail away without it he seemed stunned in disbelief bolitho shifted his gaze outboard watching the boats alongside the slow return of order as his own men took control of course he should have realised the generals booty was on board too surprisingly the thought helped to steady him he could even smile as he said you can appreciate the need for haste sir for both our reasons tyrrell fell in step beside him that took th wind from his sails bolitho said it is no joke if we can get under way in company at dawn we will have a fair chance it may be that the bonaventure changed tack altogether when we lost her she could be many leagues away by now tyrrell glanced at him but you dont think so no he stepped aside as broken rigging was dragged like black snakes from an upended boat it is the when rather than the if which troubles me tyrrell pointed across the bulwark graves is sending th first of th men over he grimaced itll leave him shorthanded in sparrow barely enough to work ship bolitho shrugged if the company was halved by fever the rest would have to manage he added now let us meet the ladies they will be more worried than the general i should imagine there were about fifty of them crowded together below the high poop but separated by their rank and station in that other world outside the ship old and young plain and beautiful they watched bolitho in silence as if he had risen from the sea like a messenger from neptune ladies he licked his lips as a strikingly beautiful girl in a gown of yellow silk smiled at him he tried again i must regret the inconvenience but there is much to do before we can see you safely on your voyage she was still smiling direct amused just the way which always reduced him to confusion ifanyone is injured my surgeon will do his best for her e meal is being prepared and my own men will stand guard over your quarters the girl asked do you think the enemy will comes captain she had a cool confident voice which spoke of education and breeding he hesitated it is always possible she showed her even teeth there now what profound words from so young a kings officer severyl of the others smiled some even laughed aloud bolitho said stiffly if you will excuse me ladies he shot the girl a fierce stare i have work to do tyrrell hid a smile as he strode past him recalling stockdales words so angry that not a man jack would draw near he was angry now blazing it was goods tyrrell concluded it might take his mind off the real danger a servant girl touched his arm beggin yer pardon sir but theres a lady below in a poor way vera feverish bolitho stopped and looked at them fetch the surgeon he tensed as the other girl came towards him her face suddenly grave i am sorry i made you angry captain it was unforgivable angry bolitho plucked at his swordbelt i do not recollect she touched his hand now that is beneath you captain unsure maybe but never pompous i see you quite differently when you have quite finished again she stopped him without even raising her voice the other women were close on hysterias captain one minute the storm was throwing us about like rag dolls the very next instant there is the cry ob mutiny and riot men fighting each other for the drink and for what they might take from us when they were too crazed to know otherwise she dropped her eyes it was horrible terrifying the eyes came up again and levelled on his face they were the colour ob violets then all at once there was a shout someone called a ship a kings ship and we ran on deck despite the dangers she turned to look across the bulwark and there you were little sparrow it was almost too much for most of us had i not made that jest at your expense think some might have broken down bolithos defences wavered er yes quite so he toyed with his swordhilt seeing dalkeith hurry past and giving him a curious glance as he went you thought quickly maam i know about some things captain i saw your eyes when you spoke to your lieutenant and sir james there is worse to come is there not bolitho shrugged in truth i do not know he heard the general shouting angrily at a seaman and said that man is bad enough for me she gave a mock curtsy smiling again sir jamest he can be difficult i agree you know him she moved back towards the other women ma uncle captain she laughed really you must try to hide your emotions better or else you will never be an admiral tyrrell came on deck and said that woman in the cabin is ill but dalkeith is managing well enough he frowned are you all right sir bolitho rasped in gods name stop asking stupid questions aye sir he grinned seeing the girl by the rail and far more beside i understand sir there was a dull bang and as they all turned bolitho saw a puff of smoke drifting from one of sparrows larboard batteries the general came panting up a ladder and shouted what was that bolitho replied quietly the signal sir my lookout has sighted the enemy he ignored the general and those near him as his mind accepted the one important fact in a way it was almost a relief to meet it recognise what must be done mr tyrrell bonaventure will take severyl hours to show her intentions by then it will be too dark for her captain to attack why should he he merely has to await the dawn and then pounce tyrrell watched him fascinated by his even tone bolitho continued if the wind does not act against us we will be able to transfer the passengers to sparrow i want every boat working and all who are neither sick nor injured to take fairly to their tasks i understand tyrrell studied him impassively theres nothing else you could do many would leave em to their own devices bolitho shook his head you have not understood am not going to abandon the royal anne or scuttle her to avoid capture as a prize he saw tyrrells jaw tighten the quick anxiety in his eyes i intend to stay in her with sixty volunteers what happens later will depend very much on bonaventures captain he had not noticed that the others had crowded round him but turned as the general exclaimed you cannot you dare not risk this ship and cargo ill see you damned first silk rustled against bolithos arm and he heard the girl say calmly be still uncle the captain intends to do more than dare she did not turn her face he intends to die for us is that not enough even for you bolitho nodded curtly and strode aft hearing stockdales voice as he hurried to cover his retreat he had to think plan every last moment until the actual second of death he paused and leaned against the ornate taffrail death was it so soon upon him he turned angrily and said pass the word for those boats to begin loading immediately women and children then the injured he glanced past the ships mate and saw the girl staring after him and no arguments from anyone he walked to the opposite side and looked at his own command how beautiful she was as she edged carefully across the indiamans quarter soon now he would be able to see the enemys sails on the horizon closing like the hunter for his kill there was so much to do orders for sparrow to carry to antigua perhaps even a quick letter to his father but not just yet he must stand quite still a little longer to watch his ship hold her in his memory before she was taken from him bolitho was still staring across the water when tyrrell came aft to report that all available boats were working carrying the passengers and indiamans company over to the waiting sloop he added shell be a mite more crowded than when we rescued th redcoats he hesitated and then said id like to stay with you sir bolitho did not look at him you realise what you are saying there is more at stake than your life tyrrell tried to grin hector graves will make a better commander sir bolitho faced him you will be called on to fight some of your own people tyrrell smiled i knew that was what you were thinking he gestured towards some of sparrows seamen as they carried an elderly woman towards the boat tackles these are my people then can i stay bolitho nodded gladly he removed his hat and ran his fingers through his hair now ill go and write graves s orders deck there sail on th larboard quarter they looked at each other and then bolitho said quickly hurry our people along i do not want the enemy to see what we are about as he strode away tyrrell stared after him and then murmured so be it capn he heard a sudden cry and saw the girl who had made bolitho angry struggling to push her way through a cordon of seamen a boatswains mate bellowed she dont want to go sir the girl punched the sailors arm but he did not seem to feel it then she shouted at tyrrell let me stay i want to be here he grinned down at her and then pointed at the boat alongside kicking and protesting she was picked up bodily and carried to the rail where with little ceremony she was passed down the side like a bright silk parcel the sky was much darker when bolitho came on deck with a sealed envelope for the boat still hooked on to the chains all other boats were hoisted and the ship around him seemed very quiet and empty he raised a telescope and trained it over the quarter the bonaventure was visible now some six miles distant but she had already shortened sails waiting as he had expected for the new day tyrrell touched his hat our men are aboard sir he gestured to the main deck where midshipman heyward was speaking to a petty officer i picked em myself but you could have had volunteers aplenty bolitho handed the envelope to a seaman pass this to the boat to tyrrell he added slowly go and take some rest i shall think awhile later as tyrrell lay in an abandoned cabin the deck of which was littered with open chests and discarded clothing he heard bolithos shoes on the planking overhead back and forth up and down thinking eventually the sound of his pacing made his eyelids droop and he fell into a dreamless sleep bolitho stood straddlelegged on the royal annes poop seeing his own shadow for the first time across the taffrail how long the night had been but at the hint of dawn everything seemed to begin at once like the start of some illrehearsed drama away on the larboard quarter he saw the hardening pyramid of sails where the big privateer moved purposefully before the wind strangely her hull was still lost in shadow with only a bone of white around her stem to reveal her growing speed about three miles distant he turned his glass to the opposite quarter to the little sloop sparrow was much closer yet in spite of this seemed even smaller tyrrell joined him and said th wind seems steady enough sir norwest by north by my reckoning he was speaking in a hushed voice as if afraid to disturb the ships and their deliberate preparations to fight bolitho nodded we will steer soueast it is what the enemy will expect he tore his eyes from the privateer and turned to look along the indiamans deck the new foresail was drawing well as were spanker and jib the rest were little better than shreds and to try to tack more than a point or so would be a waste of time tyrrell sighed ive checked th guns myself loaded as ordered he scratched his stomach some of em look so old theyd split if we doubleshotted em bolitho faced aft again to watch the other ships raising his glass he moved it slowly over sparrows deck seeing the figures on the gangways a solitary seaman at her mainmast crosstrees then aft as a freak gust lifted the foot of the main course like a millers apron he saw graves he was standing beside the wheel arms folded looking every inch a captain bolitho breathed out very slowly so much depended on graves if he lost his head or misinterpreted his carefully worded instructions the enemy would still catch two for the price of one but graves had got the first part right he was wearing bolithos new uniform the gold lace showing clearly in spite of the feeble light the enemy captain would be wary watchful nothing must go wrong at the beginning heaven alone knew how all the extra passengers had been crammed below and out ob sight it would be like a sealed tomb a nightmare for the women and children once the gunfire began midshipman heyward came to the poop and said all our boarding party are ready sir like bolitho and tyrrell he had discarded his uniform and looked even younger in his open shirt and breeches thank you bolitho noticed that instead of a midshipmans dirk heyward had thought fit to wear one of his precious swords there was a bang and he saw a ball ricocheting across the lively wave crests before throwing up a quill of spray between him and the sparrows bows e sighting shot a declaration of intent probably both he thought grimly over the water and audible above the rustle of torn canvas he heard the staccato beat of drums and pictured the scene aboard sparrow as her men ran to quarters phase two he saw the patch of scarlet as the ensign broke jauntily from her gaff felt a catch in his throat as the ports opened to reveal her line ob guns with less than half a company available graves must have pressed some of the indiamans crew into service to get the guns out so smartly but it had to look exactly right as if the sloop was preparing to show defiance and trying to defend her heavy consort another bang and the ball ploughed into the sea about a cable clear of sparrows stem bolitho clenched his jaw graves was cutting it fine ifthe wind chose this moment to veer he would be unable to go about would be in irons if he tried to fall back and try again tyrrell said hoarsely there she goes the sloops yards were swinging and as her lee gangway dipped heavily into the swell she began to tack closehauled to larboard crossing royal annes stern like a small protective terrier flags broke from her yards and bolitho imagined bethune yelling at his party to make haste and hoist the meaningless signal the enemy would think sparrow was preparing to fight to the death and was ordering the indiaman to make a run for it cannon fire ripped along the bonaventures foremost battery and more splashes leapt closer to the heeling sloop graves was shortening sail clearing away the hampering canvas from his guns even though it was unlikely he had more than a quarter ob them manned tyrrell spoke between his teeth thats close enough hector for gods sake dont make a meal ob it one heavy bang rolled across the sharkblue waters and even though the flash was hidden by sparrows hull bolitho knew it was one of her bowchasers he saw the ball slap hard into the spray by the other ships forecastle the immediate spurt of orange tongues as she fired back in earnest the sparrows foretopgallant mast quivered and then seemed to curtsy downwards into the swirling brown smoke the furled sail marking its progress as it caught and swung in the crisscross of rigging before plunging into the sea alongside holes appeared in severyl of her sails and bolitho caught his breath as the hammock nettings below the quarterdeck bucked and burst apart from a direct hit the enemy was much nearer now her foretopsail bulging as she stood before the wind charging down on the sloop which was now less than two cables from her starboard bow tyrrell exclaimed hes done it blast th man hes going about the sparrow was wearing her masts swinging upright as she came round violently the growing light making her sails shine as they flapped and puckered to the strain the gunfire had stopped for with her stern towards the enemy sparrow presented no target at all her forecourse was already being unleashed and as she gathered way through the water bolitho saw the topmen running out along the yards like black insects until more and still more canvas bellied to the wind he could see buckle by the quarterdeck rail too intent on his work even to watch the labouring indiaman as she surged past sparrow was abeam and then in minutes was well beyond the indiamans bows heading towards the first rays of sunlight from the placid horizon bolitho felt suddenly dry his limbs very loose as if belonging to someone else he watched the bonaventures forecourse being brailed up to reveal her great span of poop the men on her gangways who were waving and gesturing after the retreating sloop jeering no doubt all the madness of intended battle now lost in the confused actions of an unfought victory bolitho walked to the rail and said quietly remember mr tyrrell and remember it well we have to cripple her if we can then if a patrolling frigate finds her she can finish what we started he gripped his wrist but make sure our people play their parts ifbonaventure hauls off now she can pound us to pieces without losing a breath the privateer had edged closer running down towards the quarter so that she would eventually overhaul royal anne along her larboard side her captain was a superb seaman with all but his topsails clewed up he was handling the heavy vessel with both confidence and skill and would certainly hold the windgage no matter what bolitho tried to do a gun flashed out its long tongue and bolitho felt the ball smack into the lower hull jerking the planks at his feet with savage violence he saw bunched figures on the other ships poops the wink of sunlight on raised telescopes and guessed they were examining their victim it looked much as it had when he had come aboard damaged bulwarks and broken rigging one hatch had been purposefully left open and severyl of his men were running about in apparent confusion while heyward directed their performance from beneath the forecastle now bolitho waved his hand and from the main deck one then another of the sixpounders hurled its challenge across the narrowing strip of water from aft a swivel banged sharply the canister probably falling harmlessly long before it reached the enemys side the response was immediate gun by gun the bonaventures broadside sent ball after ball crashing into the hull bolitho was thankful he had sent most ob his men below otherwise they would have been cut down by the fierceness of the onslaught timber and planks flew in all directions and he saw a seaman hurled like a bloody rag to the opposite side his limbs kicking as he died stockdale looked at bolitho and saw him nod with a grunt he dashed along the deck waving a cutlass while bolitho drew his pistol and yelled after him when stockdale ran on towards the halliards he fired praying that his hand was steady as the shot whined clear above the coxswains head stockdale reached his goal and with one slash severed the halliards bringing the big company flag tumbling down like some bright shroud across the weather rail in a lull of noise and gunfire bolitho heard a voice across the water magnified and unreal in a speaking trumpet heave to or ill sink you from forward he heard heyward urging his men to obey the call the sudden groan of timber as the ship lurched drunkenly into the wind her remaining sails flapping and banging in disorder tyrrell said hes going to grapple there were men on the bonaventures yards and as the big hull surged carefully and then more insistently against the side bolitho saw grapnels flying from a dozen points at once the men on the yards were busily making fast their lines to royal annes shrouds and spars so that as both ships lifted and swayed together bolitho knew the moment to act had arrived now boarders away with a wild chorus of yells the hidden seamen surged up from both hatches and on to the bulwarks their cutlasses and boarding pikes marking down severyl enemy hands before they realised what was happening moments seconds earlier they had see royal anne as one more helpless prize a ship which had struck to them her flag hacked down by one of her own crew then as if from nowhere the bulk ob bolithos seamen came surging up and over the sides their steel bright in the sun their voices hoarse and wild with the madness of combat bolitho ran to the rail and jerked the lanyard ob another swivel seeing the packed canister scything through a bunch of men on bonaventures gangway and blasting them aside in its murderous hail then he was running with the second party and pulling himself on to the shrouds slashing with his sword at a mans arm on the chains below screams and curses the bang of pistols and rasp of steel he was dazed by the noise a man plummeted past him to be held like a tortured animal between the two grinding hulls his blood running pink in the leaping feathers ob foam he was on the enemys deck his arm jarring as he struck down a mans guard and drove the hilt against his jaw throwing him back into the struggling figures beyond another charged forward with a levelled bayonet slipped on a smear of blood and took stockdales blade across his neck it sounded like an axe biting into a log he yelled wildly cut the rigging lads cripple the bastard he felt a ball fan hotly past his face and ducked as another smacked into a seamans chest right beside him his cry lost in the other din of battle now he was on a ladder shoes sliding in blood his fingers feeling up a rail conscious of the torn wood where one of the swivels had made its mark two officers were parrying aside pikes and swords as they tried to rally their men from the opposite side bolitho saw one of them drive his sword into a boatswains mate saw the eyes roll with agony as he pitched to the deck below then he was up and facing the privateers officer their swords clashing as they struck and explored their strength and weakness damn you the man ducked and thrust up at bolithos throat strike while you are still alive you mad bugger bolitho caught the blade across his basket hilt and levered the man clear feeling the warmth of his body the fierceness of his breathing he yelled back strike be damned a pistol exploded and the officer dropped his arms staring blankly at the blood which pumped through his shirt in a bright red stain tyrrell strode past and fired a second pistol into the mans chest when he turned bolitho saw that tyrrells face was like stone he shouted i knew that bastard capn a bloody slaver afore th war then with a gasp he dropped on one knee blood running from his thigh bolitho dragged him asides cutting down a screaming seaman and thrusting the blade through his chest in two swift movements easy he stared desperately above the nearest men much of the enemys rigging had been slashed but the attack had made little impression after all and his men were failing back around him the lust to fight and win dwindling to match their numbers on every hand or so it appeared muskets and pistols were firing down into the retreating english seamen and he saw heyward standing astride a wounded man and screaming like a madman as he fought off two attackers at once as if from a great distance he saw the american captain watching from his poop a tall handsome man who was standing quite motionless either so confident in his mens efforts or so appalled by his attackers sacrifice that he was unable to tear his eyes away bolitho hacked a cutlass aside and sobbed aloud as his blade broke within inches of the hilt he hurled the remains at the mans head and saw him fall kicking impaled on a pike in a half daze he recalled the trader at english harbour who had sold him the sword he would not get his money now damn his eyes to stockdale he croaked you know what to do he had to push him away and even as he ran from the fighting he was still peering back his eyes filled with anxiety then there was the distorted voice again and when he looked up he saw the american captain using his trumpet strike now you have done more than enough strike or die bolitho swung round his heart bursting his mind sick as he saw a young seaman fall to the deck his face opened by a cutlass from ear to chin tyrrell was struggling on his injured knee and pointing wildly look stockdales done it from the main batch on the indiamans deck came a growing plume of dark smoke spreading and thickening until it seemed to spurt up through the seams like steam under pressure bolitho yelled fall back lads back then they were limping and staggering across the bulwarks dragging their wounded carrying others too crippled to move there were not many of thems wounded or otherwise bolitho wiped his streaming eyes hearing tyrrell gasp with agony as he half carried half dragged him to the opposite bulwark behind him he could hear frenzied shouts the sudden click of steel as the bonaventures men tried to cut away the lashings which they themselves had so skilfully used to hold both ships together but it was too late it had been from the instant stockdale had begun the last and most dangerous act a short fuse and then the fire had burst amongst the cargo of rum and the massive barrels ob spirits spreading through the hull at a terrible rate flames licked out of open ports and ran along the bonaventures tarred rigging like angry tongues sails vanished into ashes and then with a bellow one great sheet of flame leapt between the two hulls joining them finally in a single pyre bolitho peered down at the one remaining boat tethered to the ships quarter riding where it had been since taking his orders across to graves abandon ship lads some clambered down while others fell headlong splashing and yelling until they were helped inboard by their companions blazing canvas ashes and gusts ob sparks rained across their heads but as a seaman severed the bow rope and they groped half blinded for the oars bolitho heard another great explosion as if from the sea itself the indiaman began to settle down immediately her masts and spars interlocking with her attackers to throw flames and sparks hundreds of feet into the air he watched his small handful of fit men pulling at the oars feeling the heat searing his back as he steered the boat away from the blazing ships exploding powder and toppling masts a ships hold splitting wide open in an inferno of noise and shooting flames and later the engulfing sounds of inrushing water he heard it all even pictured the generals gold bullion which someone might discover one day on the sea bottom but it was all beyond him now they had done the impossible miranda was avenged he looked sadly at his men at their faces which now meant so much to him at young heyward filthy and exhausted a wounded seaman propped across his lap tyrrell a bloody bandage around his thigh eyes closed with pain but holding back his head as if to seek the first yellow bars of warmth from the sun and stockdale who was everywhere bandaging and baling lending weight to an oar or helping to heave a dead man over the gunwale he was tireless indestructible he held out his hand and studied it it was quite steady even though every nerve and muscle seemed to be quivering he glanced at his empty scabbard and gave a rueful smile no matter nothing mattered now how long they pulled at the oars the time it took for the two blazing hulks finally to sink bolitho did not remember the sun beat down on their aching exhausted limbs the stroke became slower and more hesitant once when bolitho peered astern he saw the seas face covered by a great spread of drifting remains from the ships and the men who had fought across them but the privateer had managed to launch at least one boat and before it was blotted out in haze he saw it was crammed with survivors perhaps they too would know the same despair as mirandas men then a shadow flitted across his face and he stared round caught off guard as sparrows topsails flashed gaily across the suns path the men in the boat watched silently unable to speak even to each other unable yet to realise they had survived bolitho stood by the tiller his eyes stinging as he watched her careful approach the lines of heads along her decks and gangways she had come for him despite the danger the unlikelihood of his plan succeeding she had returned to make sure across the water a voice hailed boat ahoy it sounded like buckle anxious maybe to know who had survived stockdale looked at him his battered face questioning when bolitho said nothing he stood up and cupped his big bands sparrow stand by for th captain bolitho sank down the last reserve draining from him he was back sea change captain richard bolitho stared at the partly written letter he had been composing to his father and then with a sigh carried his chair to the opposite end of the table it was stifling hot and as the sparrow idled sluggishly on a flat calm she swung her stern very slightly allowing the hard sunlight to reach him and require him to move still further away from the windows becalmed how used he had grown to this situation he rubbed his eyes and held his pen above the paper again it was difficult to know what to write especially as he never knew when this or any letter might find its way aboard a homebound vessel it was harder still to feel involved with that other world in england which he had left in trojan nearly six years back and yet the pen hovered uncertainly his own world so close and so vital in colour and smell in the bright sunlight and that word becalmed would still be too painful too harsh a reminder for his father of the navy which he had been forced to leave but bolitho wanted to tell him so desperately put his thoughts and memories into perspective to share his own life and thereby fill the one remaining gap in it overhead blocks clattered and feet thudded on the quarterdeck someone laughed and he heard a faint splash as one of the hands cast a fishing line outboard to try his luck his eyes moved from the letter to his open log which lay across the chart nearby the log had changed as much as himself worn around the edges matured perhaps he stared at the date on the open page april th three years almost to the day since he had first stepped aboard this ship in english harbour to assume command without moving it was possible to glance back through the bulky log book and even though he did not even touch a page he could recall so many of the things which had happened faces and events the demands made upon him and his varying successes in dealing with them often during moments of quiet in the cabin he had tried to fathom out some set thread in his life beyond the narrower explanations of luck or circumstance so far it had defied him and now as he sat in the familiar cabin where so much had happened he could accept that fate had had much to do with his being here ifs when he had left the trojan he had failed to take a prize en route for antigua or upon arrival there had been no opportunity for immediate promotion he might still be a lieutenant in the old shipoftheline and on that very first convoy if colquhoun had sent him back to english harbour instead of going himself would he have ever succeeded in proving to be more than averyge in either skill or luck perhaps colquhouns fateful decision on that faroff day had been the chance the offering which had set his feet on the final path bolitho had returned to antigua not merely as just one more officer rejoining his rightful squadron but to his astonishment as some sort of hero in his absence the stories of his rescuing the soldiers from delaware bay his running a frigate aground had been well spread then with the news of bonaventures end and his arrival with the rescued passengers it seemed that every man wanted to see him and shake his hand the bonaventure had been even more deadly than bolitho had realised at the time and her successes formidable her loss to the enemy might mean little bu to the british it was a tremendous lift to their battered pride and morale the admiral had received him in antigua with controlled pleasure and had made no bones about his hopes for the future colquhoun on the other hand had been the one man to offer bolitho neither encouragement nor praise for his achievements in so short a time whenever bolitho recalled their first meetings colquhouns warnings about the lot of any sea captains he was reminded of the thinness of margin between fame and oblivion had colquhoun stayed with that first convoy it was unlikely he would have shared mirandas fate for he was too shrewd and cautious to take anything for granted had he been lucky enough to meet and destroy bonaventure he would have gained the one thing he cared about just as commander maulby had suggested the unshakable power of flag rank or at very least the coveted broadpendant ob commodore instead he had stayed where he was frigate captain and with the war changing so rapidly now likely to lose even his control of the small flotilla maulby no longer called him little admiral today it seemed too cruel too unjust even for him eight bells chimed out from the forecastle and without effort he pictured the hands preparing for the midday meal the welcome ration of rum above his head tyrrell and the master would be taking their noon sights comparing their findings before bringing them down to the chart the year after bolithos destruction of the big privateer he had received his next surprise the admiral had sent for him and had calmly announced that their lordships of admiralty like himself believed in offering sparrows commander a chance ob exploiting his experience and skill promotion to full captain even now after eighteen months of it he found it hard to accept and believe within the flotilla the unexpected rise up the ladder had caused a great stir genuine pleasure from some open resentment from others maulby had taken the news better than bolitho had dared to hope for he had come to like the fawns laconic commander too much to have their friendship broken maulby was senior to him but had merely remarked id like to see the rank go to no other man so lets drink to it aboard sparrow the news had had no division at all they all seemed to share the same pride the same sense of achievement which could not have come at a better time for them for the war had changed greatly even in the past year no longer was it a matter ob patrol or convoy for the army the great powers had taken their stand and spain and holland had joined france against england in their support of the american revolution the french had mustered a wellmatched and powerful fleet in the west indies under the compte de grasse the most effective and talented admiral available admiral rodney commanded the british squadrons but with the pressures mounting daily he was hard put to spread his resources where they were most needed and the americans were not content to leave affairs to their seasoned allies they continued to use privateers whenever possible and a year after bonaventures destruction yet another challenger emerged to shake british morale to its foundation the privateer and exslaver paul jones in his bonhomme richard defeated the frigate seraphis off the coast ob england itself the fact that the privateer like the seraphis was reduced to a battered wreck in the hotly contested battle made no difference british captains were expected to take on odds and win and the defeat so close to home did more than many americans believed possible to take the war and its reasons into english homes as well as their own in the west indies and along the american coast the work of patrolling took on new importance as bolitho had always thought it was far better for the eyes of the fleet to be left unhampered by close authority true to his word the admiral had offered him almost total independence and had given him scope to patrol and seek out the enemy in his own way provided ob course his efforts were rewarded with some success bolitho leaned back in his chair and stared at the deckhead again the word luck seemed to hover in his mind maulby had scoffed at the explanation he had once said you are successful because you have trained yourself to think like the enemy god damn it dick caught a lugger loaded with contraband which had come from as far south as trinidad and even that wretched fellow had heard of you and sparrow it was certainly true about one thing bolitho decided they had been successful in the past eighteen months alone they had taken twelve prizes and despatched two small privateers with the loss of twenty killed and wounded and very little damage to the ship he let his eyes wander round the cabin less elegantly painted now even shabby after ceaseless service in all weathers it was strange to realise that apart from the unexpected promotion symbolised by the dress coat with white lapels and bright gold facings which swung gently inside the sleeping compartments there was outwardly little to show for it and yet he was a rich man and for the first time in his lifes independent of the home and estate in falmouth he smiled ruefully it seemed almost shameful to become moderately wealthy merely because he was doing the one thing he enjoyed he frowned trying to think of something to purchase if and when they were allowed a stay in port and they were well overdue for that despite her coppered hulls sparrows speed had been reduced by a full knot in otherwise perfect sailing conditions by long clinging weed which defied the copper and their efforts to move it he would buy some wine perhaps good wine not the bittertasting muck which was normally used as the only alternative for foul drinking water a dozen shirts or more his mind played with the idea of such luxury at the present moment he had only two shirts which would bear close inspection it might be possible to find a good sword somewhere not like the one which had shattered aboard the privateer nor the curved hanger which he had used since but something better lasting he heard footsteps beyond the door and knew it was tyrrell he would have known it even if it had been another time a different watch for since being wounded tyrrell had been unable to rid himself of a limp and not a little pain the first lieutenant had otherwise not changed very much he thought or maybe the three years had drawn them so close he had not noticed it unlike gravess who seemed to have withdrawn even further and had grown noticeably more nervous after each action or skirmish upon his promotion to captain bolitho had become entitled to an extra lieutenant and the appointment fell vacant on the very day the two midshipmen went aboard the flagship to sit for their commissions heyward had passed with flying colours and now looking back it was hard to recall him as a midshipman at all bethune had unfortunately failed his exams not once but three times and bolitho repeatedly wondered how best to get rid of him he had grown very fond of bethune but knew that being retained in sparrows confined community was only acting against his remaining if dwindling chances his navigation was hopeless his ability to take charge ob the quarterdeck and set the hands to making or shortening sail was dismal to behold as a marine officer or even a foot soldier he would have been adequate he could obey orders even if he found them hard to formulate under fire he had shown plenty ob courage and a boyish stoicism which was rarely matched even by a seasoned sailor now aged twenty and with no hope of gaining the commission he so obviously desired he stood out like a sore thumb heyward had tried to help him more so than bolitho had imagined he would but it was no use the ships company treated him with cheerful acceptance as they would a child his burden had not been eased by the appointment of a new midshipman to take heywards place roger augustus fowler sixteen years of age and with the pouting features of a petulant pig had soon learned to add to rather than detract from bethunes misery fowlers arrival had further enlarged the rift between bolitho and colquhoun the boy was the son of the admirals best friend and so his appointment to this or any ship was very close to a royal command the offspring of some influential person could be a great handicap to a young and busy captain but equally he could open doors otherwise denied by the chain ob command colquhoun had probably seen the boys arrival from england as an opportunity in the latter category and had been outraged when the admiral had chosen sparrow rather than his frigate bacchante fowler had been aboard for eight months and was not popular it was nothing you could put a name to obedient and attentive in the presence of his superiors he could be equally sharp and sarcastic with seamen old enough to be his father he had a way ob shutting off his expression using his pale eyes and pouting lips like the extensions of a mask if he ever reached command rank he would be a tyrant to serves bolitho thought there was a tap at the door and bolitho swept his musings into the background tyrrell limped into the cabin and sat down at the table against his open shirt his skin was burned almost to mahogany and his hair had become a shade lighter under forgotten suns he pushed the calculations across the chart and together they looked at sparrows approximate position to the south lay the nearest extensions of the bahama islands the countless spans of cays and reefs treacherous sandbars and islets some eighty miles to the west lay the coast of florida and to the east the main routes used by ships going to and fro from the indies and new york it was a veritable warren of islands and narrow channels although to the untried eye of a landsman the sea might appear at peaces broken here and there by restful purple humps of land shrouded in low haze but to the mariner the chart showed much more and that was less than he required to know the true margin of safety the occasional dab of white betrayed a reef the duller patch on the seas face might represent a cloak ob weed across some vast pinnacle lurking beneath the surface the spines of which could tear the keel from a ship like the string from an orange tyrrell said at length i reckon weve lost th bugger maybe bolitho opened a drawer in the table and took out two long clay pipes handing one to tyrrell he groped for a tobacco bowl and then said is fawn still in sight tyrrell grinned sure enough bout three miles to the eastrd he tamped down the tobacco in his pipe and added our masthead lookout thought he saw breakers to th souwest if so that would be the matanilla shoal which fixes our calculations so to speak bolitho lit his pipe from the hanging smokinglantern and then walked restlessly to the windows once near the sill he felt the slow breeze across his face and chest like air fanned from a blacksmiths forge when eventually the wind returned to give life to the sails it was to be hoped it came from the southeast as before it was no time to be driven closer to those deadly shoals but they had to stay near enough to be able to watch at least three channels while fawn patrolled further to the east for six weeks in company with the other sloop they had been searching for a big blockade runner a french flute which had been reported out of martinique and heading north most likely for the enemy base of naval operations in newport rhode island the information from spies or those merely after recognition or reward was always open to doubt but a flute which was a large manofwar with some of her armament removed to facilitate the fast passage of men or stores was too important to be ignored the flotillas third sloop heron was sweeping somewhere to the south off the andros islands and colquhouns bacchante had as far as he knew remained in more open waters to the west between the bahamas and the american mainland once away from colquhouns supervision bolitho had taken the sloops to their present position on the chart the chance of making contact with a solitary enemy seemed impossible but he knew by now that if the sea appeared empty it was in fact divided into channels by sprawling reefs and cays and was just as much a hazard to enemy as to friend if we take her itll be another feather for us tyrrell watched his pipesmoke drifting through the skylight above him i often wonder if it makes all that difference to th war it all helps jethro bolitho studied him gravely how close they had become like the use of first names the ritual pipesmoking for as long as the tobacco stock lasted it all seemed to symbolise what the ship had made them time and distance hours and days spent in every sort of condition they had all left their mark on sparrows company even the necessary changes brought about by death and injury transfer and discharge had seemed unable to break the little ships hold on their destiny over a third of the company were replacements made since he had taken commands and apart from colonists included a sprinkling ob negroes some merchant seamen pressed from a homebound ship and a solitary greek who had deserted his own vessel only to be taken aboard a french brig as a captive the brig seized as a prize by sparrow had yielded severyl new hands and the greek had proved to be an excellent assistant cook how long will you give her bolitho considered the question another week maybe if she doesnt show herself i think we can assume shes slipped past us or turned back somewhere she might have run into one of the patrols further south aye tyrrell yawned an then we can get some time in port feet pounded overhead and they heard buckle shout call all hands th winds acoming back then there was a rap on the door and bethune peered in at them his round face sweating badly mr buckles respects sir the wind is freshening from the soueast fawns topsls are already filling ill come up bolitho waited until the midshipman had withdrawn before asking quietly what am ito do about him tyrrell shrugged hell not get promoted unless by a miracle maybe if we put him in charge of our next prize he shook his head before bolitho could comment almighty god the ladd lose his way an the prize on deck they found the hands already being mustered while overhead the sails were stirring uneasily the masthead pendant lifting as the first breeze reached it man th braces tyrrell strode to the rail and squinted into the glare itll be up to us soon lads bolitho shaded his eyes to stare at the other sloop as her sails suddenly filled and brought her round in a slow pirouette across the seas glittering face he sa the first ruffle of wind then felt the sundried planking lift under his shoes the immediate response of blocks and halliards the sparrows decks were like tinder and it made no difference how many times they were doused down paintwork was blistered by the heat and as he turned to watch the busy seamen he realised it was hard to tell the negroes from his original company lean and sundried maybe he thought but they looked healthy and brighteyed ready for anything tyrrell called shall i have th larboard cutter towed astern now sir bolitho nodded only by towing them alternately could they hope to keep them from drying out and opening their seams even half filling them with water on board seemed to have small effect yes tell mr tilby to he checked himself and added pass the word to the boatswain if you please after six months it was still difficult not to speak his name or expect to see his sweating features peering aft at the quarterdeck they had run down a spanish schooner off the great bahama bank but had been forced to fire on her when she refused to yield then with grapnels flying like snakes sparrow had surged alongside in the manner so well practised that it was accepted without comment even by the new men a few pistol shots the sight of the halfnaked boarders with drawn cutlasses had been enough to quench the spaniards resistance and it was all over almost before it had begun sometime in the middle of it while men had dashed to shorten sail and prepare for boarding as bolitho had waved his arm to signal the spanish master to strike and avoid bloodshed tilby had died not in the heat and terror of close action or under an enemy broadside but quietly and without fuss while he had stood at the foot of the foremast his favourite place where he usually kept an eye on the workings ob his ship dalkeith had examined him and reported that the boatswains heart had given out like a clock which had run its course and could take no more his death made a deep impression on everyone who had known him to die in such a way was unthinkable tilby who had survived battles at sea and countless drunken brawls in taverns the world over had gone without a man seeing his passing when tyrrell had collected his possessions bolitho had been dismayed to see that there was hardly anything to barter amongst the company and thereby raise money for dependents he might have in england two small wood carvings of ships he had once served and one of them was broken a collection of foreign coins and his silver call which had been presented to him by no less a person than captain oliver of the menelaus where he had served as a bosuns mate poor tilby he had not even learned to write his own name and his language was limited to the profane for much of the time but he knew ships and he knew sparrow like his own body harry glass the senior boatswains mate had been promoted in his place but like most of the others seemed unable to accept that he was now independent of tilbys booming voice and evervigilant eye as he watched the cutter rising from its chocks on the gun deck bolitho wondered if indeed tilby had anyone ashore to grieve for him he touched the sunheated taffrail and shuddered he was a captain now the realisation of a dream which had been with him since he could remember if the war suddenly ended or other circumstances forced him to leave the navys he would drop from his present foothold like a falling stone not being confirmed to postrank he would end up as a mere lieutenant on halfpay and all this would just be a mocking memory but how much worse for those like tilby he ran his eyes quickly across the men nearest to him as they worked at the braces to set sparrow before the wind again they had nothing a little prize money if they were fortunate some bounty maybe from a charitable captain otherwise they would be thrown on the beach less able to face the demands of the outside world than when they had volunteered or been pressed into service it was unjust worse it was dishonourable to treat men so shabbily when without their sacrifice and courage their country would have fallen to an enemy years ago he began to pace the deck his chin sunk on his chest perhaps one day they could change it make the navy a service where men from all walks of life would be as glad as he was to serve in reasonable security deck thar breakers on the larboard bow he came out of his thoughts and said bring her round two points mr buckle we will give those reefs a wide berth until we are clear aye sir he turned his attention to the other sloop noting that maulby had managed to repaint his hull in spite of the heat fawn was exactly the same colour as sparrows and to any uncertain eye would appear a twin it was another part of bolithos hardwon experience when sailing separately the fact they looked so similar helped to keep the enemy or his spies guessing like the flag locker which he had stocked with almost every foreign flag in the book deception and surprise had been the enemys game bolitho was reaping the benefit of their past success and turning the tables against them west norwest sir steady as she goes very well he glanced at the compass and at the set of the main topsails not much of a wind mr buckle but it suffices for the present all afternoon and into early evening the two sloops continued on the same tack with the wind showing no sign of changing in strength or bearing the first dog watch was just drawing to its close and bolitho was making another attempt to complete his letter when a sail was reported to the southwest signalling fawn to remain in company bolitho altered course to investigate but as the newcomer showed no sign of running he guessed it was a friendly ship the masthead soon confirmed that she was in fact the flotillas little schooner lucifer a vessel kept as busy if not busier than any of them carrying despatches and poking into coves and bays where even sloops found little room to move in safety in the dull bronze sunlight she made a pretty sights with her big foreandaft sails spread like wings across her narrow hull as she tacked towards the sloops her signal flags soaring aloft to break in brightly coloured squares bethune called have despatches on board sir bolitho looked at tyrrell heave to if you please to bethune he added make to fawn remain in close company he crossed to the rail as tyrrell lowered his speaking trumpet you can never be sure she might have good news for us tyrrell gripped the rail grimacing with pain as with sails slapping fussily sparrow came up into the wind damn this leg in a calmer tone he said good or bad its grand to see a friend i was beginning to think we had th bloody sea to ourselves a jolly boat was already on its way and bolitho saw that lieutenant odell the schooners captain was coming in person and felt a sudden twinge of hopeful excitement odell clambered up the side and doffed his hat to the quarterdeck he was a quick darting young mans and was said to be slightly mad but he seemed calm enough and when he reached the cabin handed bolitho his bulky envelope before saying i have just come from captain colquhoun he took a glass ob wine from fitch and stared at it he is much excited bolitho slit open the envelope and ran his eyes quickly over the scrawling hand of colquhouns personal clerk tyrrell stood just inside the door and bolitho was well aware of buckles shadow across the skylight above the table not actually eavesdropping but if he happened to hear anything well he looked up and said captain colquhoun took a fishing boat and questioned the crew he flattened the damp paper on the table that was a week ago odell held the empty glass in front of him and waited until fitch had refilled it before saying dryly actually caught the boat sir he shrugged disdainfully but the good captain colquhoun seemed to take it over as it were bolitho eyed him gravely it also states here that the crew provided valuable information about the frenchman he beckoned to tyrrell and pushed the unfinished letter from his chart the flute was sighted here close inshore his finger rested on the western end of grand bahama island right amongst the islets she was carrying out repairs according to the fishermen tyrrell nodded slowly it sounds likely if the frenchman knew a hunt was mounted he would take th most hazardous passage amongst th islands to throw us off it dont signify hes still there of course bolitho nodded a week back allow another few days before that for the fishing boat to reach the place where lucifer sighted her he snatched up his dividers and bent over the chart thirty leagues from our present position we could be off the island by noon tomorrow if the wind holds odell said wearily but i understand that captain colquhoun wishes you to flush her out and nothing more sir he smiled or did i not comprehend the good captains desires bolitho sat down and opened the despatches again bacchante is to approach by the north west providence channel while we remain to northrd and hurry the frenchman if he tries to run for it odell nodded satisfied bacchante can be barely twenty miles from her attacking position by now sir am to find her again and report that i have met you and that you understand the instructions bolitho glanced at him quickly thank you i do understand the lieutenant stood up and reached for his hat then i will return to my ship i have no wish to be caught in these waters after dark together they watched the lieutenant being rowed back to his schooner then tyrrell said heavily seems clear enough to me capn colquhoun is set on taking th frog as a prize all to himself while we just act as beaters there is something which bothers me far more bolitho rubbed his chin the fishing boat was a small one according to the despatches too frail to be out in deep water where she might expect to find bacchante or some other frigate it was a mere fluke that she met with lucifer for as we know jethro schooners in the kings service are rare out here tyrrells eyes glistened in the dying sunlight you mean that th fishermen were looking for another ship bolitho met his gaze aye but theres only us an the fawn between here and th inshore squadron an their nearest patrol must be four hundred miles away exactly bolitho stared astern at the other sloops her topsails already painted in deepening shadows and who would know that better than some island fisherman eh tyrrell breathed out slowly hell youre saying we was meant to get the information but once colquhoun got his hands on em they acted for their own safety i dont know bolitho walked to the nettings and back to the compass seeing neither but fawns captain said something to me a while ago that our exploits were getting well known which is another way of saying they have been hurting the enemy tyrrell nodded a trap is it likely he waved one band towards the sea surely were not that important it depends what the enemy intends bolitho turned away feeling a chill on his spine it was a new sensation uncanny to think that someone might be discussing him planning and scheming like runners after a wanted criminal but it was certainly how it appeared how he must anticipate it if he was to prepare himself fleets and valuable convoys stayed to the east or west of the bahama islands so it was much more likely that the enemy was out after one particular prize he said we will show a stern lantern for fawns benefit tonight at dawn i will tell commander maulba what i think he grinned suddenly amused by his unusual caution or maybe by that time i will have driven my ghosts away tyrrell watched him doubtfully to our enemy the frogs in particular youre like a thorn he frowned theres only one way to deal with thorns you tear em out and stamp on em bolitho nodded i agree we will continue with our new course but be prepared to treat every event as a trick and a ruse until proved otherwise he looked abeam for the lucifer but she was little more than a blur in the damp evening haze he cursed colquhoun for not supplying more information about the fishing boat where it came from or the reliability ob its crew yet he could almost feel sorry for him he was obviously beset with anxiety about his own future and now there was the chance of catching a rich prize and probably military information as well he could think ob little else he went below to his cabin and stared at the chart beneath a gently spiralling lantern between his hands the islands the countless tentacles of reefs and shallows were like the neck of some gigantic bags around which colquhouns flotilla accidentally or otherwise were converging to close with the finality ob a noose bolitho sighed and turned to lean from one of the windows in the shaded stern lanterns beam the small frothing wake glowed like blue wool and beyond it the horizon had faded to mingle with the first pale stars then he touched the scar beneath the lock of hairs noting that it was hurting throbbing in time with his heart he knew he was uneasy more so because he could not find a proper reason for it overhead he heard graves murmuring as he took over the watch and tyrrells limping step as he walked towards the companion ladder normal regular sounds which usually gave him a sense of pleasure now perhaps because they represented people he had come to know and not merely extensions of the ships efficiency he was suddenly afraid not of an enemy or the everpresent shadow of death but of his responsibility which their trust had given him strategy and spies bolithe was hastily tying his neckcloth when tyrrell thrust his head through the cabin skylight and called bacchantes just signalled sir capns to repair aboard i will come up directly he threw on his coat and took a quick glance round the cabin he did not see colquhoun very often but he had learned it best to forget nothing on deck he found the gig being swayed over the gangway and when he glanced abeam he saw fawns boat already in the water and maulby hurrying down into it with his usual agility it was early afternoon and the deck burning hot through his shoes all night with fawn keeping as close as safety allowed they had driven south with the sprawling barrier of sandbars and shallows some ten miles off the larboard beam but it had taken longer than he had hoped to find colquhouns bacchante and almost as soon as the masthead had sighted her topsails the wind had fallen away to a mere breaths allowing the sun to tighten its grip over them like a furnace as he waited for the gigs crew to man their boat he turned to stare across the opposite beam towards the distorted hump of blue and purple which he knew to be the western tip of grand bahama colquhoun was taking no chances he was standing well clear of the land either to give himself searoom or to prevent the enemy from seeing his intentions ready sir he ran down to the entry port and said to tyrrell keep a sharp lookout for inquisitive craft of any kind send a cutter after em if they draw near dont wait for my orders then he was in the gig and settling himself on a hot thwart as stockdale swung the tiller and sent the boat dipping and swaying towards the frigate bacchante was hoveto her sails flapping loosely showing her copper as she rolled unsteadily in the swell she was a fine ship he thought cleancut and designed by a craftsman thirtysix guns and the ability to live off her own resources for many months she was or should be every young captains ambition it did not seem to fit colquhoun at all stockdale was muttering under his breath and bolitho knew he was cursing his opposite number in fawn who always seemed to manage to get his boat anywhere just that bit faster the gig turned swiftly oars backing in close unison the bowman hooking on to the frigates main chains as bacchantes shadow gave them brief respite from the glare bolitho clambered up the side doffing his hat and regaining his composure while the calls shrilled in salute and a squad of redcoated marines slapped their muskets to the present the first lieutenant a gaunt harassedlooking mans bobbed his head in welcome the captain is aft sir he is preparing his strategy otherwise maulby stepped from the shade of the gangway and took his arm otherwise my friend he would have had the good grace to meet us at the entry port eh he laughed at the lieutenants embarrassment you sirs deserve rich recognition for your penance aboard this ship together they strode beneath the poops automatically ducking their heads despite the ample room above a marine stamped his boots together and threw open the cabin door his eyes never blinking or shifting until both officers had stepped over the coaming colquhoun was standing by the stern windows studying his watch with obvious impatience so you have arrived gentlemen he sat down at his table eventually bolitho relaxed slightly so it was to be this way he replied we had adverse winds overnight sir maulby added calmly and i thought you might be closer inshore sir we seem to be somewhat er out ob touch with affairs at present he glanced towards his own ship as she rolled uneasily about a cable from bacchantes quarter but i expect you have a reason for that sir colquhoun stared at him fixedly as if to seek out the truth of his words fortunately he seemed quite oblivious to maulbys sarcasm he snapped look at my chart they gathered round and he tapped it with some brass dividers the frenchman is here i sent a cutter under sail before dawn to investigate he looked up his eyes triumphant so theres an end to speculation bolitho leaned closer what a formidable place from the western tip of the main island the chain ob reefs and bars ran northward for about forty miles to link with the notorious matanilla shoal the latter then turned eastward enclosing the great span of open water known as the little bahama bank like one monstrous snare in places the water was only feet deep and the fathoms were few and far between according to colquhouns marks on the chart the french ship had passed through or around one of the cays to rest up on the other side of the island it was perfect for anyone trying to avoid a skirmish for on this side and elsewhere in the channel the sea bottom was over two hundred fathoms and any hope of a close attack was foiled by the steepness of the islands face whereas on the other side within the little bahama bank the water was very shallow and sandy ideal for a master who wished to careen his ship and carry out temporary repairs was your cutter seen sir maulby did not look up of course not colquhoun seemed angry even at the simple suggestion my first lieutenant was in charge he knows what would happen to him if he allowed such carelessness he calmed himself with an effort he saw many lights on the water the cutter pulled through the surf and between two sandbars and watched the enemy at work shes big probably a fortygun frigate with some armament removed must have touched bottom and sustained damage sometime after entering the islands bolitho glanced at his profile colquhoun was very excited there was no doubt about it despite his efforts to conceal his true emotions there was a strong smell of brandy and he guessed he had been celebrating privately the victory already in his pocket he asked quietly what do you intend sir colquhoun looked at him searchingly i am working on the assumption that the enemy is near finished repairs now he will either continue on passage or make for martinique again if he is badly holed and needing greater help either way we must act at once and avoid another chase i would suggest a boat action sir we would cross the bar from two directions and cut her out before they know what is happening with men and boats from all three ships we can swamp her defences with darkness on our side colquhoun said mildly with you in overall command of the boats no doubt bolitho flushed angrily your frigate is too large by half to be of use in those confined waters sir if the frenchman makes a run for it or decides to show fights you will be needed to present your ship to him and without delay easy bolitho colquhoun was smiling gently you rise quickly to my words such haste to speak tends to show guilt more than conviction he turned swiftly before bolitho could reply you maulby will take fawn across the bar tonight under sweeps if required but i want you in position at dawn tomorrow he leaned over the chart again if the enemy is repaired enough to make sail he will no doubt hope for one of three possible channels to the north his passage could be adversely affected by wind and tide south is more likely in which case bacchante will be well placed to take him as he tacks around the point but if he is still laid up or careened you will be able to rake him there and then he will see no use in firing back at you just a few more holes will be sufficient to render him immovable or long enough for us to present more drastic measures he wagged one finger but i know these frogs theyll not fight if the odds are so well laid across his bowed shoulders maulby looked at bolitho and shrugged bolitho said nothing knowing colquhoun was waiting for him to protest sparrow was better suited to the task as defined by colquhoun her armament was heavier and her thirtytwo pounders were far more accurate and deadly than fawns lesser battery ob ninepounders he knew that any such suggestions however would only bear out colquhouns earlier hint that he was greedy for more success and fame or that he was a better man than maulby for the mission maulby asked slowly will you send men overlands sir colquhoun still did not look at them god in heaven where is all this stuff of combat i have been reading in the gazette i am beginning to wonder at its substance bolitho said it is a sensible suggestion sir i would prefer a boat action by night but in daylight a force ob men including your marines would be able to he got no further colquhoun straightened like a steel spring enough of this my plan leaves no room for nervous fumbling about the rocks like a lot of damn lizards that frenchman is as good as taken and i intend to sail her into port intact and with her cargo or whatever ready for closer inspection he walked from the table and stared at a halffilled decanter on his desk as he reached out for it bolitho saw his hand was shaking with anger or agitation his voice was equally unsteady as he continued and you bolitho will close from the north stay out of sight until the time of attack and then make contact with me for further orders his fingers closed around the decanter like claws that is all my clerk will give you written details of attack as you leave they left the cabin and walked in silence to the quarterdeck maulby spoke first it should be your doing dick agree with you about trying to cut the enemy out but either way it is your right to lead if colquhoun intends to stand offshore bolitho touched his shoulder i wish you all success but you know that you are more than due for promotion and i hope this will bring it for you maulby grimaced ill not deny that id relish the chance but i would wish it done with less bitterness he glanced aft that man will be the death of me with his bloody moods bolitho bit his lip trying to find the right words look john take good care i know colquhoun is desperate for this victory but i do not share his scorn for frenchmen they fight well they fight with courage they are not given to empty gestures even in the cannons mouth maulby nodded his eyes grave have no fear if that frenchman decides to match gun for gun with me i will haul off and await support bolitho forced a smile maulby was lying to ease his troubled mind lying as he would probably do under similar conditions before and after a fight at sea there was always room for recriminations and counterproposals but once joined in battle there was usually only one thought to fight to keep on firing until the enemy broke or the tide turned against you boats alongside the first lieutenant greeted them with a tired smile is it done sir maulby held up his written orders aye done the lieutenant sighed i have made a small sketch which may be of some help for you sir the tide race is bad there and the surf no better but if the french could enter then you should have less hardship the two gigs were hooked on to the chains and bolitho said with sudden urgency i will be making sail directly if i am to take station by dawn he held out his hand i wish i was coming with you maulby returned the clasp i too he grinned but at least you will be spared the sight of fawn as she makes colquhoun both rich and famous in one blow stockdale stood up in the gig as bolitho descended the frigates side his eyes puzzled as the boat shoved off and the oars picked up the stroke he hissed then were not fightin sir bolitho sighed secret orders plans of battle meant nothing to the lower deck stockdale had not left the gig but he and probably every jack in the flotilla knew what was happening not this time stockdale he had already forgotten colquhouns snub the calculated attempt to drive a rift between him and maulby he was thinking of fawns task the chances ob success without prolonging the attack so that colquhoun could blame maulby for the delay it aint right sir stockdale was muttering from the tiller bolitho glared at him just attend to your work have had a bellyful of strategy for one day stockdale studied the captains squared shoulders the way he was gripping his hanger so that the fingers showed white through his tan it aint no use you blowin off at me my lad it still ain t right an wots more you knows it with his secret rebuff held firmly in his mind stockdale eased the tiller bar and headed straight for the sparrow as the bowman hooked on to the chains bolitho turned abruptly and said but thank you for your concern stockdale stood and removed his hat while bolitho reached for the sloops side he grinned broadly at his back thankee sir tyrrell was no less ready to speak out but thats a strange choice commander maulbys a fine officers but bolitho swung round prepare to get the ship under way rig the royal yards as soon as we are under command for i want to make all speed with what wind there is he relented again just do as i ask mr tyrrell and let us have no more of it buckle ambled across the deck as bolitho hurried below to rid himself of his heavy dress coat what dyou make of it mr tyrrell tyrrell frowned that damn colquhoun i never took to th man like bloody ransome his eyes are slits for the devil to peer through buckle shook his head capns worried theres no doubt on that not for himself tyrrell watched the men hauling at the boat tackles as the gig bobbed above the gangway that is equally certain bolithos voice rose sharply through the skylight when you have finished gentlemen i would be obliged if you would attend to my orders buckle looked at tyrrell and grinned sheepishly thats more like it our dicks not the one to brood too long within the hour sparrow was ghosting slowly to the northwest her yards alive with canvas as with all sail set she left her consorts further and still further astern the wind rose very slightly and by the time the first stars appeared above the raked masts they had logged nearly fifty miles back along the same course they had used to join colquhoun with such haste the previous night but there was nothing anyone could do about it and there were some who were inwardly pleased to be spared fawns uncomfortable passage through the shoals on the quarterdeck lieutenant graves leaned against the rail half watching the loosely flapping sails partly listening to the creak of the wheel an occasional voice from his seamen on watch he was thinking about his home in chatham and the news he had received in a rare letter from england his was not a seafaring family and his father had owned a small but flourishing grocers shop where graves and his sister had been born and had grown up together his mothers a sickly woman had died a year before sparrow had sailed from the thames and in the past years his father had apparently taken to drink the business had fallen into debt and his sister probably out ob desperation had married an impoverished lieutenant in the army garrison she had written asking for money for herself and to try to keep their father from a debtors prison graves had sent all he had which had been little enough his share of sparrows prize money would help considerably but until he received more news from home he was unwilling to sign it over when it had been so hard to come by if only he had been better moulded to dealing with the ways of the navy like the captains whose seafaring background and famous ancestors put him apart from men like himself or even tyrrell who seemed indifferent to all authority although god knew he could ill afford to be so he remembered exactly when tyrrells sister had come aboard they had been in kingston jamaica where she had been living with friends waiting until the troubles as she called them in america were over a vivacious lively girl with none of tyrrells casual attitudes to graves she had appeared like some sort of angel an answer to everything he had ever dreamed she came from a settled prosperous family and as a wife would have given him the chance to better himself find his rightful place in the world instead of remaining unsure and cautious tyrrell had seen his intentions clearly enough but had neither encouraged nor come out directly against him then the fool had had an argument with captain ransome over a man being punished graves could no longer remember if the punishment was just or not nor did he care all that remained clear was that ransome had acted swiftly and had used all his charms which was considerable and his obvious skill on the girls defences to break his own chances as well as alienating her brother completely but graves still blamed tyrrell hated him whenever he thought of her and the way she had looked when ransome had finally put her ashore in antigua he gripped the rail until the pain steadied him where was she now someone said she had sailed for america again others mentioned a passing indiaman which had gone south to trinidad would she ever think of him he turned away angry with himself for daring to hope after so long why could he never be confident when it was most needed perhaps he had been too long in that damned grocers shop hearing his father grovelling to the quality bowing and scraping to customers who ran up bills far greater than his own debts the worry about his sister the uncertainty about himself had taken their toll in other ways too he had sensed it after the fight with the bonaventure even though he had been aboard sparrow with the rescued passengers suppose the captain had failed to grapple her long enough to carry out his wild plant would he have had the strength to turn sparrow against orders and attempt to rescue bolitho and his men but for buckle and some of the others he doubted if he would have done so even when both grappled ships had burst into flames they had seen the great pall of smoke from the horizon itself and later when they had closed with the other prizes and had exchanged shots with privateers he had felt the fear spreading inside him like some loathsome disease nobody had noticed yet he shook himself and crossed to the weather side trying to clear his mind in the cool breeze the two midshipmen were standing by the lee nettings and bethune said quietly mr graves seems worried the new midshipman fowler ignored the comment now look here he had a lisp which became more evident whenever he was trying to appear innocent before his superiors now it was barely noticeable have to supervise swabbing the cable tier tomorrow bethune was watching the lieutenant i know its your turn fowler showed his small teeth you do it for me when we rejoin the fleet i will speak with the admiral bethune gaped at him for me perhaps bethunes gratitude was pathetic oh if only he nodded firmly yes i will take charge of the cable party anything else i can do the youth regarded him coolly i will let you know throughout the ship the company lived out their hopes and dreams in their own way in his tiny cabin tyrrell was sitting on his seachest massaging his wounded thigh while on the other side of the bulkhead bolitho finished his letter to his father in the dimly lit wardroom dalkeith was drowsing over a glass of rum hearing buckle retelling a yarn about some woman or other in bristol while young heyward listened to him with his eyes closed right forward above the plunging beakhead his hair blown by wind and drifting spray yule the gunners squatted with his back against a stanchion a bottle between his knees his blurred mind thinking of tilby the good times they had shared together deep in the hold a lantern above his narrow head lock the purser inspected a cask of lemons examining each one like some robber with his booty while he made notes in a ledger and below her pale canvas sparrow held them all oblivious to their various troubles and pleasures indifferent even to the sea for she needed none ob them and seemed content as soon as bolitho reached the quarterdeck he knew the wind was changing against them and rapidly he had been in a deep sleep when a masters mate had groped into the cabin to tell him that lieutenant heyward was requesting advice it was only halfway through the middle watch and the stars still very bright above the mastheads but as he hurried across the deck his bare feet soundless on the damp planking he heard the topsails shaking violently the responding chorus from stays and shrouds buckle was beside the wheel and like himself was wearing only his breeches evidence if it was still needed of heywards unwillingness to call for help until it was almost too late well he peered at the slanting compass bowl seeing the helmsmens eyes glowing faintly in the binnacle light im waiting mr heyward he did not wish to fluster the young lieutenant and at another time could appreciate his wishing to control his own watch without showing uncertainty but this was not the time and in such dangerous waters they would have to act fast heyward explained the wind backed a point or so and i had my watch trim the yards he gestured vaguely above his head but now it has backed at a faster rate i fear maybe from the northeast buckle muttered well never be able to change tack in time to reach the head o the shoals sir he glared at the compass never bolitho rubbed his chin feeling the wind playing across his bare shoulders heyward had been foolish to let sparrow have her head like this maybe he expected the wind to veer again as it often did hereabouts but whatever he thought or hoped the ships bow was now pointing almost northwest by north and she was not holding that course very well either every minute was taking them further from the chain of shoals and it would waste hours of wearing and tacking to fight round again towards their station as colquhoun had directed heyward said miserably im sorry about this sir i thought i could hold her bolitho was thinking busily you cannot help the wind but in future you must learn to call me the moment you are unsure of anything ill not think worse of you he looked at buckle what is your opinion we have four hours before dawn buckle was adamant impossible he sighed im afraid we must remain close hauled and try to wear ship in perhaps three hours or so bolitho pictured the chart in his mind recalling vividly the nearest sandbars the set of the tide call all hands mr heyward we will wear ship directly but sir buckle sounded anxious well never be able to take up our proper course with the wind staying steady from the noreast its not possible bolitho heard the shrill of calls below decks the sudden stampede of feet on gangways and ladders agree mr buckle he paused as tyrrell came out ob the gloom dragging his leg badly as he tried to buckle his belt i intend to pass through the bars he looked at tyrrell if we stay as we are we will be unable to offer assistance if it is needed when daylight comes once inside the bank we will at least be able to use the wind if an opportunity presents itself graves ran to the quarterdeck his feet very loud above the hushed voices he had evidently found time to put on his shoes bolitho said very well leadsmen in the chains and then get the royals and tgallants off her he was speaking fast in time with his thoughts tell the bosun to unleash the sweeps in case the wind drops altogether tyrrell nodded aye aye sir i reckon we stand a fair chance of getting through th set of th tide is in our favour he hesitated when it drops a piece we may find it bothersome bolitho smiled in spite of his thoughts well spoken shouts came along the gun deck where petty officers completed their count of topmen and hands for the braces so well did most of them know the ship that darkness made little or no difference to them bolitho nodded shorten sail mr tyrrell he lowered his voice quick as you can within minutes all canvas had vanished from the upper yards and with her topsails and courses thrusting noisily to the wind sparrow lifted and staggered in an uncomfortable swell bolitho gripped the weather nettings watching the thin slivers of spray darting across the gangway the extreme angle of the yards as with sail and helm buckle tried to hold her as close to the wind as he dared and all the while he was thinking rapidly once the ship had gone about the nearest strip of sandbar and shoal would lie some ten miles across the bows e false estimate of speed and distance a wrong or careless description on the chart and he might drive her hard aground but in his heart he knew the risk was worthwhile no one could blame him for keeping to his original orders and thereby allow the wind to carry him away from the area colquhoun would probably be pleased to have him as far off as possible if only to deny sparrow even the role of spectator for the final act by ignoring the rigid span of his orders he might lay himself open to reprimand but with luck he would be better placed to give fawn assistance if the frenchman decided to fight with the wind backed to the northeyst colquhoun would be hard put to remain in his own sector when the time came and that in itselb would offer some excuse for bolithos action ready sir he tightened his jaw put the helm down he tensed feeling the sea dragging against the weeded keel in a strong undertow helms alee sir through the darkness he saw the headsails shaking wildly heard the tramp of feet as the men hauled steadily at the braces to get the yards round off tacks and sheets graves s voice was hoarse above the din of canvas and blocks mainsail haul a man fell in the darkness and a voice yelled harshly to restore calm on the gun deck bolitho gripped the nettings his body tilting with the hull as sparrow lifted her jibboom hesitated and then sliced heavily across the wind braces there tyrrell was leaning over the rail as if to seek out individual seamen in the gloom heaves lads harder sparrow resisted awhile longer then with sails filling and booming again she heeled over on the opposite tack the spray sluicing up over the gangways and drenching the men beneath bolitho had to shout to make himself heard above the noise close as you can mr buckle aye sir he sounded breathless full an bye more uncomfortable minutes while men scampered above and along the gangways a pull here and belay men hauling busily at halliards while in the bows the selected hands took their leads and lines to the forechain in readiness to begin sounding eventually even buckle seemed satisfied sou by east sir very good bolitho peered tip at the hardbraced yards not even a frigate could sail this close to the wind nothing could tyrrell staggered towards him his shirt plastered to his body you wanted this didnt you sir he was shouting but his voice was matched by the surge ob water alongside you were worried about fawn he cursed as his foot slipped and then clapped his hands to his thigh bolitho supported him and waited for the hull to sway upright again easy jethro is it painful tyrrell showed his teeth dalkeith said there might be some small splinters left in th bone them pistol balls can split open when they cut into a man he stood up gingerly and grimaced not too bad bolitho watched the topmen slithering down stays and shrouds and then said yes i suppose i did want it i cannot explain my fears he shrugged and added so i will not try he pushed his uncertainties away now jethro i want our people to have breakfast and a tot ob blackstrap no sense in waiting for daylight and imagine they are too well drenched to sleep just now he ticked off the points on his fingers then have the fires doused and muster the hands at quarters we will not clear for action but i intend that every available man is on deck when we cross the bar tyrrell was watching him intently what about heyward are you going to log him bolitho shook his head hes learned his lesson so theres no harm done when i was a junior lieutenant once fell asleep on watch his teeth showed white in the darkness im not proud of the fact but by god never did it again he moved to the hatch cover and paused i will go below and get into some clothes itll never do for our people to see their captain like this in daylight he laughed the sound carrying up to a solitary man working on the mainyard i may live like a savage but see no cause to look like one tyrrell turned back to the rail easing his leg as the pain lanced through it he had just seen yet another bolitho naked to the waist his black hair plastered over his forehead he had looked as young if not younger than heyward in such a moment tyrrell had been touched by his concern for the hands as he had been impressed by his cheerful recklessness over the approaching sandbars heyward came from the gun deck and waited to resume his duty tyrrell said dismiss th watch below then have the petty officers lay aft for instructions heyward asked glumly will this go badly for me tyrrell clapped him on the arm god boy no he laughed at his astonishment you did th capn a favour if you had called him earlier hed have been forced to change tack your mistake allowed him to take another course of action he strolled away whistling to himself his bare feet slapping on the spraydrenched planking heyward walked up the tilting deck and joined buckle by the wheel i dont think i understand buckle studied him dubiously well dont you try thats my advice he shuffled towards the hatch and added an next time you feels like playing god with my ship id be obliged if youd pass the word first heyward glanced at the compass and crossed to the weather side there was more to being lieutenant of the watch than holding a commission he decided wearily he looked at the taut mainsail and grimaced it had been a near thing and at one time he had felt stricken by the swift change of events so that he had imagined the ship was running wild carrying him and all aboard like some uncontrollable juggernaut now in these last moments he had learned something if it all happened again he would know what to do of that he was quite certain stockdale was waiting in the cabin with bolithos shirt and after handing him a towel asked did you really fall asleep on watch sir bolitho rubbed his chest and arms feeling the salt drying on his lips like another skin almost was nothing secret from stockdale bu we have to embroider things a little sometimes he stepped out of his sodden breeches and threw them across the cabin as he continued to towel his naked body he listened to heywards measured tread across the deck above then he added quietly i once knew of a lieutenant who beat a man for giving a false report from the masthead after that the seaman was too frightened to say anything and when there was danger he held his tongue for fear he would get another beating as a result the ship was driven ashore and the lieutenant drowned stockdale watched him warily serve im right bolitho sighed moralising was wasted on stockdale the big coxswain shook out a clean pair ob breeches and handed them across for another minute or so he did not speak but his forehead was wrinkled in thought then he asked an wot appened to the seaman sir bolitho stared at him i am afraid he was flogged for neglect of duty stockdales battered face lit up in a broad grin proves me point then dont it sir there aint no justice in th world for any of us bolitho sat down one leg still tangled in the breeches as was often the case stockdale had had the last word a twist of fate lieutenant tyrrell gripped the quarterdeck rail and peered fixedly along the starboard gangway god damn this mist he leaned across the rails straining his eyes forward in an effort to see beyond the forecastle and god damn our luck bolitho said nothing but moved to the opposite side of the deck since before dawn when with leads going and every ear and eye pitched to the shouted depths the sounds of distant surf and the occasional feather ob warning spray in the darkness he had been aware ob the thickening sea mist it was not unusual in these waters at the time of year but he had expected it to pass quickly to clear with the first hint of morning sunlight now as he stared abeam he knew it was thicker than ever moving steadily with the wind it wreathed between the shrouds and seemed to cling to the rigging like pale weed above the topsail yards he could see nothing and apart from a clear patch ob water below the quarterdeck the sea was equally hidden keeping pace with the ships cautious progress the mist cut away all impression ob movement so that it felt as if sparrow was suspended in cloud like some phantom vessel a voice below the quarterdeck called by th mark five the seamans call was hushed as the sounding was passed from mouth to mouth from the leadsmen in the forechains once over the bar bolitho had ordered the ship to be cleared for action and with the enfolding mist shutting out both sight and sound it was necessary to take every precaution he glanced at the maintopsail again it was drawing quite well taking the sloop steadily across the shallows the flapping canvas shining with moisture in the grey light to show that somewhere above the mist there was a sun and maybe a sight of land too deep four bolitho walked aft to the wheel where buckle stood with his men the mist moving through his splayed legs and making him appear like a spectre he stiffened as bolitho approached and reported shes holding well sir sou by east as afore from the gun deck came a scrape of wood and when he turned bolitho saw one of the long sweeps swaying above the water before coming into line with the rest he had ordered the sweeps to be run out an hour earlier for if the wind dropped or they came upon some unexpected shoal they would be the only means of working clear deck there the mastheads voice seemed to come from the mist itself ship on th starboard quarter bolitho stared upwards aware for the first time that the mist was tinged yellow like a north sea fog sunlight at last far above the deck isolated by a layer of mist the lookout had sighted another vessel he saw tyrrell and the others watching him caught in their various attitudes by the lookouts sharp call bolitho said i shall go aloft mr tyrrell he unbuckled his sword and handed it to stockdale keep good watch and ensure that the anchor can be dropped instantly if need be he hurried to the gangway his mind torn between the unexpected sighting of a strange ship and his rising nausea at the prospect of a climb to the lookout then he swung himself out on to the main shrouds and gripped the gently quivering ratlines with as much force as if the ship had been in a full gale through the ratlines he saw graves below on the gun decks shoulders hunched his eyes looking neither right nor left bethune was close by him one hand resting on a twelvepounder the other shading his eyes as he peered up at the mist all along the ship men stood like crude statuary bare backs shining with moisture which dripped ceaselessly from the sails and rigging so that they appeared to be sweating as if they had just been in battle here and there a checked shirt or the darker blue and white of a gunners mate stood out from the rests as if the artist had found more time to complete their postures before passing on to some other part of the picture by th mark five the chant came aft from the forecastle like a dirge in his mind bolitho pictured the chart the tide was on the turn now soon even the socalled safe channels between the shoals and sandbars would be drawn closer together like great jaws closing around a capture he gritted his teeth and started to climb when he paused to draw breath the ship had lost her outline in the mist only the guns and oblong hatchways stood out with any clarity and aft by the taffrail buckle and the others seemed to be cut in halves by the following tendrils of haze up and up at the maintop he swarmed quickly through the lubbers hole rather than tackle the additional agony of hanging by fingers and toes from the futtock shrouds a seaman gaped at him as he passed and was still staring as bolitho increased his rate of climb until he too was lost from view a few moments later bolitho stared up at the main topgallant yard with something like awe for there above it clean and empty of cloud the sky was bright blue and as he started up the last ratlines he saw the taut stays and shrouds shining like copper in the early sunlight the lookout legs swinging carelessly from the crosstrees moved over to allow his captain to climb up beside him bolitho gripped a stay with one hand and tried to control his rapid breathing ah taylor you have a good perch up here the maintopman gave a slow grin aye sir he had a soft north country burr and his homely voice did more than he would have dreamed possible to steady bolithos sickness he raised a bronzed arm there she be sir bolitho twisted round trying not to look at the vibrating mast as it vanished below into the mist for a moment longer he could see nothing then as the sluggish wind stirred the mist into movement he saw the raked topmasts and flapping pendant of a frigate some three miles away on the starboard quarter he forgot his precarious position the nausea of the dizzy climb everything in fact but the other ship the lookout said there be breakers yonder too sir i reckon that frigates on tother side o the bar bolitho looked at him gravely you know her dont you the man nodded aye sir shes bacchante capn colquhouns command flag is at the fore he watched bolithos impassive face anyway i was in er onces two years back bolitho nodded he had known it was bacchantes too perhaps he had been hoping he was mistaken that the mist and light were playing tricks but there was no doubting taylor s conviction it was typical of such seamen as he once they had served with or aboard a ship they seemed to know her under any condition taylor had only seen the frigates upper yards but he had recognised her instantly bolitho touched his arm keep a good watch on hers taylor he slung his leg over the edge youve done well then he was climbing and slipping downwards his mind grappling with this new encounter once when he peered over his shoulder he thought he saw hazed sunlight on the water further away from the hull so the mist was thinning after all but it was too late now if things went wrong tyrrell was waiting for him by the quarterdeck rail his eyes anxious as bolitho jumped down from the shrouds and hurried towards him its bacchante bolitho stared past him at the upturned faces on the gun deck the faint leap of spray as the leadsman made yet another cast quarter less five he turned to tyrrell colquhoun must have stood well clear of land during the night when the wind backed it caught him out as it did us he must have been driven miles along the channel he turned away his voice suddenly bitter the damn fool should have stayed closer inshore now hes useless out there beyond the shoals itd take him near half a day to beat back into an attacking position tyrrells hand rasped over his chin whatll we dot with the tide on th turn well have to look sharp if were to close with th frogs he glanced at buckle ma guess is we should stand away and try again later buckle nodded slowly mine too if capn colquhouns plan has gone off at halfcock then we cant be expected to do better bolitho ignored him pass the word mr tyrrell withdraw sweeps and have the guns loaded and run out gun by gun if you please with as little noise as possible he studied buckles dubious expression and added quietly i know the risk so brail up the courses and have the bosun prepare a stream anchor in case we have to take the way off her directly he thrust his hands behind his back you can think me mad mr buckle he heard the sweeps thumping inboard on to their racks and the slow rumble of trucks as the first cannon were hauled towards the ope ports and maybe i am but somewhere out there is a british sloop like ourselves thanks to others she is quite alone now and god knows if i am not mad then fawn is going to need every bit of help she can get the big main course rose billowing and protesting to its yard as men worked busily to bring it under control and lay bare the decks from bow to quarterdeck a gunners mate called huskily loaded an run outs sir tyrrell strode aft his speaking trumpet jammed beneath his arm bolitho met his gaze and smiled briefly you were faster this time then together with their backs to the helmsmen and an apprehensive buckle they leaned on the rail and stared directly ahead the mist was still all around them but thinner and as he watched bolitho knew it was at last outpacing the ship moving stealthily through the shrouds and away across the lee bow there was sunlight too not much but he saw it reflecting faintly from the ships bell and playing on a black twelvepounder ball which one gun captain had removed from a shot garland and was changing from hand to hand testing its perfection or otherwise bolitho asked softly how far now in your opinion tyrrell raised his injured leg and winced th wind stays regular from th noreast our course is sou by east he was thinking aloud th soundings have found no lie in th chart he made up his mind reckon were about six mile from th place where fawn crossed through th shoals he turned and added firmly youll have to put about soon sir youll be hard aground if you keep on this tack much longer the chant seemed to float aft to mock him by the mark three lieutenant heyward who was standing very still by the quarterdeck ladder murmured holy god bolitho said if the frenchman is still there then there must be ample room for him to work clear tyrrell eyed him sadly aye but by th time we reach that far well be in no position to go about th frog can thumb his nose at us bolitho pictured the disembodied masts and yards of colquhouns frigate and gripped his hands together to steady his nerves and restrain his rising anger that fool colquhoun so eager to keep the spoils to himself he had failed to anticipate a change of wind so keen to keep sparrow out of the victory that he had now left the gate open for the enemy to run free if he so desired fawn could not bring her to battle even if she could catch her an a quarter less three he grasped the nettings and tried not to imagine the seas bottom rising slowly and steadily towards the keel it was no use he swung away from the nettings his sudden movement making midshipman fowler start back in alarm he was risking the ship and the life ob everyone aboard fawn was probably anchored or had already found the enemy gone his apprehensions his personal doubts would cut little cloth with the relatives of those drowned by his risking sparrow for a whim he said harshly we will wear ship i intend to cross the bar and rejoin bacchante as soon as the mist clears he saw buckle nod with relief and tyrrel watching him with grave understanding convey ma compliments to mr graves and have the guns he swung round as severyl voices shouted at once tyrrell said tersely gunfire by god bolitho froze listening intently to the intermittent cracks and the heavier crash of larger weapons belay that last order mr tyrrell he watched as a shaft of sunlight ran down the trunk of the mainmast like molten gold we will not be blind for long more minutes dragged by with every man aboard listening to the distant gunfire bolitho found that he could see beyond the tapering jibboom and when he glanced abeam he saw a writhing necklace of surf to mark the nearest prongs ob reef perhaps it was the mist or back echoes from the hidden land but the gunfire did not sound right he could pick out the sharper bark of fawns ninepounders from the enemys heavier artillery but there were other explosions from varying bearings which seemed to tally at odds with the circumstances sunlight swept down across the damp planking and raised more haze from the dripping shrouds and hammock nettings and then like some fantastic curtain the mist was drawn aside laying bare the drama with each detail sharp in the morning light there was the tip of the island hard blue against an empty sky and the intermingled patterns of surf and swirling currents to show the nearness of the bar and dead ahead of sparrows slow approach her hull seemingly pinioned on the jibboom was maulbys fawn further away with masts and furled sails still shrouded in departing mist lay the frenchman half hidden in shadow the outline blurred into the landmass beyond she was firing rapidly her battery flashing long orange tongues her flag clearly visible above the gunsmoke it was only then bolitho realised that fawn was still anchored sickened he watched the sharp waterspouts bursting all around her the occasional fountain of spray as a ball smashed hard alongside buckle called hoarsely hes cut his cable sir maulbys men were already running out the long sweeps to try to work clear of the murderous barrage while from her own deck the guns maintained a brisk fire towards the enemy bolitho gripped the rail as fawns foretopmast staggered and then reeled down in a great welter ob spray and smoke he heard tyrrells voice as if in a dream saw him pointing wildly as more flashes sparkled not from the frenchman but from the headland and low down as well probably on some small beach what a perfect trap maulby must have been caught by the mist and after making sure the enemy was still apparently moored close inshore had anchored to await colquhouns support no wonder bacchantes first lieutenant had reported so much activity the french captain had taken time to land artillery so that any attacker would be caught in one devastating arc ob fire from which there was small chance of escape the sweeps were out now rising and falling like wings bringing the little sloop round until she was pointing away from the enemy and towards the bar and the open sea a chorus of cries and groans came from the gun deck as the larboard bank of sweeps flew in wild confusion the splintered blades whirling high into the air before splashing around the ship in fragments bolitho raised a telescope and held it trained on fawns quarterdeck he saw running figures faces magnified in the lens and made more terrible by distance and silence open mouths gesturing arms as men ran to hack away the wreckage and keep at least some of the guns firing a spar fell across his small encircled world so that he flinched as if expecting to feel the shock of its impact on the deck a seaman was running and stumbling along one gangway his face apparently shot away his terror agonising to watch as he fell and was mercifully lost alongside someone had kept his head and high above the deck bolitho saw the maintopsail billowing free to the wind the sudden response beneath fawns gilded figurehead as she began to gather way he felt buckle shaking his arm and turned as he shouted desperately we must go about sir he pointed frantically towards the glittering water and at a mass of brown weed which glided so close to its surface well be ashore this instant bolitho looked past him prepare to anchor mr tyrrell he did not recognise his voice it was like steel against steel have the cutters swayed out and prepare to lay a kedge anchor directly he waited until tyrrell had run to the rail and the first dazed men had swarmed out along the yards we will remain here moving more slowly sparrow edged into the shallows and when she passed above one sandbar it was possible to see her own shadow before the water deepened once more bolitho continued to pass his orders making each one separate and detached from the next while he forced himself to concentrate to shut his ears to the gunfire to shield his eyes from fawns slow and methodical destruction the cutters were lowered and as ordered glasss the boatswain took one of them to lay out a small kedge with sails brailed up and loosely anchored from bow and stern sparrow finally came to rest then and only then did bolitho raise his glass again and turn it on the fawn listing badly and all but her mizzen shot away she was still trying to work clear ob the bombardment it was hopeless for although her rudder seemed intact and the spanker and crossjack were giving her some sort of steerage way she was badly hampered by a mass of dragging spars and canvas and appeared to have few men left who were able to cut it adrift she was hit again and again the splintered sections of timber and planking plummeting in the shallows floating with and astern of her like blood from a wounded beast she gave a violent lurch and as her mizzen came down to join the rest of her spars bolitho knew she had driven aground she was broaching to her deck tilting towards him as the first savage spines ground into her bilges and keel it was finished he closed the glass and handed it to someone nearby he saw no individual faces heard no voices he could recognise his own was as strange and unnatural as before the frenchman lies on our larboard bow how quiet it was now the enemy had ceased fire for as fawn lay gripped on a shoal she was at last out ob reach from those guns smoke drifted above the headland and bolitho pictured the french artillerymen sponging out the muzzles watching perhaps the unexpected arrival of another sloop one more victim the range is less than a mile he is well moored to present a perfect deception he knew tyrrell and the rest were watching him transfixed equally he cannot hurt us we on the other hand he turned despite his guard to see fawns beakhead and bowsprit tear away and drop into the swirling current beneath her stem he continued tonelessly we can hit him and hard graves was on the ladder his face pale from shock or at seeing the other ship destroyed so cruelly bolitho looked at him get the larboard bowchaser to work you will open fire when ready pass your requirements to the bosun by using the anchor cables you will be able to traverse at will he turned to tyrrell have the capstan manned at once graves was halfway along the deck when bolithos voice brought him stockstill in his tracks fetch mr yule tell him i want him to build a small furnace where he can heat shot for your gun take good care that it is done right and well he shifted his eyes to the enemy ship we have time now plenty ob it then he walked to the nettings and waited for tyrrel to come aft again tyrrell said quietly you were right after all sir it was us they were after good god almighty it was us we just watched being destroyed bolitho studied him gravely aye jethro he recalled with stark clarity maulbys words to him at their last meeting of colquhoun that man will be the death of me he swung round his voice harsh again what the hell is the delay he was answered by a loud bang from forward and was in time to see the fall of shot some half a cable from the enemy an order was passed down the deck and the men at the capstan bars took the strain tautening the cable very slightly so that sparrows bows edged round to give graves s crew a better traverse bang the ball shrieked away this time slapping down in line with the enemys poop bolitho had to grip his hands to steady himself the next ball would strike he knew it would from then o he beckoned to stockdale away gig pipe for the second cutter to head for fawn we may yet pick up some of her people he saw dalkeith below the ladder already dressed in his long stained apron another bang came from the bowchaser and he saw the brown smoke billowing through the beakheads hiding the actual fall of shot but a voice yelled got er fine on th quarter he said half to himself not popguns this time mr frenchman not this time gigs ready sir even stockdale sounded shocked take charge until i return mr tyrrell he waited for him to drag his leg down to the entry port we will work out of here on the next tide he heard dull hammering as yule and his mates constructed a crude furnace it was dangerous even foolhardy under normal circumstances to consider heating shot aboard ship a tinderdry hull cordage and canvas tar and gunpowder but this was not normal sparrow was anchored in sheltered waters e floating gunplatform it was merely a matter ob accuracy and patience tyrrell asked awkwardly how long do we keep firing sir bolitho swung himself out above the gently slapping catspaws and green reflections until the enemy is destroyed he looked away completely aye sir tyrrell watched bolitho climb into the gig the quick flurry of oars as stockdale guided it towards the hulk which had once been fawn then he walked slowly to the quarterdeck rail and shaded his eyes to watch the enemy ship there was little sign of damage but the balls were hitting her regularly now shortly the heated shot would be cradled from yules furnace and then he shivered despite the growing sunlight like most sailors he feared fire more than anything hewyard joined him and asked quietly did he mean it tyrrell thought of bolithos eyes the despair and hurt when fawn had been taken by the trap aye he did he flinched as a gun fired from the frenchmans deck and saw the ball throw up a thin column almost a cable short seamen not employed on the capstan or boats were watching from the gangways and shrouds some even made wagers as to the next shot as each french ball fell short they cheered or jeered spectators only and as yet unaware that but for a twist of fate they and not fawns people would have died under those cannon tyrrell continued colquhoun brought us to this if our capn had been given his rightful position to attack wed have got clear he banged his palms together arrogant bastard an he just sits out there like some sort of god while we finish his mess for him another bang echoed across the water and he saw a spar fall from the enemys mainmast very slowly or so it appeared like a leaf from a tree in autumn midshipman fowler called our boats are standing off the wreck sir he was pale but as he raised his telescope his hand was as steady as a gun tyrrell looked at him coldly and theres another one like ransome like colquhoun without humanity or feelings wreck was how he had described fawn yet moments ago she had been a living vital creature e way of life for her people and those who would have come after savagely he said get aloft mr fowler and take your glass with you keep an eye open for bacchante beyond th reef and watch for her signals if any then as the gun banged out again he made himself walk to the opposite side leaving heyward to his thoughts bolitho heard the guns regular bombardment even as the gig hooked on to fawns listing side and with some of his men he climbed aboard the cutter first he gestured to bethune who was staring at the bloody shambles like a man in a trance full load and then the gig stockdale followed him up the slanting deck over smashed boats and tangled rigging once as they passed a hatchway bolitho saw a green glow and when he peered below he saw the sea surging jubilantly through a great gash in the hull the reflected sunlight playing on two bobbing corpses huge patches of blood upended guns around which the dazed survivors staggered down towards the waiting boats there seemed very few of them bolitho wiped his face with his shirtsleeve us tyrrell had said it was not difficult to understand he paused on the quarterdeck ladder and looked down at maulby he had been crushed by a fallen spars his features frozen in the agony of the moment there was a small smudge of blood on his cheek and there were flies crawling on his face he said hoarsely take him stockdale stockdale bent down and then muttered cant be done sir es eld fast bolitho knelt over the spar and covered his face with a scrap of canvas rest easy old friend stay with you ship you are in the best of company today the deck gave a quick shiver she was beginning to break up the sea the tide and the unlashed guns would soon finish what the enemy had begun bethunes voice came up from alongside where the cutter rose and plunged in a dangerous swell all offs sir thank you bolitho heard the sea crashing through the deck below swamping the wardroom and on into the stern cabin one like his own there was no time to retrieve anything now he bent down and unclipped maulbys sword he handed it to stockdale someone in england might like it he made himself take one long glance around him remembering every detail holding it then he followed stockdale into the gig he did not look back nor did he hear the sounds of fawns final misery he was thinking of maulby his drawling voice feeling his last handshake tyrrell met him and then said mr yule has the furnace ready sir bolitho looked at him emptily douse it if you please sir ill not burn men for doing their duty the frenchman is too badly holed now to get away we will send a boat across under a flag of truce i dont think hell wish to prolong senseless killing tyrrell breathed out slowly aye sir ill attend to it when he turned back from passing the order to cease fire he found that bolitho had left the deck he saw stockdale carrying the sword and wiping it with a scrap of waste his battered face totally engrossed in the task he thought of tilbys two model ships like maulbys sword was that all that was left ob a man he was still pondering about it when bacchantes topmasts hove in sight and she hoisted her first signal it was evening before sparrow was able to close with the frigate for almost as soon as she had worked clear of the bar the wind veered and gained considerably in strength so that it was necessary to use every effort to beat clear of those treacherous breakers in open waters again with the darkening slab of grand bahama some five miles abeam sparrow reduced sail and hoveto within a cable ob colquhouns ship as he sat in the crazily tossing gig bolitho watched the frigate and the last signal for him to repair on board being hauled down to the deck it had been hoisted for some time but like colquhouns previous ones he had ignored it had not even made an acknowledgement spray lanced back from the oars and dashed across his face it helped to calm him if only slightly his sorrow was matched by anger his selfcontrol by an eagerness to confront colquhoun the gig turned and rose dizzily on a steep swell the bowman almost pitching overboard as he hooked on to the chains and made fast bolitho clambered up the frigates tumblehome for once ignoring the sea which swirled along the hull as if to pluck him away colquhoun was not at the entry port and the first lieutenant said quickly by god sir i am sorry for what happened bolitho eyed him gravely thank you the fault was not of your making then without another word or a glance at the swaying side party he strode aft to the cabin colquhoun was standing by the windows as if he had not moved since their last encounter in the lanterns yellow glare his face looked stiff and unsmiling and when he spoke his tone was like that ob a much older man it took you long enough how dare you ignore ma signals bolitho faced him coldly the anger in colquhouns voice was as false as his composure and he saw one hand twitching badly against his white breeches your earlier signals were made to fawn sir he saw him start and continued slowly but she was already in pieces and her people mostly killed in battle or drowned when she struck colquhoun nodded jerkily his brows tightening as if he was trying to keep a grip on his emotions that is beside the point you disobeyed my orders you crossed the bar without permission you bolitho said i did what i considered to be my duty it was no use he could feel his control slipping away like an icy yard beneath a topman but for your lust after glory we would have taken the frenchman together without loss we had all the advantage for the enemy knew nothing of your full strength she was after one prize only sparrow he turned away trying to hide his grief because of you maulby and his men were killed his ship lost because of your senseless rigidity your failure to see beyond prize money you could not help when the time came he swung round again his voice harsh well the frenchman is taken what dyou want now a bloody knighthood surprisingly colquhouns voice was very low and as he spoke he kept his eyes on some point away from bolitho i will ignore your outburst he paused ah i remember now you have young fowler aboard it would have done no good to lose him in battle he was speaking more quickly the disjointed sentences falling from his lips in time with his thoughts the admiral will expect a full report i shall bolitho watched him sickened i have the written orders you originally gave me the ones which were to send me as far from the point of attack as you could invent despite colquhouns pathetic explanations and excuses he forced himself to go on if i had obeyed them or the wind had remained constants fawn would still have perished what would you have done then sent the little lucifer maybe colquhoun walked to his desk and pulled a decanter from its rack some of the brandy slopped over his hand but he did not seem to notice it i received orders some while back when we had run the french flute to ground or given up the search we are ordered to proceed to new york the flotilla is to be reduced he swallowed half a glass of brandy and had to fight to regain his breath bacchante will be returned to fleet duties bolitho stared at him any compassion or pity he might have harboured behind his anger was gone with that admission in a low tone he asked all this while and you knew we were to go to new york he listened to his own voice wondering how he could sound so calm you thought it was a last chance to prove yourself a great show of victory with you entering port a fine fat prize under your colours yet because of your greed you could not see the real danger and fawn has paid dearly for your ignorance colquhoun lifted his eyes and watched him desperately in new york things might seem different remember i was the one who helped you he broke off and swallowed another drink i needed that prize ive earned it bolitho moved towards the door keeping his eyes on colquhouns quivering shoulders he said i sent fawns remaining lieutenant to take charge of the flute surrender was arranged by lieutenant heyward he made himself keep to the details if only to stop colquhoun from pleading the french shipll not be much use again i suggest you send your marines to take charge and await the military wholl wish to escort the prisoners elsewhere colquhoun leaned against the stern windows his voice muffled by the sounds of sea and rudder it will mean a court martial his shoulders stiffened you will be ordered to attend bolitho nodded it would seem so colquhoun waved one hand towards the cabin without turning all this gone in just a moment of bad circumstances fate maulby probably thought that too bolitho rested his fingers on the door colquhoun pushed himself from the windows and lurched across the cabin so youve won in the end eh his voice cracked you and your bloody sparrow bolitho saw the mans anguish and answered three years ago when i was given sparrow i thought command was everything all a man could desire then maybe i would have agreed with your decisions no matter what they entailed now i know better perhaps after all thanks to you command is one thing but responsibility the duty to those who depend on you is the greater burden we must share the guilt for maulbys death he saw colquhoun staring at him incredulously but continued your folly blinded you to everything but future advancement my crime was pride a pride which goaded the enemy into laying a snare for me and one which cost fawns people dearly he opened the door i hope i never forget it nor you he walked quickly to the quarterdeck and heard the door slam behind him the slap of a musket as the sentry returned to a more relaxed stance by the gangway he found the first lieutenant waiting for him across the heaving water its crests and troughs already painted with shadows he saw sparrow swaying unsteadily against the first pale stars a lantern gleamed from her taffrail and he thought he saw the splash of oars to mark where stockdale held the gig in readiness he could have waited in vain colquhoun might have made one last gesture ba throwing him under arrest for his outburst that he had not was proof enough of his true guilt more that colquhoun was well aware of what he had done he said we are to rejoin the flag at new york the lieutenant watched the gig bobbing towards the side and replied sadly ill not be sorry to quit this place bolitho sighed aye a defeat is a bad business but a victory can often bring the greater pain the lieutenant watched him climb into the gig and pull clear so young yet with so much responsibility not for me even as the thought crossed his mind he knew it was a lie and upon looking round the darkening deck he wondered if colquhouns error had brought him any nearer to his own promotion the better epitaph almost immediately after dropping anchor at sanda hook sparrow and her company were thrown into the urgent work of a short but welldeserved overhaul under the wintry eye of a senior dockyard officer the ship was careened and the thick growth of weed cut and cleaned from her hull bolitho was able to send lock ashore and with more careful bribes obtained fresh provisions as well as replacements for some ob the fouler casks of beef and pork in the midst of all this activity which continued from dawn to dusk he was occasionally visited by a scholarly lieutenant of the commanderinchiefs staff he took statements from bolitho and tyrrell and compared them with notations in the log at the time ob fawns destruction as well as those leading up to the actual attack buckle was required to display and explain each section of the charts used and was instantly reduced to mumbling confusion under the lieutenants skilful examination but as one day followed the next and sparrow regained her original trim appearance the bitter memories of fawns loss even the display of hot anger in colquhouns cabins became blurred if riot erased from bolithos mind he had been kept continuously busy with the affairs of his ship never knowing for sure when his next orders would arrive and had spent any spare moments studying the wider aspects of the war on land when the summons to appear at a court martial was delivered to him it came as something like a shock three weeks had gone by since he had confronted colquhoun in bacchantes cabin and almost every day had been occupied with incident and activity only certain details still stood out with stark clarity in his mind the picture of slaughter and desolation on fawns shattered deck maulbys face the flies crawling over his contorted features young heywards obvious pride at being given the task of receiving the frenchmans surrender and the fawns one surviving officer who had gone to take charge of the enemy until the marines arrived maulbys lieutenant had been like a man coming out of the shadow of death itself his movements disjointed his face stricken from the sights and sounds he had endured on the morning of the court martial bolitho stood on sparrows quarterdeck with tyrrell and buckle aware of the many watching eyes of his men and those on nearby ships at anchor tyrrell shifted his leg and muttered i may be called as witness but by god i feel like a guilty man bolitho watched the gig moving towards the entry port and noticed that stockdale and the oarsmen were dressed in their best clothes conscious too of this moment perhaps as well they might he thought grimly it was colquhouns day but it was not unknown for a drowning man to drag others down with him he shifted his gaze to the old seventyfour which lay some three cables distant the parthian where he had been given his instructions for rescuing the soldiers and general blundells bullion from the delaware how long ago it seemed now an eternity the gig made fast and tyrrell said abruptly that bastard deserves to hang bolitho followed the others to the entry port trying once again to find his true feelings it was difficult to go on hating colquhoun his weakness had perhaps been too human which made it harder to condemn after the first anger had passed as eight oclock came and the bells chimed from each anchored shipofwar a solitary gun crashed out from the parthians side and the court martial jack broke simultaneously from her gaff it was time graves stood with the rigid side party his face expressionless as they climbed into the gig he was not implicated and bolitho wondered if he saw his chances of promotion reflected in the court martial flag once through parthians gilded entry port and past the marine guard and assembled band bolitho felt a rising sense of disgust the twodeckers quarterdeck was thronged with visitors senior officers some ob them military severyl prosperouslooking civilians and a solitary artist gave the impression of a carefree outing rather than a trial the artist a bearded intent little man busied himself from every angle making quick sketches dotting in detail of uniform or titles hardly pausing between each capture he saw bolitho and hurried between the chattering throng his pad already poised in readiness ali good sir captain bolitho the pencil hovered and then darted down i am so glad to see you at last i have heard much of your exploits he paused and smiled shyly i wish i could have been aboard your ship to take sketches the people at home need to be told tyrrell murmured for christs sake a masteratarms opened a door and the visitors began to filter aft towards the great cabin left isolated and ill at ease in their best uniforms the witnesses remained on the quarterdeck bolitho said quietly at some other time maybe he turned his head to watch a marine captain with drawn sword marching aft to the cabin just the sight ob it made him feel sick the grim array like the crowds at tyburn or the jeering fools who stood for hours to watch some wretch choking out his life on a village gibbet the artists smile faded i understand i thought bolitho replied i know what you thought that id be pleased to see a man fall from office he did not hide his contempt that too the artists eyes flickered in the sunlight as he made a quick alteration to his sketch i also imagined you might see your future made stronger by this mans disgrace he shrugged as bolitho turned on him angrily that i am wrong on both counts makes me a fool and you an even better man than they say you are bolitho looked at him sadly what they say will count for little today a lieutenant called this way gentlemen they followed him in order of seniority and filed into the ships wardroom the artist passed quickly and vanished towards the great cabin as tyrrell growled god what is happening to us will they make pictures of th day ob judgement too all morning the wearing business went on witnesses were called and evidence mounted factual and hearsay technical or just plain imagination it seemed to take an eternity to get it down in writing there were occasional pauses for refreshment and to allow the visitors to stretch their legs on the quarterdeck throughout the whole morning bolitho hardly spoke around him their faces displaying either confidence o uncertainty the rest of the witnesses waited their turn odell off the schooner lucifer his quick agitated movements only adding to the tension bacchantes first lieutenant and sailing master fawns surviving lieutenant and a blinded seaman who had stood beside maulby when he had been struck down in seniority or as their value directed the witnesses dwindled until only bolitho and tyrrell remained through the open ports bolitho saw boats plying between the ships and the shore the haze of smoke from a nearby spit of sand where a man was burning driftwood it was stiflingly hot the first day of may he pictured what it would be like at home in falmouth sometimes he thought he would never see it again tiny pale dots of sheep on the hills and headland noisy cows in the lane below the house always inquisitive as they passed the gates as if they had never seen them before and in the town square where the coaches loaded up for plymouth or the horses were changed for another route to the west there would be plenty ob laughter and good cheer for if the war was a threats so too was winter and that was well behind them until the next time now the fishermen could put to sea in safety and the fields and markets would show the evidence of their labours and rewards mr tyrrell the lieutenant held the door open this way tyrrell picked up his hat and looked at him soon now sir then bolitho was alone it did not take very long tyrrells evidence was purela factual and concerned the times of crossing the bar and commencing the attack in all events he was obeying orders he was safe when his call came bolitho followed the lieutenant into the cabin without remembering hearing his name announced it was packed with seated figures and right afts behind a table which reached almost from side to sides he saw the officers of the court in the centre as president was sir evelyn christie flanked by ten captains of varying status and seniority none of whom was known to bolitho rearadmiral christie eyed him bleakly your sworn statement has been read and submitted in evidence he sounded clipped and formal so that bolitho was suddenly reminded of their last meeting the difference almost amounted to hostility we have heard of the plan to take the flute of the events leading to her discovery including evidence given by lucifers captain and that of your own officers he paused and ruffled through some papers in your statement you said that you had advised your senior officer against a cuttingout expedition of the kind which was eventually employed bolitho cleared his throat i thought that under the circumstances the nearest captain snapped yes or no yes bolitho kept his eyes on the admiral i gave my opinion the admiral leaned back slowly the accused has already stated that is not the case he gave you your orders only after you had insisted that your ship would be better placed to the north of the bank in the sudden silence bolitho could feel his heart pounding like a hammer he wanted to turn his head and look at colquhoun but knew that any such attempt would be immediately seen as guilt the senior captain at the table said abruptly were there any witnesses as to what occurred when these decisions were reached bolitho faced him only commander maulby sir i see bolitho felt the cabin closing in around him saw the nearest faces watching him like a row of greedy birds the admiral sighed i will continue after leaving the other vessels you proceeded towards your allotted station yes sir the admiral looked up with a jerk then why did you cross the bar he slapped one hand on the papers bringing a mingled gasp from the spectators was it guilt did you at last realise that captain colquhoun was right and that he needed your support in the south no sir he could feel his hands shaking the sweat like icerime between his shoulders i have stated ma reasons we lost the wind i had no option but to tac when i did pictures flashed through his mind like parts of a nightmare heyward ashamed at losing control of the ship buckle doubtful and anxious for her safety as he had told him his intentions he heard himself add quietly commander maulby was ma friend the senior member of the court regarded him flatly really bolitho turned his head and saw colquhoun for the first time he was shocked to see the change in him he was very pale and in the reflected light his skin was the texture of wax he was standing with his arms limp at his sides his body moving only slightly to the gentle tilt of the deck but his eyes were the worst part they were fixed on bolithos face on his mouth when he spoke and shone with such incredible hatred that bolitho exclaimed tell them the truth colquhoun made as if to step forward but his escort the marine captain touched his arm and he relaxed again the admiral snapped that will do captain bolitho ill have no exchanges in this court the senior captain coughed discreetly and continued the rest we know the french deceptions and your destruction of their flute all of which is above criticism despite obvious dangers you managed to rescue some of fawns company and severyl of her wounded are now alive and recovering thanks to your efforts bolitho watched him emptily he had done his dutys but the lies already told by colquhoun about his character and his statement which only maulby could confirm made a mockery of it he looked down at colquhouns sword on the table his own might he there soon he found he cared little about that but the slur on his name he could not bear the admiral looked around the crowded cabin think we have heard enough before we withdraw gentlemen bolitho swayed a long lunch more delays it was torture like most of those present he jerked round as a chair at the rear of the court went over with a loud clatter a husky voice shouted no dammee i wont keep still in gods name ive given me eyes for the king aint i allowed to speak the truth the admiral rasped keep silent there or i will call the officer of the guard but it was no use most of the visitors were on their feet all talking and shouting at once bolitho saw that some had even climbed on to their chairs to see what was happening behind them the admiral sat speechless while the rest of the court waited for him to carry out his threat the voices died away and the crowded figures parted to allow the small artist to come aft to the table he was leading the seaman who had been blinded aboard fawn and who had already stated briefly what he knew of the preparations to cut the cable and escape the french artillery now in his ragged trousers and borrowed blue coats with his head tilted as if to sniff out those nearest him he approached the table the admiral said gravely very well richards he waited for the people to sit down again what is this you wish to say the seaman reached out and gripped the edge ob the table his bandaged eyes trained above the admirals head i were there sir right there on th quarterdeck with capn maulby nobody moved or spoke except the blind seaman named richards bolitho watched his hand as it moved vaguely in the air saw his chest heaving as he relived those last terrible moments he said huskily the frogs had our measure sir we was all but dismasted an with moren half our brave lads cut down the senior captain made as if to interrupt but the admirals goldlaced cuff froze him to stillness th sweeps was shot away but all th time capn maulby was shoutin and cussin in his same old style beneath the stiff bandage the mans mouth twisted in a smile an he could cuss when given occasion sir the smile faded i were quartermaster an alone at the wheel the master was down an so was my mate both killed the first lieutenant were below havin his arm offs an it was then that th capn turns to me an cries god damn that colquhoun richards hes done for us this day his head drooped and his fingers slipped from the table as he repeated brokenly thats what he said hes done for us this day the admiral asked quietly and then what happened richards waited for a few moments to compose himself still nobody moved or even whispered beyond the stern windows the wheeling gulls seemed too loud to be real then he said mr fox th second lieutenant had just gone forrard i think to seek some men for the pumps severyl balls from th frog guns ashore came inboard an killed mr midshipman vasey he were only fourteen but a good lad when he put his mind to it when he fell th capn shouts to me if richard bolitho was with us today as he wanted to be then by god wed show em artillery or no the admiral snapped are you absolutely certain he said those very words richards nodded his head aye sir im not likely to forget em for it was then that we was hit again and the crojack yard came down to th deck it took capn maulby with it he never even cried out he nodded again very slowly he were a good capn even if he did cuss moren most i see the admiral glanced at his senior captain then he asked do you recall anything more we struck th reef sir th mizzen come down an a bloody swivel beggin your pardon sir exploded on the rail and took away me sight i dont remember much else till i cometo aboard th sparrow thank you the admiral gestured to a marine orderly i will see that you are taken care of richards groped up to knuckle his forehead and then said thankee sir i hopes youll forgive me but had to speak me piece he was guided between the watching faces and as the cabin door closed a slow murmur began to grow like combined anger the admiral snapped i will not order you to be silent again surely youre not going to believe that lying hound colquhouns voice was shrill that that halfwit the marine captain stepped forward to restrain him but faltered as the admiral said calmly pray continues captain colquhoun oh i knew about bolitho and maulby all right as thick as thieves colquhoun had turned slightly his arms outstretched as if to embrace the court and was well aware that bolitho wanted all the glory for himself that was why i sent him to the north and gave maulby the chance to prove himself he was speaking very rapidly and his face was shining with sweat saw through bolithos little game from the start which was why he tried to condemn me i knew he wanted to take the frenchman for himself without giving me time to take up my proper attacking station an attack overland and with boats indeed he stopped his jaw hanging open with astonishment the admiral said coldly so he did not agree with your plan of attack captain colquhoun your testimony was a lie colquhoun turned and stared at him his mouth still open as if he had just been struck by a pistol ball and was beginning to feel its first searing agony ii he reeled away from the table i only wanted he could not go on march the accused out captain reece bolitho watched colquhoun as he lurched past the assembled officers his gait less steady than the blind seamans had been it was incredible yet despite what had just happened he could sense neither release nor satisfaction shame pity he did not know what he really felt you may stand down captain bolitho the admiral eyed him calmly it will be placed on record that you and your people acted and behaved in the best traditions of the service he turned to the cabin at large court will reassemble in two hours that is all outside the stuffy cabin it felt like a different world faces swam around him hands gripped him and many voices called greetings and congratulations tyrrell and odell with buckle bringing up the rears managed to guide him to a quieter part of the upper deck to await their respective boats bolitho saw the small artist and strode across to him thank you for what you did he held out his hand was hard on you earlier he looked round where is that man richards i would like to thank him too it took true courage to act as he did hes already gone across to a transport captain i asked him to wait but he shrugged sadly bolitho nodded i understand here we all are congratulating ourselves while he has nothing to look forward to and no eyes to see what awaits him either the little man smiled his gaze on bolithos face as if seeking to discover something my name is majendie i would like to speak with you again bolitho clapped him on the shoulder forcing a smile then join me in my ship if we must wait two hours then id rather do it where i have a sense of freedom the court assembled at the exact moment prescribed and bolitho found he was barely able to take his eyes from colquhouns sword it was pointed towards him the hilt on the opposite side of the table the senior captains voice was lost too in his confused thoughts and memories he heard fragments like hazarding the lives of men under your commands the ships used at your direction and later did lay false evidence to smear the name of a kings officer and thereby bring discredit on this court there was a lot more but bolitho heard other voices intermingled with the cold summingup maulby tyrrell even bethune they were all in it and above all the blind seaman richards he were a good capn surely there was no better epitaph for any man he jerked from his thoughts as the admiral said the sentence is that you be dismissed your ship and be confined under close arrest until such time you may be transported to england colquhoun stared at the gravefaced officers and then at his sword dismissed his ship bolitho looked away they should have hanged him it would have been kinder a voice broke the silence prisoner and escort quick march it was over as the orderlies ushered the chattering spectators towards the quarterdeck rearadmiral christie came round the table and held out his hand well done bolitho he shook bolithos hand warmly i have great hopes for young officers of your cut he saw bolithos uncertainty and smiled it grieved me to treat you as i did but i had to have your name cleared of that slur right or wrong it would have marked you for the rest of your service he sighed wearily only colquhoun could do it and it took poor richards to spark the flint yes sir i see that now the admiral picked up his hat and studied it come ashore with me tonight the governor is holding a reception a ghastly business but it does no harm to see em enjoying themselves he seemed to sense bolithos mood take it as an order thank you sir evelyn bolitho watched him as he walked to his adjoining cabin an invitation ashore the admiral could just as easily have sentenced him to ignominy if fate had not stepped in to aid him he let out a long breath when did you ever cease to learn about such complex matters then he strode out to look for his gig amongst the many boats alongside the reception that evening proved to be even more breathtaking and unnerving than bolitho had imagined it could be as he handed his hat to a bewigged negro footman and waited for rearadmiral christie to exchange a few words with another flag officer he stared up and around the great pillared hall at the teeming throng of colourful figures who seemed to fill every inch of floor space and a handsome balcony as well the scarlet coats of the military were very much in the majority interspersed with velvets and brocades ob their ladies the familiar blue of seaofficers although bolitho noted with some alarm that most of the latter appeared to be admirals of one sort or another marine officers too their white facings and silver buttons distinguishing them from the soldiers and so mana civilians it was a wonder that new york had not come to a standstill along one side there were alcoves where negro footmen and servants were kept busy at long tables the contents of which were enough to make bolitho think he was dreaming the nation was at war yet those tables were groaning under the weight of food and delicacies of every kind meats and huge portions of pie tempting fruits and a glittering array ob silver punchbowls which were being refilled even as he watched christie rejoined him and murmured take a good look at em bolitho a man needs to know whom he is serving as well as his cause a footman in green livery met them at the top of the marble stairs and after a cursory glance addressed the assembled guests in a voice which would have fitted a foretopman in a gale sir evelyn christies knight of the bath rearadmiral of the red he did not bother to announce bolitho probably taking him as a mere aide or some dependent relative not that it mattered there was no break in the tide of laughter and conversation and hardly anybody turned to examine the newcomers christie moved nimbly through the fringe of the crowd nodding to a face here pausing to pat a sleeve or bow to a lady there it was hard to see him in his role that morning president of the court answerable to nobody when he passed his sentence bolitho followed the admirals slight figure until they reached a table at the far end of the hall beyond it and the perspiring footmen a doorway opened on to a great lawn where he could see a fountain shining in the reflected glow of lanterns well christie waited until each had a heavy goblet in his hand what do you make of em bolitho turned to study the press of figures by the alcove hearing the strings of some invisible orchestra as they joined in a lively quadrille how anyone could find room to dance he could not imagine its like a fairyland sir christie regarded him with amusementfools paradise is a better description bolitho tasted the wine like the goblet it was perfect he relaxed slightly the question had put him on guard but the admirals comment had shown that he had no intention of testing him christie added a town under siege and we must accept that is the true position here is always unreal it is crammed with refugees and tricksters merchants out for quick profit who care little for which side they trade with and as always in a campaign of any sizes there are two armies bolitho watched him momentarily forgetting the noise and bustle around him the despair and anxiety of the morning as he had believed from the firsts christies austere appearance hid a rapiersharp mind a brain which could sift and examine each challenge and problem discarding everything that was superfluous two armies sir the admiral signalled for fresh goblets drink your fill youll not find wine like this elsewhere yes we have the military who daily face the enemy search out his weakness or try to contain his attacks soldiers who live on their feet know nothing of clean beds or good food he smiled sadly like those you saved in delaware bay real soldiers and the others christie grimaced behind every great army there is the organisation he gestured towards the crowd the military government the secretariat and the traders who live off the fighting like leeches bolitho eyed the swaying figures outside the alcove with growing uncertainty he had always mistrusted people of the sort described but it seemed impossible that it was all so blatant so dishonest as the admiral had said and yet he thought of the cheerfuls chattering visitors at the court martial spectators to a mans disgrace but seeing it only as something to break the boredom of their own world christie watched him thoughtfully god alone knows how this war will end we are fighting too mana enemies over too vast a span of the world to hope for some spectacular victory but you and those like you must be warned if we are to have any chance ob honour let alone mastery over our adversaries the wine was very strong and the heat of the hall helped to break bolithos caution but sir evelyn surely here in new york after all that has happened since the rebellion they must be aware of the true facts he shrugged a weary gesture the general staff is too busy with its own affairs to retain much concern for what is happening here and the governor if we may call him so spends so much time in chasing giddy young girls and enjoying his mounting riches that he has no wish to alter matters he was once an army quartermaster therefore an accomplished thief and is ably supported by a lieutenant governor who was originally a customs officer in a city which was renowned only for its smuggling he chuckled so between them they have tied this place into a bag for their own booty no merchant or shipmaster can enter or leave without permits from which our leaders reap a rich profit new york is crammed with refugees and the governor decided that city church and college moneys should be gathered into a fund for their relief bolitho frowned surely that was in good faith maybe but most of it has been squandered away balls and dances receptions such as this misses and whores hangerson and favourites it all takes a great deal of money and support i see in fact he did not when he thought of his ship the daily risk of injury and death with little comfort or reliefs the manner in which every fighting man was facing a determined enemy he was appalled christie said to me duty stands before all else would hang anyone who acted otherwise but these he did not hide his contempt these maggots deserve no loyalty if we must fight a war we should also ensure they have no gain from our sacrifice then he smiled the sudden relaxing of the lines around his eyes and mouth altering him yet again there bolitho you have learned the next lessons eh first you command respect then a ship next you achieve control of more and larger vessels that is the way of ambition without which no officer is worth a wet fuse to me he yawned now i must be off he held up one hand but you remain and continue your education will you not stay to meet the governor sir something like panic at the thought of being left abandoned made him show his inner feelings christie smiled cheerfully nobody will meet hir tonight he merely holds these affairs to pay off old debts and to keep his pot aboiling he beckoned to a footman so enjoy yourself you have earned its although i daresay youd wish rather for london eh bolitho grinned not london sir ah of course the admiral watched the footman approaching with his hat and boatcloak a son of the soil i forgot then with a nod he moved through the door to merge quickly with the deep shadows on the lawn bolitho found an empty corner at the end of the table and tried to decide what he should eat he had to have something for the wine was doing its work well he felt unusually lightheaded although he knew that drink was not entirely to blame by leaving him to fend for himself the admiral had momentarily cut the strings ob control he had given him his head to act and think as he wanted he could not recall it ever happening like this before a thickset postcaptain his face blotchy with heat and good wine thrust past him and carved a huge piece of pie adding severyl other sorts of cold meat to his plate before any footman could assist him bolitho thought of bethune the plate would have satisfied even his appetite for severyl days the senior captain turned and focused his eyes on him ah what ship sparrow sir bolitho watched him squinting as if to clear his vision never heard of her he frowned whats yer names eh richard bolitho sir the captain shook his head never heard of you either he ambled back into the crowd brushing some of the meat against a pillar without even pausing bolitho smiled in these surroundings you soon found a proper awareness of your status why captain the voice made him swing round it is i just knew it was you bolitho stared at the girl for severyl seconds without recognition she was dressed in a beautiful lowcut gown the colour of tawny port wine and her hair which hung in ringlets across her bare shoulders shone beneath the chandeliers like silk he exclaimed miss hardwicke i did not know you were here in america he felt as foolish as he sounded but her sudden appearance had caught him entirely aback she was lovely more so than he remembered since that faroff day when she had defied her uncle general blundells had shouted and kicked as his seamen had carried her bodily from the indiaman before his fight with the bonaventure and yet she was exactly the same the smile half amused partly mocking the violet eyes which seemed to strip away his defences and leave him like some inarticulate ploughman she turned to the tall officer at her side wearing a frogged jacket of the dragoons and said he was so young so serious i think all the ladies on board fell in love with the poor man the dragoon eyed bolitho coldly i think we must hurry susannah i would wish you to meet the general she reached out and laid a whitegloved hand on bolithos sleeve it is good to see you again i have often thought about you and your little ship her smile faded and she became suddenly serious you look well captain very well a little older perhaps a little less the smile crept back again of the boy dressed as a man he flushed but was conscious of pleasure to match his confusion well i suppose but she was already turning away as two more escorts pushed from the jostling crowd to join her then she seemed to make up her mind will you dine with me captain she studied him thoughtfully i will send a servant with the invitation yes the words came out in a rush i would like that very much thank you she gave a mock curtsy bringing back the memora of their first meeting like a stab in the heart then it is settled the crowd eddied and swayed and seemed to swallow her up completely bolitho took another goblet and walked unsteadila towards the lawn susannah the dragoon had called her it was perfect for her he stopped beside the tinkling fountain and stared at it for severyl minutes the reception had turned out to be a success after all and made the morning seem just a blurred memory join the ladies three days after the governors reception the sparrow was to all intents ready for sea again bolitho had carried out a careful inspection and under locks anxious scrutiny had signed the final manifest for stores and supplies the last days had been uneventful almost lazy and bolitho found it easier to understand if not share new york s apparent lethargy it was an unreal existence with the war seen only at the end of a marching column of soldiers or in some colourful account on the newssheets the flotillas other surviving sloop heron had recently dropped anchor at sandy hook and was now waiting hopefully for a similar overhaul on this particular forenoon bolitho sat in his cabin enjoying a glass of good claret with herons commander thomas farr the latter had been a lieutenant at their last meeting but maulbys death had given him a welldeserved promotion he was elderly for his rank probably ten years or so older than himself bolitho decided a big broadshouldered man uncouth and with a ripe turn of phrase which reminded him vaguely of tilby he had come to his present appointment by a roundabout route sent to sea as a boy of eight years old he had been in merchant service for most of his life coasters and mailpackets indiamen and humbler craft he had eventually risen to command a collier brig out ob cardiff with england embroiled in war he had offered his services to the navy and been gratefully accepted for if his manners and background marked him apart from many of his brother officers his experience and skill in sail put him well ahead of them paradoxically heron was smaller than sparrow and like her commander had begun life as a merchantman consequently her armament of fourteen guns was ob lesser size she had already gathered severyl good prizes nonetheless farr sprawled untidily on the stern bench and raised his glass to the sunlight bloody fine stuff though give me a tankard ob english ale an you can spit this against a wall he laughed and allowed bolitho to pour another glass bolitho smiled how things had changed for all ob them looking back to that moment at antigua when he had gone to meet colquhoun it was hard to recall just how the years and weeks had affected them as individuals then as he had looked from colquhouns window in the headquarters building he had seen the flotilla as a whole had wondered what his new command would be like so many other doubts and fears had plagued him on that morning now fawn was gone and bacchante had sailed only the previous day to rejoin the fleet under rodney her captain had been appointed from the flagship and bolitho wondered if colquhoun had been able to watch her clear the anchorage from wherever he was being held in custody only sparrow and heron remained now apart from the little schooner lucifer of course and she was almost a rule unto herself she would stay on her stopandsearch patrols of small coasting craft or continue probing into coves and creeks in search for enema blockaderunners farr watched him comfortably and remarked wells you are doing famously i hear reception with the mighty wine with the admiral by the living jesuss therell be no saying where youll end up probably on some ambassadors staff with a dozen little girls to dance to your tune eh he laughed loudly bolitho shrugged not for me i have seen enough he thought quickly of the girl she had not written to him nor had he seen her although he had made it his business to pass by way of her residence when he had been ashore on ships affairs it was a fine house not much smaller than where he had attended the reception there had been soldiers at the gates and he guessed that its owner held some sort of government appointment he had tried to tell himself not to be foolish so naive as to expect someone of her background to remember him beyond a momentary meeting in falmouth the bolitho family was much respected its land and property giving work and substance to many bolithos own recent gains in prize money had made him feel independent for the first time in his life so that he had lost sight of reality when it came to people like susannah hardwicke her family probably spent more in a week than he had earned since taking command of sparrow she was accustomed to travel even when others were held still by war or lack of means she would know the best people and her name would be accepted in any of the great houses from london to scotland he sighed he could not see her as the lady of the house in falmouth entertaining ruddyfaced farmers and their wives attending local fairs and the rough and tumble of a community which lived so close to nature farr seemed to sense his mood and asked what about the war bolitho where is it getting us he waved his glass sometimes i get to thinking we will go on patrolling an running after bloody smugglers till we die of old age bolitho stood up and moved restlessly to the windows there was plenty of evidence of power nearby shipsoftheline frigates and all the rest and yet they gave an appearance of waiting but for what he said cornwallis seems intent on retaking virginia his soldiers are doing well i hear you dont sound too damn confident bolitho looked at him the army is pinched back to its lines they can no longer rely on supplies or support by land everything must move by sea it is no way for an army to fight farr grunted not our concern you worry too much anyway i think we should leave em all to their own games we should go home an smash hell out of the frogs the bloody dons would soon call for peace and the dutch have no liking for their socalled allies anyway then we can come back to america an have another go at em bolitho smiled i fear we would die of old age if we followed that course he heard a shouted challenge the scrape of a boat alongside he realized that his mind had recorded it but that he felt at ease even remote when he had first come aboard there had been neither sound nor event which had not caught his immediate attention perhaps at last he was accepting his true role graves appeared in the cabin door with a familiar sealed envelope guardboat sir he darted a glance at herons commander sailing orders i expect bolitho nodded carry on mr graves i will inform you directly the lieutenant hesitated this letter was delivered also sir it was small and the handwriting was almost hidden by a seal office of the military government as the door closed farr asked thickly graves no bloody relative of our admiral i trust bolitho grinned with rodney in the west indies and further restricted by bad health the command ob american waters came under the flag of rearadmiral thomas graves lacking the wisdom of rodney the hardwon respect of hood he was looked upon by most of the fleets officers as a fair but cautious commander he believed utterly in the rigid rules ob fighting and had never been known to change one jot of their interpretation severyl senior captains had pu down suggestions for improving the system ob signalling between ships engaged in close action graves had said icily according to the many stories circulating amongst the fleet my captains know their function that should be enough for any man bolitho replied no perhaps it would be better if he were we might know more of what is happening farr stood up and belched good wine better company ill leave you to yer sealed orders if all the written despatches from all the admirals in the world was laced together wed have enough to cover the equator an thats a fact gods teeth i sometimes think we choke on paper he shambled out of the cabin refusing bolithos offer to see him over the side by saying if i cant manage on me own by now then its time i was weighted with a pair of roundshot and dropped overboard bolitho settled down at the table and slit open the canvas envelope although his eyes rested mainly on the smaller one the orders were briefer than usual being in al respects ready for sea his britannic majestys sloopofwar sparrow would weigh and proceed at the earliest convenience the following day she would carra out an independent patrol eastward to montauk point at the top of long island and thence via block island to the approaches of newport itself he contained his rising excitement with some difficulty and made himself concentryte on the sparse requirements of the patrol he was not to become involved with enemy forces other than at his own discretion his eye rested on the last words how they reminded him of colquhoun so brief yet concealing the very precariousness of his own position should he act wrongly but here at last was something direct to carry out not merely harrying blockaderunners or seeking some sly privateer this was french territory the fringe of the second greatest seapower on earth beneath the flag captains scrawling signature he saw that rearadmiral christie had added his own how typical of the man a sign of his trust and the extent of his arm he stood up and rapped on the skylight midshipman of the watch he saw bethunes face above him and called ma compliments to the first lieutenant i would like to see him at once he paused i thought you were on watch earlier bethune dropped his eyes aye sir that is true but bolitho said quietly in future you will take your watches as laid down i suppose mr fowler should have been on duty i promised him sir bethune looked uneasy owed him a relief very well but remember my orders ill have no retired officers in this ship he sat down again he should have noticed what was happening poor bethune was no match for the fowlers of this world he smiled in spite of his concern he was a fine one to talk he slit open the second envelope and came up with a jerk against the table my dear captain i would be so pleased if you could dine with us this evening i feel wretched at this inexcusable delay and hope for instant forgiveness as you read this letter i am watching your ship through ma uncles telescope so that i shall not be held in suspense please show yourself it was signed susannab hardwicke bolitho stood up and winced as his skull collided with a deck beam pausing only to lock his orders in the cabin strongbox he hurried out of the door and up the companion ladder her uncles telescope so general blundell was here too it would explain the sentries at the gates but even this fact did not depress him he almost collided with tyrrell as he came limping aft his arms spattered with grease sorry i was adrift when you called for me sir i was in th cable tier bolitho smiled taking the opportunity of an empty tier to look for rot eh tyrrell rubbed his thigh aye but shes fine sound as a bell bolitho walked to the nettings and shaded his eyes against the fierce glare the distant houses were almost lost in haze their outlines quivering and intermingling as it they were melting in the heat tyrrell watched him questioningly something wrong sir bolitho beckoned to bethune and took his telescope it was no better the one trained upon sparrow was probably a huge affair very slowly he raised his arm and waved it from side to side behind him tyrrell and bethune stood stockstill each as puzzled as the other by the captains strange behaviour bolitho turned and saw tyrrells face er i was just waving to someone tyrrell looked past him at the anchored ships and busy harbour craft i see sir no you dont jethro but no matter he clapped his shoulder come below and i will tell you what we are about you will be in charge of the ship this evening fo i am dining ashore a slow grin spread across the lieutenants face ohs i see sir they were examining a chart and discussing the sailing orders when they heard bethune yell avast there stand still that man then there was a splash and more shouts along the gun deck bolitho and tyrrell hurried to the quarterdeck again to find bethune and most of the unemployed hands lining the larboard gangway or clinging to the shrouds a man was in the water arms striking out stronglys his dark hair glossy in the spray and sunlight bethune panted it was lockhart sir he dived overboard before i could stop him tyrrell murmured a good seaman never any trouble i know him well bolitho kept his eyes on the swimmer a colonist aye came from new haven some years back hes done it now poor devil there was no anger in tyrrells voice if anything it was pity bolitho heard the men near him exchanging guesses at the swimmers success of getting ashore it was a long way to go he had known many deserters during his life at sea often he had found room for sympathy although he had thought their actions to be wrong few men would volunteer for the harsh demands of service in a kings ship especially as nobody ever knew for sure if he would regain his home in safety seaports were full ob those who had returned cripples and men made old before their time in many cases but as yet no one had found a better way of crewing the fleet once presseds most men accepted it could even be relied upon to take others by similar methods the sailors old rule ifim here why not him carried a lot of weight in shipsofwar but this was different the seaman lockhart had seemed nothing out of the ordinary a good worker and rarely adrift for his watch or station yet all the while he must have been brooding over his proper homelands and the stay in new york had done the rest even nows as he thrashed steadily past an anchored twodeckers he was no doubt thinking only of his goal some vague mental picture of house and family or parents who had almost forgotten what he looked like a faint crack came from the twodeckers beakheads and bolitho saw a redcoated marine already ramming another ball into his musket for a further shot at the lone swimmer a growl of anger came from sparrows seamen whatever they thought of the mans desertion or of the man himself had nothing to do with their reaction he was one of their own and the marine sentry was momentarily an enemy yule the gunner muttered that damn bullock should be shot down hisself the bloody bastard the marine did not fire again but sauntered to the end of his little platform to watch the swimmer like a wildfowler who has given his quarry best for the time being or so it appeared then as a guardboat swept round the stern of another twodecker bolitho knew why he had not bothered to shoot the longboat was moving swiftly the oars sending it through the glittering water like a blue fish in the sternsheets he saw severyl marines a midshipman with a raised telescope trained on the seaman yule observed dourly ell not escape now tyrrell said its out of our hands aye bolitho felt suddenly heavy the pleasure of the letter spoiled by this mans despair nobody who had run from a kings ship could expect mercy it was to be hoped he was hanged rather than face the horror ob flogging round the fleet he chilled if he was to be hanged he stared up at sparrows mainyard his eyes desperate there was no doubt where the execution would be carried out even christie would make sure of that an example a warning clear to all aboard and throughout the nearby ships he tried not to watch the guardboat as it swept down on the tinys bobbing head his own friends sparrows loyal seamen would be forced to witness the halter being set around his neck before they and they alone were ordered to run him up to the yard after all they had endured together this sickening act might drive a wedge between officers and men and destroy what they had achieved tyrrell gasped look sir bolitho snatched a glass and trained it beyond the guardboat he was just in time to see the mans lockhart treading water turning to stare either at the boat or perhaps at sparrow herself then even as the boats oars backed water and a marine groped over the stemhead for the mans hair he threw up his hands and disappeared beneath the surface nobody spoke and bolitho found himself holding his breath perhaps like the man who had vanished so suddenly sailors were usually poor swimmers perhaps he had got cramp in a moment he would break surface nearby and the guardboat would haul him on board seconds minutes passed and then at a shouted command the guardboat resumed its leisurela patrol between the anchored ships bolitho said quietly i thank god for that if he had to suffer i am glad it was gently done tyrrell watched him dully thats true he turned with sudden anger on the gunner mr yule clear these idlers off th gangway or ill find em some harder work for their wits to dwell on he was unusually disturbed and bolitho wondered if he was comparing his own fate with that of the drowned seaman he said make an entry in the log mr tyrrell sir tyrrell faced him grimly as a deserter bolitho looked past him at the seamen as they wandered towards the gun deck again we do not know for certain he was deserting mark him as dischargeddead he walked to the hatch his relatives will have enough to bear without the weight of shame also tyrrell watched him go his breathing returning slowly to normal it would not help lockhart he was beyond reach but bolithos order would ensure that his name carried no stigma and his loss would be recorded with those who had fallen in battle in fights which he had also suffered without complaint it was a small distinction but even so he knew that only bolitho would have thought of it when bolitho climbed from his gig he was astonished to find a smartly painted carriage waiting for him on the jetty a liveried negro doffed his tricorn hat and beamed hugely good evenin sah he opened the carriage door with a flourish while stockdale and the gigs crew watched in silent admiration bolitho paused er do not wait stockdale i will return to the ship in a local boat he was strangely elated and conscious of watching townsfolk on the road above the jetty an envious glance from a passing marine major stockdale touched his hat if you says so sir i could come along with you no ill have full need of you tomorrow he felt suddenly reckless and pulled a coin from his pocket here buy some grog for the gigs crew but not too much for safetys sake eh he climbed into the coach and sank back against the blue cushions as with a jerk the horses took the first strain at their harness with his hat on his knees he watched the passing houses and people stockdale even the ships temporarily forgotten once when the coach reined to a halt to allow a heavy wagon to cross ahead of it he heard a faraway murmur of cannon fire it was a fino evening and the steady westerly wind was dry and warm sounds carried easily in such conditions even so it was hard to connect the distant gunfire with the brightly lit houses the occasional snatches of musi and song from taverns along the road some arma battery testing its guns perhaps but more likely a nervous duel between opposing pickets where the two armies lay in watchful readiness it did not take long to reach the house and as he stepped down from the coach he realised there were other guests arriving too again he called himself a fool for imagining he alone would be entertained this evening servants glided from the shadows and like magi his hat and boatcloak were spirited away a footman opened some doors and announced captain richard bolitho of his britannic majestys ship sparrow how different from the reception he thought as he walked into a fine highceilinged room he was conscious of comfort and luxury mixed with an air ob intimacy which had been lacking before at the end of the room general sir james blundell watched his approach in silence and then called gruffly you are an unexpected guest bolitho his heavy features yielded slightly my niece told me ob your arrival he thrust out his hand you are welcome here the general had changed very little heavier perhaps but otherwise the same man in one hand he was holding a brandy glass and bolitho was reminded of his stay aboard sparrow of his obvious contempt for the men who had carried him to safety something of their first meeting must have circulated amongst his friends for upon blundells show ob greeting the room came alive again with laughter and noisy conversation it was as if they had all been waiting to see how blundell would react bolithos own feelings were of course unimportant he could always be told to leave bolitho felt the girls hand on his arm and turned to find her smiling up at him with a nod to her uncle she steered him towards the other side of the room the guests moving aside for her as if she were royalty she said i saw you today thank you for coming she patted his cuff i thought you were splendid just now uncle can be rather troublesome bolitho returned her smile i think i can appreciate that after all he lost a great deal of bullion because ob me she wrinkled her nose i have no doubt he will have recovered it by insurance elsewhere she gestured to a servant some wine before dinner thank you he saw severyl officers mostly military watching him intently envy resentment curiosity it was all there she said sir james is adjutant general now came out here with him after our return to englandl she watched his face as he sipped the wine i am glad i came england is full of woe because of the war bolitho tore his mind from what she had just said ob her uncle christie had already spoken scathingla about the governor and his assistant with blundell involved in controlling the city there seemed little hope of improvement as the girl turned to curtsy to a whitehaired man and his lady he let his eyes devour her as if seeing her for the last time the curve of her neck as she bowed to her guests the way her hair seemed to float across her bared shoulders it was beautiful hair golden browns like the wing of a young thrush he smiled awkwardly as she looked up at him really captain you make a girl feel indecent the way you stare so she laughed i suppose you sailors are so long away from civilisation you cannot control your ways she clutched his arm her mouth quivering with amusement do not fret there is no need to be so serious about it i really must teach you to accept what is there to enjoy what is yours by right i am sorry you are most likely right about me he looked at the marble floor and grinned at sea i can stand upright here i feel as if the deck is moving she stepped back and regarded him searchingly well i shall have to see what can be done about thatl she tapped her lips with a slim fan everyone is talking about you what you have done how you faced that awful court martial and made fools of them it was not exactly like that she ignored him of course they will not mention any of this some are probably afraid you will turn into a wild bloodthirsty seadog she laughed gaily others see in your success something of their own failure a footman was whispering to the general and she added quickly i will have to leave you to your own devices for dinner i am hostess tonight he said oh i thought to cover his confusion he asked is lady blundell not here too she stays in england my uncles habits are those of a soldier i think she is content to keep them well away from her she held his arm again but do not look so sad i will see you later we must talk of your future i know people who can help you put you where you deserve instead of she did not finish a gong boomed and the footman intoned my lordss ladies and gentlemen dinner is now served they followed the general and his niece into an even greater room and bolitho found himself paired off with a darkhaired little woman who was apparently the wife of a staff officer he was not present and with something like gloom bolitho thought he would be saddled with her for the rest of the evening the dinner matched the room every course largers more extravagantly prepared than the one before his stomach had long become used to the sparse fare aboard ship and the varying efforts of many seacooks no one else seemed to find difficulty however and he could only marvel at the way the plates emptied without any apparent break in conversation there were many toasts with the wines as varied as their reasons for drinking them after the loyal toast to king george there were all the usual ones death to the french confusion to our enemies a curse on washington as the wine flowed they became as meaningless as they were incoherent the lady at bolithos side dropped her fan but as he bent to collect it she reached below the tablecloth and seized his wrist holding it against her thigh for severyl seconds it seemed like an hour and he thought every eye at the table must be on him but she was the only one and her face was filled with such desire that he could almost feel her control slipping away he returned the fan and said easy maam there are quite a few courses yet she stared at him openmouthed and then gave a secret smile god what it is to find a real man bolitho forced himself to take another portion ob chicken if only to regain his wits he could feel her knee pressing into his leg and was very aware that whenever she required something from the table she seemed to need it from across his arm each time she lingered over the motion letting her shoulder or breast touch for just a few moments more every time he glanced desperately along the table and saw the girl watching him it was hard to understand her expression when she was so far away part amuseds part watchful his companion was saying casually my husband is much older than i he cares more for his damned office than for me she reached for some butter allowing her breast to touch his sleeve while she kept her eyes on his i expect you have been many places captain how i wish i could take a ship somewhere away from this place and him at last the meal was over and with a scraping ob chairs the men rose to allow their ladies to witheraw even at the last moment bolithos companion persisted with her campaign like a frigate cutting out a ship which was totally outmatched from the start she whispered i have a room here i will send a servant to guide you as she moved from the table he saw her stagger but recover instantly it would take more than wine to break her he thought anxiously the doors closed again and the men moved their seats closer to the head of the table more brandy and some black cheroots which blundell said had come from some damned rascal who tried to avoid his dues i hear you are now on our local patrols bolithol blundells harsh voice reduced the other guests to attentive silence yes sir james bolitho eyed him evenly blundell was well informeds considering he had only received his orders that forenoon good we need a few captains with the will to guard our lifelines what blundells features were crimson from the extent of his dinner these damn yankees have had too much their own way i say there was a growl of approval and someone called tipsily thash th bloody truth shir he shrank under blundells withering gaze bolitho asked quickly colonel foley sir is he still in america he has a battalion under cornwallis blundell seemed disinterested best bloody place for hims too bolitho allowed the conversation to flow around him like a protective cloak he heard little about the war horse breeding and the cost of keeping house in new york the affair of some unfortunate artillery captain who had been found in bed with a dragoons wife the growing difficulty of obtaining good brandy even a smugglers prices bolitho thought of christies summing up two armies he had said how true it now seemed colonel foley whether he was a likeable man or not was one of those fighting for his countrys cause and his life around this table sat a goodly proportion of the other sort spoiled cosseted and completely selfish he wished he could be rid of them blundell heaved himself upright we will join the ladies god help us when bolitho glanced at the ornate french clock he saw it was almost midnight it seemed incredible that time could pass so swiftly but despite the hour there was no lessening in the pace a small string orchestrz struck up a lively dance and laughing noisily the guests pushed and jostled towards the sound of music bolitho walked slowly through the connecting roomss watching for susannah hardwicke and keeping a wara eye open for his earlier companion as he passed a booklined study he saw blundell speaking with a group of men most of whom were prosperouslooking civilians one very tall and broad shouldered stood partly in shadow but the side of his face which was visible in the candlelight made bolitho start with shock then pity it had been scoured aways the skin burned almost to the bone from hairline to chin so that it had the appearance of some grotesque mask he seemed to feel bolithos eyes on him and after a quick glance turned his back hiding himself in shadow no wonder he had not joined the others at dinner it was easy to imagine the agony of that disfigurements the torment which had left him so scarred ah there you are she came out of another room and rested her hand on his arm take me into the garden they walked in silence and he felt her dress swishing against his legs the warmth of her body you were absolutely splendid captain she paused and looked at him her eyes very bright that poor woman i thought for an instant you would fall to her oh you saw bolitho felt uneasy she has gone it seems yes she led him into the garden i sent her offl she laughed the sound carrying through the shrubs like an echo i cannot have her interfering with ma captain now can l i hope you were easy with her actually she burst into tears it was all rather pathetic she turned inside his arm her full dress spreading out behind her like pale gold i must leave you now captain but but i thought we were going to talk later she studied him gravely i have plans for your future as i told you earlier did i not i weigh anchor tomorrow he felt wretched helpless i know that silly she reached up and touched his lips do not frown i cannot allow it when you come back i will introduce you to some friends of mine you will not regret it her gloved fingers moved gently to his cheek and neither i trust shall i a servant appeared through the gloom carriage ready missy she nodded to bolitho she said after you have left i will try and clear these dreary people from the housel she tilted her head and faced hint calmly you may kiss my shoulder if you wish her skin was surprisingly cool and as soft as a peach she twisted away from him and called be goods captain and take care of yourself when you return will be here then she laughed and ran lightly up the terrace into the house the coach was waiting for him as he walked dazedla through the shadowed garden and on to the carriageway his hat and cloak were on the seat and strapped to the boot was a large wooden box the footmans teeth shone in a white crescent missy susannah had the kitchen pack some food for you sah he chuckled nothin but the best she said bolitho climbed into the coach and sank against the cushions he could still feel her skin against his mouths smell the perfume from her hair a girl who could drive a man mad even if he was not halfway there already at the end of the jetty he found a waterman nodding over his oars and had to call severyl times to attract his attention wot ship sir sparrow just saying the name helped to steady his racing thoughts before he stepped down into the dory he turned to look at the coach but it had already disappeared like one more part of the dream the waterman was grumbling to himself as he hauled the heavy box down the steps not enough to offend a ships captain but enough to add slightly to his fare bolitho wrapped his cloak around him and felt the seabreeze cold against his face still westerly it would be good to get away again if only to find time to collect himself and examine his hopes for the future a good likeness sparrowp mission to investigate the strength ob french shipping at newport proved to be more difficult than bolitho had expected the passage from sanda hook to the eastern extremes of long island showed nothing but promise for a quick completion and an equally swift return but the weather decided otherwise and in a savage westerly gale the little sloop was driven and battered continuously so that bolitho had to run with it rather than risk damage to spars and canvas even when the wind moderated it took many more days to beat back again and hardly an hour passed without the need to shorten sail or lay the ship on a tack which would take her away rather than toward her goal new york s entertainment seemed a long way behind and bolitho found the reality of driving his ship against wind and tide more than enough to occupy his energy even so he found plenty of time to think about susannah hardwicke pacing the deck hair whipping in the wind his shirt often drenched with spray he remembered their parting the hint of an embrace which he could recall as clearly as if it had just occurred he suspected that his officers knew or guessed what had happened in new york if only because ob their careful silence the drudgery of fighting against the wind the constant demands on every man aboard were eased in part by the presence of their passenger rupert majendie true to his word had arrived within minutes of weighing complete with sketching and painting materials and a repertoire of stories which did more than pay for his keep on board when the sea and wind calmed he would be seen with his pad sketching seamen at their daily tasks or catching them at their relaxation off watch dancing or making small models and scrimshaw work if the weather was less friendla he would disappear below to find fresh scope for his busy hands with only a swinging lantern to guide his pencil or brush he and dalkeith had become firm friends which was hardly surprising each came from another sphere of culture and high intellect with far more to discuss than the averyge sailor at the end of three long weeks and with each day adding to his frustration bolitho decided to wait nq more he called tyrrell to the cabin and unrolled his chart we will close with the shore at daylight tomorrows jethro the wind is still strong but i see no other choice tyrrell let his eyes move across the chart the approaches to rhode island were always a problem with a prevailing westerly wind to be caught in a full gale might mean being driven eastwards again and once within the jaws of the mainland and newport itselb there would be little room for manoeuvre under normal conditions it required patience and understanding but with the french in control of the area it was something else entirely as if reading his thoughts bolitho said quietly id not wish to be caught on a lee shore but if we stay out here in open water we might as well admit failure aye tyrrell straightened his back i doubt the frogsll have much in th way of ships anyway they depend on their batteries to defend themselves bolitho smiled some of the strain slipping from his face good pass the word ill want the very best eyes at the mastheads tomorrow but true to buckles gloomy prediction the next morning was something of a disappointment the ska was clouded over and the wind which made the topsails bluster and crack despite their trim told there was rain nearby and yet the air felt sultry and oppressive affecting the hands as they went to their stations for changing tack the welcome stay in harbour followed by the nervous uncertainty ob thrashing this way and that at the winds discretion had taken their toll there were plenty of curses and not a few blows from boatswains mates before sparrow laid herself over on the larboard tack her plunging beakhead pointing towards the shore once again a grey day bolitho gripped the weather nettings and mopped his forehead with his shirtsleeve his skin and clothing were wringing wet as much from sweat as from flying spray only majendie seemed content to remain on decks willingly his pencil busy his thin body and jutting beard dripping with moisture land ho fine on the weather bow bolitho tried not to show his satisfaction and relief with the dull visibility and blustery wind you could not be too secure with mere calculations he looked up at the masthead pendant the wind had backed slightly he stared at the pendant until his eyes watered there was no doubt about it good for a steady approach not so comforting if they had to turn and run bring her up a point mr buckle aye aye sir buckle dabbed his face with a handkerchief before passing his orders he would be well aware of the difficulties bolitho thought there was no sanity in worrying him further to majendie he said i hope you are getting it all down you will make your fortune when you return to england buckle yelled nor noreast sir full an bye very good hold her so bolitho walked a couple of paces and thought of the girl in new york what would she think of him nowt crumpled and soaked to the skin his shirt more patches than original cloth he smiled to himself no seeing majendies pencil as it recorded his mood tyrrell limped up the deck and joined him by the nettings i reckon that newport is bout five miles off the starboard bow sir he looked up with surprise as a shaft of watery sunlight played across the bucking hull like a lantern beam hell you can never tell in these waters deck thar ships at anchor to the noreast tyrrell rubbed his hands frogs may be assembling a convoy our inshore squadronll catch em if we carra th word fast enough the lookout yelled again six no eight sailotheline sir graves staggered from the rail as sparrow lurched sickeningly into a deep trough the mans mad he spluttered as spray burst above the nettings and cascaded over him like hail e couple of frigates at most if you ask me bolitho tried to ignore the buzz of speculation and doubt around him de grasse had a powerful fleet in the west indies that was well known his subordinates de barras who commanded at newport had no such strength his usefulness was placed in frigates and smaller craft and in quick forays against british coastal trade de barras had made one attempt to challenge the new york forces off cape henry earlier in the years but the action had been desultory and ineffective he had retired to his defences and had remained there he said aloft with you mr graves tell me what you see graves hurried to the shrouds muttering that fool cant be shipsoftheline cant be bolitho stared after him graves was acting very strangely it was as if he dreaded what he might discover afraid no that seemed unlikely he had been aboard long enough to know the risks and rewards of the game deck there it was another seaman clinging high above the mizzen yard sail on the larboard quarter damn tyrrell snatched a telescope and hurried with it to the taffrail mist and spray the distance made worse by sparrows drunken motion it took time to find the newcomer tyrrell snapped frigate no doubt sir bolitho nodded the other ship was clawing close inshore coming around the jutting headland with every available sail set to the wind buckle cupped his hands stand by to come about belay that bolithos voice held the master motionless we have got this far let us see what there is to see and then run graves came lurching from the gangway his shirt torn from his rapid descent he gasped he was right sir eight of the line maybe two frigates and a whole clutter of supply ships anchored closer in bolitho thought of his talk with farr at sandy hooks his own reaction at seeing the british twodeckers nearby waiting he had thought but for what and were these frenchmen doing likewise tyrrell said cant be none of de grasses ships sir our patrols even blind ones wouldve seen em bolitho met his stare i agree its a gathering for something we must inform the admiral directly buckle shouted frigate closing fast sir less than three miles by my reckoning bolitho nodded very well run up french colourss and prepare to come about the flag rose swiftly to the gaff to be greeted by an immediate blast of cannon from the frigates forecastle bolitho smiled grimly he is not deceived so hoist our own if you please buckle crossed to bolithos side his features screwed tight with worry i think maybe we would wear ship sir that frenchmanll be up to us afore we knows it otherwise bolitho shook his head we would lose too much time the frigate might chase us all the way to nantucket or run us aground he swung on graves clear away the bowchasers load but do not run outl he clapped him on the forearm seeing him start with alarm lively man or mr frenchmanll be aboard for grog men scampered wildly to their stations some pausing only to peer over the hammock nettings at the other ship which was driving purposefully towards the larboard quarter she was much nearer but in the bursting spray her hull was almost lost to view only her bulging courses and topsails displayed her captains eagerness to do battle ready about bolitho had his hands on his hips as he peered aloft at the slashing pendant stand by on the quarterdeck put the helm down he felt the deck stagger and wondered how sparrow would appear to the enemy running preparing to fight he almost fell as the ship heeled and tilted still further to the thrust of sail and rudder helm alee sir buckle added his own weight to the wheel headsails flailing about like mad things yards bending to the contest between braces and booming canvas it was a picture of confusion as sparrow heeled sickeningly round into the wind the sea surged up and over the beakhead and men fell cursing and sprawling some being washed into the gun deck scuppers like corpses majendie clung to the nettings his pad already sodden with spray as he stared transfixed at the sloops wild turn across the wind tyrrells voice rose above the pandemonium like a trumpet braces there heave my lads bosun drive em hard today bolitho tried not to watch his ships torment but concentryted instead on the frigate as sparrow swung and plunged round on to her new tack the wet sails thrusting her over until the lee gangway was awash he saw the enemys topmasts appear suddenly above the starboard bow barely a mile between them but the violent turn had had the desired effect instead ob closing comfortably on sparrows larboard quarter she now lay across the opposite bow and on a dangerousla converging tack starboard chaser bolitho had to repeat the orde before young fowler heard him and scurried forward to find graves he yelled at tyrrell he must be made to think we are going to fight faintly from forward he heard the squeal of chocks as the gun crew hauled the thirtytwopounder to its port it would not be easy for them with the ship lying hard over it would be like dragging it uphill fire the smoke whipped inboard above the forecastle as the bowchaser roared its challenge at the enemy nobody reported a fall of shot and at such an angle it was likely the ball had passed clean above the other ship bolitho felt his jaw tighten into a grin the enemys forecourse was being brailed up her topgallants disappearing as if by remote hand as they shortened sail to fight the impudent sparrow fire again the gun hurled its heavy ball into the murka confusion of sea and drifting spume bolitho looked at buckle stand by he strode to the rail and touched tyrrells arm get the forecourse on her hands aloft and loose tgallants tis time for a little prudence as the great foresail billowed and then hardened to the wind bolitho felt the hull steady and hold firm to its thrust right above the deck the topmen were busa releasing the topgallant sails so that as he peered aloft the mainmast seemed to be bending forward like a tree in a storm when he turned towards the french frigate again he saw that his plan had worked well she was trying to reset her foresail but the momentary pause to present her broadside had cost her dearly she was plunging past the sparrows quarter a full three cables clear by the time she had regained her control of wind and tack she would be well astern also sparrows sudden manoeuvre had now given her the windgage a ripple of flashes spouted from the frigates side balls plunged into the sea nearby although with so many whitehorses on each beam it was hard to tel shot from spray overhead a ball whined between the masts and a seaman fell from the mainyard hitting the sea alongside without surfacing until he was far astern majendie said hoarsely the poor fellow god rest his soul bolitho nodded aye that was bad luck he stared along the gun deck where his men worked like demons to retrim the yards and secure halliards which were swollen with damp hardly one of them had looked up as the man had fallen later perhaps they would mourn but maybe like himself they were thanking god that sparrow had answered their calls had not scorned their efforts to drag her into the wind and risk demasting or crippling her to lie an easy prize under the enemys guns steer due south mr buckle we will gain some room before we attempt to wear buckle gazed astern the frigate was going abouts the heart gone from her original challenge there he goes god rot him buckle grinned at his helmsmen thought we were going to surrender without a fightb did he majendie watched bolithos strained face mana would have done captain even i a landsman know you were badly matched bolitho forced a smile but we did not fight ma friend he glanced briefly astern not this time he shut the picture of the failing topman from his mind it was to be hoped he died instantly to see his ship sailing on without him would make his last moments on earth worse than death itself now fetch mr graves and the lookouts we will put all our information together he caught majendies arm as a deep plunge all but threw him down the quarterdeck ladder steady there i may want you to make some sketches for the admiral it seems the fashionable thing to do these days when at last he was satisfied with sparrows course and trim he walked aft and looked for the land but it was lost from view and he guessed that rain covered the headland and the frigate which had so nearla caught them in a trap he stripped off his shirt and mopped his neck and chest with it majendie watched him and then peered glumly at his sodden pad that he decided would have been the best sketch of all bolitho read carefully through his prepared report and then thrust it into an envelope stockdale stood beside the table a candle and wax ready to seal it now that it seemed there was nothing more to add bolitho leaned back and stretched his arms for two whole days they had fought their way southwest losing sight of land and intent only on gaining advantage over the wind tacking back and forth for hours at a time to record but a few miles in actual progress it had been hard work for everyone but now that the wind had decided to back still further sparrow had at last been able to turn towards the mainland with luck they would anchor at sandy hook tomorrow he glanced at the open log book and smiled it was sobering to realise that in the time it had taken to reach newport fight the adverse weather and return to sandy hook by this frustrating and delaying method he could have sailed his ship clear across the atlantic to falmouth with days to spare will i seal it now sir stockdale watched him patiently i think so he closed his eyes memorising the statements he had obtained from graves and the lookouts they differed in small details but one thing was clear it seemed more than likely to expect a combined francoamerican attack on new york and soon he found some satisfaction in the fact that if the weather had delayed his swift return then it would equalla hamper the enemy deck there sail on th weather bow bolitho pushed stockdales candle aside laterl then he hurried from the cabin because of the sparrows need to gain advantage from the wind they had driven far to the southwest now having at last found the winds favour the compass pointed northwest by north with sandy hook some ninety miles ahead the afternoon was hot but clear and even from the deck it was possible to see the small pyramid of canvas to show that the other vessel was standing on a converging tack bring her up a point steer norwest he took a glass from bethune and steadied it above the nettings the masthead called brigantine sir he looked at tyrrell ours probably it was the only sail they had sighted since narrowla avoiding action with the french frigate it was always good to meet a friendly ship and he would pass some of his news across to her in case she was making for the north and might pass too close to the enemys squadron at newport with the wind blowing keenly it did not take long for both ships to draw near one another he intends to pass to leerd bolitho raised the glass again brigantines were untidy looking ships squarerigged on the foremast and with a schooners foreandaft sail on the main they appeared illdesigneds but were known capable of outdistancing even a frigate under good conditions bolitho said signal her to heave to i will speak with her master tyrrell said anyway shes english no doubt about that flags soared up the newcomers yards and broke to the wind bethune shouted shes the five sisters sir he fumbled with his book while fowler stood a little aparts his mouth set in an expression of disdain shown here as under warrant to the governor at new york thought as much tyrrell frowned law unto themselves and crewed by some real rascals i can tell you he sighed still a warrant keeps em safe from th press and risking their precious necks the brigantine had crossed sparrows bows and was moving steadily on the starboard tack bolitho could see the red and gold flag at her fore the trim semblance of order usually found in a government sponsored vessel she was drawing closer and would eventually pass less than half a cable clear bolitho saw majendie and dalkeith by the nettings the former scribbling frantically the surgeon peering over his shoulder with obvious interest shes heaving to sir the brigantine was coming up into the wind her canvas aback and the big mainsail diminishing steadily as the seamen took charge of it bolitho nodded approvingly it had been well executed luff mr tyrrell i will hail her while she rides under our lee the crash and boom of flapping canvas made any sort of conversation difficult for as sparrow turned closer into the wind and her way was reduced to a crawl every sail and shroud seemed intent on drowning bolithos voice he held the speaking trumpet in both hands and shouted where are you bound across the short wavecrests he heard the reply montego bay jamaica tyrrell remarked bit off course id say the voice came again we were chased by a spanish frigate yesterday gave him the slip during the night but you might report him for me the brigantine was falling downwind and her yards were moving restlessly to show her master was eager to be on his way bolitho lowered the trumpet there was no point in detaining her longer and he would get precious little thanks for so doing by the new york authorities it was odd to realise that she probably came under the control of men like blundell who knew nothing and cared less for the sea he heard dalkeith murmur by god that captains face ive never seen such cruel burns and know a man to live bolitho snapped give me that glass he snatched it from the astonished surgeon and levelled it on the other ships poop through the black rigging and loosely flapping sails he saw him his coat collar was turned up to his ears despite the heat and his hat was drawn firmly almos to eyelevel bolitho realised that the brigantines captain had not only lost half his face but an eye as well and he was holding his head at a stiff unnatural angle as he trained the remaining one on the sloop so the brigantine had something to do with blundell he could picture them murmuring together in the studys the scarred face half hidden in shadow buckle called worriedly permission to get the ship under way sir were riding a bit close very well bolitho waved to the men on the brigantines deck and turned to watch majendie again he was hanging on the nettings scribbling and shading smoothing out and adding detail even as the five sisters reset her foresail and began to gather way downwind dalkeith grinned not bad rupert i daresay some of our naval companions will assist you with detail ob rigging eh tyrrell limped over to him and peered across his narrow shoulder he seized the pad and exclaimed holy god if i didnt know for sure bolitho strode to his side the picture was of the brigantines poop with officers and seamen caught in realistic attitudes even if as dalkeith had hinted the details of rigging were imperfect he felt himself go cold as he saw majendies drawing of the ships captain distance and scale had wiped away the terrible scars so that he stood out like a figure from the past he looked at tyrrell who was still watching his face tyrrell said quietly you remember sir you were too busy fighting and guarding me from attack he turned to stare at the other ship but after i took that ball in ma thigh i had plenty of time to watch that bugger bolitho tried to clear the dryness from his throat with stark clarity he saw the fury and hatred of battle as if it had been yesterday the sparrows seamen being cut down and driven from bonaventures decks and the privateers captain standing like some detached onlooker calling on him to strike and surrender he snapped put the ship about hands aloft and set tgallants to majendie he added softly thanks to you i thin we may solve a mystery today the instant sparrow showed her intentions and even as the fore topgallant sail bellied from its yard the brigantine also increased her canvas and headed away clear for action sir no he watched the jibboom edging round until it fastened on the brigantines starboard quarter like a bridge in fact she was two cables clear and showed no sign of losing her lead it must be quickly done we will go alongside and grapple tell mr graves to loose off a ball from the larboard bowchaser lively now buckle said grimly were overhauling him sir bolitho nodded tyrrell understood what was happening but so far nobody else had even hinted surprise at his actions to all intents he was chasing a government vessel with which minutes earlier he had been exchanging pleasantries bang the bowchasers black muzzle lurched inboard on its tackles and bolitho saw the waterspout shoot upwards within a boats length of the brigantines side shes shortening sail now buckle sounded satisfied pass the word for mr graves to muster a boarding party bolitho watched narrowly as the other ship began to yaw heavily in a procession of troughs mr heyward take charge of the gun deck mr bethunes accompany the second lieutenant men scampered to the larboard gangway cutlasses bared and some carrying muskets above their heads to avoid misfiring into their companions steady mr buckle bolitho held out his hand and looked up at the yards sails were vanishing brisklys and as the forecourse rose booming and writhing to its yard he saw the brigantine slipping under the larboard bow as if both ships were being drawn together by hawsers steady along the gangway picked seamen swung their grapnels while others scurried forward to fend off the first contact across the shortening range bolitho heard stand away there i command you to keep clear i will have the law on your head bolitho felt his tension easing if he had harboured doubts they were gone now there was no mistaking that voice too many of sparrows seamen had died that day aboard bonaventure for him ever to forget he raised the trumpet take in your sails and bring to instantly he heard the grumble of chocks and guessed the brigantines crew were well able to see the big thirtytwopounder as it was run out again warily and with great skill both vessels slowly edged round their progress through the choppy water falling almost to nothing their seamen taking in canvas and trimming yards in harmony with the change ob rudder it was perfectly done and with little more than a shudder sparrow nudged against the brigantines hull and ground forward before coming to rest with her bowspirit level with the others foremast grapnels flew from the gangway and bolitho saw graves waving his men forward and bethune swinging out on the fore shrouds his dirk seeming too small for so heavy a midshipman tyrrell rested his hands on the rail and said she carries a deck cargo as well he pointed to a large canvas hump below the forecastle booty for the master no doubt even as he finished speaking and as the first seaman jumped out and down on to the brigantines bulwark the deck cargo revealed itself hands tore the canvas away to uncover a sturdy twelvepounder which was rigged in the centre of the deck its bulk controlled by tackles and ringbolts the crash of its explosion was matched only by the shriek of grapeshot as it burst with terrifying impact along sparrows gangway men and pieces of flesh flew in bloody profusion and through the rolling bank ob brown smoke bolitho saw some of them smashed to the opposite side of the deck then came the shouting and from the brigantines poop and main hatch he saw some fifty men charging to the attack he groped for his hanger but realised he had forgotten to bring it from the cabin everywhere men were shouting and screaming and above it all came an increasing rasp of steel the bang and whine of musket fire a seaman fell bodily from the nettings and knocked tyrrell against the rail his leg doubled under him and his face contorted with pain bolitho yelled take charge mr buckle he snatched a cutlass from the dead seamans belt and ran to the gangway his eyes smarted in smokes and he felt severyl balls fan past him one severing a netting like an invisible knife the brigantine stood no chance against sparrows cannon but grappled together like this the fight could easily turn against them he had done this very thing himself and knew the odds he vaulted wildly on to the main shrouds and then saw with astonishment that graves was still below him on the gun deck he was yelling at his men but seemed unable to follow them of bethune there was no sign and he realised that heyward had gone forward to meet a rush of boarders who were trying to climb across the beakhead he slipped and almost dropped between the hullss and then with a gasp he was on the brigantines deck a pistol exploded beside his face nearly blinding hims but he slashed out with the heavy cutlass felt a brieb impact and heard someone scream the poop he thrust his way between some of his men and saw bethune using a musket like a club his hair blowing wildly as he tried to rally what remained ob his boarding party take the poop lads somebody raised a cracked cheer and with fresh heart the seamen lunged aft feet and legs kicked and swayed above groaning wounded and corpses alike there was no time to reload muskets and it was blade to blade at close quarters through the struggling interlocked figures bolitho saw the ships wheel a masters mate standing alone beside it while others lay in various attitudes of death around him to show that aboard sparrow someone had mustered a few sharpshooters in the maintop then all at once they were face to face bolithob with his shirt torn almost to his waist his hair plastered across his forehead and the cutlass outstretched towards his enemy the other captain stood quite motionless his sword held easily and angled across his front close to his face was even more terrible but there was no doubting his agility as he suddenly darted forward the blades came together with a sharp clang sparks flew as they ground inwards until both hilts locked and each man tested the weight of his adversarys arm bolitho looked into the unwinking eye felt the heat ob his breath the quivering tension in his shoulder as with a curse he thrust bolitho back against the wheels witherawing his sword and striking forward in two swift movements again and again strike parry guard the cutlass felt like a lead weight and each movement became an agony bolitho saw the other mans mouth set in a grim smile he knew he was winning beyond the rail the fighting continued as before but above it he heard tyrrell yell from the quarterdeck help th capn for christs sake help him as they circled each other like jungle cats bolitho saw stockdale slashing and hacking to try to reach him but he was fighting at least three men and his bellows were those of an anguished bull bolitho lifted his cutlass and levelled it at the other mans waist he could raise it no further his muscles seemed to be cracking if only he could change hands but he would die if he attempted it the sword flicked out its point cutting through his sleeve and touching his skin like a whitehot iron he could feel blood running down his arm saw the mans single eye gleaming through a mist of pain like some glowing stone the brigantines captain shouted now capn this is the moment for you he moved so quickly that bolitho hardly saw the blade coming it caught the cutlass within inches of the hilt turned it from his fingers like something plucked from a child and sent it flying over the rail there was a loud crack and bolitho felt the ball pass his shoulder the heat so fierce it must have missed him by an inch it struck the other man in the throatb hurling him aside even as the sword made its final lunge for a moment longer he kicked and convulsed in his blood and then lay still bolitho saw dalkeith throw one leg over the bulwark and climb up beside him a pistol smoking in his hand throughout the two ships there was stricken silences and the brigantines crew stood or lay to await quarter from their attackers bolitho said thank you that was close dalkeith did not seem to hear him he said brokenly they killed majendie shot him down like a dog as he tried to save a wounded man bolitho felt the surgeons fingers on his arm as he ripped his shirt into a deft bandage majendie gone and so many others too he looked down at the dead man by the bulwark if he had kept his head he might have got away with the deception but for majendie he certainly would have done perhaps like himself he had never forgotten that day aboard the privateer and once more fate had decided to end the memory in its own way he turned to survey the two vessels there was much to be done a lot to be discovered before they reached sandy hook some of his men gave a hoarse cheer as he walked to the bulwark but most were too spent even to move anger disgust as well as a sense of loss flooded through him as he walked amongst his gasping seamen to think men had died because of treachera and to gain riches for others who remained aloof from blame but not this time he spoke aloud without realising it somebody will pay dearly for todays griefl then he thought of the girl in new york and wondered how he could protect her when the truth became known one mans loss rearadmiral sir evelyn christie rose from behind a table crammed with documents and leaned forward to offer his hand welcome he gestured to a chair good to meet you again bolitho sat down and watched the admiral as he moved towards the stern gallery it was stiflingly hots and even though there was a regular breeze across sandy hook the air in the flagships great cabin was lifeless christie added abruptly i am sorry to have kept you so long but the politics of high command are no area for a young captain he smiled your courage is beyond doubt but here in new york they would eat you alive bolitho tried to relax for three days after dropping anchor he had been to all intents confined to his ship once his report had been spirited to the flagship and his wounded landed for care ashore he had been left in little doubt as to his own position no actual command had been issued but the officeroftheguard had told him that his presence aboard would be in everyones best interests until word from the admiral he began if i have done wrong sir then christie looked at him sternly wrong quite the reverse but you have certainly set a fox amongst the geese this time he shrugged but you did not come aboard to hear what you already know your action in capturing the brigantine five sisters the seizure ob certain documents before her master could dispose ob them far outweigh individual discomfort elsewhere thank you sir he was still uncertain where christies comments were leading it now seems evident that the brigantines masters one matthew crozier intended to pass information either to an enemy vessel or to some spy along the coast that would explain his being so far off courses his excuse of avoiding a spanish frigate but there can be no doubt as to his main mission whilst on passage for jamaica he was to deliver a message for the compte de grasse at martinique my people have examined the despatch most thoroughly he eyed bolitho steadily in it they found full details of our defences and all available shipsofwar deploymentss both sea and military even to the extent of our strength under cornwallis he picked up a document and studied it for severyl seconds one way or tother this will be a year to remember bolitho shifted in his chair how could z privateersman like crozier obtain a warrant to work for the british christie smiled wryly he owned the brigantine it was no doubt purchased by his own side the crew were handpicked the sweepings of a dozen ports and almost as many countries with small vessels in such demand his deception was not so very difficult even on his official voyages he was apparentla smuggling he turned away his shoulders suddenly rigid mostly for those in power in new york may i ask if they are to be punished christie turned and shrugged if you mean general blundell then you may be assured he will be leaving america very soon after that i am equally certain he will be saved by influence and powerful friends at home distance and time are great healers where the guilty are concerned but others will certainly go to the wall and i have been told that the military command intends to use your discovery to rid itself in part at least of the parasites who have lived too long off its back he smiled at bolithos grave features pour some madeira it will do us both good he continued in the same unruffled tone admiral graves is well pleased with you he has sent the schooner lucifer to antiguz to inform admiral rodney of the situation here patrols have been ordered to newport to watch de barrass squadron although as you well know it is hard to see what is happening there in fact everything is being done with the forces available to watch over local waters to see which way the tiger will pounce he took a glass from bolithos hand and asked sparrow is she in good repair bolitho nodded it was still difficult to keep pace with the small admiral my carpenter has almost completed repairs to the gangway and christie nodded briskly in any case that can be finished at sea i want you to take on full supplies for three months at least my flag captain has it in hand he might even find you some seamen to replace those lost in battle i have sent heron to the southrd agains but my other inshore patrols are too well spread for comfort i need every available ship especially yoursl he smiled and you thank you sir he put down the glass newport again the admiral shook his head you will join farr and his heron bolitho stared at him but sir i thought you needed ships to watch de barras christie picked up the decanter and examined it thoughtfully i may do so later but for the present i want you out of sandy hook away from those who will try to bring you down you have made enemies by your actions as i said just now you are no match for the devious ways of politics i am prepared to take that risk sir i am not christies voice was hard like it had been at the court martial in this very cabin to yous your ship and her affairs are paramount but i must think on a wider scope and my superiors wider still if it is thought best for you to lead my whole squadron against de barras then that is how it will be and if your ship must be sacrificed like a tethered animal in a snare then that too will be ordered he relented forgive me that was unpardonable he waved one hand above his charts the enemy is powerful but not so that he can attack everywhere at once he can strike against new york for deprived of it we have nq pretence at government in america or he can turn his iron on general cornwalliss army in the field for without that we are just as pointless either way there will be a battle and i believe that a sea fight will decide our course and that of history for years to come feet pounded overhead and bolitho heard the bark of commands the scrape of tackles and blocks even the old parthian was preparing to sail to show her readiness for whatever the enemy intended bolitho stood up when can i expect my orders sirt before sunset i would advise you to contain yours er other interests until some later date he proffered his hand the heart is a fine thing but i would prefer you to rest your judgements on the brain bolitho walked out to the sunlight his mind buzzing with all christie had said and the greater part which he had left unspoken it was all so unfair a sailor stood to his gun in battle until told otherwise or he struggled aloft in a shrieking gale frozen with icy spray and scared half to death but he obeyed it was the way ob things or had been in bolithos experience until now yet blundells kind ignored such distinctions could and did use their personal authority for gain even when the country was fighting for its life no wonder those like crozier could prosper and achieve more results than an army of paid spies crozier had been doing his duty in the only way he knew by ignoring the dangers blundell had committed little better than treason he stopped by the entry port and stared at the waiting gig with sudden andiety so why had he not told christie of croziers presence in blundells houset there would have been no hiding from conspiracy had that piece of news been released he swore under his breath and signalled to stockdale fool fool perhaps he should have told her first to allow her time to disassociate herself from her uncles affairs the flag captain joined him by the port i have had the water hoys sent over to sparrow another lighter will be alongside within the hour if your people turn to with a will you should have all the stores aboard before dusk bolitho eyed him curiously such calm assuranceb yet this captain had not only his own ship and the whims of an admiral to consider he must concern himself with the needs of every officer and man in the squadron he was jolted by his discovery it was like seeing christies charts on the cabin table to all but himself sparrow and her company were just a tiny part of the whole he doffed his hat to the shrill calls and shining bayonets and clambered down to the gig he said nothing as the boat pulled lustily across the anchorages and stockdale for once seemed content to leave him in peace he was in his cabin with lock studying the latest return of ships stores when graves entered to announce the arrival of another hoy carrying fresh water as the purser scuttled away to watch over the casks before they were lowered into the hold bolitho said was meaning to have a word with you mr graves he saw the lieutenant stiffen the way his fingers locked into his coat poor graves he looked like an old mans and even his tan could not hide the shadows under his eyes the pinched lines at each side of his mouth how did you begin to ask an officer if he was a coward he added are you troubled about something graves swallowed hard my father is dead sir some weeks back i just received a letter i am sorry to hear that mr graves bolitho watched his face with sudden compassion it is harder to bear when you are out of reach as we are yes graves did not even blink he had been er ill for some while the door swung open and tyrrell limped noisily into the cabin he did not appear to see graves as he exclaimed by god capn ive had news he leaned on the table all his excitement and pleasure welling out of him in an uncontrollable flood my sister shes safe an well i met a man who was a trapper in th county he said shes living with our uncle thats about twenty mile to th north of our old farmstead he grinned widely safe i still cant believe im awake he turned and saw graves for the first time oh hell im sorry forgot myself with th fair excitement of it all graves was staring at him glassily and his fingers had screwed his coat into two tight balls tyrrell asked whats wrong you sick o something graves muttered i must go if youll excuse me sir he almost ran from the cabin bolitho stood up it was good news jethro he looked at the open door i am afraid graves just brought some of a sadder note his father tyrrell sighed im sorry i thought maybe it was something i said in what way tyrrell shrugged no matter he was once in hopes of courting my sister he smiled at some secret memory it all seems a long way back now bolitho tried not to think about graves s stunned expression one day youll be able to join your sister again i am very glad for you tyrrell nodded his eyes dreamy aye one day he nodded more firmly i dont feel quite so lost any more midshipman fowler stepped neatly over the coaming and removed his hat the lighterman brought you a letter sir his lisp was very pronounced he insisted i give it to you myself thank you bolitho held it in his fingers like the other one which he had locked in his strongbox her own hand he opened it quickly and then said ill be ashore for an hour maybe longer call away my gig fowler ran from the cabin his sharp voice calling for the boats crew tyrrell asked quietly is it wise sir what the hell do you mean by that bolitho swung towards him caught off guard by his question tyrrell frowned i met severyl people when i was ordering some new cordage sir its well known all over new york what youve done most are laughing fit to burst that your action has unmasked these bloody scabs and traitors but some think youll be in real danger while youre here therell be plenty more quaking in their beds wondering what you discovered an when th soldiers are going to bang on their door bolitho dropped his eyes im sorry about my anger but have no fear ive no intention of parading my back for the benefit of that sort tyrrell watched him as he snatched up his hat and fretted impatiently for fitch to adjust his swordbelt then he said ill rest easier when were at sea again bolitho hurried past him and that will be tonight ma cautious friend so stir yourself and watch over the provisions he smiled at tyrrells concern but beware there may be an assassin hiding in the salt beef tyrrell saw him over the side but remained by the rail for a long while despite the sun and the pain in his thigh there was a small carriage waiting for bolitho at the end of the jetty it was a shabby affair and not in the least like the one which had carried him to the generals residence but the driver was the same negro and as soon as bolitho was inside he cracked his whip and urged the horses into a brisk trot they rattled through severyl narrow streets and then out into a quiet road which was lined by sturdy houses most of which seemed to be occupied by some of the citys refugees the buildings had lost their facade ob wellbeing and where there had been gardens there were piles of discarded boxes and sorrylooking vehicles at many of the windows he saw women and children staring out at the road below they had the lost look of uprooted people with little to do but wait and hope the coach wheeled through a pair of sagging gates and towards another such house except that this one was empty its windows bare in the sunlight like blind eyes for an instant he recalled tyrrells warning but as the coach slid to a halt he saw the girl beside the house her gown reflected in a partly overgrown pond he hurried towards her his heart pounding in time with his shoes i came as fast as i could he took her hands in his and studied her warmly but why must we meet here she tossed her head throwing the hair from her shoulder in the way he had remembered in the weeks he had been away it is better so i cannot bear the watching eyes the sneers behind my back there was little emotion in her voice but we will go inside now i must speak with you their shoes rang hollowly on the bare boards it had been a fine house but now the plaster was flaking and the walls were heavy with cobwebs she walked to a window and said my uncle is in serious trouble but i expect you know he was perhaps foolish but no more than many here bolitho slipped his hand beneath her arm i do not want you to be involved susannah his insistence or the use of her name made her turn and face him but i am involved as you put it no the smuggling and other offences could have had nothing to do with you nobody would ever believe it she stared at him calmly nor does it matter but one hint of treason would ruin my uncle and all connected with him she gripped his arm that mans crozier have you spoken of his presence at our house please i must know for if you remain silent all may yet he well bolitho turned away believe me i can save you from that your uncle will be sent to england there is no reason why you cannot remain here here she stood back from him what use is that ii thought given time you might see your way to becoming my wife in the empty room his words seemed to come back to mock him marry you she brushed her hair from her forehead is that what you thought yes i had cause to hope he watched her despairingly you hinted that she replied sharply i hinted no such proposals captain if things had gone as i had planned well then maybe he tried again but nothing need change for us she continued as if he had not spoken i did think that with some help from my friends you might one day amount to something a position in london perhaps even a seat in parliament all is possible if the will is there she lifted her eyes to his face again did you really expect me to marry a seaofficer live from day to day waiting for one ship after the other to drop anchor there are other lives beyond your miserable service captain it is my life he felt the walls closing in on him the air forced from his lungs as if he was drowning the path of duty she walked to the window and looked down at the carriage you were a fool to think of my sharing such an existence an even bigger one if you continue to do so she turned easily her eyes flashing theres more to living than catching some poor smuggler in the kings name bolitho said i did not tell of crozier being with your uncle but it is certain to come out when the authorities have finished their inquiries he added bitterly rats always turn on one another when the pickings are few she breathed out slowly one hand resting lightly below her heart stay a few minutes while i go to ma carriage i have no wish to be seen here bolitho reached out his arms and then let them drop to his sides he was defeated had been so for longer than he had understood yet in the dusty sunlight as she stood watching him her violet eyes holding him at a distance he knew that if there was anything he could do or say to keep her he would use it she moved to the door you are a strange man but i can see no future for you then she was gone her shoes fading on the staircase until he was quite alone he did not remember how long he stood in that empty room minutes an hour when at last he walked down the stairs and into the overgrown garden he realised that even the shabby carriage had gone he crossed to the pond and stared at his own reflection if she had been angry or frightened anything he could have recognised he might still have known what to do there had not even been contempt she had dismissed him with no more thought than if she had been rejecting a useless servant a foot scraped on stone and he swung rounds seeing in those seconds four dark figures lined against the ragged bushes easy capn one of them had a drawn sword and he saw the others were also well armed theres no sense in strugglin bolitho backed up to the pond his fingers on his hanger another of the men chuckled aye thats rights capn somewhere for usn to hide yer corpse when weve done with you most considerate eh lads bolitho remained quite still he knew it was useless to bargain with any of them they had the looks ob professional criminals men who worked for a fee no matter what the final cost might be to them he was suddenly very calm as if their arrival had driven away his other despair like a cold wind then ill take a couple with me he snatched out his hanger and waited for them to attack two carried pistols but there were probably military patrols nearby and a shot might bring them running steel clashed with steel and he saw the leaders grin fade to an intent frown as they locked blades together he ducked as one man struck at his necks twisted his hanger and slashed him across the faces hearing him scream as he tumbled back into the bushes damn you you bloody bastard another dived forward his sword sweeping under bolithos guard but it glanced from his belt buckle and he was able to thrust him aside with the hilt catching him on the jaw with such force it almost tore the hanger from his grip the garden swam in a mist of pain as something struck him savagely on the forehead and he realised that one of them had hurled a stone he hit out with the hanger but felt it pass through air someone laughed and another called hoarsely now arry in the guts feet pounded through the shrubs and bolitho was pushed aside by someone in a blue coat who shouted at em lads cut em down swords grated and sparked and a body rolled thrashing into the pond the blood staining the surface like red weed bolitho lurched to his feet realising that heyward and tyrrell were driving the two attackers against the house while dalkeith stood watchfully nearby his beautiful pistols shining in the sunlight heyward brought his man to his knees and jumped back to let him roll silently on to his face and stay there the sole survivor threw down his heavy sword and yelled quarter quarter tyrrell swayed awkwardly on his crippled leg and said harshly quarter be damned the sword took him in the chest holding him to the wall for an endless moment before allowing him to slide beside his companion tyrrell sheathed his blade and limped to bolithos side all well capn he reached out to steady him just in time it seems heyward stepped over one of the corpses someone wanted you dead sir bolitho looked from one to the next the emotion rising to mingle with his understanding tyrrell grinned you see i was right bolitho nodded heavily someone wanted you dead but the worst part was knowing that she had realised his peril and had done nothing he glanced at the corpse sprawled in the pond what can i say how can i find words dalkeith murmured lets say it was for rupert majendie too tyrrell slipped his arm over heywards slim shoulder for support aye thatll do he glanced at bolitho and held his gaze youve done plenty for us an in sparrow we look after our own then together they walked out to the road and towards the sea k mistaken identits bolithe leaned back in his chair and stared wearila at the open log he was stripped to the waist but could feel no benefit in the overheated cabin he touched his mouth with the pen wondering what he should writes when there was nothing to report around and above him the ship swayed and dipped in a gentle southeasterly breeze and he pitied the watch on decks sweating out another day of relentless glare and fierce sunlight even the sparrow seemed to be voicing her protest the timbers groaned and trembled to the motion dried out by salt and heat and through the open windows he saw the carved scrollwork by the sill splitting open the paint flaking away to reveal bare wood once on station north of the little bahama bank he had anticipated being recalled to more active duty within a matter of weeks but like most of his men he had long since given up hope week followed weeks with sparrow and her attendant sloop heron dragging their wearying patrol through july each dawn bringing an empty horizon and every hour tightening its grip on their small isolated existence and now it was august perhaps christie had insisted on three months supplies because he had had no intention of recalling sparrow until the end ob that time maybe they had all been forgotten or the war was over it was as if the whole patrol area had been drained of movement unlike their last visit to the bahama banks when they had taken prizes or had gossiped with lawful merchantmen they had seen nothing their routine varied little usually they kept herons topsails just within sight below the horizon and on a parallel tack swept back and forth well clear ob reefs and shoals with the masthead lookouts of both sloops able to see one another it was possible to sweep an area some sixty miles wide unless the weather changed against them even a real storm would be welcome but the agonising discomfort was getting everyone down not least himself there was a tap at the door and dalkeith entered his round face shining with sweat the forenoon watch had half run its course and bolitho had found it necessary to meet the surgeon at this time every day when he had completed his inspection of the sick he gestured to a chair well dalkeith groaned and shifted his bulk carefully to avoid the glare from the open skylight two more down today sir ive got them below e few days rest might revive em for a while bolitho nodded it was getting serious too much heat and not enough fresh food or fruit lock had already opened the last barrel of lemons after that dalkeith had been carrying a glass of water which he now stood on the table it was the colour of tobacco juice without comment he took a flat bottle from his pocket and looked at bolitho for permission to pour himself a stiff glass of rum again it was one of their little routines although how the plump surgeon could stomach rum in this heat was beyond bolitho dalkeith smacked his lips bettern this water he frowned if we cant get a fresh supply of drinking water ill not answer for the consequences sir ill do what i can maybe we can close with some small island and find a stream but i am not too hopeful hereabouts was that all dalkeith hesitatedim supposed to hold my peace but friendship and duty rarely go hand in hand its the first lieutenant mr tyrrell bolitho tensed what about him his leg he tries to pretend its all right but im not happy about it he dropped his eyes worse im getting anxious i see he had noticed tyrrells limp getting more pronounced but whenever he had mentioned it he had replied itll pass nothin to bite on what dyou advise dalkeith sighed i can probe for more splinters but if that fails he took another swallow of neat rum might have to cut it off oh god bolitho walked to the windows and leaned out over the transom below the sea looked very clear and he could see small darting fish in the rudders frothing wake behind him he heard dalkeith add firmly i could do it of course but it would have to be while he is still strong before the pain and this damn heat gets him down like some of the others bolitho turned feeling the sun across his bared back i was not doubting your ability youve proved that more than enough dalkeith said grimly i was at a fine hospital in london before i left england he grimaced we practised on the poor and worked for the wealthy it was a hard training ground but very useful will you return when the war is over he tried not to think of tyrrell being held on a table the saw poised above his leg dalkeith shook his head no ill settle out here somewhere maybe in america who can tell he gave a wry smile i am afraid that i had to leave england in somewhat of a hurry a matter of honour over a lady i have wondered these three years where you found your skill with pistols dalkeith nodded unfortunately i shot the wrong man his death was considered a greater loss than mine so i caught the packet from dover and eventually two years later i arrived in the indies thank you for telling me bolitho massaged his stomach with the palm of one hand i will see what can do to obtain a berth in another ship if and when we are ordered home the surgeon lurched to his feet i would appreciate that he watched bolitho doubtfully and tyrrell ill speak with him he turned away in gods name what do i say how would i feel if it were me dalkeith rested his hand on the bulkhead until sparrow had completed a slow uproll i cant answer im just a surgeon aye bolitho looked at him gravely and im just a captain midshipman bethune clattered through the wardroom and paused outside the cabin mr gravess respects sir heron has signalled she has sighted an unknown sail to the eastrd very well ill come up dalkeith waited for bethune to go recall to new york sir if so i could take tyrrell to a hospital they have facilities proper care bolitho shook his head i fear not that sail will be from the southrd to be on such a bearing friend or foe we have yet to see he heard dalkeith sigh as he left him and hurried up the ladder to the quarterdeck he glanced quickly at the helmsman who called hoarsely nor norwest sir his lips were cracked in the heat graves reported our masthead has not sighted her yet sir his mouth jerked at one corner and he added quickly could be anything it was an empty comment but bolitho knew it was merely to cover his embarrassment he had seen the growing strain on graves perhaps worst of all now the twitch in his jaw laid bare his inner torment like the mark of some disease very well call the hands and prepare to run down on heron get the tgallants on her and lay her on the starboard tack he saw buckle climbing wearily through the hatchway and called a sail mr buckle maybe itll bring us luck today the master pouted bout time sir bolitho heard the familiar limping step and turned to see tyrrell walking from the larboard gangway tyrrell grinned a sail did i hear sir he shaded his eyes as he watched the men mustering at their stations now theres a thing indeed bolitho bit his lip it made it more painful to see tyrrells new contentment to know what must be done that was if dalkeith knew his trade and he did on the horizon he could see herons sails glinting brightly and knew farr would wait for him to join him to break the monotony if nothing else within the hour the stranger had identified herself it was the lucifer her great schooner sails spread like wings as she ran before the wind the spray bursting above her jibboom in a lively silver pattern fowler was in the lee shrouds with a telescope his small piggy face glowing with heat from lucifer have despatches on board he looked down at the quarterdeck as if proud of his revelation heave to mr tyrrell bolitho watched the mad dash aboard lucifer to shorten sail and put her about before running down beneath sparrows lee a fine little vessel had she been his instead of sparrow he wondered if his life would have been changed to the same extent he saw the haste with which the schooners boat was being hoisted out above the water something acted like a small warning in his mind and he said signal heron captain repair on board aye aye sir fowler snapped his fingers and continued to do so until the flags had broken from sparrows yard farrs gig hooked on the chains within minutes ob lucifers jolly boat odell had come aboard in person and as he removed his hat to the quarterdeck and darted a sharp glance at bolithos bare torso farr climbed up beside him and said cheerfully by god what brings you heres man were you pining for us in antigua odell walked a few paces clear and then faced them the french are out sir for a moment nobody spoke bolitho held the words in his mind yet was also aware of those about him stockdale by the hatchway slightly stooped as if to hear better buckle and tyrrell their faces showing astonishment and more relief perhaps that the guessing was over come below bolitho led them to his cabin the heat and the drudgery of patrol forgotten odell sat on the edge of a chair his features giving little hint of strain at driving his command all those miles from antigua bolitho said quietly now tell us i carried the despatches to the fleet as ordered odell had a quick erratic manner of speaking nodding his head in time with his words it was not hard to see how he got his reputation for being slightly mad a man on a knifeedge bolitho suspected but there was no doubting the accuracy of his report admiral rodney despatched a fleet of fourteen shipsoftheline to assist our forces at new york farr muttered by god thats more like it ive no stomach for our admiral graves odells eyes flashed dangerously at the interruption he snapped rodney has sailed for england he is a sick man hood commands the reinforcements farr was unabashed ah well even better ive served admiral hood and respect him bolitho said let us hear all of it i suspect there is more odell nodded the compte de grasse set sail with some twenty sailoftheline the patrols reported that he was escorting the seasons convoy clear of the islands bolitho said that is quite usual i believe yes but de grasse has not been seen since the words fell into the cabin like roundshot farr exclaimed a whole fleet disappeared its bloody impossible but fact odell glared at him admiral hoods ships must have passed this area well to the eastrd and there are severyl frigates searching elsewhere he spread his hands but of de grasse there is no sign god farr looked at bolitho what dyou make ob that odell said testily i could relish a glass sir i am as dry as a paupers loaf bolitho opened his cupboard and handed him a decanter he said hood will join with graves at sandy hook they will still be outnumbered but can give good account if de grasse chooses to head their way farr said less firmly and hood will show the damn frogs eh bolitho replied his fleet is larger than admiral gravess but graves is senior now that rodney has gone home he looked at farrs anxious face i am afraid graves will lead our forces if and when the time comes he turned to odell who was drinking his second glass of wine do you know anything else he shrugged i understood that admiral hood will examine chesapeake bay while on passage to new york some believe the french may strike at cornwalliss army from the sea if not then new york is to be the melting pot bolitho made himself sit down it was strange to be so moved by odells information for months even years they had expected some great confrontation at sea there had been skirmishes and bitter shiptoship actions in plenty but this was what they had all known would happen sooner or later who commanded the waters around america controlled the destiny of those who fought within its boundaries he said one thing is certain we are doing no good here farr asked are you saying we should join the fleet something like that he tried to clear his mind put odells brief facts into perspective de grasse could be anywhere but it was ridiculous to imagine he had sailed back to france his mission left incomplete without his presence in the indies the british would be able to throw every ship and man into the fight for america and de grasse was astute enough to know his own value he moved to the table and pulled a chart from its rack it was close on seven hundred miles to cape henry at the mouth of chesapeake bay with the wind remaining friendly they could make landfall in five days if admiral hoods ships were lying there he could request further orders sloops would be more than useful for searching close inshore or relaying signals in a fleet action bolitho said slowly i intend to head north to the chesapeake farr stood up and exclaimed good im with you odell asked are you taking full responsibility sir his eyes were opaque yes i would wish you to remain here in case any ships come this way if they do you can come after us with all haste very well sir odell added calmly i would like it in writing damn your eyes you impudent puppy farr thumped the table with his fist wheres your bloody trust odell shrugged i trust captain bolitho have no doubts sir he gave a quick smile but if he and you are both killed who is to say i only obeyed orders bolitho nodded that is fair i will do it directly he saw the two men watching each other with open hostility easy now right or wrong it will be good to move again so lets not start with disharmony eh odell showed his teeth i meant no offence sir farr swallowed hard in that case i suppose he grinned broadly but by god odell you push me to the limit a glass together bolitho wanted to go on deck to share his news with tyrrell and the others but he knew this moment was equally vital just a few seconds which each would remember when the other ships were mere silhouettes he raised his glass what shall it be my friends farr met his eye and smiled he at least understood to us dick that will do fine for me bolitho placed his empty glass on the table e simple toast but king cause even country were too remote the future too uncertain they had only each other and their three little ships to sustain them with legs braced against sparrows uncomfortable corkscrewing motion bolitho levelled a telescope across the nettings and waited for the shoreline to settle in the lens it was close on sunset and as the dull orange glow withered beyond the nearest shoulder ob land he forced himself to concentryte on what he saw rather than what he had anticipated from his charts around him other glasses were also trained and he heard tyrrells heavy breathing at his side the squeak of a pencil on buckles slate by the wheel within a few miles of cape henry the southernmost cape at the entrynce of chesapeake bay the wind had backed sharply and backed again a full day had been added to their previously fast passage and as they had clawed desperately from a lee shore had fought to obtain sea room bolitho had watched the bay fading across the quarter with something like anger and nows after their long beat back towards the entrynce he was faced by a new decision to lie offshore until dawn or take his chance and thrust between cape henry and the northern headland in what would certainly be total darkness tyrrell lowered his glass i know this entrynce well theres a great middleground which reaches into the bay with care you can pass either side but with the wind under our coattails id suggest trying th southern channel if you stay to leerd of th middleground you can hold mebbe three miles clear of cape henry he rubbed his chin if you misjudge and tack too far to southrd youll have to move lively there are shoals off th cape an bad ones at that bolitho shifted the telescope to watch some dancing red flashes far inland tyrrell remarked cannon good way off bolitho nodded if tyrrell was feeling the strain ob drawing so near to his home territory he did not show it tyrrell continued up beyond york river i reckon heavy artillery by th looks of it heyward who was standing nearby said no sign of any ships sir there wouldnt be tyrrell was watching bolitho just around cape henry lies lynnhaven bay good shelter where big ships anchor sometimes when theres foul weather around no youd not even see a fleet from out here he paused youd have to go inside th old chesapeake bolitho handed the glass to fowler i agree if we wait longer the wind might veer wed be on a lee shore again and lose more time fighting clear from it he turned to look for heron her reefed topsails were still holding the fast fading sunlight but beyond her the sea was in deep shadow show the signal lantern to heron captain farr knows what to do he turned to tyrrell the place is badly charted tyrrell grinned his eyes glowing in the dull light unless things have changed i reckon i can take us through fowler called signal passed sir bolitho made up his mind alter course two points to starboard to tyrrell he added slowly i hate entering any bay like this one i feel more secure in open sea the lieutenant sighed aye th chesapeake is a brute in many ways north to south it measures close on a hundred an forty miles you can sail a fairsized craft right up to baltimore without too much hardship but it measures lessn thirty across an thats only where the patowmack flows into it buckle called course souwest sir very well bolitho watched the nearest headland of cape charles losing its bronze crest as the sun finally dipped behind a line of hills you may clear for action mr tyrrell better safe than sorry he wondered briefly what farr was thinking as he tacked to follow sparrows shadow towards the dark mass of land doubt regret even mistrust you could hardly blame him it was like groping for coal in a shuttered cellar under his shoes he felt the planks quiver to the hurrying seamen the thud of screens being torn down and mess tables dragged clear of tackles and guns that was another difference he had found in sparrow even clearing for action had a sort of intimacy which was lacking in a shipoftheline in trojan the hands had scurried to quarters urged on by the drums staccato beat and the blare of a marines bugle sometimes you never knew men who did not serve in your own watch or division but here it was entirely different men nodded to each other as they dashed to their stations a grin here a brief touch of hands there in many ways it made death harder to accept a mans cries too personal to ignore cleared for action sir good bolitho gripped the nettings and watched the tiny feathers of surf far abeam alter course another point aye sir buckle was muttering to his helmsmen then souwest by south sir hold her steady he moved restlessly below the great spankers seeing a faint glow on the boom from the compass bowl there were already plenty of stars in the velvet sky and there would be a moon on the water in a few hours but by then he must be inside the bay tyrrell joined him by the wheel its a strange feeling my sisterll be no more than fifty miles from where im standing i can still remember it clearly th york rivers th place in th woods where we used to get together as kids he turned and said sharply let her fall off a point mr buckle mr bethune take some men forrard and trim the foreyard again he waited until he was satisfied with the ships head and the bearing of the nearest cape and continued its a funny business all round bolitho agreed after the first few weeks he had not thought much about susannah hardwicke now as he pictured an unknown girl out there in the darkness beyond the occasional flash of gunfire he realised how their lives had become merged tyrrells sister and graves s secret longings for her dalkeiths affair ob honour which had cost him his career and almost his life and himself he was surprised he could still not examine her memory without regret and a sense ob loss when he looked again he realised that cape charles had merged with the shadows a quick glance at tyrrell reassured him he seemed relaxed even cheerful as he stood where he could watch the compass and the set of the spanker overhead but for the treacherous span of middleground they could have sailed boldly between the capes with a comfortable four miles or more on either beam tyrrell said we will alter course again with your permission sir shes in your hands tyrrell grinned aye aye sir to buckle he called steer west by north full an bye then he cupped his hands and yelled pipe the hands to th braces with the helm down and the seamen hauling at the braces sparrow turned her bows towards the land voices called in the gloom and above the decks the paler shapes of arms and legs moved busily about the yards west by north sir buckle peered at the flapping sails as the ship heeled still further close hauled on the starboard tack tyrrell limped from side to side his arm darting out to catch a mans attention or his voice sending another to pass his orders right forward where graves was equally busy right lads belay there he cocked his head as if to listen to the chorus of shrouds and vibrating halliards shes loving it bolitho walked up to the weather side and felt the cold spray across his face tyrrell had come and gone through these capes many times in his fathers schooner perhaps that memory and the realisation that his sister was now safe and close at hand made him forget the purpose of their mission the chance ob danger with each passing minute breakers on the weather bow the lookout sounded nervous but tyrrell called breakers be damned thatll be th middleground his teeth gleamed in the darkness true as a bloody arrow if i do say so myself bolitho smiled at his excitement breakers be damned he had used much the same phrase and tone when he had driven his sword through the man who had almost killed him beside the pond the massive looming shoulder of cape henra hardened from the darkness on the larboard beams and for a brief instant bolitho imagined they were too close that the wind had thrust them further downwind than tyrrell had allowed he dragged his eyes to the opposite side and through the spray and across the deep inshore swell he saw a revolving patch of white the middleground was clearly marked by the swirl of broken water but if tyrrell had misjudged his approach it would have been too late to avoid it tyrrell shouted once saw a damn fine dutchman aground there she broke her back buckle muttered thats bloody encouraging bolitho peered astern i hope herons seen our entrynce shell be fine tyrrell hurried to the side and studied the darker wedge of land she draws less and is better to handle close hauled he patted the rail but sparrow do for me take in the forecourse if you please bolitho pitched his ear to the seas changing sounds the hollow boom of surf against rocks the deeper note ob water exploring a cave or some narrow gully below the headland then the spanker under topsails and jib sparrow crept deeper into the bay her stem rising and plunging across tide race and swell alike her helmsmen tensed at the wheel fingers sensing her will almost as soon as she did minutes dragged by then an halfhour with eyes straining into the darkness and other men poised at gunport tackles and braces the sloop tacked delicately below the cape then tyrrell said no ships here sir lynnhaven lies abeam now any squadron at anchor ours or th frogss would be showing some sort of light to deter an enemy if for no other reason that makes good sense bolitho walked away to hide his disappointment odell had been right to ask for written orders for if bolitho had misjudged hoods whereabouts this badly he could be equally at fault for quitting his proper station in the south a series of dull explosions echoed across the water and one bright stab of flame as if some powder had been accidentally fired he ran his fingers through his hair wondering what he should do next sail on for new york it seemed the only solution tyrrell said quietly if we are to beat clear of the cape then i suggest we wear ship now he paused or anchor bolitho joined him by the compass then we anchor we must make contact with the army they at least should know what is happening tyrrell sighed its hard to think that theres a damn great army out there across our bows poor bastards if they are in yorktown as odell was led to believe then they are well placed but itll be no comfort if they come under siege lets waste no more time bolitho beckoned to fowler show the lantern again captain farr will anchor when he sees the signal the topsails stirred noisily as sparrow turned obediently into the wind her anchor throwing up a sheet of spray like some disturbed waterspirit buckle called easy with that light mr fowler enough tyrrell dropped his voice no matter well have been sighted from th moment we weathered th cape bolitho looked at him it was not difficult to picture some scurrying messenger or a mounted man riding through the darkness to warn of their arrival he felt much as he had done in delaware bay cut off and restricted with only the vaguest idea of what was happening tyrrell said i can take a boat sir if th army is encamped in th town then theyll be well shielded around th next spit of land along york river he sounded suddenly on edge god this quiet disturbs me moren gunfire my grandfather was a soldier used to make my flesh creep with his yarns of night fighting bolitho watched the topmen sliding down to the deck seemingly indifferent to the closeness of land or a possible enemy rig boarding nets and have half the twelvepounders loaded with grape tyrrell nodded aye an ill put some good hands on th swivels too no sense in being rushed by some crazy boat attack he waited and then asked shall go very well take both cutters mr graves can command the second one mr fowler will go with you in case we need any signals made a voice called herons anchored sir but when bolitho looked across the nettings he could see nothing the lookout must have caught a brief glimpse of her reefed topsails as she edged around the cape or the splash of her anchor when she let go tackles creaked and jerked as both cutters were swayed over the gangways before the decks were sealed off in a web of nets that could be left safely to the boatswain not too taut to afford a grip to some daring boarder just slack enough to confuse him to allow a pike or bayonet to catch him before he could slip free men shuffled across the deck and he heard an occasional clink of steel the thud of oars being released from their lashings graves came aft his breeches white in the darkness you know what to do bolitho looked at each in turn mr tyrrell will lead muffle your oars and watch out for enemy pickets graves sounded breathless how will we recognise our own soldiers bolitho could imagine his mouth jerking uncontrollably and was tempted to keep him on board but tyrrell was all important he knew the lay of the land like his own cabin it needed an experienced officer to back him if things went wrong he heard tyrrell reply calmly easy th frogs speak french graves swung round and then controlled himself with an effort ii didnt ask for your sarcasm its all right for you this is your country that will do bolitho stepped closer remembers our people are depending on you so lets have none of this bickering tyrrell eased his sword in its sheath im sorry sir it was my fault he rested his hand on graves s shoulder forget i spoke eh fowlers voice came up from the boats all ready sir bolitho walked to the gangway be back by dawn he touched tyrrells arm how is the pain now hardly feel a thing sir tyrrell stood back to allow his men to clamber into the cutters a bit of exercise will do me good the boats shoved off and pulled steadily into the darkness within minutes they had vanished and a watchful silence settled over those who stood at the loaded guns on either beam bolitho sought out stockdale and said have the gig lowered i may want word carried to heron he saw bethunes plump outline by the rail and added you take the gig and pull round the ship i will signal if need a message passed bethune hesitated i would have willingly gone with the first lieutenant sir i know that it was hard to believe that in the midst of all this confusion bethune had managed to see his choice of fowler as a personal slur he is very young i need all the men i can get to manage the ship it was a lame explanation but it seemed to suffice it was cool under the stars and after the heat of the day a gentle relief bolitho kept the seamen in short watches so that those not on lookout or standing at the guns might snatch a few moments rest likewise the officers stood watch and watch and when he was relieved by heyward bolitho squatted against the mainmast trunk and rested his head in his hands he felt someone gripping his wrist and knew he must have fallen asleep heyward was crouching beside him his voice a fierce whisper boat approaching sir maybe two bolitho scrambled to his feet his mind grappling with heywards words surely they were not returning already they could not even have reached the first part of their destination heyward said its not the gig shes away on the starboard quarter bolitho cupped his hands round his ears above the slap of water alongside he heard oars and the squeak of a tiller a boatswains mate asked shall i call a challenge sir no why had he said that not yet he strained his eyes and tried to pick out the splash of oars amidst the lapping catspaws of the bay it had to be tyrrell returning for he was coming straight for the ship without caution or hesitation a thin shaft of moonlight had made a small rippling pattern across the water and as he watched a longboat glided into it the oars moving unhurriedly before it slid once more into shadows bolitho saw the gleam of crossbelts some soldiers wearing shakos crowded in the sternsheets heyward gasped hoarsely holy god theyre french the boatswains mate whispered theres another one astern of er thoughts and wild ideas flooded through bolithos mind as he watched the boats slow approach tyrrell and his men captured and being returned for parley the french coming to announce that yorktown was theirs and to demand sparrows surrender he moved quickly to the gangway and cupped his hands obi a canot qui val la there was a babble of voices from the boat and he heard someone laughing to heyward he snapped quick recall the gig well catch these beauties with any luck the first boat was already grinding alongside and bolitho held his breath half expecting one of his own men to fire from a corner of his eye he saw a cream of sprays and thanked god that the gigs crew had kept their wits it was sweeping around the stern and he could imagine stockdale willing his men to pull with all their strength heyward came back the signal lantern still in his hand bolitho shouted now even as the first men appeared on the chains and clung uncertainly to the nets a line of armed seamen leapt on to the gangway with levelled muskets while glass the boatswain swung a swivel gun and trained it threateningly there was a chorus of shouts and a musket stabbed fire through the night the ball slammed into the rail and brought a savage fusilade of shots from heywards marksmen glass depressed the swivel and jerked the lanyards changing the crowded boat into a screaming bloody shambles it was more than enough for the second boat the crash of musket fire the devastating hail of canister from glasss swivel were sufficient to render the oars motionless hardly a man moved as the gig tore alongside and made fast and across the choppy water stockdale bawled got er sir a pause and he called again theres a dozen english prisoners in this un bolitho turned away feeling sick he saw dalkeith and his mates climbing down to the boat alongside and pictured the whimpering carnage he would find there it could just as easily have been the second boat and the canister would have carved its bloody path amongst their own people he said harshly get those men aboard mr heyward then send the gig to heron farr will be wondering what the hell we are about he waited beside the entry port as with boarding nets lifted the first dazed men were pushed or hauled aboard the second boatload french and english alike came with obvious relief the french glad to have been spared their companions slaughter the english redcoats had different reasons but their stunned disbelief was pitiful to watch bedraggled and filthy they were more like scarecrows than trained soldiers bolitho said take the prisoners below mr glass to the redcoats he added have no fear this is a kings ship one a young ensign stepped forward and exclaimed i thank you captain we all do bolitho gripped his hand you will get all the rest and help i can offer but first i must know what is happening here the officer rubbed his eyes with his knuckles we were taken severyl days back it was a skirmish with one of their patrols most of my men were killed he rocked on his feet i still cannot believe we are saved bolitho persisted is general cornwallis holding yorktown yes but as i expect you know sir washington and the french general rochambeau crossed the hudson some weeks back to the head of chesapeake bay they have a great army massed around yorktown e musket behind every tree but when we heard that an english squadron had looked into the bay we thought we were relieved i understand a little french and heard the guards speaking of their arrival heyward said hoods ships bolitho nodded when was this the ensign shrugged three days back i have lost count of time bolitho tried to shut out the pitiful cries alongside he knew little french little more than he had used to deceive the boat but sufficient to recognise pleading a man being held while dalkeith got busy with his knife three days back that fitted what odell had reported hood must have taken a quick look into the bay and finding no sign of de grasse had pushed on for new york the ensign added weakly the french are expecting their own fleet that was why when someone hailed them in their own language they what bolitho seized his arm his voice harsh despite the mans condition expecting their own fleet the ensign stared at him but i thought i imagined our ships had gone to fight them off sir no he released his arm i fear that when they reach new york and discover their mistake it will be too late then the army is done for sir the ensign walked unsteadily to the rail all this he shouted across the dark water all for bloody nothing dalkeith appeared on deck and with a brief nod took the officers arm bolitho said take care of them for me he turned away they would be prisoners again very soon unless he could decide what to do buckle was watching him anxiously what about mr tyrrell sir dyou imagine ive not thought about him he saw buckle recoil we will pass the word to heron immediately if she can work clear tonight farr must carry the news to admiral graves there might still be time he saw the purser hovering by the hatch fetch some paper and i will write a note for farr to buckle he added im sorry i abused you it was a fair question he looked towards the land we will weigh at first light and move closer inshore have the sweeps ready in case the wind loses us ill not throw tyrrell and his men away without a fight he remembered the lieutenants words in that far off garden in sparrow we look after our own he added quietly weve all come too far together for that dalkeith crossed the deck as bolitho walked to the taffrail to buckle he whispered whats the captain going to do buckle shrugged something crazy i expect the surgeon wiped his hands on a piece of waste but you approve nonetheless buckle grinned dont make much difference what think does it but i spect hell think of something he added vehemently i bloody well hope so for all our sakes only the bravs stockdale padded across the quarterdeck and held out a pewter mug ere sir some coffee bolitho took it and held it to his lips it was barely hots but cleared the dryness from his throat stockdale added thickly the galley fire was doused so i ad to warm it on a lantern in the shot locker bolitho looked at him was it imagination or were stockdales features growing more distinct in the gloom he shivered more likely he had been too long on deck waiting and wondering yet he could do no good by pacing the deck and going over his ideas again and again it was a kind thought he handed him the mug feel awake now he peered up at the rigging and furled sails the stars were still there but paler that was no illusion where is the wind stockdale considered the question as afore sir nor noreast if im not mistook bolitho bit his lip he had already decided it was so stockdale was usually right but his confirmation did little to help he said rouse the master he is by the hatchway buckle sprang to his feet wide awake at stockdales first touch what is it an attack easy mr buckle bolitho beckoned him to the rail the wind has dropped but still too far northrd to help us the master said nothing and waited to see what the captain had in mind if we are to be of any use we must drive higher into the bay it would take hours of tacking back and forth with little to show for our pains but if we stay here at anchor we can help neither the first lieutenant nor ourselves if an enemy arrives buckle yawned thats true enough so call all hands and run out the sweeps we will get under way and not wait for the dawn buckle pulled out his watch and held it against the compass light hmm itll be a hard pull sir but the current will not be too much against us he walked to the nettings and kicked a shadowy figure who was sleeping soundly on the bare planks up boy tell mr glass to call the hands jump to it bolitho went quickly to his cabin and concentryted for severyl minutes on his chart recalling what tyrrell had told him and adding the information to what he knew already he settled on his plan of action beyond the cabin he could hear the tramp of feet at the capstan the regular clink of a pawl as the cable came inboard he put on his coat and adjusted his swordbelt how strange the cabin looked in the solitary lanterns light cleared for action like the rest of his ship the guns creaking gently behind their sealed ports powder and shot rammers and sponges all within easy reach but no one stood near them for like the remainder of the gun deck every hand would be needed to raise anchor and man the long sweeps the latter had got them out of trouble before this time they might do the same for tyrrell and his men he left the cabin and ran swiftly up the ladder it was lighter there could be no doubt about it e sort of greyness above cape henry and he could see the swirl of currents well clear of the hull he saw the long sweeps swaying above the water on either beam the men hunched around them chattering quietly while they awaited an order from aft heyward touched his hat anchors hove short sir he sounded tense and very alert bolitho strode from side to side watching the ships swing towards the shore the ripple of water below the gangways how does it feel from midshipman to first lieutenant with barely a pause he did not hear heywards reply and knew he had only asked the question to cover his own andiety if the men lost control of the sweeps he would have to anchor immediately even then he might be driven too close inshore for comfort from forward he heard bethunes cry anchors aweigh sir the patter of feet as men ran from the capstan bars to add their weight on the sweeps then glasss voice steady standby bolitho gripped his hands together until the fingers almost cracked why the hell was he leaving it so late in a moment the ship would be aground give way all the sweeps swayed forward dipped and then came steadily aft behind him bolitho heard the wheel easing gently and buckles quiet cursing as he endured the tension in his own style he tried to relax his muscles glass had been right to make sure of that first stroke but it was one thing to know it another to remain aloof in the face of danger to his ship up and down forward to aft the sweeps creaked busily but without undue haste until buckle called steerage way sir good hold her due north if you please heyward removed his coat ill go and lend a hands sir yes make sure we have every available man working those redcoats as well if they have the strength he checked him as he ran for the ladder there is no need to tell the soldiers we are heading towards the enemy mr heyward he saw him grin theyll find out soon enough buckle and a solitary seaman stood at the wheels and bolitho walked right aft to the taffrail without speaking he saw the nearest cape more clearly now the pattern of whitecaps at its base to mark some small cove an empty place when daylight came and heron was seen to be gone his men might question his action and rightly but if their presence was to be ob any use to the admiral then they must learn everything possible the released soldiers had told them much but a lot could have changed since they had been taken he smiled grimly he was deluding himself but for tyrrell and the others would he really have remained here in the bay he heard shouts on deck and someone speaking in french heyward was more than a good companions he was proving to be an excellent officer without further consultation and at the risk of his captains displeasure he had released the french prisoners and put them to work all strong beefy soldiers who had led a fairly comfortable life guarding prisoners they would make a small but significant difference to the heavy sweeps some gulls rose screaming angrily from the water where they had been sleeping as the sparrow moved amongst them at a slow but steady crawl time dragged by and bolitho saw that the soldiers coats were red again instead of black as they had appeared in the darkness faces regained personality and he was able to see those who were standing the strain and others who were being relieved at more frequent intervals to regain their breath a blacker shadow loomed and held firm across the starboard bow that must be the inner side of cape charles he decided with tyrells middleground some distance below it bring her up a point mr buckle he heard the helm squeak we must pass the cape with the mainland to larboard therell not be too much water in the channels so hold her steady aye sir nor by east it is the ship was heading almost directly into the winds and he could feel it on his face smell the land and its freshness in the dawn air but it was more sheltered and he was relieved to see the sweeps were still moving in unison although the actual progress was probably less than a knot he sought out the young ensign and called him aft he arrived panting on the quarterdeck and bolitho said look abeam how near are your outposts the soldier peered across the larboard nettings and raised one arm that bit of land sir thatll he the turning point a lot of sand there we lost some barges a few weeks back when they ran ashore a mile or so further and youll be able to see the mouth of york river just beyond a pair of small islands bolitho smiled i expect youre surprised were heading this way the ensign shrugged i am past surprise sir he stiffened i heard a bugle thatll be our lads he tapped the rail with his fingers his face engrossed then there was a long drawnout trumpet call which sent a cloud of gulls flapping and squeaking from the land he said the frogs always a minute behind our reveille bolitho tried to break him from his mood what ob the americans the ensign sighed they have artillery over the river theyll start firing at first light more effective than any damn bugle bolitho turned towards buckle we will keep on this course as long as our people have strength for it the wind will favour us when we finally go about but i want to get as far above york river as i can he looked aloft and saw the masthead pendant for the first time it was flapping gently astern but showed no warning of a strengthening wind if it got up now his men would be unable to hold the stroke even with tyrrells boat crews it would have been hard without them impossible when he glanced abeam he saw the overhanging spur of cape charles and far beyond it like a thin gold thread the horizon showing its face to the sun which was easing into view parting sea from sky night from day there was a muffled bang and seconds later he saw the telltale white fin of spray to mark where a ball had ploughed into the bay the ensign remarked indifferently theyll neve reach you at this range youve a good half a mile to play with where is the battery the soldier studied him curiously everywhere sir there are guns right round this sector yorktown and its approaches are hemmed in a ring of iron our army has the sea at its back he suddenly looked very young and vulnerable only the fleet can bring relief bolitho pictured farrs heron making all haste towards new york even there he might find hood gone perhaps further still to newport to contain de barras he thought too of odells solitary vigil in his lucifer if the french did come by way of the littleused bahama channel he would need no encouragement to make sail and run he blinked as a shaft of sunlight played across the distant cape and coloured the yards and stays like honey he pulled out his watch tyrrell should have made his contact with cornwalliss pickets and be on his way back to lynnhaven by now by weighing and putting the men to the sweeps their meeting should have been brought forward by an hour at least glass ran up the ladder his chest heaving from exertion cant hold em much longer sir he peered down at the sweeps at their sluggish rise and fall shall i put the ropes end to em sir you will not bolitho looked away there was no malice in glass nor was he prone to unnecessary force it was just that he did not know what else to do tell them another half hour then we make sail or anchor glass shifted awkwardly itd be better from you sir bolitho walked to the rail and called one more turn of the glass lads he heard groans the mingled curses and gasps from those still hidden in shadow its that or leave our people out there to fend for themselves remember it might have been you he turned away not knowing if his words had achieved anything but resentment glass watched critically and then spat on his hands that done it sir better already bolitho sighed the stroke looked as weary as before but if the boatswain was satisfied then he swung round as a voice called boat sir fine on the larboard bow bolitho gripped the rail just the one aye sir bring her round two points to larboard bolitho tried not to think about the missing boat he felt the hull yaw the stroke failing as the helm went over the soldier said quietly no closer i pray you youll be in cannonshot before long bolitho ignored him pull lads come on do your damndest one man fell exhausted from a loom and was dragged away by dalkeith the lookout yelled its the second cutter sir mr graves dalkeith heaved himself up the ladder and stood at the rail i know what youre thinking sir he did not flinch under bolithos cold stare hed not leave you not for anything bolitho looked past his shoulder at a patch of land in the strengthening light he saw tall trees and a round hill beyond they were motionless the sweeps were only keeping sparrow steady against wind and current in a minute she would start to payoff and drift inshore they had done their best it was not enough he snapped damn your eyes mr dalkeith ill not be lectured by you he leaned over the rail mr heyward stand by to let go the anchor bolitho waited while men ran to the call and glass sent others to bear down on the flagging sweeps where exhausted sailors had fallen to the deck he heard a bang and saw a ball ricochet across the water to throw up a plume of spray very close to the approaching cutter the boat was moving rapidly towards him and he could see graves by the tiller his hat awry as he beat out the time to his oarsmen ready sir he chopped with his arm let go even as the anchor took grip and the bull swung carelessly to the cable he yelled withdraw sweeps mr glass get those men on their feet dalkeith stood his ground you cant blame yourself sir he met bolithos gaze stubbornly curse me if you will but ill not stand by and see you torment yourself the cutter was hooking on to the main chains and he heard graves shouting at the men on deck to make fast his lines he said quietly thank you for your concern but there is no one else to blame he made himself wait by the rail until graves had scrabbled aboard and then called sharply lay aft if you please the boatswain can deal with the cutter graves hurried towards him his face twitching violently bolitho asked where are the others he kept his voice very calm but was conscious of his whole being screaming at graves s stricken face we grounded in some shallows sir both boats separated it was the first lieutenants idea a patrol ob soldiers had signalled where we should secure the boats but there was some shooting enema marksmen i believe and then he could feel others standing nearby see heywards frozen expression as he listened to graves s quick erratic account in the darkness we were all trying to take cover lost a man and tyrrell sent word for us to stay hidden in a creek he shook his head vaguely the balls were flying everywhere tyrrell was going to meet one of the officers they knew we were coming apparently their scouts had seen us his mouth jerked uncontrollably we stayed there waiting and then there was more firing and i heard men charging through the brush there must have been a platoon or more did you not think of going to assist mr tyrrell graves stared at him his eyes blank we were in mortal danger i sent fowler to find the others but you did what bolitho reached out and gripped his coat you sent that boy on his own hehe volunteered sir graves looked down at bolithos hand on his coat when he failed to return decided tohe raised his eyes suddenly composedto obey your orders and withdraw to the ship bolitho released his hold and turned away he felt sick and appalled with what graves had done the lieutenants pathetic defiance made it worse if that were possible he had obeyed orders so his crime was acceptable a puff of smoke rose above the nearest spit of lands and he saw the ball drop within half a cable of the ship even now some officer might be ordering up a heavier gun one which would make short work of so promising a target he heard himself say tell mr yule to run out the larboard bow chaser and lay it on that gunsmoke he will fire with grape until i order otherwise it might cool their eagerness he walked past graves without a glance have the cutter manned at once he looked down at the silent seamen on the gun deck i want volunteers for he swallowed as the assembled men moved towards the side as if drawn by wires thank you but just a boats crew mr glass see to it at once to heyward he added you will remain here he did not look at graves if i fall you will assist the master in getting the ship under way understood heyward nodded his eyes filling his face dalkeith touched his arm look sir it was the other cutter or what was left of it even in the poor light it was possible to see the splintered gunwale the few remaining oars which moved it so very slowly on the uneasy water there was a bang and another waterspout shot skyward just beyond it the hidden gun had shifted to a smaller but closer target bolitho flinched as yules crew fired their first shot from forward saw the trees quiver as if in a freak gust as the packed grape scythed towards the drifting smoke a glass he hardly dared to raise it to his eye then he saw the cutter the scars in its side left by musket balls the lolling corpses still propped between the remaining oarsmen then he saw tyrrell he was sitting on the gunwale right aft someone draped across his knees as he steered the boat past the white patch left by the enemys ball he said quietly thank god the bow chaser hurled itself inboard again dragging him from his thoughts his overwhelming relief he shouted mr bethune take the cutter and assist mr tyrrell he looked for buckle get the hands aloft and prepare to loose topsls all exhaustion and dread at graves s report seemed to be fading as men tore to their stations the cutter was pulling from the side bethune standing upright as he urged his crew to greater efforts dalkeith said well sir he got no further one of the topmen who had reached the uppermost yard before his companions yelled deck there sail comin around th eadland bolitho snatched a glass and trained it above the nettings she was standing well out from the bay but was already tacking frantically towards cape henry it was the lucifer odell would be shocked to find no fleet nor even heron at anchor he tensed there was damage to the schooners mizzen and she was handling sluggishly as she tried to beat closer to the entrynce she must have been caught unprepared by another ship perhaps under cover of darkness there was no mistaking the flapping rents in her great foresail the uneven spread of rigging he saw flags breaking to the wind and held the glass motionless while his lips spelled out the brief signal he turned to buckle enemy in sight god amighty mr heyward he saw him swing round from the capstan stand by to cut the cable we will not recover the boats but make sail as soon as our people are aboard he heard a chorus of shouts and when he turned aft he saw lucifer folding her great sails like the wings ob a dying bird she must have risked everything to reach him with her news even to make that one vital signal she had driven too close and had struck the shoals which tyrrell had described so vividly he made himself walk to the rail and look for the boats tyrrells cutter was almost awash but bethune was there and he saw the wounded being hauled across a patch of scarlet to mark at least one soldier in the party severyl more guns were firing now and balls threw up tall splashes in the pale sunlight like a line ob leaping dolphins some of the topmen gave a ragged cheer as bethune cast the waterlogged cutter adrift and headed back towards sparrow bolitho turned towards graves who was standing much as before take charge of your guns he kept his voice formal without understanding why or how he could picture lucifers frail hull breaking up on the rocks and tyrrells shattered boat trying to reach sparrow he could even see young fowler a mere child running through some unknown woods while shots shrieked all about him do your duty that is all ask of you he looked away all i will ever ask of you again he heard the boat grind alongside and saw tyrrell and the others being dragged through the entry ports being clapped on the shoulders and bombarded with questions and cheers bolitho strode towards him and saw with sudden despair that tyrrell was carrying midshipman fowler it must have been his body across his legs in the boat tyrrell looked at him steadily and gave a tired grin hes all right sir he was crying fit to break his hearts an then fell asleep in th boat he handed the midshipman to some seamen worn out poor little bugger he saw graves and added flatly but hes got guts plenty of em then he strode forward and gripped bolithos hands hes not th only one it seems a new voice drawled pon my word i knew wed meet again it was colonel foley a bandage round his throat his uniform in tatters but somehow remaining as impeccable as bolitho remembered him bolitho said i too he looked at tyrrell we are in for some warm work today i fear lucifers done for and we must leave quickly if we are to avoid her fate aye tyrrell limped towards the wheel id guessed as much a cry from aloft brought every eye towards the headland very slowly their yards braced round in the sunlight a frigate and a deephulled transport were passing level with the wrecked schooner bolitho said simply sooner than i thought he looked at heyward we will cut the cable to tyrell he added then you may pass the word to load and run out the cutter and its dead oarsmen drifted away from the side a discarded reminder of their sacrifice bethune hurried aft his face glowing with excitement bolitho said well done ill see you a lieutenant yet despite what you do to the contrary he felt suddenly composed even relaxed run up the colours well show the army were not leaving them to no purpose the cable cut and with her topsails bellying to the wind sparrow tilted round in a tight arc the thunder ob her canvas drowning the gunfire from the trees her seamen too busy even to think beyond their work and the need to reach the open sea by the time sparrow had gone about and settled on her course towards the capes there could be no doubt in anyones mind as to the enemys intentions even as tyrrell reported all guns loaded and run out bolitho raised his glass to examine yet another ship as she rounded the southern headland one more heavy transport and beyond her he could see the billowing topsails of a protective frigate tyrrell said gods teeth a fleet and nothing less buckle called steady as she goes sir sou by west the first transport had already dropped anchor and through his glass bolitho saw her boats being lowered with swift precision the glint of sunlight on weapons and uniforms as soldiers clambered down ladders and nets in a manner which spoke of much practice he shifted his glass to the second large vessel she too was crammed with soldiers and there were limbers on her upper deck and her yards were festooned with heavy tackles the kind used for lowering horses into boats or lighters colonel foley drawled we heard rochambeau was expecting reinforcements it would appear they have arrived bolitho glanced at him what is your mission now if you can get me to new york i have despatches for general clinton they may not help cornwallis but he will be glad to know what is happening here he gave a brief smile i heard that you dealt severely with our old friend blundell not before time he raised one eyebrow you met his niece again i understand bolitho watched the jibboom swing very slightly and settle on the outthrust wedge of headland how could they speak so calmly and detachedly when death lay so close at hand he replied yes she will be in england now foley gave a sigh i am relieved i recognise all the signs captain she wanted you to quit the service and join her train of admirers eh he held up one hand do not bother to reply it is plain on your face as it must have been on mine bolitho smiled gravely something of the sort when she tired of me i was sent to serve under cornwallis a favour as it turned out and you tyrrell stepped back from the rail she almost had him killed foley shook his head a formidable woman indeed deck there shipotheline roundin the cape bolitho felt a chill on his spine as he thought ob odells dash from the south day by day and at each dawn he would look astern at the pursuing ships it must have been a nightmare for every man aboard the boats from the two transports were pulling towards the land now and he could see the hulls deep in the water as testimony of the numbers they carried set the tgallants mr tyrrell we will need all our wind today foley drew his sabre and turned it over in his hands you are not merely running away i take it bolitho shook his head those two frigates are shortening sail colonel they intend to rake us when we attempt to clear the middleground he pointed towards the anchored transports there is our course close inshore where well be least expected foley grimaced or welcome i suspect bolitho looked at buckle when we go about you must lay her as close as you can to cape henry aye sir buckle was peering through shrouds and stays his eyes fixed on the ships bolitho raised his glass again the two frigates were under minimum canvas standing before the wind with some difficulty as they waited for the small sloop to dash past them less than a mile now he watched them narrowly noting their drift the sun gleaming on their broadsides and on the raised telescopes of their officers he snapped how many boats in the water bethune called at least thirty good bolitho imagined the packed soldiers who would be watching sparrows apparent dash for safety e spectacle to drive away their own doubts and fears ob what lay ahead on the american mainland bolitho drew his hanger and held it above his head along the gun deck he saw the crews crouching at the tackles each captain peering aft a slowmatch held ready in the maintop two swivels were training this way and that a seaman squatting on the barricade with fresh canister cradled to his chest curiously as he ran his eyes quickly over his command he was reminded of colquhouns words so long ago when all others are looking aft at you he heard a sharp bang and seconds later the highpitched whine of a ball whipping overhead one ob the frigates had fired a ranging shot but he kept his eyes on the nearest transport as she swung to her cable her high poop towards the beach aboard the frigates the gun crews would be betting with each other how many balls would they get off before the sparrow was overwhelmed by their crossfire or she struck her colours he brought down his hanger with a flourish now the wheel creaked noisily and as men hauled at the braces to retrim the yards sparrows stem began to turn bolitho held his breath watching the frigates slipping further and further down the larboard bows while the nearest transport and then the great spread of oared boats swam across the jibboom and beyond them the land opened up as if to receive their onrushing charge hold her bolitho ran to the nettings his mind hanging on to tyrrells words of lynnhaven bay the depths and currents the dangers and margin of survival buckles helmsmen cursed and spun the wheel against the opposite thrust of wind and sea and as spray leapt above the beakhead bolitho saw the nearest boats careering off course the realisation and horror of his intentions at last only too clear gunfire thudded across the bay and balls whimpered and splashed very near to the hull but the two frigates had been taken by surprise and as sparrow lunged towards the shore bolitho knew that within minutes she would be screened from their fire by the first transport he could feel the madness surging through him like fever and as he yelled down at the gun deck he knew it was infectious saw the men poised at their open ports like halfnaked demons stand by the hanger was above his head again full depression he saw the nearest muzzles dipping towards the creaming water the gun captains dancing from side to side while their men stood ready with charges and fresh shot for the next barrage and the one after that as you bear the hanger hovered holding the fresh sunlight like gold fire the air was blasted apart by the ragged broadsides from either beam as the dense smoke swirled inboard and the gun crews yelled and cheered above the squeak of trucks the clatter of handspikes and rammers bolitho saw the next spitting tongues from forward the double shotted charges smashing into boats and soldiers the whirl of splinters and spray above the decks the braced topsails quivered to each explosion the smoke fanning out on either side in a choking fog while the guns roared out again and again sharper cracks from muskets the metallic bangs ob swivels made words impossible it was a nightmare a world in torment boats lurched into the hull and bolitho felt the deck shake as sparrows stem smashed into a launch breaking it in two and spilling out the overloaded soldiers in a kicking screaming profusion a transport was firing now her upper tier cutting over the scattered boats and slapping through sparrows canvas like great fists a ball burst through the nettings and bolitho heard shrill screams as two seamen were pulped against the opposite side he saw fowler walking dazedly past the dismembered corpses his face set as if in deep thought he noticed that he was snapping his fingers the hull gave another great lurch and below his feet he felt the enemys iron smashing through the gun deck the attendant rumble of a twelvepounder being overturned another longboat lurched down the starboard sides some men firing with their muskets others scrambling over the frantic sailors at the oars balls thudded into the rail and bulwark and a seaman fell choking on blood as one took him in the throat bolitho ran to the side and wiped his streaming eyes to peer astern the surface was littered with smashed boats and drifting woodwork men too some swimming others fading beneath the water under their weight of weapons and equipment foley was reloading a musket and shouting a few less for our boys to fight he leaned over the nettings and shot down a soldier even as he stood to fire at the sloop bolitho strained his eyes towards the shore it was near enough almost too close bring her about he had to repeat the order before buckle understood with blocks screaming and her yards braced round once more sparrow heeled dangerously on the larboard tack her bows seemingly pointed straight at the land and there was the second transport swinging drunkenly across the bow her gunports already flashing and tearing the air apart with shot a ball ripped through the quarterdeck rail splitting it apart like matchwood and cutting down a masters mate who was yelling to the hands at the mizzen braces blood splashed across bolithos breeches and he saw other men falling on the gun deck the protective nets above it jerking with fallen cordage and torn canvas a quick glance aloft told him the masthead pendant was streaming almost abeam they were as close to the wind as they could be enough or too little made no difference now there was no room to go about nor time to change tack tyrrell yelled rake that bastards poop he gestured to the nearest gun captains grape bring them down he stared at bolitho his eyes glazed with fatigues the fury of battle shes coming round he caught a seaman as he dropped from the nettings his face a mask of blood another for th surgeon he turned to bolitho again and then gave a short cry his hands to his thigh as he fell bolitho knelt beside him holding his shoulders as more balls blasted splinters from the deck tyrrell stared up at him his eyes dark with pain sall right he gritted his teeth its th same bloody leg bolitho saw dalkeith stooping and running across the deck some of his men at his back tyrrell added weakly i knew it had to come off now theres no excuse eh then he fainted from the littered gun deck graves watched him falls although his mind was cringing to the noise and the stench of death he screamed run out he thrust at a wildeyed seaman point ready he stared fixedly at the towering sails of the transport as it rose ponderously abeam fire the deck lurched beneath his feet and he saw two men blasted into crimson fragments their screams cut short before they reached the stained planking but somewhere in his reeling mind he was thinking of tyrrell he must be dead god rot him his sister would be all alone now one day maybe sooner than the others realised he would find her take her for himself a gunners mate gaped up at him his mouth like a black hole as he bellowed look out sir for christs sake his words were lost in the grating crash ob timber as the main topgallant yard plunged through the nets like a great tree it gouged into the planking and further still to the deck below as its trailing rigging and severed halliards thundered between the blazing guns graves died his body impaled under the broken spar at the quarterdeck rail bolitho saw him die and knew that the months of patrol duty the storms and the fights had at last broken the yard which they had once fished so carefully after another battle a thousand years ago but heyward was there his voice rallying the gun crews as the anchored transport faded into the smokes her hull pitted with holes from the bowchasers merciless bombardment the wind fanned the smoke aside and with something like disbelief he saw the sheer of cape henry pulling back like a huge door the horizon glittering beyond it in welcome fowler slipped and fell on some blood and sobbed its no use i cant bethune strode towards him you can and you damn well will the young midshipman turned and blinked at him what bethune grinned his face black with powder smoke you heard me so jump to it boy mr buckle bolitho winced as some stray shots shrieked through the shrouds and brought down more lengths of cordage i want you to but the master took no notice he was sitting with his back to the hatchway hands to his chest as if in prayer his eyes were open but the spreading pattern of blood around him told its own story glass and a solitary seaman stood at the unprotected wheel their eyes wild their legs straddled amidst dead and dying bolitho snapped as close as you can lucifers remains will guide you clear of the shoal as sunlight enveloped the sloop from stem to sterns and her yards swung yet again to take her out of the bay bolitho saw the great array of ships coming down from the southern horizon and filling the sea it was a fantastic spectacle squadron by squadron the shipsoftheline appearing to overlap as they headed purposefully towards the chesapeake foley murmured de grasse i have never seen such a fleet bolitho tore his eyes away and hurried to the taffrail there was no sign of pursuit from the bay nor had he expected one the two frigates would be guarding their new anchorage and trying to rescue some of the soldiers who had escaped sparrows fury he turned towards the wheel where heyward and bethune stood watching him we will wear ship directly he saw dalkeith and called tell me dalkeith eyed him sadly its done hes sleeping now but i am confident bolitho wiped his face and felt stockdale steady his arm as the ship pitched heavily to the freshening wind so much still to do repairs to be carried out even as they avoided the oncoming might of france to find admiral graves and tell him of the enemys arrival to bury their dead his mind felt numb yule the gunner clattered up a sagging ladder and barked any spare hands sir i need em for the pumps bolitho faced him get them elsewhere he looked around at the sprawled bodies caught in their various attitudes of death only the brave lie here he looked up startled as from high above the deck he heard someone singing beyond the pitted canvas and dangling rigging to where the topgallant yard had splintered apart before falling to kill graves he saw a solitary seaman working in the sunlight his marlin spike glinting as he spliced a broken stay the sounds of sea and booming sails were too loud for him to hear the words but the tune seemed familiar and strangely sad foley joined him and said quietly if they can sing like that after what theyve done he turned away unable to watch bolithos face then by god i envy you epilogue two days after fighting out of the bay sparrows lookouts sighted the van of admiral gravess fleet bearing down the coast of maryland the occasion was both exciting and bitter for with many of her company wounded or killed it was hard not to feel emotion well ahead of the fleet her signal flags rippling in the sunlight heron stood before the wind a small symbol of what they had endured and achieved together bolitho could remember the moment exactly as with his men he had waited on the splintered quarterdeck while his signals were passed to heron and repeated to the flagship when the reply had been received bethune had turned his face suddenly matured flag to sparrow sir you will lead yours is the honour for an admiral who disliked superfluous signalling admiral graves had done them proudly once again sparrow had gone about her torn sails and battered hull acting like a pointer to the great shipsoftheline which followed obediently in her wake once in sight of the bay and with the knowledge that the french were still there sparrows role had become that of a mere spectator to a battle which was to leave its mark on all who took part a warning to young officers like bolitho a grim lesson to the hidebound who had for so long fought by the book a book which had become outdated by hard experience perhaps admiral graves had expected even hoped up to the last moment that the french had quit the chesapeake or at worst de barrass smaller squadron would be there having slipped past his patrols and escaped from newport some days earlier sparrows signal had put paid to any such belief and the sight ob such a grand array must have filled him with misgivings but if his fleet was inferior to de grasses in both ships and guns he had much in his favour the wind gave him the advantage and as tyrrell had so often predicted the treacherous middleground between the chesapeake s capes was soon to show its impartiality to those who braved it with the british bearing down on the bay and de barrass reinforcements not yet in close company de grasse decided to weigh and meet them in open water an adverse wind and tide the dangerous spit ob middleground soon told him he was unable to leave his protective anchorage as a complete fleet squadron by squadron his ships fought their way around cape henry with lucifers skeleton close by as a warning to the foolhardy or the careless this should have been graves s great opportunity to signal general chase and allow his captains to fall on the enemy before he could reassemble and proclaim his superiority had there been a hawke or a keppel in command there was little doubt in anyones mind that the effect would have been devastating but once again graves faltered his mind grasping the written word of the fighting instructions and seeing no other alternative his flagship hoisted the rigid signal to form line ob battle and it remained flying throughout the action the delay allowed de grasse to assemble his fleet and when the two adversaries finally drove together it was impossible for the rearmost british ships even to engage by evening failing light forced the fleets to disengage and driven by a strong northwesterly both soon lost contact when at last graves was able to reform his squadrons the french had beaten back into the chesapeake they did not leave it again and after further hesitation graves ordered his frustrated captains to sail for new york helpless and beyond reach of the action itself bolitho had watched much of the tactics and guessed far more of what was happening he left the deck at regular intervals to speak with tyrrell in the sickbay holding his hand as he tried to describe the sequence of events he could recall each visit exactly tyrrells face very pale in the lantern light his mouth clenched against the agony and around him groaning or sobbing quietly the others who had suffered and some who were beyond pain tyrrell had said hoarsely thats th army finished he had gripped bolithos hand with some of his old vigour but we did what we could later at sandy hook as sparrow had carried out repairs and bolitho had received orders to sail for england with the admirals despatches and news of the battle the blow had fallen cut off from the sea his ammunition and supplies exhausted cornwallis and his whole army had capitulated true to his reputation general washington had allowed the british to surrender with both honour and dignity but it was a crushing defeat nevertheless couriers who had brought the news of the surrender told of the british military band which led their soldiers into general washingtons camp they had been playing the world turned upside down which gave some hint of what they thought about their situation if nothing else under low cloud and a steady drizzle sparrow weighed and turned her stern to sandy hook for the last time her company reacted to their sailing orders with mixed feelings some mourned old friends whom they had buried at sea or left crippled to await more comfortable transport others were almost afraid ob what they might find in england after so long and there were plenty who turned their backs on america and dreamed only of that moment when they would step ashore in their own country thankful at being spared the pain and despair grateful even to see the leaden sky above the mastheads when not required on deck bolitho spent much ob the voyage alone in his cabin it made contact less painful the losses of familiar faces easier to bear he could remember his last handshake with tyrrell as he had said his farewells at a new york hospital dalkeith had been there too and it had been a sad parting it was still hard to think of tyrrell with one legs nor did he want to one thing seemed certain tyrrel was without despair after this im going home he had said it severyl times i dont know how or when but by th lord ill get there dalkeith had been appointed to an accommodation ship off sandy hook and had added quietly reckon theyll need a good doctor too eh jethro he had given his deep chuckle so heres me hand on it bolitho shivered and pulled his coat more closely across his body it was cold and very damp and the bulkhead was dripping with condensation he glanced at the open log book it was the first day of january another year for all of them he stood up and walked slowly from the cabin his legs taking the pitch and plunge without conscious thought or effort over three and a half years since he had stepped into this ship which had become so much a part of him he climbed the ladder and saw heyward at the weather nettings it would be worse for him he had been aboard since she had commissioned five years back he walked across to him seeing the grey mist swirling through the dripping shrouds the spray bursting high above the gangway well mr heyward the english channel yonders with any sort of luck lies the isle of wight we will anchor at spitheyd before dark heyward looked at him steadily its a strange feeling sir he shrugged im not sure if i want to leave the ship now bolitho nodded it is often the case sparrow is no different from the rest of us she needs a proper overhaul in the yard and she is to be fitted with these new carronades we keep hearing about shell not be the same after this he saw bethune climbing from the gun deck his jaw working on a stale biscuit i doubt if any of us will land ho fine on th starboard bow bolitho took a glass wight youd better let her fall off a point he watched heyward hurry to the rail with his speaking trumpet it could have been tyrrell then he looked around the rainsoaked deck at the seamen by the mizzen braces their faces and arms even darker in the hostile grey light a tansailed yawl bobbed past a bearded man waving from the tiller on the other beam he saw a smudge of land through the drizzle and mist england he gripped the rail hard after so long and so much steady as she goes sir heyward joined him again bethune stood on his opposite side and murmured i feel as if ive grown up in sparrow bolitho thrust his arms around their shoulders we all did then he turned away and said formally muster your anchor party and tell the gunner to prepare a salute he began to pace slowly up and down the weather side seeing the busy seamen around him and mana more buckle and tilby graves and the artist majendie he paused and touched the rail the scars where balls had cut down so many of his men a frigate loomed through the mist on an opposite tack her flags very bright against the murky backcloth fowler called what ship sir bolitho nodded hoist our number sparrow sloopofwar had come home
