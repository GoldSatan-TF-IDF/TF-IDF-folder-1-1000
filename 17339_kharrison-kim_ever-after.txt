ever after book in the rachel morgan series a novel by kim harrison dedication to the only man id make butterscotch pudding for acknowledgments id like to thank my editor diana gill and my agent richard curtis who have each helped shape the hollows in uncountable ways chapter one this is close enough thanks i said to the cabdriver and he swerved to park a block from carew towers dropoff zone it was sunday night and the trendy restaurants in the lower levels of the cincinnati highrise were busy with the march madness food festthe revolving door never stopped as laughing couples and groups went in and out the kidsonart exhibit had probably brought in a few but id be willing to bet that the stoic pair in the suit and sequined dress getting out of the black car ahead of me were going up to the revolving restaurant as i was i fumbled for a twenty in my ridiculously small clutch purse then handed it over the front seat keep the change i said distracted as i tugged my shawl closer breathing in a faint lilac scent and im going to need a receipt please the cabbie shot me a thankful glance at the tip high maybe but hed come all the way out to the hollows to pick me up nervous i readjusted my shawl again and slid to the door i could have taken my car but parking was a hassle downtown for festivals and tawny silk and lace lost a lot of sparkle while getting out of a mini cooper not to mention the stiff wind off the river might pull apart my carefully braided hair if i had to walk more than a block i doubted that tonights meeting with quen would lead to a job but i needed all the tax deductions i could get right now even if it was just cab fare skipping filing for a year while they decided if i was a citizen or not hadnt turned out to be the boon i originally thought it was thanks i said as i tucked the receipt away taking a steadying breath i sat with my hands in my lap maybe i should go home instead i liked quen but he was trents number one security guy i was sure it was a job offer but probably not one i wanted to take my curiosity had always been stronger than common sense though and when the cabbies eyes met mine through his rearview mirror i reached for the handle whatever it is im saying no i muttered as i got out and the were chuckled the thump of the door barely beat the three loud goth teenagers descending upon him my low heels clicked on the sidewalk and i held my tiny clutch bag under my arm the other hand on my hair the bag was small yes but it was big enough to hold my streetlegal splat gun stocked with sleepytime charms if quen didnt take no for an answer i could leave him facedown in his twelvedollarabowl soup squinting through the wind i dodged the people loitering for their rides quen had asked me to dinner not trent i didnt like that he felt the need to talk to me at a fivestar restaurant instead of a coffee shop but maybe the man liked his whiskey old one last gust pushed me into the revolving door and a whisper of impending danger tightened my gut as the scent of old brass and dog urine rose in the sudden dead air it expanded into the echoing noise of a wide lobby done in marble and i shivered as i made for the elevators it was more than the march chill the couple id seen at the curb were long gone by the time i got there and i had to wait for the dedicated restaurant lift hands making a fig leaf with my purse i watched the foot traffic feeling out of place in my long sheath dress it had looked so fabulous on me in the store that id bought it even though i couldnt run in it wearing it tonight was half the reason i had said yes to quen i often dressed up for work but always with the assumption that id probably end the evening having to run from banshees or after vampires maybe quen just wanted to catch up but i doubted it the elevator dinged and i forced a smile for whoever might be in it it faded fast when the doors opened to show only more brass velvet and mahogany i stepped inside and hit the r button at the top of the panel maybe my unease was simply because i was alone id been alone a lot this week while jenks tried to do the work of five pixies in the garden and ivy was in flagstaff helping glenn and daryl move the lobby noise vanished as the doors closed and i looked in the mirrors tucking away a strand that had escaped the loose braid jenkss youngest kids had put it in tonight if jenks were here hed tell me to snap out of it and i pulled myself straighter when my ears popped there were ley line symbols carved into the railing like a pattern but they were really a mild euphoric charm and i leaned backward into them i could use all the euphoria i could get tonight my shoulders had relaxed by the time the doors opened and the light strains of live chamber music filtered in it was just dinner for gods sake and i smiled at the young host at the reception desk his hair slicked back he was wearing his uniform well behind him cincinnati spread out in the dark the lights glinting like souls in the night the stink and noise of the city were far away and only the beauty showed maybe thats why quen chose here im meeting quen hanson i said forcing my attention back to the host the tables i could see were full of people taking advantage of the festivals specials your booth isnt ready yet but hes waiting for you at the bar the man said and my eyes flicked up at the unexpected sound of respect in his voice may i take your shawl better and better i thought as i turned to let him slip the thin silk from my shoulders i felt him hesitate at my pack tattoo and i straightened to my full height proud of it this way please he said as he handed it to a woman and took the little paper tag handing it to me in turn i let my hips sway a little as i fell into step behind him making the shift to the revolving circle without pause id been up here a couple of times and the bar was on the far side of the entry we strode through tables of upscale wininganddining people the couple who had come up ahead of me were already seated wine being poured as they sat close together and enjoyed each other more than the view it had been a while since id felt that and a pang went through me shoving it down i stepped to the still center portion of the restaurant with the brass and mahogany bar quen was the only one there apart from the bartender his stance hinting at unease as he stood not sat with a ramrod straightness in his suit coat and tie he had the build to wear it well but it probably hampered his movement more than he liked and i smiled as he frowned and tugged at his sleeve clearly not seeing me yet the reflection in the glass behind the mirror showed the lights on the river he looked tiredalert but tired his eyes were everywhere and his head cocked as he listened to the muted tv in the upper corner behind him catching the movement of our approach he turned smiling last year i might have felt out of place and uncomfortable but now i smiled back genuinely glad to see him somehow hed taken on the shades of a father figure in my mind that we kept butting heads the first year wed known each other might have something to do with it that he could still lay me flat out on the floor with his magic was another saving his life once when i had failed to save my dad probably also figured into it quen i said as he needlessly tugged his dress slacks and suit coat straight i have to say this is better than meeting you on the roof the hint of weariness in his eyes shifted to warmth as he took my offered hand in a firm grip to help me onto the perch of the bar stool tired or not he looked good in a mature trim security sort of way he was a little short for an elf dark where most were light but it worked well for him and i wondered if that was gray about his temples or a trick of the light a new sensation of contentment and peace flowed from himfamily life was agreeing with him even if it was probably also why he was tired lucy and ray were thirteen months and ten months respectively as trents security adviser quen was powerful in his magic strong in his convictions and he loved ceri with all his soul quen made a sour amused face at the reminder of our first meeting at carew tower rachel thank you for agreeing to see me he said his low melodious voice reminding me of trents it wasnt an accent as much as his controlled grace extending even to his speech he looked up as the bartender approached and topped off his glass of white wine what would you like while we wait the tv was just over his head behind him and i looked away from the stock prices scrolling under the latest national scandal my back was to the city and i could see a hint of the hollows beyond the river through the bars mirror anything with bubbles in it i said and quens eyes widened it doesnt have to be champagne i said warming a sparkling wine wont have sulfates the bartender nodded knowingly and i smiled it was nice when i didnt have to explain quen leaned in close and i caught my breath at the scent of cinnamon dark and laced with moss i thought you were going to order a soft drink he said and i set my purse on the bar beside me pop no way you dragged me all the way into cincy for a meeting at a fivestar restaurant im getting the quail he chuckled but it faded too fast for my liking usually i said slowly fishing for why i was here when a man invites me somewhere nice its because he wants to break up with me and doesnt want me to make a scene i know thats not the case here silent he tightened his jaw my pulse quickened the bartender came back with my drink and i pushed it around in a little circle waiting quen just sat there what does trent want me to do that im not going to like i finally prompted and he actually winced he doesnt know im here quen said and his slight unease took on an entirely new meaning the last time id met quen without trent knowing about it dude holy crap did you get ceri pregnant again congratulations you old dog but what do you need me for babies are good things unless you happen to be a demon that is he frowned hunching over the bar to sip his drink and shooting me a look to lower my voice ceri is not pregnant but the children do touch on what i wanted to talk to you about suddenly concerned i leaned closer what is it i said a flicker of anger passing through me trent could be a dick sometimes taking his saving his race quest to unfair extremes is it about the girls is he pressuring you about something ray is your daughter i said hotly she and lucy being raised together as sisters is a great idea but if he thinks im going to sit here while he shoves you out of their life no thats far from the truth of it quen set his drink aside to put his hand on mine my words cut off as he gave my hand a warning squeeze and when i grimaced he pulled away i could knock him flat on his ass with a curse but i wouldnt it had nothing to do with the fancy restaurant and everything to do with respect besides if i knocked him down hed knock me down and quen had a spell lexicon that put mine to shame ray and lucy are being raised with two fathers and one mother its working beautifully but thats what i wanted to discuss he said confusing me even more i drew my hands back to my lap slightly huffy so i had jumped to conclusions i knew trent too well and pushing quen out of the picture to further the professional image of a happy traditional family wasnt beyond him im listening avoiding me quen downed a swallow of wine trent is a fine young man he said watching the remaining wine swirl yes i drawled cautiously if you can call a drug lord and outlawedmedicine manufacturer a fine young man both were true but id lost any fire behind the accusations a while ago i think it was when trent slugged the man trying to abduct me into a lifetime of degradation quens flash of irritation vanished when he realized i was jokingsort of i have no issue in having a secondary public role in the girls lives he said defensively trent takes great pains to see that i have sufficient time with them midnight rides on horseback and reading before bed i imagined but not a public show of parenthood still i managed not to say anything but a tart he gives you time to be a dad bully for trent i took a sip of bubbly wine blinking the fizz away before it made me sneeze you are the devil to talk to rachel he said curtly will you shut up and listen the sharp rebuke brought me up short yes i was being rude but trent irritated me sorry i said as i focused on him the tv behind him was distracting and i wished theyd turn it down even more seeing my attention he dropped his head trent is conscientiously making sure i have time to be with both ray and lucy but its becoming increasingly evident that its caused an unwise reduction to his own personal safety reduction to his own personal safety i snorted and reached for my wine hes not getting his fair share of daddy time no hes scheduling things when im not available and using the excuse to go out alone it has to stop ohhhh i said in understanding quen had been keeping trent safe since his father had died leaving him alone in the world quen practically raised him and letting the billionaire idiot savant out of his sight to chat with businessmen on the golf course probably didnt sit well especially with trents new mindset that he could do magic too then i followed that thought as to why i might be sitting here and my eyes got even wider oh hell no i said grabbing my purse and shifting forward to get off the stool i am not going to do your job again quen there isnt enough money in the world not in two worlds well maybe in two worlds but that wasnt the point rachel please he pleaded taking my shoulder before i could find the floor it wasnt the strength of his grip that stopped me cold but the worry in his voice im not asking you to do my job good because i wont i said my voice hushed but intense i will not work for trent hes a a i hesitated finding all my usual insults no longer holding force he never listens to me i said instead and quens hand fell from my shoulder a faint smile on his face and gets himself in trouble because of it i got him to the west coast for you and look what happened quen turned to the bar his voice flat his actions resulted in a bar burning down and the collapse of a us monument it wasnt just a bar it was margaritaville and im still getting hate mail it was his fault and i got blamed for it and lets not forget san francisco getting toasted oh and how about my ending up in a baby bottle waiting for my aura to solidify enough so that i could survive you think i enjoyed that granted the kiss to break the spell had been nice but the last time i worked for trent the assassins had been aimed at me upset i turned back to the bars mirror my face was red and i forced myself to relax maybe quen was right to bring me here if we had been at juniors i probably would be halfway out the door looking for my car even angry as i was i looked like i belonged here with my hair up and my elegant dress that made me look svelte not skinny but it was all show i didnt belong here i was not wealthy especially smart or talented i was good at staying alivethats itand every last person up here save quen would be the first to go if there was trouble except maybe the cook cooks were good with knives quen lifted his head the wrinkle line in his forehead deeper thats exactly what im saying he said softly the man needs someone to watch him someone who can survive what he gets himself into and is sensitive to his quirks quirks frustrated i let go of my clutch purse and downed another swallow of wine dude i hear you i understand i said and quen blinked at my word choice i even sympathize but i cant do it id end up killing him hes too pigheaded and unwilling to consider anyone elses opinion especially in a tight situation quen chuckled relaxing his tight grip on his emotions sounds familiar we are talking about trent not me and besides the man does not need a babysitter hes all grown up and youi pointed at quendont give him enough credit he stole lucy okay and they were waiting for him i turned back to the bar and the reflection of the hollows he can handle whatever cincinnati can dish out i said softly going over my short list of trouble its been quiet lately quen sighed slumping beside me with both hands around his drink but i wasnt going to fall for it i will admit that trent has a knack for devising a plan and following through with it but he falters at improvisation and thats where you excel i wish you would reconsider hearing the truth of it i looked up and quen lifted his drink in salute trent could plan his way out of a demons contract but that wouldnt keep him alive against a sniper spell and thats where the real danger was my jaw clenched and i shoved the thought away what did i care i left the is because i couldnt stomach working for anyone that hasnt changed thats not entirely true he said and i frowned you work with ivy and jenks all the time my eyebrows rose yes i work with jenks and ivy not for them they dont always do what i think is best but they always at least listen to me i didnt do what they thought was best either so we got along tolerably well trent though he needed to listen the businessman made more mistakes than me hes doing much better quen said and i couldnt stop my chuckle yeah he worked with jenks quen offered but i could hear the doubt in his voice yes he worked with jenks i said the wine bitter as it slipped down and jenks said it was like pulling the wings off a fairy to get trent to include him on even the smallest details no quens worry line in his brow was deepening quen i understand your concern i said reaching out to put a hand on his arm it was tense and i pulled back feeling like i shouldnt have touched him im sorry but i just cant do it could you maybe just try he said shocking me theres an elven heritage exhibit at the museum next friday trent has a few items on display and will be putting in an appearance youll love it no i faced the mirror and watched myself take a drink free food he said and i eyed him in disbelief through the reflection i wasnt that desperate lots of contacts with people with too much money he added you need to get out and network let cincy know youre the same rachel morgan who captured a banshee and saved san francisco and not just the witch whos really a demon i flushed setting the glass down and looking around for a clock jeez had i only been here ten minutes i expect you would pick up a few legit jobs he said and i stiffened i wasnt out of money but the only people who wanted to hire me wanted me because i could twist demon curses i wasnt that kind of a girl even if i had the potential to be and it bothered me that quen knew who had been knocking on my door working a couple of easy chaperoning jobs for cincinnatis elite would do wonders for my esteem isnt that what quen is offering me there would be a clothing allowance quen wheedled my pulse quickened not at the thought of a new pair of boots but at being dumb enough to consider this rachel im asking this as a personal favor he added sensing me waver for me and ceri groaning i dropped my head into my hand and my dress pinched as i shifted to turn away from him ceri though she had agreed to maintaining a public image with trent she loved quen quen loved her back with all the fierceness of someone who never expected to find anything beautiful in the world hell if it was nothing more than being a security escort i could stomach trent for a few hours how much trouble could the man get into out at the museum anyway you fight dirty i said sourly to his reflection and he toasted me smiling wickedly its my nature so will you do it i rubbed the back of my neck as i turned to him guilt and duty pulling at me avoiding him i sent my eyes to the tv it was showing the cincy skyline which was odd since it was a national station the banner third infant abducted flashed up then vanished behind an insurance commercial act as trents security i thought remembering trents savage protective expression under the city when he downed that man trying to abduct me and then how he looked on my front steps when he found wayde carting me out of the church over his shoulder trent had spun a charm to knock the were out cold with the ease of picking a flower true it hadnt been needed but trent hadnt known that my fingers spinning the footing of my glass slowed as i recalled trent opening up to me and telling me about the person he wanted to be it was as if i was the only person who might really understand and quen wanted me to be the one to deny him that no i whispered knowing that trent would count my presence as his failure he didnt deserve that im not going to be his babysitter rachel you need to put your petty grudge aside and no i said louder angry now and his words cut off this isnt about me trent can stand on his own hes better than you give him credit for you asked me i said no find someone else to spit in his eye quen pulled back from me his face creased in anger thats not what im doing he said but there was a whisper of concern in his denial i simply dont want him out there alone theres nothing wrong with someone having your back he can stand on his own without having to be alone behind him the tv was showing the front of cincys hospital lit up with lights and security vehicles have his back i wont bring it up again he said shifting away from me suddenly closed off i think our table is ready confused i slid from the stool shimmying until my dress fell right if i was there trent wouldnt see it as me watching his back hed say i was babysitting him quen had it wrong didnt he after you quen said sourly gesturing for me to follow the man standing before us with two huge menus in his hand god save me from myself maybe quen was right quen but then my gaze jerked up to the tv over the bar as i caught a familiar phrase and my thoughts of trent vanished with a sudden flash i recognized the new rosewood wing behind the newscaster on the scene the rosewood wing was simply a fancy name for the three comfortable houselike facilities theyd built for the terminally ill babies suffering from rosewood syndrome the culdesac was damp from the earlier rain and lights from the is cruisers and news vans made everything shiny the thought of third abduction echoed through me and i jerked to a halt behind me quen grunted in surprise turn it up i exclaimed turning back to the bar and shoving past quen to get closer apparently abducted by a kidnapper posing as a night nurse the woman was saying and i felt myself pale is officials are investigating but so far they have no leads as to who is taking the failing infants and why turn it up i said again and this time the bartender heard me aiming a remote and upping the volume i felt myself pale as quen rocked to a halt beside me both of us looking up a phone buzzed and quen jumped his hand fumbling to a back pocket because of baby benjamins miraculous progress in fighting the lethal disease officials are not hopeful for a ransom demandthey fear that he was taken by unscrupulous biogenetic engineers trying to find and sell a cure oh my god i whispered fumbling in my clutch bag for my phone theyd killed all the bioengineers during the turn it was a tradition both humans and inderlanders alike gleefully continued to this day that i was alive because of illegal tinkering didnt make me feel any better lets hope they find them soon the woman was saying and then the headlines shifted to the latest washington scandal head down over my phone i punched in trents number it would go right to his private quarters bypassing the switchboard i felt hot then cold my grip on my phone shaking he wouldnt have abducted the baby but hed have a short list of who might have the humans against paranormals association hapa maybe now that they couldnt have me trent had once promised that hed give the demons the cure to their infertility but after suffering through the chaos wrought by his fathers saving me i couldnt believe that trent was looking to increase the number of survivors just yet the busy signal shocked through me and i glanced up at the shadow of a man standing too close quen his brow furrowed as he looked at his phones screen blinking i remembered where i was quens lips twitched and he held out his phone it was smaller and shinier than mine hes on my line he said with a thin distant voice you talk to him fingers shaking i took the phone hell know were together that we talked oh god i didnt want trent to know that quen doubted him he looked to him as his father despite the monthly stipend quen shrugged hell find out anyway mouth suddenly dry i answered the phone and put it to my ear trent the hesitation was telling but he caught his balance quickly rachel trent said clearly surprised im sorry i must have hit the wrong button i was trying to reach quen i held the phone tighter my pulse pounding his voice was beautiful and i felt glad for turning quen down ahh i said glancing up at a stoic quen you hit the right number again trent hesitated okay we were having dinner i explained nothing and quens face became even more bland quen and i you saw the news do you know who did it my worry came rushing back crowding out my brief flash of pleasure for having caught trent off guard it happened so seldom the host was still waiting and when quen shook his head he smiled ingratiatingly and walked away dropping the menus on the bar no but im going out there right now trents tone was tight and my idea that he was fixing rosewood babies died since youre with quen would you both meet me there my lips parted even as i heard the accusation in his tone he wanted me there with him rachel are you there trent asked and i flushed glancing at quen before pushing the phone tighter to my ear yes the hospital right where all the news vans were swell i couldnt help but wonder if his invitation was because he wanted my professional opinion or simply to find out what quen and i were doing rosewood wing he said his tone grim i doubt there will be any indication as to who took the infant but i dont want evidence to be buried if the is doesnt like what they find if one of us is there we will at least have the truth i nodded as quen exchanged a few words with the bartender and slipped him a bill the is was an offshoot of the original fbi and local police forces before the turn responsible for hiding inderland crimes before humans could find evidence that witches werewolves and vampires existed covering up the uncomfortable or unprofitable was in their blood rachel may i talk to quen trent asked shaking me out of my thoughts um sure ill see you there my stomach was in knots and i held the phone out he wants to talk to you quen looked at the phone his expression never shifting as he reluctantly reached out turning sideways to me he drew himself up sahan he hesitated having dinner another pause of course ceri knows it was her idea ceri was in on this too frowning i forced my arms from my middle trent would be pissed i knew id been when my mom and dad rented me a livein personal security guy for a few months no quen said firmly and then again no ill see you there i could hear trent complaining as quen closed the phone cutting him off midprotest that wasnt going to go over very well i decided and when quen gestured for me to head out before him i meekly fell into place my thoughts turning to the hospital behind us people laughed and clinked glasses below cincinnati moved with her people uncaring and unaware it felt wrong now someone was stealing rosewood babies the why was ugly quen was silent all the way to the elevator he avoided my eyes as i handed him my ticket to give to the coatcheck woman i could have given it to her myself but high society came with weird rules and it was no skin off my nose youre not going to tell him i said hoping he wanted to use the time it would take to get to the hospital to come up with some story other than quens asking me to babysit trent gaze distant in thought quen shook out my shawl and i turned around my head lowered you might be right he said and i shivered as the silk settled over my bare skin i may have acted without thought it was an honest answer but quen might be right as well trent didnt need a babysitter but everyone needed someone to watch their back chapter two quens car was warm the seats heated and my vents aimed at me making the escaping strands of my braid tickle my neck as we slowly wove through the twisty hospital campus feeling ill i leaned toward the dash and peered through the curved glass both anxious to get there and uncertain as to what i was going to tell trent it was starting to mist and everything had a surreal glow the tall main building looked foreboding in the rain lights gleaming on its slick walls that was not our destination people got bettermostlyat the hospital where we were headed the only healing was emotional the tires hissed on the wet pavement as we took a tight corner into a culdesac three modest structures identical apart from their color were before us is cruisers and black crown vics parked in the drives and at the curbs my lips curled in disgust at the news vans bright lights spilling out along with heavy wires like grotesque umbilical cords running into one of the houses it must have made their night to have their local story picked up nationwide the three twostory homes looked out of place in the otherwise institutional hospital setting they were relatively new the landscaping bushes still small and inadequate it was cincinnatis rosewood wing where rosewood babies were moved to sometimes born here but always dying here never surviving a lot of parents elected to take their baby home for his or her last days but not all and the homey atmosphere was a boon counselors were more prevalent than nursing staff they hadnt had such a place when id been born and as quen parked his twoseater into a space too small for the official cars i felt odd and melancholy quen put the car in park making no move to get out i too leaned back into the plush seat afraid almost blowing his breath out noisily quen turned to me im going to tell him we had dinner and talked about his security he finally said his eyes holding a hint of pleading im also going to tell him that i was asking your opinion if he was secure on his own merits and that you said he was but that if the situation changed that you would my heart thumped as he let his words trail off into expectation waiting for me to finish his sentence and tell him id watch trent when he couldnt that wasnt even mentioning the little white lie i didnt know how i felt about that and i searched quens expression the shadowlight coming from the litup building made him look older his worry clear damn it all to hell that if the situation changed that id be able to assist in keeping the girls safe i said firmly and quens expression became stoic very well tal sahan he grumbled and my eyebrows rose tal sahan that was a new one i would have asked him what it meant but his voice had been mocking then lets go i said reaching for my bag the little clutch bag felt too small as i got out and my clothes were totally inappropriate for a crime scene the cool mist touched my face and the thump of quens door surprised me dropping my eyes to the damp pavement i shut my door as well i took a deep breath and lifted my chin starting for the door already propped open for the sporadic flow of people in and out i couldnt help but notice the opening was almost twice as wide as usual i hated oversize doorsor rather i hated the wheelchairs they alluded to a sudden wish to be anywhere but here struck me i had escaped dying from rosewood syndrome it had taken almost all my early life to do it and it shaped me in ways i was only now figuring out but the reminder was bittersweet quen met me stride for stride are you okay we had gained the paved walk which artistically meandered to give the appearance of distance and interest it just looked fake to me fine i said my mood growing worse i didnt want to be heredidnt like the memories being stirred up someone was stealing rosewood babies and what followed from there was enough to make my nights sleepless head down i stepped over the news vans cords walking sideways to get through the door and flashing my id to the is guy i think it was more quens and my fancy dress that got us in than my id the officer clearly didnt recognize me but only someone who needed to be here would come dressed in formalwear id have to remember that the cool night mist vanished and i hesitated just inside the wide entryway feeling quens silent solid presence behind me a set of stairs led up probably to the nurses quarters the kitchen was behind the stairway down a short hallway there were two living rooms one to either side of the door both of them were full of people standing around talking but only one had the lights of the news crews it was warm even for me and i didnt like the excited tone of the newswoman asking the distraught mother how she felt now that her babythriving against all oddshad been stolen what a slime i whispered with a surge of anger and quen cleared his throat someone had pieced together that the rosewood syndrome was actually an expression of too much demon enzyme and was harvesting demon blood while the babies still lived id be dead too if trents father hadnt modified my mitochondria to supply the enzyme that blocked the lethal action of the first enzyme that actually invoked demon magic it was a mouthful that basically meant hed enabled me to survive being born a demon quens hand cupped my elbow and he gently pulled me out of someones way numb i looked for a familiar facesomewhere to start my evening dress was garnering odd looks but it also kept people away that stupid newscaster was still interviewing the parents and is agents stood at the outskirts hoping to get some airtime no one recognized me thank god and i felt guilty for being surrounded by so much griefgrief that my parents had endured and triumphed over damn it i would not feel guilty for having survived there he is quen breathed in relief and i followed his gaze to the back of the living room to the hallway running from the nurseries to the kitchen and felix i said surprised to find trent talking to the undead vampire or rather he was talking to nina the young vampire that felix currently liked doing his aboveground talking through the young woman was looking thinner than the last time id seen her better dressed and confident but decidedly peaked as if shed been on too many amphetamines for the last four months it was hard to see her behind the suave collected undead vamp controlling her body living through her for a few hours at a time it was about what i had expected serving as an undead masters mouthpiece wasnt safe for either partythe old vampire was reminded too strongly of what it was like to be alive and began to pine for it and the young was given more power running through his or her mind and body to handle alone it was a knifes edge that only the most experienced attempted at this level and i was starting to think that the relationship had passed the point where it could be ended safely concerned i bit my lip wondering if the is was questioning trent about the abductions but as i watched i decided that though trent had proved he could be calm even while being arrested for murder at his own wedding he didnt have the guarded air of someone being grilled for kidnapping he was probably getting the real story not the canned tripe they were feeding the reporters trents short translucently blond hair next to ninas thick shoulderlength wash of hispanic elegance was striking the woman herself had no political sway but felix was shining through making the woman unusually sophisticated and in controland slightly masculine in her mannerisms as she stood with her knees too far apart for her professional skirt and suit coat running into trent and felix at a crime scene is starting to become a habit i said as i rocked into motion moving slowly to avoid the reporters as we crossed the room seeing trent i felt my entire perception of quen shift oh both men had grace but quens was born in the confidence that he could handle any situation trents was from a lifetime of being listened to and taken more than seriously they were both dressed well but trents suit was tailored to every inch of his trim sexy self and it was growing obvious that quen would rather be in his usual loosefitting security uniform though id seen both men take down an attacker quen would always use the minimal amount of force whereas trent would be a conflict of visionselegance coupled with savagery and a frightening grace magic sung into existence trent felt my gaze on him his expression startled until he hid the emotion only after running his gaze up and downappreciatively taking in my evening gowndid he touch felixs shoulder to point me out the youngold is operative turned beaming the young womans normal mannerisms gone as felix took complete control rachel nina said a shade too loudly and with an exaggerated slowness as quen and i tucked into the marginally quieter hallway where we could still watch what happened im surprised to see you here is ivy back yet with a guarded air i shook both my head and her hand not until next saturday i said pulling my hand from hers not liking felixs interest in my roommate i was at dinner when i heard the news and came over because i hesitated my grip tightening on my clutch bag because i wanted to know who was kidnapping babies who could invoke demon magic sure that sounded good trent cleared his throat as the silence became awkward because i asked her to he said reaching to shake my hand it was missing the last two digits but he hid their absence well until our fingers met the glint of a ring twin to my own was still on his index finger and i hid my hand behind my back not wanting felix to notice and ask hello rachel i appreciate you changing your plans the hesitation had been slight but it was there beside me quen cleared his throat clearly not wanting to explain in front of felix i dont know if i want to lie to you anymore i thought warming at his touch and wondering if i had felt a faint tingle of spilling energy before our fingers had parted who did this i said trying to block out the woman sobbing on the couch my god didnt newspeople have any soul at all nina laughed lightly felix apparently immune to the human tragedy let me consult my magic ball she said then sobered when both trent and i stared at her we werent the only ones that laugh had traveled quen thank you for bringing ms morgan out trent said as he inclined his head it wasnt a problem sahan quen paused if i can have a second of your time in a moment trent beamed one of his professional smiles and i slumped ever so slightly as long as felix was here trent would be the epitome of teflonknowing nothing seeing nothing accomplishing nothingboring boring boring he was also ticked i could tell by the faint rim of red on his ears he wouldnt talk to quen until they were alone and until then he was going to believe the worst three days in a car was having unforeseen benefits i hope you and rachel had a pleasant dinner that was catty for him and i slipped my arm into quens startling both men for different reasons he bought me sparkling wine it doesnt give me a headache like most wines do trents attention lingered on my arm in quens then rose to quens eyes slowly quen pulled away stiff and uncomfortable quen nina said as she looked at the reporters now asking the staff for their views since youre here could you give me your professional opinion on something quen blinked in surprise his hands behind his back me nina was bobbing her head yes that is if trent will let me steal you away for a few moments youre well versed in a variety of security techniques both mundane and magic she said one hand reaching out to touch his shoulder the other extended to escort him deeper into the building to the bedrooms personal security yes i dont see how i can help drawn by the livingdead vampire quen brushed by me leaving the scent of wool and cinnamon id be most appreciative if you would look at the security system here and tell me what would be needed to circumvent it nina said the man glanced back at trent and when trent shrugged quen said it would be my pleasure ah i dont want to give testimony in court he continued this is strictly my casual opinion his voice going faint behind the noise in the front room as they walked away i couldnt help but smile it was quickly followed by the sour emotion of envy always a bridesmaid i muttered as i shifted to stand shoulder to shoulder with trent no one ever asked my opinion of a crime scene reconsidering i glanced at trent at least not before the vacuuming guys were done if i didnt know better felix had taken quen away intentionally so trent and i could talk the feeling strengthened when trent glanced at me and turned away making me feel as if we were two wallflowers at a dance left by our respective dates so we could get to know each other trent in his threepiece suit that cost more than my car and me in a slinky tawny number id probably never wear again ever then the woman on the couch began sobbing again and the feeling died this is ugly trent said the mask was gone he hadnt asked what quen and i had been doing and my shoulders eased how serious is the is treating this trents breath came out a shade too forceful the small tell ringing through me he was worrieda lot not seriously enough that i could tell already but trent wouldnt be out here for just this how many babies are missing i said wincing as the mother balled up her tissue in a tight whiteknuckled grip her eyes redrimmed and drained other than this one i mean the press said three his gaze somewhere across the room trent whispered eight total across the united states but the is is only admitting to those that get leaked to the press the one just before this was a set of twins from a prominent political figure they were over a month old the parents are devastated they dont know why their babies were surviving most of the infants abducted are male which is odd since the female gender has a naturally higher resistance that was why he was here and my eyebrows rose as he faced me whispering its not me someone has been giving them the enzyme that blocks the destructive actions of the rosewood genes or they would never have lived even this long now that whoever is doing this knows that it works he or she is coming back and stealing the infants who have been treated a sick feeling stole over me as i looked into the living room with its pain and guilt hapa he shook his head felix says no that info was questionable at best but id go with it until i heard otherwise well who else knows what these babies are capable of invoking trent gracefully turned to look down the hall as if wanting to leave he was tired but it was only because he was letting his guard down that i could tell anyone can piece it togethernow that its common knowledge what you are his gaze came back to me an empty regret in them the sole survivor of rosewood syndrome happens to be a demon perhaps we were lucky it took this long that an enzyme can keep them alive though his lips pressed together a handful know that and most of them work for me silent i forced my arms to relax at my sides the silk of my dress whispering this isnt good trent said so softly i barely heard him you think a silence grew not companionable but not uncomfortable either the news teams seemed to be packing it up and the is operatives were getting noisy a lastditch effort to get the cameras on them before they left i looked at trents jiggling foot and raised my eyebrows grimacing trent stopped fidgeting you look nice tonight he said surprising me i cant decide if i like your hair more up or down flushing i touched the loose braid jenkss kids had put my hair in still damp from the mist thanks so did you and quen have a nice dinner he asked pushing me even more mentally off balance carew tower yes as a matter of fact it was drinks at the bar but yes it was carew tower flustered i gripped my clutch bag tighter how did you guess his feet scuffed the small move telling me he was satisfiedand yet still ticked you smell like damaged brass it was either carew tower or the deli down on vine the one with the old bar footrest i blinked lips parting wow oh i said trying to decide what i could say yes we were at carew tower i looked down at my dress clearly not suitable for a deli trent moved to stand next to me so near i could smell his aftershave under the brokengreen smell of him together we watched the newscaster finish her interview with a nurse and him being that close was almost worse than his accusing stare you were discussing me he said his voice a shade high his attention fixed determinedly across the room the scent of spoiled wine and cinnamon joined the mix quen asked me to fill in for him when your schedules dont mesh i said he knows youre planning the conflictsdid you think he would do nothing his eye twitched thats it but i could see right through it give the man a break i said and he finally gave up his false indifference to glare at me quen crosschecked your prom date and took you to the dmv office for your license he worries about you okay unwilling to believe trent frowned i could feel the reporters watching his eyes flicked to them and slowly his hands unclenched exhaling he forced a fake smile but i didnt think he was fooling anyone now he was ready to walk and i took his elbow trent i told him no i said softly and his gaze shot from my grip to my eyes i told him you dont need a babysitter i told him he was selling you short and that you had the skill and dexterity to take care of yourself hes trying to wrap his mind around it but after a decade of keeping you safe its hard you might want to ease up on the rebelliousness for a while trents anger vanished rebelliousness he said and we both moved sideways as the vacuum guys trundled out past us is that his word or yours mine i said relieved that i hadnt tried to lie to him i know rebelling when i see it come on i cajoled my hand slipping from him let the poor guy come to grips with your independence before you go forcing it on him thats kind of cool you know that he loves you so much again he started clearly at a loss thank you he said as his gaze canvassed the room behind me but his smile was honest when it returned to me i never saw it like that my heart thumped when trent ducked his head to rub his chin ruefully and a funny feeling went to my middle behind me the bright lights of the news crews pinned down the human tragedy like the african sun exposing it in a distasteful savagery akin to lions ripping the underbelly of a gazelle it was just as hard to look away i took a breath to tell him if he ever wanted someone to watch his back to give me a call but i chickened out instead i nervously shifted to stand beside him again a wisp of separation drifted between us youre leaving ah yes he said clearly surprised that newswoman has been eyeing me and i dont want to give an interview i nodded in understanding as soon as he left i was going to beat a hasty retreat in the other direction in search of nina maybe theyd let me into the crime scene if felix asked them to rachel trent said suddenly and i brought my attention back from the empty hallway between the kitchen and the bedrooms be careful it might be hapa even if felix says it isnt angry i nodded whoever was doing this knew i was a hard target so theyd abducted babies instead cowards trent was rocking forward to leave and i stuck out my hand you be careful too if whoever this is knows about the enzyme theyll know that youre the only one who can make the cure permanent could i ever work for him i wondered as he looked at my hand and i recalled the satisfaction of bringing in cincinnatis hapa faction with him and the twohourlong conversation with him over pie and coffee afterward it had been wonderful but i didnt think i could stomach taking direction from him and i doubted he would ever learn to be anything other than what he was i didnt know if id like him if he changed damn i liked him and it kind of hurt admitting it trent eyed my hand for a half second taking it only to pull me toward him surprised i almost fell my breath held as he gave me a quick professional hug our shoulders touching my free hand went around him for balance and the memory of kissing him flashed through my mind as my hand slid from his waist thank you ill be careful he said as my heart pounded and i stared at him then he let go and i stepped back my face warming are you available tomorrow morning he asked as if unaware i was now bright red jeez louise what was with the hug and in front of the reporters everyone can see me blushing id like to talk to you about what this might mean he said his gaze rising to take in the entire ugly scene and i know ceri and the girls would like to see you i hesitated i hadnt seen lucy and ray for a few weeks i was their godmother of course i wanted to come over regardless of the reason make it ten i said remembering that elves like pixies usually slept the four hours when the sun was the highest im ah usually not up before eleven but i can swing ten occasionally oh god i was blushing even more now but trent only bobbed his head smiling at my red face we can make it eleven if you like he said thats their usual riding time wear boots we can talk on the trail ill see you then calm and relaxed trent headed for the door his steps confident as he timed his retreat perfectly to avoid the rising newscaster reaching for him and then he was gone crap on toast i was gripping my clutch purse like a fig leaf and disgusted that id handled that with the grace of a troll i fidgeted where i was feeling out of place in my tawny dress now that i wasnt standing next to a man in a suit my heart was still pounding and through the window i saw a flash of light as trent got into his car hands swinging i edged backward down the hall where quen and felix had gone quen would want to know trent had ditched him again i expected that the hallway led to the nurseries and indeed behind the first door i hesitantly peeped in was the expected double bed two soft chairs a rocker tv dresser mirror and a crib there was a bank of white cupboards i was sure they held lifesaving equipment hidden like an ugly secret not here i said to myself starting to relax the farther i got from the noise and warmth of the living room i pulled the door shut then hesitated looking at my fingers they felt slippery and i brought them to my nose breathing in the smell of crushed leaves pixy dust pulse quickening i went down the hallway following voices felix i called out hiking my dress up so i could move better in here rachel nina called back and i froze at the tiny ultrasonic wing chirp of surprise that followed i never would have heard it over the noise except that i lived with pixies i spun back to the kitchen my eyes widening jax i blurted seeing the little pixy looking at me from over the rim of the light fixture jax i shouted as he darted down the hall and into the kitchen i moved dress hiked up i stormed down the hall blowing into the kitchen and scaring the two is guys standing at the open fridge the sparkling of pixy dust hung in the air pixy i shouted and the two men stared at me where did he go wideeyed they said nothing the pie between them like guilt given substance where did the damn pixy go i repeated my heart thudding pixy one of them asked as if i were asking about a unicorn the sound of a vehicle starting came in through the open window and i ran to the back door adrenaline surging i shoved the door open cool night air hit me misty with no moonand the sifting silver dust of a pixy trailed like a moonbeam it drifted to the sidewalk running past the dumpster and vanishing around the corner breathless i followed the tracing of dust my heels sending shocks up my spine as i cliptapped around the corner a squeal of tires brought me to a halt and i put a hand on the dumpster and watched as a blue ford truck drove away tires smoking anger sparked but it wasnt until it hit a speed bump and the passenger door flew open that i was sure nnnnnick chapter three the kitchen was bright with electric light loud with the shrieks of pixies and with a snap i flicked the coffeemaker on before turning back to my sandwich it was a rather large room newly remodeled with stainlesssteel counters two stoves and my moms old fridge with the automatic ice dispenser right in the door my spelling equipment hung over the center island counter copper pots and ceramic spelling spoons making it look less like the industrial kitchen at the back of a church that it had started out as ivys thick countrykitchen table where she did most of her research was depressingly empty shed been gone this whole week out in flagstaff helping glenn and daryl get settled in their new digs standing at the counter in my evening gown surrounded by cold cuts condiments and a halfempty twoliter bottle of pop i clenched my teeth and wished the pixies would go away they were playing war among the hanging copper pots giving me a headache copper was one of the few metals that wouldnt burn them and they loved banging into it telling jenks about the abducted rosewood babies had been bad enough but bringing nick into it had left us both in a bad mood that his kids werent helping get rid of nick if there was anyone who could irritate me by simply breathing it was nick the selfproclaimed thief once professed that hed loved me and i think he had inasmuch as he could love another person he loved money and the security he thought that it represented more i honestly believed that he felt justified for all the trouble hed heaped upon me i hadnt trusted him for a long time but when he had betrayed not just me but trent in the same breath id written him off that he lured jenkss eldest son jax into a life of crime and hardship just pissed me off id not heard from nick since he had spirited himselfand presumably jaxout of trents highsecurity lockup only a demon could have done it i frankly didnt give a damn if nick had gotten himself indebted to a demon but i did care about who might be holding his leashand why he was again on this side of the ley lines stealing rosewood infants the big knife ivy left out to scare magazine salesmen was too big to comfortably cut my sandwich but i used it anyway setting it down on the counter with a thud when an unpopped kernel of popcorn zinged over my head and clattered against the wall jenks my shout sent a strand of hair drifting your kids are driving me nuts from the sanctuaryturnedlivingroom i heard him yell get the hell out of the kitchen sure that ought to do it frowning i set the sandwich on a napkin little drops of water from the lettuce making spots on it i reached for a paper towel as belle edged into the kitchen riding rex like an elephant the fairy had her feet snuggled in behind rexs ears and she gave the cat a tap with the end of her bow when rex threatened to sit down and spill her backward changing her mind the orange cat twined about my ankles instead belle was an odd contrast of a pixy silks bright colors and a fairys naturally gaunt paleness never would i have imagined that jenks would suffer to let a fairy live in his garden but the small warrior woman had somehow become a part of the churcheven if it had been her clan who had killed jenkss wife that the fairy was now wingless might have something to do with it but i think he admired her grit your dad sssays to get outssside she lisped around her long teeth her face turned upright at the noisy battle you shame yourssselves with a disgusted snarl she smacked rexs flank as she purred and rubbed against me hoping for a fallen morsel get out she yelled at them now my head was exploding from their noise but about half of them started for the hallway flying backward and still shooting popcorn kernels at each other with slingshots someone shrieked when a seed punched through her wing and the shouted threats got serious as the girls sided against the boys there was a sharp ping when a seed hit my biggest spell pot and ricocheted into me making my eyes narrow jenks was giving them a lot of latitude knowing that as soon as it warmed up half of them were going to leave to make homes for themselves all right you lot jenks shouted as he flew into the kitchen a faint red dust of annoyance spilling from him you heard belle get out before i bend your wings backward if youre cold put on the long johns belle made you but i want you outside clearing the lines jumoke get your sister a patch you made it you fix it do it nicely or youre going to do midnight sentry with bis no matter how cold it is i tossed my paper towel exchanging a weary look with belle as they flowed out of the kitchen with a chorus of complaints going across the hall and up the flue in the back living room by the sound of it jumoke jenkss only darkhaired son helped the pixy with the hole in her wing stoically taking the verbal abuse the eightyearold pixy was heaping on him shed probably be on her own next year fully grown and ready to start a family why jumoke hadnt left yet was obvious blackhaired pixies were often killed on sight by their own kind he at least would be staying belle nudged rex into motion and she followed them out it was too cold for fairies but if she was sitting on rex shed be okay the cat door squeaked and jenks flew a reddusted path to the kitchen spigot where he could watch the garden and his kids dispersing into the damp spring night his hands were on his hips and his feet were spread wide but he seemed more worried about jax than the noise belles touch was showing in surprising places and jenks wasnt looking so much like peter pan these days he still had the tights and garden sword at his hip that he used to chase off birds but his usual green gardening coat had been replaced by a flashy multicolored jacket with tails and a dark orange vest belles work with the huntergreen shirt it made a striking statement with his curly blond hair trim physique skintight boots and tights and that narrow waist and wide shoulders his dragonflylike wings blurred to nothing as he watched the dusty glows from his grown children in the garden though his feet never lifted off the noise of his wings increased when the catsize shadow of bis joined them then he relaxed thanks i said in relief as i took my sandwich to the table they dont listen to me jenks frowned as he flew over the center counter spilling a sour green dust on the cheese and making it glow briefly they dont listen to me either it was a notsosubtle reminder of jax nicks sudden appearance had us both in a stellar mood uptight i shifted to try to make the dress feel more comfortable finally sitting sideways to the table in the hardbacked chair my clutch purse and shawl were at ivys empty spot trying to make it look less empty suddenly nick didnt seem so important and depressed i leaned sideways over the table as i took a bite of my sandwich trying not to get any of it on my dress the coffeemaker on the counter gurgled its last but i didnt bother to get up jenks descended from the utensil rack using his sword to cut a pixysize chunk of cheese spearing it on the tip he angled the short sword up to eat it right from the blade soooo he drawled his dust shifting to a more normal gold you never did tell me what quen wanted i froze then took another bite to give myself time to think nick had been on my mind when quen dropped me off nick demons rosewood babies quens request hadnt even been in the theoretical kitchen much less on a back burner ah he wanted to know if id take over some of his security duties tink loves a duck really it wasnt the reaction that i had expected and my chewing slowed when jenks flew to sit on the back of ivys monitor where he could see me better you told him no right i made a little huff trying to forget that surprising hug trent doesnt need my help youve worked with him tell me im wrong quen is a nervous worrywart trent can handle anything cincinnati can dish out his eyes fixed on mine jenks tilted his head and bit off a chunk of cheese sure like his best friend locking him on a boat and blowing it up demons possessing said best friend said demons exfamiliar living in his home mothering the child he had with the woman who tried to kill him last summer i sighed you think i should have said yes jenks shrugged trent always pays his bills i stared at him who are you and how did you kill my partner i asked and a faint red dust of embarrassment slipped from him last year he would have been insulting tink with a brandished sword for my even considering the idea but then again he had worked with trent to rescue his daughter head tilting the other way he plucked the last chunk of cheese from the tip and ate it licking the crumbs from his fingers cincy is a fickle woman one day youre leading her in a waltz and the next shes smacked you and is walking on your face round the clock would be an insult but someone to watch his back someone in a dress who looks like a pushover and isnt always telling him what to do yeah hed go for that his eyes met mine especially if it was you the sandwich went tasteless and i set it down two bites in id worked with trent three times the first to steal a thousandyearold elven dna sample from the everafterwhich ended badly the second to apprehend hapawhich turned out okay and the last at a museum fundraiserwhere the assassins were aiming at me not him and yet i cant do it jenks i cant work for him so work with him not for him jenks said as if that distinction was the easiest thing in the world hell if i can work with him you can sure because youre great at backup i protested but im not a backup kind of girl jenks nodded solemnly and i slumped shoving the tomato back into my sandwich trent isnt either i muttered im not going to change and im not going to delude myself that i can change him i dont know if i would if i could focus blurring i gazed past the kitchens blue curtains to the foggy night beyond good because you cant jenks dropped down his wings rustling as they lay flat on his back no one can change anyone but themselves my thoughts drifted again to the unusual hug trent had given me and then his request that i come out to talk about the abducted infants i knew the subject of security would come up again i could see it already quen forcing the issue and both trent and i staunchly against it i wasnt averse to spending time with trent and i liked kicking ass that needed kicking but either i was in charge of his security and he took direction from me or i wasnt people dont change i whispered silk sliding as i stood to get a cup of coffee you did i turned from the open cupboard to see jenks smirking at me youre a hell of a lot easier to work with than you were a few years ago he paused tinks little pink rosebuds has it only been a few years it seems like three times that the sound of coffee chattering into the porcelain was comforting and i smiled faintly he invited me out tomorrow to go over the abductions if its warm enough do you want to come i could use your take on things jenks struck a pose as if shooting from the hip pow see you never would have asked me that two years ago hell yes ill come elf babies are almost as cute as pixy newlings what time so i can get belle to watch my kids cup cradled in my hands i leaned back against the counter and winced eleven he snickered ill wake you up at nine he said then flew to the counter dust sifting silver and gold from him felix knows about nick right the is probably has an apb out on him already i bet that put slugs in trents roses i didnt tell felix i said eyes flicking to jenks and the pixys eyes widened quen didnt tell him either why the hell not he was right there what would be the point avoiding his eyes i came back to the table i cant prove anything all ive got is a hunch admittedly a pretty good hunch but still just a hunch jenks hovered at the coffeemaker to catch a drop in a pixysize cup like needing proof ever stopped you before blowing over the top i took a sip youre the one who said i was capable of change besides if theres one thing nick can do its disappear hes long gone sitting crosslegged on the coffeemaker with his cup jenks frowned and lie hes really good at that wings slipping silver dust he eyed me you should call him felix no nick jenks looked at my clutch purse youve still got his number dont you it might still work ask him if hes involved even if he lies youll be able to tell at the very least youll know if hes here or in the everafter i sat for a moment and thought about it id never bothered to take nicks number out of my phone i didnt know why maybe because i had so few friends whose number ever made it that far jenks made a getonwithit gesture and i half stood my dress pinching as i stretched across the table to reach my clutch bag okay im game jenks flew over to eavesdrop and i wondered if hed suggested it in the hopes of finding out about jax i heard a stitch give when i fell back into my chair with my purse wings clattering jenks hovered over my open phone as i scrolled his dust making the screen blank out until he moved away tinks panties why do you still have denons number in your address book jenks said and i made a face at him not only was denon no longer my boss but the man was dead entombed and burned to ash in one of cincys tunnels i helped with the last part but he got dead all on his own you got a problem with that i asked him and he held his hands up in surrender embarrassed i punched nicks number and put the phone to my ear the hum of jenkss wings was loud as he came to sit on my shoulder so he could hear i dont think its good anymore i said but then my bobbing foot stilled when the phone machine clicked on and an automated voice told me to leave a message it was generic but familiar the number was good i finally got a beep and i filled the silence with my attitude helloooo nick i said hitting the k hard you might want to consider getting a new number if youre going to be doing badguy stuff jenks flew backward off my shoulder giving me a thumbsup with both hands i saw you tonightrunning away as usual if i catch you you will be in the is lockup with a zip strip bolted to your forehead thats a promise from me to you you hear me crap for brains these are babies not a piece of antiquated piece of history no one cares about you are stealing someones child and im going to the phone clicked rachel the flat sound of my name cracked through me and my eyes darted to jenks now standing on my plate it was nick all right his tone dry and accusing the image of his narrow face scruffy stubble and casual unkempt clothes flashed through my mind and my gut tightened what had i ever seen in him but behind his rough exterior was a wickedly clever mind one that was going to get him in a hole in the ground oh i said lightly so you have a pair after all huh you left me with no recourse but to sell my soul nick said oh please i stood pacing to the other side of the kitchen with jenks hovering by my ear you sold your soul all on your own i never made you summon a demon i asked you once but you were summoning him already so im not taking the blame for that besides you dont belong to al who owns you nickie is it newt you almost deserve her there you go again he said his bitter laugh clear through the phone jumping to the wrong conclusion listen to me this time you left me with no recourse but to sell my soul thank you my lips parted i never would have met kusox any other way oh shit my gut tightened even more and jenks dropped to the counter before me pale and his wings unmoving kusox was totally deranged and psychoticalong with coddled endured and hated by his entire race as their beloved and mentally unstable attempt to circumvent the elven curse that had made them basically barren the labcreated demon had a tendency to eat people alive because he thought his soul was missing something maybe he was right nick stealing surviving rosewood babies for him wasnt for the good of his species he was up to something something really bad i had to call algaliarept my teacher had to know of this like yesterday son of a disney whore jenks whispered i spun hearing the silence of the church listen to me i said and nick snorted kusox is psychotic hell kill you as soon as he has everything he needs which is why i havent told him how to make the enzyme that keeps his babies alive nick said his voice distant god you think im stupid he wasnt really paying attention and that made me even angrier you think you have something on him i exclaimed and i heard pixy kids whisper from the hallway nick you almost deserve whats coming just stop okay stop if you stop and go away i wont have to hurt you better yet put the babies back and maybe i can get the rest of the demons to not kill you too youre not going to come out of this alive youre not the only one who wants to cheat death he said bitterly im hanging up now dont bother calling back this number isnt going to work anymore i stared at the phone as he clicked off son of a bastard i whispered knowing now why hed gone to kusox he wanted power and was hoping kusox would give it to him sweet loving son of a bastard more tired than angry i leaned against the counter my dress pulling tight against me head bowed i set the phone down with an exaggerated softness nick was going to get himself killed but not before he hurt a lot of people and broke the balance of power that kept inderland and humans from open conflict kusox was halfway to making his own army of daywalking demonsunless i did something about it my dinner sat on the table across the kitchen the two bites out of it looking odd and disconnectedcoffee and a sandwich when id been expecting to end my day with grilled salmon and tiramisu wheres my scrying mirror i said softly and jenks lit into motion darting to the open shelving under the counter lungs full of stale air i leaned to get it my dress tightened again and with a smooth motion i pulled the scrying mirror from between the demon textbooks and my favorite cookie book holding it tight to my chest i sat back down in my chair and rested it on my knees it was wrong side up the flat silver back dull and mundane im calling al i said though that was obvious he needs to know whats going on the redwinetinted glass sent sparkles through my fingertips and the tops of my legs as i arranged it right side up the silveredged etchings that id put in it catching the light and gleaming the round platesize glass holding the demon curse had been scribed with the figures to make it into sort of an interdimensional cell phone it was really beautiful and the fact that i had made it was a source of guilty pride keep your kids out in case he comes over i warned jenks but he had already chased them back into the garden and i set my right hand in the center glyph tapping a line i felt my mind expand as my awareness was dumped into the demon collective i could still see the kitchen hear the pixies playing outside but i could also hear the faint whispers of a handful of conversationsdemons in their chat room i guess it was uncomfortable but it would ease if i could get al to pick up rachel calling al come in al i thought sourly it wasnt even midnight yet he should still be up most demons kept to a witchs sleep schedule and they did sleep al had given me his bedroom after examining the closetsize room id purchased from another demon his old room had safeguards built into the walls and he didnt trust i could take care of myselfyet yo are you there your immenseness come in al i need to talk to you jenkss wings were humming and my move to look up at him was cut short when als thoughts slid into my mind somehow maintaining the slightly dry lordly tone of a british aristocrat that his verbal speech invariably had what do you want were busy we i said aloud knowing that my verbal speech would carry through the mirror reflected perfectly in my thoughts jenks wouldnt be able to hear als responses but it was polite to include him as much as i could ah me al amended his embarrassment making it through the attempted barrier that he tried unsuccessfully to erect between us what do you want im busy if its about canceling your next lesson forget it wednesday midnight or ill find you i hesitated getting the faintest impression of books and candles but his thoughts werent tinged with thoughts of the library he was in his closet of a room etching the walls with curses to make a new safe room paranoid are we ah we might have a problem i said meeting jenkss eyes and seeing his encouragement its nick how many nasty little men do you need love isnt trenton enough al thought clearly distracted you cant have him kusox would put too high a price just because its you cut him loose hes toad shit my jaw dropped hovering across from me jenkss wings dropped in pitch as he reflected my shock not knowing why you know kusox has nick i said warming and you dont care you didnt tell me of course i know and no i dont care his thought was distant as if i was only getting half his attention and i wondered what he was doing why do you if all youre after is abuse i can give it to you far more deliciously than a human i frowned at the wave of titillation hed put in his words do you have any idea what hes capable of kusox no nick i pressed my fingers more firmly into the glass he was losing interest oh for the two worlds colliding al thought clearly bothered can this wait no i said and jenks crossed his arms over his chest to mirror my distress how did kusox get nick the two of them couldnt have met before that i knew for a fact the timing was off i waited shoving needlelike thoughts of impatience at als mind threatening him until he found out for me sure enough he made a huge mental sigh thinking hold on a sec i took a breath to complain but he was gone i shudderedit felt as if i suddenly lost half my mind when the thousand halfrealized musings that go on in the back of our awareness abruptly vanished i hadnt lost my mind of course but al and i had been sharing mental space by way of the scrying mirror and i felt the loss of his background noise when he left hes checking i said then jumped as my focus blurred briefly as al came drifting back into my head ah here it is the demon muttered and i pressed my fingers against the scrying mirror to improve the connection kusox won him in a bet one concerning you actually i put my free hand to my forehead and massaged it jenks landed on the table beside me his tiny features drawn up in concern it was as id feared kusox on his own was bad enough but add in a thieving magicusing human who didnt mind getting dirty and we were in trouble won him eh i thought derisively this omnipotent crap you guys think of yourself is going to get you all killed nick is devious kusox is worse together theyre really bad als spark of amusement darted through me alien and at odds with myself he belongs to kusox that should be some consolation abject humiliation blah blah blah he somehow gave the impression of leafing through papers its all perfectly legal i doubt abject humiliation is whats going on nick is over here in reality i said and jenks smirked frowning i turned back to the mirror seeing a very faint reflection of him in its reddish depths i thought it interesting that the pixy showed up better than me did you know nick is stealing rosewood babies i said shortly and jenkss dust pooling on the mirror shifted to a sicklooking blue thriving rosewood babies nick knows the enzyme to keep them alive stole it from trent hes injecting it into them prolonging their lives then stealing them eight so far als amusement only ticked me off ah you think kusox is making little yous i dont blame him seeing as you dont like him longterm planning good for him it will keep the freak busy for a few decades first thing the brat has done right since he got out of a test tube im proud als thoughts were going distant and i pressed my hand harder into the glass until it ached with the thrum of energy running through it hes not doing this for the greater demon good i said sharply in ten years hes going to have a bunch of preadolescent very powerful daywalking demons who look to him for everything right down to their continued existence nick knows the enzyme not the cure the moment they dont get the enzyme they die you think that little fact is going to escape kusox breath held i felt al consider that a hint of worry colored his usual confidence if he were actually next to me i probably wouldnt have been able to detect it but here with our consciousness twined together it was harder to hide and just as i knew he was concerned he knew i was deadly serious mmmm he finally thought is that coffee i smell in your thoughts with an abruptness that told me he was taking me seriously he snapped our connection i sucked in my breath and jerked my head up shocked damn i whispered curling my shaking fingers under into a fist the lingering energy swirled hurting until it was reabsorbed i hate it when he leaves that fast hes coming over fingers aching i slid the mirror onto the table and stood rubbing my hands together to try to rid myself of the lingering prickles of magic scrying mirrors are like party lines this is a good thing i think you staying jenks casually cleaned his sword on a torn corner of napkin and nodded i smiled carefully setting my scrying mirror beside my cooling coffee thanks hes easier to deal with when he thinks people trust him trust the pixy held the blade up to the light and squinted at its shine i trust him all right trust him to get away with whatever he can as if on cue there was the barest tug on my awareness as al gently misted into existence without even the hint of a shift in the air appearing in the threshold he sniffed his eyes going to the steaming pot of coffee the demon was taller than me his overdone buckled boots giving him an advantage he was wearing his usual crushed green velvet frock coat with the lace at his throat and cuffs having gone on to add a matching top hat a scarf to protect against the nights mist a cane he didnt need and his usual round bluetinted glasses they did little to hide his red goatslitted eyes and i knew he didnt need them to see with al was all about show and he liked the image of a bygone british nobleman racheeel he drawled eyeing me over his glasses as he loosened his scarf and came in boots grinding leftover circlesalt into the linoleum sweats at your trial gowns in your kitchen you simply must learn how to dress yourself properly or did you go all out for me his expression souring he gave jenks a disparaging glance jenks wrinkled his nose in disgust at the rank smell of burnt amber now permeating the air sweet everloving tink he said rising up and holding his nose dramatically havent you learned how to take a shower yet you smell like a burning tire stop it i said knowing al couldnt help it the everafter stank like burnt amber and it rubbed off on you i still noticed it but it didnt seem to have the same impact anymore which bothered me for some reason i didnt get dressed up for you i said hoping the pixies stayed out i havent had time to change from my ah date is all al pulled his baredteeth smile from jenks mellowing as he turned to me is that so wanting to improve his mood i went to get him a coffee al propped his cane in the corner and sat in ivys chair by the door knowing it was the throne of the room settling himself with a pompous air he shook out his sleeves and took a deep breath to speak i spun when six pixies came burst in shouting about something or other jenks rose up but as soon as they saw al they flew out screaming jenks shrugged and al grinned to show me his flat blocky teeth you do have an interesting life he said fluffing the lace at his cuffs now about nicholas gregory sparagmos stealing rosewood babies how sure are you that hes not collaborating with trent shocked i almost sloshed his cup over pretty sure trent seemed as angry as i was when we met at the crime scene you wore that to a crime scene no wonder they dont take you seriously al rolled his eyes dramatically and frowning i extended his coffee to him his eyebrows rose at the rainbow mug and in a huff i sat down beside my uneaten sandwich and pushed it away he was eyeing the cold cuts still out and i gestured for him to help himself coffee id get him but if he wanted a sandwich he was going to have to make it himself pinkie extended he sipped from his rainbow mug his eyes closing in what had to be bliss oh this is marvelous rachel you have made a capital cup al about nick i said impatiently and al set his coffee aside rubbing his hands in anticipation as he went to the center counter trent wouldnt help him he doesnt want to see more rosewood babies turning into demons any more than i do standing behind the counter al shook water off the lettuce looking odd in his silk and velvet trent has been known to work with nicholas gregory sparagmos before he said using his full name to denote his familiar status the tricky elf freed kusox from the prison we put him in he allowed nicholas gregory sparagmos to escape from his lockdown al put a gloved finger to his nose sounds suspicious i frowned chin lifted as i refused to let his doubt poison me trent didnt let nick go he was abducted by a demon probably one that nick called for that very reason and probably the same one kusox got him from you sound proud of the little man al drawled and my lips parted when with a tug on my awareness and a cascading sheet of everafter the vision of a british nobleman vanished replaced with a heartstoppingly familiar vision of nick son of a disney whore jenks whispered but id gone cold seeing nick with his thin build shaggy mop of dark hair and sparse stubble al even had the faded jeans tatty sneakers black tshirt with the lumberjackstyle shirt open and hanging loosely over his narrow shoulders a chill went through me as he layered cold cuts on white bread looking like nick until he blew me a kiss and winked at me with his goatslitted eyes with a confidence only al could command thats not funny i said ahh you do hate him his voice was his own and i shivered as al put a last slice of bread atop his pile seeing me turn away he sent a second shiver of everafter over himself and was back to his usual appearance good for you rachel he said as he brought his sandwich to the table hate is all that keeps us alive when love is gone youre almost there not quite ready to let it go yet sitting he took a large bite god slay me this is good shaken from the reminder of nick i crossed my knees so you believe weve got a problem he bobbed his head not letting go of his sandwich to take a sip of his coffee we might he said downing half of it in one go but you understand i simply cannot go to dali with your scary bedtime story of killer demon babies jenkss wings clattered in disgust i too wasnt happy my foot starting to bob kusox hasnt done anything against the law that is our law al said one hand holding his sandwich the other his coffee especially if these children are potentially demons its the first time hes ever shown a hint of an interest in seeing our species regain its health and should be applauded as for nick hes just a human mostly harmless outraged i stood al you are underestimating the danger here yes nick is just a human but hes not afraid to do things that might kill him if he thinks the risk is good you cant fight something like that will you just listen to me how come no one listens to me is it the dress i snapped my anger misplaced but real maybe the curves if i shaved my head and dressed like newt would you take me seriously then the demons chewing paused as he sent his eyes over my shape silent as he took a sip of coffee now now no need to go to extremes he said softly where is the proof that hes planning mischief itchy witch my shoulders slumped if he was calling me itchy witch he believed me believed the danger and that was all i wanted i talked to him he as much as admitted so red goatslitted eyes showing over his glasses al made a bland face you talked to kusox i blinked god no nick ahh clearly relieved he took a bite of sandwich then you have nothing he mumbled around his full mouth frustrated i slumped back into my chair my elbow just missing my scrying mirror jenkss dust sifting down seemed to fall through the glass but i was too frustrated to care oh very well al grumped with bad grace i suppose youll be badtempered until i talk to dali ill do it in the morninghes crankier than you if he doesnt get his beauty sleep my head came up and i smiled glad i had him to go to then i wondered how id gotten to the point where going to a demon was a good thing thanks i said meaning it al stood coffee in one hand halfeaten sandwich in the other indeed he said then vanished in a wash of everafter his cane in the corner went with him and then my eyes darted to the counter when the coffeepot popped out hey i shouted but it was too late my fingers drummed once in discontent but i could sympathize you couldnt get a cup of decent coffee in the everafter for any amount of money id pick the coffeepot up wednesday but experience told me that a rank burntamber smell would taint the coffee for weeks what an ass jenks scoffed he took our coffeemaker shrugging i went to open the window ill get a new one tomorrow on the way out to trents the slider moved up with its accustomed ease and i stood a moment listening to the pixies playing in the night as the stink of demons filtered out my thoughts went to nick and my heart hardened he had lied to me misled me and betrayed me time and again id warned him and i wouldnt feel guilty for whatever happened you going to call ivy jenks asked and i turned my arms around my middle as i looked at her empty chair and her shutdown computer anything left open was going to smell like everafter and i bent to get the trash can out from under the sink my first impulse was yes seeing as she would like a piece of nicks ass in a glass as much as me but shed tell glenn and glenn didnt work for the fib anymore he had retired after finding out that hapa had infiltrated the fib refusing to work for a company he couldnt trust implicitly and moving to flagstaff with daryl in the hopes that the higher elevation and cleaner air would help the nymph calling ivy would only get them all in a turmoil pinning the trash bin against the center counter i ran my arm over the counter throwing away the food that was open no i said and i met jenkss eyes when he clattered his wings in disapproval its the first time shes ever done anything healthy in her relationships i said not sure it was the right thing to do im not going to screw it up shell be back in a week jenkss dust shifted from an uneasy green to a more neutral silver yeah maybe youre right he said as he flew to sit on the windowsill to watch his kids but it didnt feel right chapter four if i were to die and come back as a horse id want to be a horse in trents stables the stalls were large the hay sweet smelling and the layout set to funnel the wind from the pasture right through it all to create the sensation of an open pavilion tucking a strand of hair back under my hat i gave molly a pat running my hand down her side to feel the swallow of air shed taken in to inflate herself so the saddle wouldnt be so binding id have to walk her until she released it before i tightened the cinch a final time molly youre a sweet horse but predictable i said as i turned her around in the expansive box stall and walked her into the corridor around me were contented snuffs grindings and flicking of ears and tails we werent in the wing where trent kept his racehorses no these were the animals he kept for the hunt and they were far more intelligent and levelheaded my boots were silent on the sawdust as i headed for the north paddock in the background was ceris high serious voice going over our route with the stable manager as soon as jenks got back with trent and ray wed be taking the river path where we could stay in the shelter of the oldgrowth forest the latemorning sun was high and it was unusually hot outside but the upper housing units caught most of the rays to leave the open stables cool i couldnt help but be reminded of campthough i didnt recall a lot of it i did remember the stables my endurance had been nil then and the horses had made me feel strong though seemingly sure of himself trent had been anything butuntil i told him to stop letting lee bully him and stand up for himself they found lee in the camp well three days later maybe trent listened to me more than i thought my faint caffeine headache was finally easing and i grabbed my togo cup for the last swallows it had gone cold and tossing the empty cup in the trash barrel i came out blinking into the sun molly clopping behind me seeing quen already there with lucy waiting for us i smiled quen was standing sideways with lucy on his hip making a striking statement in his blackandgreen riding clothes a big gray horse hung his huge head over quens shoulder snuffing at lucys bonnet the little girl was sweet in her white riding outfit the picture of privilege as her chubby hands reached up to the unfamiliar brim her expression was pinched in annoyance as she tried to pull it off so as to see it the little girl had trents looks and ellasbeths attitude and when the curious horse blew out his breath the little girl squealed reaching for his floppy lips you need your hat today lucy quen said moving before lucy could get a grip on the horse we dont want to have to ask aunt rachel to spell your sunburn away aunt rachel i liked that and squinting despite my hat i ambled forward with molly i would you know i said touching lucys softsoled shoe and beaming at the little girl now shouting out nonsense just to hear herself talk even if it took a curse to do it my gaze lifted to quens shouldnt they be back by now quen peered at the height of the sun give or take a few here he said holding lucy out to me your cinch is loose i know i said then dropped mollys reins as i found myself suddenly holding a squishy surprisingly heavy small person she smelled like snickerdoodles and i laughed when she wiggled almost jumping in my arms i was going to walk her to get her to exhale first i said scrambling to get my hats strap out of lucys mouth she let go already head lowered quen eased the cinch up a notch molly flicked an ear sighing he gave her a pat and reached for lucy now patting my neck where my tattoo was realizing she was trying to say flower i grinned she was only a year old but elves grew up fast not like witches who jenks swore were not able to be on their own until they were thirty ahem theyre just over the hill quen said as he took her back his smile making his few wrinkles fold in and hide his pox scars evaluating the threeyearolds practicing the gate oh i didnt really know exactly what he meant but i could guess hes quite good at reading them quen was saying as i gazed over the nearby hill hes like his father there quen turned to the hill expectantly at the soft rumble of hooves kal was extraordinary on a horse he had a knack for knowing what it was thinking and countering it with just the right amount of force i looked up from playing peekaboo with lucy and quen seemed to straighten thats him now he said softly then turned to the stables ceri hes back my eyebrows rose at the informal hail but being around horses tended to do that to a person big horses with jockeys looking like children on their backs were coming over the hill in pairs highstepping and sending up puffs of dust from the soft path i didnt see trent yet but clearly practice was done the clop of hooves turned me around ceri was beaming as she looked up from adjusting her boot the sun glowing in her hair caught back in a veilhat kind of thing she was utterly beautiful in her proper english riding outfit sitting atop her horse with a happy air about her green eyes squinting she was both breathless in anticipation and relaxed in the saddle the voices of the jockeys became louder and her mount backed up nervous as the adjacent paddock filled with an aggressive energy do you have lucy love she asked quen as she calmed her horse and the older poxscarred man looked down at the little girl his own mount didnt care about the spirited stallions and feisty mares calmly twitching an ear at them down lucy whined twisting until she could reach her hat down down ill take her ceri demanded but quen only smiled a private smile and handed her to me instead it was then that jenks showed up and i almost dropped the little girl when lucy squealed reaching for the little funny man with wings who managed to stay just out of her reach jeez jenks i exclaimed scrambling for a hold as the little girl wiggled if she ever gets a hold on you im going to sell tickets back up will you awww she wont hurt me he said but he hovered unmoving until i could hand the slightly squishy lucy up to her mom or ceri or whatever technically speaking lucy and ray didnt share a drop of common blood and the only thing that linked them were their perfect uncropped and somewhat pointy ears but still ceri was cooing over lucy adjusting her bonnet as i checked the cinch again and swung myself up immediately i felt taller as molly took three steps to the gate before i pulled her back lastminute details were being sorted out as ceri settled lucy before her and talked to the stable managerdiaper bag water sunscreen phones checked for a proper chargebut it was trent my attention was on he had come in last with ray sitting in front of him and he was accompanied by a heavy small man on a sedate quarter horse quite simply trent looked amazing on tulpa the same horse i remembered from camp the tall black would be ancient by now but being trents familiar had extended his life span sort of a capacitor for highvoltage magic as well as allowing trent to reach a ley line when surrounded by water his back to me trent discussed something with his manager seeing him there ray sitting before him the picture of wealth and privilege i felt something catch in me it wasnt just that he looked good but that he was comfortable at peace without the mask of perfection that he felt he needed everywhere else molly flicked an ear at jenks and the pixy landed right between them yeah the elf looks good on a horse he said dryly but hes mean to them my gaze jerked from trent to jenks mean jenks nodded using his heel to scratch molly between her ears mind games remind me not to piss him off hes good at them little cookie maker i took a breath to ask him to explain but he darted off to lucy the little girl was calling to him shrieking at the top of her lungs for inks inks ceri was looking harried and i wondered how long it would be until she gave her back to quen mind games i breathed and trent looked up as if hearing me across the distance his eyes met mine briefly in acknowledgment then went back to the manager no i want her across from managed detail not out of his sight he was saying gesturing to a stable hand where he goes she goes three steps behind we made progress but it will mean nothing if she thinks the rules apply only on the track the stable hand lugged a bucket of water out and tulpa nosed him before dropping his head and sucking it in i want red right across from managed detail in a box stall trent said his eyes again flicking to me he is to be lavished with attention for at least an hour starting now and then special treats on the hour until sunset i want her so frustrated and jealous that she does exactly what ben tells her next time mind games yes sir the manager said squinting up at him and we all looked at a fierytempered horse only now coming into the paddock she was high stepping and beautiful her jockey needing every ounce of his attention to keep her in bounds frustrated id say she was that already it was obvious to me she was pissed shed been held back when everyone else got to go back to the stables the wailing of an ambulance drew my attention to the nearby service road and everything became more serious seeing it the manager sighed shes not a bad horse sir shes magnificent trent frowned as red squealed and snapped at the horse next to her but if she doesnt learn that playing with others is more fun than playing alone we will be the only two to know it trenton ceri cajoled a hand to her eyes the sun is getting hot and the girls will be napping before we get to the woods trent raised his hand acknowledging her then turned back to his manager were done with practice tomorrow take her and managed detail on a ride and let them go he has more endurance and can bring her to exhaustion shell gate next time pulling tulpa together he angled to the gate between the two paddocks a stable hand ran to open it turning trent looked over his shoulder treats every hour he reminded him dont forget and i want a call as soon as you know how bens collarbone is the manager jotted a note on his clipboard yes sir and keep her away from everyone else i want managed detail her best frenemy the older man smiled yes sir enjoy your ride molly barely moved an ear as trent rode up but my heart gave a thump blinking i looked away pretending to fix my boot but taking sideways glances at him damn he looked good his trim physiqueusually only hinted at underneath a suitdefined and definite in the jeans and button shirt he had on i think normally he would be in full english garb but he had dressed down either for gate practice or me i didnt mind i rather liked seeing that wisp of chest hair and his muscles moving behind his shirtsleeves ray looked sweet beyond description in her sturdy pale green riding dress complete with white leggings soft boots and matching hat happily playing with the bells woven into tulpas mane seeing her there only layered paternal over everything and hit just about every button i had no working for trent would be a mistake a big mistake ready he said the sun and wind in his hair and jenks snorted rising up from lucy and making the little girl whine rather ceri said as she nudged her horse into motion toward the far gate a hand waited to open it for us red is not suited for the track dear why do you insist on tormenting that animal waiting for quen to go first trent smiled you have to admit my methods have good results yes but why ceri insisted her hand gentle on the reins as she angled her horse closer to me let red be who she is shes better tempered to the hunt and will make a magnificent courser trent turned in the saddle to look behind him at the stables that mare is going to break womens hearts and mens fortunes ceri i want the world to know her name she will never be forgotten confused i turned to quen red the man brought his eyes back from the edge of the woods where hed been scanning always on alert her papered name is kalamacks sunrise surprise but we call her red really i looked at trent his horse predictably out front because of her color thats original quen leaned closer with a creak of leather no her attitude red zone danger wed put a red collar on her if everyone didnt know to look out for her already she bit trent three hours after she was foaled passing through the gate to open field trent looked at his hand ruefully clearly having heard us oh i said softly and jenks snickered coming to a landing on my saddle horn dropping down he sat crosslegged his wings glinting and his head drooping in the hot sun with a soft clicking ceri encouraged her horse to come even with trents and we went two by two we were almost to the woods and i was eager for the shade theres nothing wrong with anonymity if one is the best at their art ceri insisted the horse is a born hunter let her be they rode side by side the girls they shared between them reaching out to touch each other if she doesnt gate tomorrow i will let her be trent said reaching across the space to kiss the top of ceris hand in a formal acquiescence seeing them there i glanced at quen his eyes were tired but the only other emotion i saw was a fond pleasure that both ceri and trent were happy in their familiar but platonic relationship he was secure in his love for ceri and it was obvious that though ceri liked trent her heart belonged to the older man somehow it all worked but even though the girls and their past bound them all together i was dogged by the feeling that though trent was a part of this he would forever be somewhat sidelined his future demanded so much of him that love was a luxury his fortune couldnt buy and it bothered me because i thought he not only knew it but accepted it as normal smiling with the surety of the devil ceri drew her hand from trent i would have a private world with rachel trenton jenks opened an eye and i felt a sliver of concern at her soft confidence private word about what what had i done now just girl talk she added but her tone concerned me she had something on her mind of course trent nudged tulpa into a faster pace as ceri drew her mount in i glanced at quen worried when his brow pinched refusing to look at me he nudged his horse ahead jenks flew up saying youre on your own before he darted off to join the elves i havent done anything i muttered grimacing at his chiming laughter floating back sighing i looked over at ceri seeing the faint blush of anger on her as we slipped under the welcoming shade of the woods the path was steep and we said nothing as the horses scrambled up lucy was still in ceris lap and the little girl was struggling to stay awake ahead of us trent and quen rode with soft masculine murmurs drifting between them maybe her flush had only been from the sun lucy looks sweet today i said and her grip on the reins tightened nope guess not quen told me you refused to help keep trenton safe she said coming right out with it my breath caught and then i exhaled yeah i probably owed her an explanation trent doesnt need me to babysit him i said voice low and i wont insult him by doing so her eyes widened insult him rachel we are teetering on the brink of extinction and youre worried that extra security will insult him lucy shouted her voice echoing against the underside of the canopy as she mirrored ceris outburst wincing i begged her with my eyes to lower her voice his actions impact our entire species ceri said yes but theyre all looking to him now reclaiming lucy solidified his standing if he dies it will be the withons who chart the next fifty years and theyd have us hiding in closets and cropping our ears again i couldnt even catch her eye i think quen was laughing the bastard we cant survive another five decades hiding we must come out and trenton needs protection you think the vampires are happy about this no i managed to get in you think anyone is you are a demon she shouted and i flinched looking up the path where trent and quen plodded along jenks rose up amid a sparking of gold dust and darted off at surveillance height but thankfully no one turned around you are a daywalking demon and as such you are the best person possible save quen for keeping him alive we all have our tasks and what we want needs to be set aside to meet them why are you being so selfish selfish i grimaced when trent glanced back to make sure we were okay i knew her anger was a mix of worry for trent and her ironclad upbringing that personal desire was a distant second to political need but seeing her spouting off when she had her happy ending and trent was being asked to sacrifice what he wanted for everyone else rankled you just got done telling trent to let red be who she is i said allowing a hint of my own anger to show and now youre saying everyone should be what some big plan dictates she was flushed but i knew she enjoyed our shouting matches since i was the only one who would yell back at her and if i was honest id admit i enjoyed them too red is a horse rachel she said pointedly trent is poised to lead an entire society he has healthy children political and monetary advantage everyone from the vampires to the humans would like to see the elves die out he needs protection i dont care if hes insulted a martyr wont save our species i understand that i said knowing she wasnt angry at me but that outside forces were threatening the one spot of peace in her long heartbreaking life then why wont you do it she asked her horse prancing because of her tension i dont know what i want ceri ceri hesitated and then her eyes widened sitting atop my horse i went hot i dont know what i want had i really just shouted that what you want ceri echoed the clops of the horses silent beneath us by the goddess you like him mother pus bucket when did that happen hearing als cuss phrase come out of her was a shock and flustered i scrambled for something to say uh i hedged praying that neither quen nor trent turned around i think somewhere between him slugging eloy and pie but it doesnt change anything it changes everything she said her upright stance returning as she thought the possibilities over all for the state yes but she was a romantic at heart and i could see where she was going damn it she was thinking again i had to stop this and stop it now ceri look at me i pleaded ive had four relationships in two years one was a thief one died as a political gift one walked away because i was shunned and the last is a slave in the everafter i know you think this is perfect but i come with a lot of baggage and it would be a mistake to work for him i looked up seeing the concern on her face as deep as her excitement had been hed end up dead because of me and you know it a wisp of pity showed in her eyes as she set lucys bonnet straight maybe youre right it was what i wanted to hear but it kind of hurt its simply that trent is so important she said voice wistful as she stared into space i know he feels he can ward off any attack but he needs to set his pride aside hes more than he ever was more than just himself there was a lump in my throat and i wasnt sure why yes trent had always been more than just himself but that wasnt what he wanted to be i knew how that felt the flash of jenkss dust over quen and trent caught my attention and i wasnt surprised when both of them pulled their mounts up short concern pushed out everything else when quens horse nickered feeling the tension of his rider trent was gazing into the canopy and both ceri and i urged our horses into a faster pace to catch up theres something in the woods the pixy said as we joined them and a chill dropped down my spine the birds are agitated and the small mammals are hiding ceri held lucy closer quen she questioned and he shook his head clearly at a loss as he scanned the trees i shivered and the sundappled shadows became fraught with doubt reaching out i tapped a line filling my chi and then spindling enough energy in my head to make a circle around all of us its probably just nick i said but molly had felt my tension and was now stomping immediately ceri seemed to lose her concern the slimy little worm she said sourly quen call security to dispatch him immediately the thought of him here makes me ill ah i talked to al last night about nick i started trent bobbed his head as if not surprised but quen turned in the saddle to face me straight on an accusing look in his eyes and see i was going to tell you all at once i said fidgeting with mollys reins jenks had darted away and both girls were wiggling to find him kusox owns him won him in a bet tulpa pranced in place giving away trents tension i wondered he said softly eyes on the canopy nick gained the labs once he could do it again i know for a fact it isnt hapa damn hes making demons i didnt often hear trent swear and i nodded uneasily thats what i think too i said quietly in twenty years kusox will have at least eight daywalking demons who look to him for their very survival quen glanced at trent and trent nodded its up to twelve now trent said and quen took ray from him the little girl settling in before her birth father with a serious air about her this is what i was afraid of ceri im sorry but we are cutting our ride short trenton she protested you and quen head back to the stables with the girls if nick is here rachel and i will draw him out im the one hes after im the only one who can make the cure permanent ceri began turning her horse around but quen was unmoving his horse blocking the path ahead of us its not your place to draw out danger sahan i too wasnt keen on this plan but for another reason ah i dont think the cure is what kusox wants trent pulled tulpa up short the black snorting at the rough motion if kusox didnt want the cure nick wouldnt be in the woods he said words clipped and yes its my place to draw out danger just as its rachels expertise to crush it he looked at me we will continue on oh i was all for crushing danger but this was moving too fast maybe id picked up more of ivys cautious planning than id thought jenks i shouted and got a wing chirp back quen its only nick ceri said clearly wanting to get the girls out of the woods and possible danger but still quen stood there this is an illconceived plan we dont know if its nick what if its someone else the corner of trents eye twitched and he looked irate as tulpa trotted in place under him you dont trust rachels skills he said and i winced you went behind my back to buy them quen clearly angry he added in a softer voice i cant risk any of you go let me do my job rachel easing up on his hold on tulpa he let the horse bolt quen jerked his horse back from following his expression as angry and dark as id ever seen it before him ray was silent but lucy was wailing her distress shrugging i gave molly a nudge i glanced behind us to see quen turning his horse back to the stables ceri sitting tall in her saddle with lucy waiting for her love to join her i agreed with trent they had a perfect life a perfect love when theyd both resigned themselves to having neither it needed to be protected trent was silent when i joined him and we continued on my shoulders were tense and i listened to the wind in the tops of the trees their new leaves pale green and rustling jenks was up there somewhere he had my back the silence stretched and i glanced at trent his jaw was tight and the sun caught his hair in a comeandgo fashion something other than nick was on his mind his fierce determination reminding me of his satisfaction when he turned that hapa member into a deformed twisted mockery of a demon here nicky nicky nicky tulpa was a larger horse and he was stepping out farther than molly could comfortably walk trent was too distracted to notice jenks dropped down and trent absently corrected the uptight stallion when he shied used to it molly contented herself with flicking an ear something is in the woods huh i said as jenks landed on the saddle pommel do you know how creepy that is his sword was loosened in its scabbard but he hadnt pulled it i dont know how else to say it rache im going to do a z axis until i see quen and ceri make it out of the woods theres nothing ahead of you for another quarter mile trent shook himself out of his funk you couldnt have scouted a quarter mile that fast thats right jenks said grinning you just keep thinking that he turned to me as he took wing ill stay within earshot something isnt right thanks jenks he zipped straight up to rise high enough to see when quen and ceri broke free of the trees and i nudged molly into a short canter to catch up with tulpa sighing trent drew tulpa into a slower pace the black horse snorting in impatience thank you i appreciate you doing this with me he said his low voice blending perfectly with the leaves stirring in me like the wind in my hair and here i had just gotten done telling ceri i wouldnt work with him youre welcome if i hadnt then ceri would have refused to leave his profile showing his concern he tucked a wayward lock of his hair away you really should think about including a pixy clan in your security i added trent looked up into the canopy thats what you keep saying then maybe you should listen i shot back tulpa had already resumed his faster pace and it irritated me or at least do a cost analysis or something pulling tulpa up short trent smiled with half his mouth molly stopped as well and a sudden memory exploded in me brought forth by the tension the dappled sun even the shadowed air drawing goose bumps he had been lanky and insecure with youth and i had been awkward and overly confident with the first hints of health but tulpa had been the same and i had been irate that hed gotten a larger horse than me and i couldnt keep up what he asked and i put a hand to my cold face um i said scrambling ceri might be right molly shifted under me and trent reached out i froze as he tucked a stray strand of hair behind my ear his fingers brushing the rim of my hat about what my heart was pounding that youd be good at being king of the elves his hand dropped and i breathed again head bowing he looked at his fingers laced among the reins i can be both what i need to be and what i want to be but it was soft and i wasnt sure he believed it i tried that and it didnt work i said the reins slipping through my fingers as molly stretched to crop at the spindly grass surviving under the shade it didnt work for batman either trent didnt look up and i blurted at least you have something worth fighting for trent ive been meaning to ask if you would like to choose a horse from my herd he interrupted me one who would be designated as yours for when you ride with us i still owe you a proper hunt my eyebrows rose more because of the change of subject than the offer we are sitting here in the middle of nowhere waiting to be attacked and you offer me a horse tulpa sighed making trent shift his seat we can talk more about your conversation with ceri if you like oh god no sure id love a horse i said feeling the need to give molly a pat im not really into the hunt though i remembered the sound of the hounds the heartstopping fear that they might catch me is he nuts he nudged tulpa into motion and molly followed if you change your mind let me know ceri would love another feminine presence on the field she says we men lack style in running down prey ill bet i might just do that i said if only to get you to stop giving me molly all the time trents smile warmed me all the way to my center it was true and honest and he was smiling at me stop it rachel whats wrong with molly nothing but you keep giving me a horse i cant possibly win with his face lost all expression as he thought that over then his eyes narrowed you cant have red shes not in the herd you may choose from it sounded like a rather formal statement the fiery horse was way out of my league and i hadnt even been thinking about her why not i teased shes sweet trent stiffened but he wasnt looking at me under him tulpa snorted and with a sudden shock i felt a huge drop in the nearest ley line jenks pattered through the leaves wreathed in a haze of silver sparkles hey someone just made a huge bubble between here and the stables it poked above the turnblasted trees i stared at trent nick cant make a bubble bigger than three feet ceri trent whispered the girls trent i exclaimed my hand outstretched but hed already wheeled tulpa around with a word i didnt recognize he urged him into a full gallop in an instant he was gone the thudding of his hooves fading molly snorted as i jerked her to follow head tossing when i kicked her into a gallop hanging on low to her back and knees flexing i pushed her down the trail i needed a faster horse chapter five cerrrri trents voice raised in summons jerked my attention and i yanked molly to a halt just off the path was a clearing the winding shaded stream wed been paralleling beyond it the fresher wind shifted my hair bringing the scent of burned grass and decaying vegetationand spent magic tingling like ozone before a lightning strike there were two ugly burn marks and a large circle pressed into the tall grass and the line i was connected to seemed to hum with the reminder of an energy draw the fastmoving stream chattered among the rocks and tree roots and i stifled a flash of fear when i saw trent crouched over quen tulpa standing a watchful guard it was probably the same stream that id stumbled through once to lose the hounds chasing me hie i shouted giving molly my heels and she jumped forward neck arching and hooves stepping high when her footing unexpectedly turned spongy the lowlying area surrounded by craggy trees looked as if it flooded often the grass that wasnt burned was tall three trees managed to survive the wet ground but they were spindly and let a lot of light through especially this early in the spring jenks hovered over quen his dust seeming to melt into him as i came to a fast stop beside them ray sat in the crook of quens twisted body her little hands clutching her fathers jacket she was too scared to cry quen was unconscious no signs of attack but for a slight burn on his hands his aura is intact jenks said as he darted to me but its doing something really weird shifting outside its normal color spectrum like it doesnt have a clear connection to his soul anymore worried i unfocused my attention to bring my second sight into play molly quivered as if feeling it and i looked down trents aura was its usual gold with sparkles around his hands and head a deeper slash of red running in the thin spots and a new shiny white at the center id not seen before quens was a dull green that mutated to red then an orange as i watched whoa still holding my second sight i looked away shivering the sunbaked surface of the everafter overlaid itself atop reality a dry streambed and sparse grass running to the distant profiles of broken buildings where cincinnati would be there were no demons no eyes watching and i let go of my second sight trembling as i maintained my hold on the ley line thats not right i said and trent stood his eyes were haunted and his hands cupped about his mouth ceri he shouted again but the silence was broken only by the sound of the water and wind ceri wasnt here nor were the horses jenks rose up on a column of purple dust as i slid down my knees protesting how bad is he hurt is he okay i said as i crouched beside them ray made a sob that was too old for her and i reached out as she leaned toward me falling into my arms no i froze where i crouched rays grip tightened and she twisted on my hip to see her dads still she didnt cry red wet cheeks under deep green eyes what had she seen turning trent squinted into the surrounding woods ceri he called again his voice holding fear now i held my breath listening there was a burn mark on the closest tree the part that hadnt hit it spreading out behind in a long trail thered been a fightshort but powerful demons shes not answering trent muttered his hair fell into his eyes as he looked down cell phone in hand and i stumbled to my feet when he shoved it at me call the gatehouse the number is there have them send the med copter stay with quen i have to find ceri and lucy they could be hurt and unable to respond his leaving wasnt a good idea and i resettled ray on my hip when she reached for him small sounds of distress coming from her trent jenkss wings clattered stay here he said hovering between both of us quen silent at our feet i can cover more ground faster than you can trent looked awful his grace mutated by fear no turning he broke into a jog for the nearby trees i took a hesitant step but jenks was faster and before trent could even get past the horses the pixy was in his face dripping a silvertinted red dust hey the pixy shouted and rays whimpering cut off i said stay put whoever did this might still be out there mr kingoftheworld and i can cover ten times more ground than you you got me wings clattering he stared trent down stay here and call your ambulance quens aura is freaking out he needs help my heart thudded but trent hesitated and finally with a groan of frustration he spun back to quen his head down to hide his eyes as he returned he held his hand out for his phone and i swear i felt a tingle of magic as he took it in his cold fingers do you know a healing charm i asked not knowing one myself id been afraid to learn and al wouldnt teach me lest i do something worse to myself than the burn or cut i would use it to fix i did it already he said flipping his phone open as he dropped down to kneel beside quen thats when his aura started cycling but it did get his pulse to even out not even a bird disturbed the silence and awkward with ray on my hip i knelt as well reaching for quens wrist his pulse is thready i said and i shifted rays weight when i leaned to pull quens lids back dilation is normal i said at a loss my hand was tingling and disconcerted i pulled back ray began to protest and i stood its trent trent said into his phone his voice iron hard all hint of his fear hidden weve had an accident i need the med copter out at the stables now you have a medical copter he didnt even look at me his eyes scanning the nearby trees as if wanting to be among them searching inform the university hospital we might be bringing quen in i suspect a demon attack yes in the daylight ceri and lucy are missing i want the dogs in the woods running a rescue pattern as soon as possible focus on the river path he hesitated and i saw him struggle to keep his face steady i will be out of contact for several hours questions he closed the phone breathing raggedly hurry up jenks i stood my shadow covering quens pale face it made his pox scars stand out i couldnt do anything if he was bleeding i could stop the blood if he had a concussion i could treat him for shock if he was delusional i could sit on him until help arrivedbut this i didnt know what to do and i found i was rocking back and forth with ray she was silent her beautiful dark green eyes scared maybe ceri made it back to the stables i said turning to the burn marks the horses are gone trent was taking quens pulse again i called before you got here his voice was even distracted the horses came in riderless ceri never would have left quen and yet she was gone damn it quen had tried to stop them i should have been here i could have helped it doesnt mean that demons took them i said flushing when trent looked up his anger obvious ray turned her eyes tracking jenks as he darted back from under the trees his dust was almost nonexistent i did a circle two hundred yards out he said no sign of them then do a wider one i said and he frowned i didnt go out any farther because theres a circle burn were in the center shit quen couldnt make a circle that big even under stress neither could ceri it was demon made if theres a demon circle then theyve been taken he finished and trents hands clenched kusox i needed to talk to al and i turned to the horses thinking of my scrying mirror hours away id been promising myself id make a compact version and i cursed myself for having put it off i was completely out of contact with the everafter it couldnt be kusox i whispered just wanting it to be anyone else its daylight and hes cursed to stay in the everafter hes working through nick trent stood up this is my fault fault it was no ones fault dont start i said harshly and jenks hummed his wings nervously my tone brought trent up short and his eyes narrowed as he focused on me no i mean it i said jiggling ray on my hip kusox could have as easily been going for you maybe he didnt because i was with you in which case it would be my fault they were taken oh god ceri and lucy with kusox was too terrifying to think about you dont understand this is my fault trent said his voice angry i never should have left them i thought i was his target i sent them into danger not away from it he looked at me anguish in his green eyes he took them why i was right there because youre an emancipated familiar i said numb and almost sick to my stomach ceri was freed but you were emancipated the papers had been filed and there was no way he could get away with it like he can with ceri trent give me a chance to look into it and get ceris papers signed and filed lucy is my godchild i think that comes under the leavingmeandminealone deal we have i hope we can get them back teeth clenched he turned away another look of guilt slithered over his face im the only person who can make the rosewood cure permanent he said head down so the sun couldnt reach his eyes it shouldve been me i was ready if it had been me his voice cracked and he stared at the river it flowed uncaring before us like the chaos that was running through his mind always moving never silent i hovered over quen as i remembered that hug last night it had been unusual especially in front of the newspeople had trent known this might happen and had been trying to keep me from being a suspect up until recently i would have loved to see him in jail he took her to make me comply he said flatly rachel i cant do that i vowed to see to the survival of the elves a resurgence of demons might be our end maybe not theres the i cant he shouted and i became silent i was ready to give my life to keep the secret of the demons survival out of their hands i was not ready to give theirs well get them back i said as i shifted rays weight but even i knew it was only something to say the doing would be harder a faint thumping of a helicopters blades sounded in the late morning air and trent looked at his watch then the woods i touched his shoulder finding it rock hard its going to be okay he jerked from me and my resolve strengthened im telling you if kusox has them they will be okay god please let them be okay he spun the sound of the chopper blades growing how he barked the demon is sadistic and psychotic he does things because he enjoys it not for power or money but because he enjoys it then maybe you shouldnt have let him go from under the st louis arch i thought but to say it wouldnt do any good hed freed kusox to save me trent ive been where you are now its going to be okay give me a chance to talk to al well get the papers filed and get them back in the meantime they will be safe will you look at me he finally looked up the anguish he was trying to hide stopping me cold i held ray tighter and the little girl began to fuss pardon me if i dont share your trust of demons trust has nothing to do with it i shouted and tulpa flattened his ears i know hes psychotic but he is not stupid and hes not going to eat his bargaining chip trent glared up at the circling copter ignoring me how would they even know where to land ceri knows demons i said she will keep lucy safe she has her soul and that makes all the difference i promise ill find out what happened we have a space we need to think please give me a chance to do something he wasnt looking at me his jaw set and his manner closed i didnt know if id made things better or worse jenks he said suddenly they will have to land in the pasture and walk in youre the fastest person here will you tell them where we are frowning i shifted ray higher we didnt have time for this i didnt know what quens aura was doing but it wasnt normal are those trees important to you i asked trent suddenly and he looked at me blankly even jenks hesitated your dad didnt kiss your mom under them or anything trent shook his head no jaw clenched i pulled heavily on the ley line ray jumped as if smacked but she wasnt crying so i narrowed my focus and pushed it into my hand adsimulo calefacio i shouted throwing the curse at the nearest tree superheating the sap in an instant the tree exploded and i spun shielding ray with my body bits of bark and sharp splinters struck my back the horses scattered with the muted sound of hooves hey give me some warning jenks shrilled as the last of the branches fell back to earth and trent looked up from where he had hastily covered quen the tree was scattered over a twentyfoot circle the last pieces still falling it had only been molly that had run away and tulpa stood at a fourposted stiffness his neck arched and his eyes wild he snorted at me shifting his skin to shake off the bits of bark and leaves consider yourself warned i said grimly and after seeing ray wideeyed and quiet i shifted her to sit more firmly on my hip and blew up two more trees it was an ungodly mess but there was room now and better yet the ambulance would know exactly where to land growing more angry tulpa withstood it all held to the spot by trents will alone trent was silent as he joined me in the new sun squinting up as the sound of the copter blades grew closer i felt ill as the imbalance for the curse rose up lapping about me i could feel it cresting and with no regret i lifted my chin i pay the cost for this i thought feeling the smut slither across my soul the sun didnt seem any dimmer the sky was just as blue but looking at the shattered stumps and splintered branches and wilting leaves i knew my soul was a little bit darker but what was the point of a clean soul if quen died and i could have helped thank you trent said and then he darted back to quen as the long medical helicopter began to land what wasnt nailed down blew to the edgesand there was a lot ray began to wail and i held her face to me covering her head as i turned my back on the copter swearing jenks tucked in at my collar and i stood there hunched and shaking feeling as if i were at the center of a tornado finally it was only bits of grass striking me and i turned to see three men in scrubs jump out of the side a stretcher between them the blades slowed but didnt stop and trent stood over quen his worry coming back threefold no spinal damage one said squinting at an amulet held against quens temple we can move him and the other two manhandled him onto the stretcher starting an iv and taking vital signs sir the one with the amulet asked and trent pulled his attention from quens face his eyes looked better treat it as a demon attack he said voice raised against the wind yes its daylight he added when the man looked doubtfully at the sun he was possessing someone jenks left me ray starting as the silver sparkles sifted down his aura is wonky the pixy said standing on quens chest to garner everyones attention for a brief instant its cycling through shades like its ringing its getting worse though five minutes ago it was taking thirty seconds to cycle and now its down to twenty brow furrowed the man put on a pair of glasses another handed him his eyes widened and his motions took on a new urgency get him in the chopper now i didnt see it happen trent said as they counted to three and lifted the stretcher the first man holding the iv bag high morgan and i were out on another trail and felt the disturbance i think they took ceri and lucy he said fear crossing his face before he tried to hide it i could see it shimmering behind his every move with an efficiency of motion they loaded quen the sound of the blades drowning out the new conversation between the two techs jenks had darted in with them and out of the wind and ray was watching for him to come back outsilent so silent still beside us the head guy looked at the pilot motioning for a moment of time concern showed in his eyes as he leaned in to be heard sir i dont know what this is we have to take him to the university hospital trent looked up at the whirling blades and i held ray tighter to me are you sure i dont want a media circus but the man was shaking his head were running out of time he needs to be in a desensitization tank and you dont have one we can try a quiet room no trent looked inside fear flickering over him like a second aura go take him the man made a motion to the pilot and through the glass i saw him grab a radio well call ahead the tech shouted theyll be ready for him i think were in time but we have to move fast to stop the damage i have room for one more trent spun to me his face was riven with a worry he was trying to hide with a cool efficiency it all fell apart when he looked at ray then me and whispered rachel i couldnt hear him but i could read his lips something in me twisted and i shoved it aside go i said propelling him toward the door as the wind whipped my hair around ive got this call me when you know something he kissed rays fingers looking her firmly in her eyes ill be back as soon as i can his eyes rose to mine as the blades shrieked in the air thank you i held ray closer letting her see as we backed away trent effortlessly got into the medical copter jenks darted out just before the door closed whipped downward and out as if he were on a roller coaster he streaked past me swearing at tink but i figured he was okay one hand supporting ray the other holding my hair i watched the pilot do a check before lifting up squinting i held my ground as more sticks and leaves blew blades thumping the copter gained altitude and vanished beyond the trees heading for cincinnati slowly the leaves settled shaking i looked to where we had found quen the grass was flattened rays grip on my hair tugged and i disentangled her letting her soft damp hand hold my fingers as i listened to the quiet my ears ringing jenkss wings sounded muffled as he started to land on my shoulder then thought better of it and hung where he was dust sifting from him in the leftover breeze hell be okay we got to him in time i didnt know but i had an unusually quiet toddler on my hip and no horse tulpa had vanished i didnt blame the animal but i needed to get back to the stables i heard the hounds bay in the distance and shivered quen is strong jenks said his words fast as he fell into place beside me as i picked my way through the shattered vegetation one of the trees id taken out had been damaged by magic all evidence of it destroyed the is would have a cow either that or blame me for the attack hes going to be okay jenks said again and i walked into the shade on the path hoofprints were a sad reminder of how fast life could change the marks going both ways and crisscrossing in a chaotic mishmash hell be okay i agreed just to get him to stop talking but i didnt know if i believed it ray was still silent leaning away from me to try to see jenks flying over my head i hadnt spent a lot of time with her but enough that i was familiar she was so different from her sister quiet and reserved where lucy was outgoing and demanding my face twisted and my gut clenched at the thought of lucy with kusox i had told trent everything was going to be okay but the uncertainty as we waited for what kusox wanted was heartbreaking from above my ear jenks made an ultrasonic chirp holy toad spit the pixy squeaked and i stiffened feeling as if something was crawling through me by way of the ley line ray too stiffened her hand in my fingers clenching harder then i sucked in my breath as i felt a huge tug from the nearest ley line it felt like a sudden drop in the road you werent expectinga quick jolt and then back to normal what was that i said the back of my head was hot and i made a face as if trying to pop my ears how should i know jenks shrilled listen its going to do it again oh god here it comes i froze my feet planted on the path as the line hiccuped and became nauseatingly erratic hissing i dropped the line from my thoughts as it raked through me silveredged dust fell from jenks so thickly that ray reached for it the memory of that itchy feeling scraped up my spine and lodged itself in my brain glancing at jenks i tentatively tapped a ley line squinting as i let it flow through me tasting it it felt okay now but something had happened id have to ask bis when he woke up tonight he was more in tune with the lines than any person i knew if i got home that is i didnt know if trent would approve of me taking ray home with me jenks hovered before us a weird lost look on his face what happened the pixy asked and i pushed into motion wanting to get to a tv ive no idea but it cant be good chapter six ray fussed threatening to cry as i inexpertly fumbled at the straps to buckle her into the car seat the nicelooking guy in trents garage helped me move into my little cooper dont start with me i warned her my unfamiliar tone catching her attention and distracting her it might have been jenks making faces at her from the rearview mirror though and i backed out of the car blowing a strand of hair out of my eyes it was nearing three i smelled like horse and i had a cranky toddler who refused to go down for her nap and it wasnt as if i hadnt tried trents secretary had gotten me back to trents apartments to wait for him but that had been four books two songs and three hours ago watching tv with jenks had only made being stuck at trents big empty apartments worse that line hiccup id felt wasnt just out at trents place but everywhere the entire united states and off continent too the lines were fine now but the media was scrambling interviewing specialists and wackos with little signs saying the end was near jenks gave me a thumbsup from inside the car and i sighed diaper bag extra food change of clothes blanket from her crib and three stuffed animals she had pointed to when i asked her which ones she wanted yep i had it all it wasnt that i didnt appreciate camping out at trents apartments watching his bigscreen tv and raiding his fridge for fresh fruit and pudding but i had stuff to do stuff that i could get done while ray napped and boy did she need to nap a sneeze shook me as i shut the door my brow furrowed if it followed the emerging pattern id sneeze again in about ten minutes al was trying to get a hold of me and my scrying mirror was across town in the hollows id tried stepping into the line that bisected trents estate and contacting him that way but al hadnt showed and i hadnt lingered since the lines felt sour somehow i hoped it was only the uncomfortable state of the lines that he wanted to discuss but i had a bad feeling it was more and my eyes flicked to ray in her car seat as i got in jenks eyed me suspiciously as i settled myself wiping my nose with a tissue i took out of my shoulder bag bless you he said sourly thats like what the twentieth one i lost count smiling at ray who was making sssss noises to get jenkss attention i headed for the bright square of light and out of trents underground garage worry flitted through me that i was taking ray off the grounds but trent hadnt told me i couldnt jenks went drowsy in the new sun and i slowly wove my way past the employee parking lots and low buildings to the gatehouse it was up about half a mile and ray was well on her way to snoozeville too when i came around a bend and slowed trent had modified his gatehouse twice since id known him once when i had blown through the simple metal bar on my way out and again when ivy had tossed me over his new wall when i was in a hurry to leave and he had wanted me to stay the modest onestory building was now a twostory edifice that straddled the road officers on both sides to monitor traffic leaving as well as coming in parking lots were available on either side of the highly landscaped wall the bushes trying to hide how tall and thick it was it wasnt the five is vehicles parked just this side of the bar that made me take my foot off the gas and coast init was the three news vans just past the gate crap on toast that hadnt taken long my sigh roused jenks and he whistled bringing rays eyes open for a brief moment id known the is was out here having seen the fax of the warrant sent to trents living room when theyd arrived the is i could handle the news vans were another story you think they saw you jenks asked as i pulled into the parking lot probably but im leaving with trents kid i probably have to sign something i said as i leaned to undo her buckle and pull the whining tired girl to me leaving her in the car was not an option both ray and i sneezed on jenkss dust as he shot out before us and i took a clean breath as i stood beside the car baby on my hip and blinking in the wind and sun an anxious nervous man in trents security uniform was gesturing for me at a glass door and i headed for him my bag over one shoulder ray gripping the other sure enough a reporter on the other side of the gate shouted my name id been spotted swell ms morgan im glad you stopped the man said as i came in and set ray on the counter three walls were entirely glass and it was like being in a fish tank there was new activity among the press gathered waiting for any tidbit the is might let fall vultures they were vultures we werent aware you were going to take ray off the grounds why jenks asked snidely giving the three other guards fits as he flew behind the counter and inspected the views from the security cameras you think you can stop her well actually the man hedged and i took a pen away from ray before she stuck it in her mouth and gave her from my purse a harmless charm that would straighten hair look you i said a finger pointed and i swear ray tried to mimic me charm between her swollen gums like a teething ring trent asked me to watch her and i need to get home from behind the counter a big fat guy in a uniform turned his chair on casters frank shes on the list quit razzing her my eyebrows rose my good mood returning i was on the list how about that and then i sneezed feeling a faint itch of a ley line pull attached to it bless you jenks said and i swear ray echoed him way off on the actual word but spot on as far as rhythm her littlegirl voice was sweet and charmed i tickled her under her chin to make her squirm maam my smile vanished and the mans became nervous uh youre on the list but i need to see a photo id and get a phone number we can reach you at and we need to know where youre going and when you expect to be back oh that was all right then and i swung my bag up beside ray pawing through it with one hand as the other hovered over rays back in case she decided to move the clatter drew rays attention and she watched with a serious expression not reaching for anything as i sifted past the splat gun lethal charm detector two sets of cuffs handful of zip strips breath mints phone and whatnot for my wallet thank you he said as he took it to run it through their machine it apparently liked what it found since he gave it back behind him the news crew was setting up tripods and longrange cameras im taking her to my church i said as wrote down my cell number and i shoved everything away jenks laughing at the expression on the other officers faces at the cuffs and charms ill have her there until trent picks her up or we run out of diapers thank you the anxious guy said and i swung my bag up onto my shoulder jenks hovered beside me and together we looked at the newspeople hanging around in the hopes of a scrap of anything i slid ray onto my hip motions slow think if i give them something they wont follow me i muttered and jenks snorted doubt it i doubted it too but i headed for the door if i kept my windows up i could at least ignore them trent wouldnt be pleased about any photos they took of ray but it couldnt be helped the sun and wind hit me anew as i went outside jenks was close and my steps were fast as i headed for the car shouts and calls for my attention got loud as i opened the door if you follow me home i swear ill let the pixies play in your electronic equipment ms morgan is it true that mr kalamack has been flown to the hospital and is in intensive care ms morgan my back was to them and jenks currently perched on the roof winced its not going to look good if you dont answer he said his eyes going to ray and back to me ms morgan have you taken custody of his children because hes unconscious where is ms dulciate has she been injured as well i sighed then shifted ray higher she wasnt fussy happily gumming the charm it wouldnt hurt to quash a few rumors before they got started the security people on both sides of the road were standing at their big plateglass windows watching id get no help from them and although trent probably wouldnt thank me for putting ray in front of the cameras id found out the hard way if you didnt give the press something to chew on they invented things that sold more papers than the truth ms morgan a woman shouted and i turned holding my hair to my head so the wind wouldnt catch it i must look a sight but at least i wasnt limping beaten up or bandaged the news crews had a spasm of delight as i let the car door shut and paced across the road to the gate they were clustered behind jenks hung back as the still photographers snapped their pictures and big guys with video cameras on their shoulders shoved for the best angle they were all shouting for my attention jenks took refuge on my shoulder and ray hid her face scared my protective nature rose up from a tiny seed of maternal instinct i didnt even know i had and i shushed her rocking as i stood in the road three feet back from the gate you i said to a woman in a white dress suit her short hair hardly moving in the stiff wind didnt i knock you down once outside of the mall the woman grinned as her peers chuckled at her expense that was me ms morgan trent kalamack was seen being transported to the hospital by helicopter and unless im mistaken that is his daughter something happened to the ley lines this afternoon and the is is onsite can you comment from my shoulder jenks sighed you sure you want to do this no i didnt want to do this but i wanted them following me home even less trent kalamack escorted one of his employees to the hospital after an accident that occurred while riding this morning i said smug when the woman shifted her gaze to her truth amulet ring a nice steady green they werent legal in this situation but hard to prove mr kalamack didnt sustain any injuries and im waiting for news just as you are but the is the woman blurted as a followup and the rising questions subsided were the ley lines damaged in the accident no i said shortly i felt the lines sour well after the incident the is is here because the wounds his employee sustained are similar to those a demon might inflict the noise rose and i put up a hand guessing their next question and wanting to answer it my way instead of needing to work around that truth amulet as you can tell the sun is up so logic says the is is taking the opportunity to be nosy while trent is away they liked that scribbling on tablets or talking into their recorders ms morgan a man from the back shouted his hand raised as cincinnatis only daywalking demon have you been questioned in the incident told you this was a bad idea jenks muttered and i forced my smile to widen a sneeze shook me and ray patted my shoulder i wasnt an eyewitness to the incident i said truthfully but i did blow up a couple of trees so the medical copter could land i looked at the is vehicles dramatically im sure they will blame me for something i added getting the expected laughs this wasnt so bad making deals with demons had given me practice do you have an explanation as to what happened to the ley line a man in a sports coat asked holding his mic out over the gate no im on my way home to talk to al actually and find out if the demons know what happened i said then sneezed again they were coming faster and nervously i patted ray on her back as she said bless you in a garbled baby talk so if there are no more questions i said into the suddenly awkward silence i took a step backward and like lions on prey they pounced is that ray can we have a picture are you taking her home where is lucy what has the is learned so far jenks was laughing and i reluctantly turned back around i scanned the yammering reporters finding one i recognized mark i said and they all shut up you know i cant divulge what the is finds and besides ive only seen the search warrant why are you taking ray can we have a picture was ms dulciate injured in the accident as well i had three to choose from and i took a step back ms dulciate is currently occupied with lucy you can understand taking care of two little girls twins almost is enough to drive anyone to distraction i need to go its nap time ms morgan a photo please ms morgan ray was clutching my neck scared theyd already snapped pictures of ray so that boat had sailed spent a week at the island and returned to port for more tourists but i didnt want rays fear to be what they walked away from here with a picture i taunted and they clamored for one maybe if you would all shut up for a moment i exclaimed youre yammering so loud that you would scare a thirdgrade teacher okay they didnt know what to think about that but they did quiet down and sure enough drawn by the sudden silence ray pushed herself from my front and turned her big green eyes wide and looking sweet in the little pinkandwhite dress id put her in to nap in i smiled at the adoring faces of the women as the cameras clicked id give ceri and quen one thingthey could make very pretty babies but then my smile faded as i noticed a big black car that screamed money driving slowly up to the gate it was trent i knew it and here i was showing off ray like a prize now youre in for it jenks said darting off my shoulder and making ray jerk as she watched his angling flight to the black car okay thats enough i said hoping that jenks would put in a good word in for me i waved cheerfully at the last shouted question as i added i gotta go and if anyone shows up on my doorstep i will file harassment charges after i let the pixies into your vans you got it but they werent listening having figured out trent was in the car as well head down i hustled back to my car as they fell on his like zombies if i could give him ray right now i could be home in thirty minutes and the press probably wouldnt follow sneezing i wondered if i could make it in twenty if someone from the is ran vanguard a man from the gatehouse came out waving everyone back shouting that mr kalamack would make a statement in an hour and that they were welcome to wait at the gatehouse pressroom if they liked in pairs and groups they parted and the black car moved slowly through the gate and turned into the parking lot where i waited nervous i leaned against my car pointing trents car out to ray and telling her that one of her daddies was in it she was still gumming that charm when the car pulled to a halt two spots down immediately a back door opened trent not waiting for the driver to get it for him jenks darted out shedding encouraging silver sparkles but trent was a great deal slower moving as if he was in pain upon closer inspection i decided he was just tired his jeans creased and the sleeves of his riding shirt rolled up there was a tuft of cotton and a bandaid inside his elbow and i wondered if hed given blood squinting at the sun he crossed the warm pavement his hands outstretched for ray the little girl had begun to wiggle when shed caught sight of him and the smile that came over trent caught in my heart it didnt matter if this child was not his bloodshe was his child and quens and ceris my smile faded i had to fix this ray he breathed and suddenly i felt her absence keenly as he took her your daddy is going to be okay i think his eyes rose to mine we got him there in time ten more minutes and they might not have been able to stop the cascading reaction he blinked fast then looked away thats twice youve saved quens life thank you i shifted from foot to foot uncomfortable im sorry this happened me too our eyes met for a long silent moment ray jumped and wiggled as jenkss dust sifted over her and i flushed when trent noticed what she was gumming her little fingers gripping the charm so hard they were white i sneezed and i shook my head at trents unspoken question ah im sorry about this i said as the driver of his car began to move the car seat to the black jag i hate coming home to find reporters in my driveway i hadnt heard from you and i need to talk to al thats why im sneezing ray wouldnt go down for her nap and i figured shed fall asleep in the car i hesitated you look tired i napped during some of the tests he said and i wondered at the incongruity of us standing in the sun and talking as other people moved rays things to his car i didnt want to leave until he was stable they got his aura to stop cycling but they dont know why he wont regain consciousness thank you for handling the press one of the guards relayed what you said you did pretty well my eyes dropped at his wry smile ive been dodging them the last couple of years i know how much you have to give them for them to leave you alone ray had fallen against him her head tucked under his chin as she started to drift asleep her eyes never leaving me oh god jenks said from my shoulder and her eyelids flickered here come the vampires sure enough coming up the road on a golf cart were four is officers the grit ground under trents heel as he spun slowly to watch as they parked beside their cars and the one in the dress suit angled toward us it was nina or felix maybe i could tell by the grace and slightly pained motion of the living vampire as she crossed the lot the sun normally didnt bother living vampires but nina was channeling felix by the looks of it trent seemed to shed his fatigue like an old shirt but i could see it in the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes they had a warrant i explained and he bobbed his head in acceptance the is in your backyard is another thing i dont like coming home to theyve been on the grounds for the last couple of hours but your security tells me theyve been escorting them the entire time so they wouldnt wander the hospital called them probably thank you he murmured gently patting ray as the tallish hispanic woman in the black dress suit put a hand up to ask us to wait you did exactly what qu what should have been done i quashed the feeling of hurt i used to work for them i know your rights trenton the woman boomed out her voice too expansive and masculine for her slight frame clearly felix was in her again and i worried about her it wasnt uncommon for the undead to use their children as moving walkietalkies but it was unusual that felix kept doing it but who tells an undead no good to see you again trent said shaking the womans hand with an expansive motion that he usually only used with men how much longer until you are off my property the vampire smiled setting a finger aside her nose in a gesture i hadnt seen anyone under the age of fifty use rachel is ivy back from arizona yet no i shook ninas hand struggling with my desire to wipe it off her fingers had been cool and dry but the man animating her bothered me was it a demon attack it would be a lot easier to tell if you hadnt exploded three trees over the entire crime site nina squinted uncomfortably can we move this inside no i said again shifting my bag up higher on my shoulder can i leave or do you want something jenkss wings shifted against my neck in warning okay it wasnt smart to antagonize a vampire especially a dead one but ray wasnt the only one tired here i need a statement if you would please before you leave i sneezed my entire body contracting and the noise making ray crack her eyes al was getting impatient im kind of busy right now then you shouldnt have obliterated the evidence felix said ninas beautiful white teeth bared at me in a threat thinly disguised as a smile oh my god jenks said safely parked on my shoulder but his dust shifting a bright red rache they think you did it do you really believe the crap that is coming out of your mouth the pixy added as nina reflectively steepled her fingers as id seen older men do or do you just make shit up to see how stupid people might think you are i knew i was filling the air with my anger a close second to a vampires favorite smell after fear the wind helped but by ninas smirk i knew that she was picking up on some of it you are a demon nina said making jenkss wings seem to hum in anger and yes this has all the markings of a demon attack it occurred in the daylight meaning you are the only one who could accomplish it thats dumber than tinks dildo jenks exclaimed and i raised a hand to keep him from flying at her the vampire might be quick enough to catch him i doubted felix truly believed id done this or he wouldve had a dozen other magic users out here to bring me in unless he knew even that wouldnt be enough and id been moved to the level of a banshee where theyd just kill me outright with a snipers spell greaaaat then there is option number two nina said brightly as i fumed and she turned to include trent do you wish to start an investigation on the withons ellasbeth didnt do this trents voice was soft because of ray but it had the sureness of wind and water slumped against him ray slept at peace at last nina tilted her head as if unsure and i agreed with felix ellasbeths family was one of the wealthiest on the west coast she had motive opportunity and the clout to buy a demon attack i wished it was her it would make my life easier but with nick involved nina eyed trent a cruel twist to her lips isnt that what you did to her steal her child she said as she held her hair against a gust of wind whats good for the goose eh jenkss wings clattered tickling my neck and trent frowned letting a hint of his anger show beyond the gates the press teams were coiling cords and packing away lights but their longrange cameras were reading lips ellasbeth did not arrange this trent said shortly his back to them i stole lucy with my own efforts under an arranged tradition older than your species vampire if ellasbeth had come here and taken lucy by herself then id be angry for having allowed it i wouldnt deserve her but this wasnt ellasbeth nina swung back to me which brings us back to you rachel exasperated i dropped back to my car sneezing and trying not to look pensive just because a demon cant come to reality doesnt mean that his influence ends at the ley lines i saw nick sparagmos leaving the hospital in a hurry yesterday amid that media circus you instigated i did some asking around and found out he belongs to kusox shakuru kusox could have done this through nick not easily but he could have and why didnt you say anything earlier nina almost purred making me think felix had known about it all along damn it i hated when i fell into their mind games because up until today nick was stealing thriving rosewood syndrome babies not trents family nina squinted her guile replaced with a frown you think the two crimes are linked i nodded pulling my jacket tighter around my shoulders to make jenks take to the air just as well since i sneezed again both the pixy and trent eyed me in concern theres no way in the two worlds that youll find him you want his phone number thats all i got and its probably not going to work anymore i dug in my bag for a tissue if i didnt get to my scrying mirror soon al was going to be pissed ninas eyes narrowed i do not like you withholding information rachel morgan i leaned forward to get into her face emboldened by the news crews watching then maybe you should stop accusing me of everything i didnt have any evidence and one thing ive learned is no one acts on what i believe only what i can prove i would trent said and i smiled at him with a wash of gratitude jenks had moved himself to his shoulder and he looked different with a baby on one side a pixy on the other im going to hold you to that i said softly and ninas stance became antagonistic i want a statement she insisted am i a suspect nina sighed dramatically noooo a person of interest i pushed and she rolled her head on her shoulders as if stretching into a new skin and finding it unpleasant no not really she said flatly then you can wait until i can come in tomorrow and give you a statement right now i have to talk to al and find out what happened to the ley lines this afternoon okay ill even tell you what he said deal nina glared brown eyes becoming black i held her gaze my heart hammering as i saw past the woman to the ugly old vampire speaking through her frightening ideas churned in him whispers showing and vanishing like bursting bubbles of oil he was old maybe too old to adapt to the reality of demons among us and to make decisions to ease the coming chaos his attention bore into me and i took it without flinching would he accept me and the possible demon baggage i might bring to reality or forever keep me in the them category the second choice was familiar comfortable but it would lead to their damnation i thought he was smart enough to see it the question was could he sell it to those who looked to him very well tomorrow the vampire finally said and i exhaled as our eye contact broke trying to make it inaudible but knowing that nina could sense my relief easier than she could feel the wind in her hair i hadnt gotten the full acceptance that i wanted but rather a cautious maybe it was enough for now still it would be easier if you hadnt obliterated evidence of the attack she grumped i was trying to save quens life i said darkly the news crews were finally going into the gatehouse pressroom soon as they left id head home you did a moulage right i couldnt see the imprint left by strong emotions but vampires whether they be living or dead could if ivy was here she could tell me but she wasnt i had an uncomfortable thought that shed much rather be helping glenn than our investigative firm nina sniffed clearly uncomfortable in the sun but i leaned back against my car enjoying the stored heat it was giving off most has already evaporated with the sun nina said the evaluation is still being scored but even though neither i nor nina is rated for the courts its obvious that there was violence determination frustration and panic in large amounts mostly violence between two people gee you think jenks smartmouthed you come up with that all on your own quen and kusox i thought seeing frustration cross trents face it seems nina said idly looking at her perfect nails as if ceri did nothing perhaps she was knocked out or protecting the baby trent turned away the rims of his ears red in the sun jenks had taken wing hovering protectively seeing it nina smiled like a cat whod cornered a mouse i sensed three maybe four auras present but only quen and one other were active id be comfortable guessing that there was one person who abducted ceri and lucy someone proficient in magic quen fought him or her realized he couldnt overcome them and the two females were taken how can she just stand there and say it i thought my frustration bubbling up lucy and ceri were gone quen was possibly dying having tried to save them trent i glanced at him wishing he didnt have to deal with this demons sucked nina was silent reading the emotions as neither one of us said anything ray was slumped against trents shoulder jenks a silent presence of support i didnt understand it was obvious that trent had never admitted to himself how much ceri and lucy had come to mean to him he might not even know it now so wrought with the pressure of dealing with the present that he couldnt see clearly he was suffering though he had no one i didnt think he realized it yethe wasnt angry enough i could feel his realization coming maybe in a day maybe two trent had always seemed to be alone but hed always had his assistant jonathan as well as quen then ceri even ellasbeth though that hadnt turned out very well apart from lucy and now even lucy was gone soon he would understand that the demons had taken everything but a child who would remind him of what he lost things would get ugly then as the worst parts of trent warred with the best a chill went through me and nina looked at me in question her eyes dilating in the strong sun as i shivered trent had power on multiple levels and he wasnt averse to using it i didnt know which side of him would win id seen both there was little i could do except perhaps be there so he didnt feel so alone then you have nothing more to add nina asked her voice oily as she soaked in my sudden fear no ill see you tomorrow rachel she said and i looked at her outstretched hand refusing to take it she might kiss it or something trenton nina hesitated inclined her head and then spun slowly trent shifted to me slightly and we watched her walk to the cars you could tell when felix left her her head came up and she breathed as if coming out from a hole as she paced faster her heels clicked on the pavement until she got in a car arms still over my chest i watched her slowly pivot the big car back onto the road headed for the gatehouse id stopped sneezing that was good right she thinks im not telling her everything i said and trents shoulders slumped are you i touched rays hair smiling faintly she hadnt let go of that amulet and it was still in her tight little grip even as she slept i dont know its ingrained not to tell the is squat i opened my car door to leave and trent lingered ray in his arms and the sun glowing on him felix is teetering on insanity he said eyes concerned as he watched ninas car go through the gate youll be okay tonight sure unless they decide to blame it on me i got in finding my keys in my bag sitting there i looked up at him it would be easier if ellasbeth planned it i said wanting to believe that i didnt like the woman and by jenkss scoff as he darted in to sit on the rearview mirror i knew he didnt hold any love for her either i called her from the hospital trent said a surprising tone of compassion in his voice she seemed shocked and she doesnt lie that well even if it were ten against one quen wouldnt have his voice broke and i felt a surge of pity when his jaw clenched and released he would have prevailed im sorry his breath coming in was shaky but it smoothed out when he exhaled me too my chest hurt and i watched him hold ray i knew he loved her but the feeling that he had failed lucy must be overwhelming he had risked his life to find lucy and bring her home promised that she would be safe with him youre a good father i said suddenly and his lips parted no one can stop a demon when they make half an effort you can he said quickly and jenks made a pained sound from the rearview mirror the selfrecrimination in trents voice made me feel worse true but im a demon trent blinked with a sudden thought his shoulders eased and the horrid tightness to his jaw let up you are arent you he said as if id given him something new to consider a fragment of knowledge that he could use as he began scheming looking for a way to fix this what i said hoping hed tell me what my words had sparked but he shook his head nothing ellasbeth has promised to take lucy from me even if i can get her back shes already filing papers i wondered why he was telling me this even as my heart went out to him you will get her back ceri too but i didnt promise it still between me and my car door he swallowed hard i wanted to reach out to touch him but didnt know how hed take it putting the key in the ignition i sneezed then i sneezed again jerking so hard my forehead almost hit the dash scared i looked at jenks his eyes were wide shit id waited too long to get to my scrying mirror bless you trent said dully not paying attention my eyes widened and i sneezed again mouth dry i grasped his free wrist trent im sorry i said knowing i couldnt stop this he was going to lose me too he stared at my hand and then his eyes widened as i sneezed again no i let go of him sitting in my car afraid to move i wanted to run but i couldnt outdistance the summons im being summoned i said turning away to sneeze again a nauseating pulling sensation had started it was soft right now but if i didnt submit it would grow until i had no choice for a second i panicked thinking it might be kusox but al was the only one in the everafter who knew my summoning name and nick the panic returned nick knows your summoning name jenks shouted as he figured it out too rachel fight it but there was nothing i could do and i shook my head trying not to show my fear i didnt have a choice i had to go at least the news crew couldnt see me im sorry i said again wincing this might be okay ill do what i can i looked at jenks his face was white give me an hour then summon me back no the snarl of denial had come from trent and i gasped as he knelt and grasped my wrist my head snapped up as the interdimensional pulling sensation vanished sitting in my car i stared at trent shocked as the world seemed to revolve and settle the tips of his hair were floating as time seemed to stand still jenks began to softly swear trent had stopped the summons i hadnt known he could do that i mean i knew he could channel a crapload of everafter but this this was incredible not you too he said fiercely and i smiled grateful even as a sudden pain lanced through my head trent cried out and his hold on me vanished like the shocking snap of a rubber band breaking the parking lot and my car vanished trents aghast face was the last thing that i saw rays startled cry the last thing i heard chapter seven the scent of burnt amber pulled through my awareness first dragging the rest of the everafter behind it i left the ley line gratefully the harsh tastesound of it making me shudder kusox hadnt summoned me or id be fighting for my life by now and i sighed in relief as i decided that i was in the everafter blue sky white sun and saltytasting wind notwithstanding nowhere in reality stank so bad my nose had adjusted to the smell even before i finished coalescing to find myself standing on a round dais of white rock two togaclad demons before me like judges a crowd of them behind me muttering like the mob they were i shivered trying to throw off the wrong feeling of the line i seemed to be in a greek auditorium with rising benches of stone and stately pillars with white cloth strung between them to shade the demons from the fake sun the horizon was lost in a stark white line and i looked for the jukebox when i realized i was in dalliance it might look as if we were outside but we were deep underground in the everafter the restaurant was a convenient meeting place and i wondered why the demons were adhering to the dress rules since it was clearly not being used as an eatery but rather a courtroom irate demons filtered in their varied clothing shifting to togas as they passed the threshold al was beside me on the dais and finding the collected slightly bitter demon there was a relief he was in a toga as well instead of his usual crushed green velvet frock coat the fine cloth tied with a crimson sash so bright that it made me squint his hair was in oiled ringlets making his somewhat blocky face look even more so sandals peeped from under his hem and i stared at his black toenails that was new his manner was off as well his red goatslitted eyes holding a sheen of nervousness as he gave me a quick onceover and frowned this didnt bode well he was always confident even when he shouldnt be and i followed his gaze to the long bench before us just on the other side of the shallow moat making a pained smile at newt and dali not my favorite denizens of the everafter so you always talk to dali in front of an audience i quipped and al grimaced stand up fix your hair al said as he smacked me into a stiffer position keeping to his usual british nobleman accent though he now looked like a greek councilman my god what is that youre wearing jeans you smell like horse thats because i was on one i said becoming angry someone from the everafter stole ceri and trents daughter three guesses as to who and why my tone was sarcastic but al made a noise as if he didnt care and i shivered as a cascade of everafter fell over me tainted with his aura for a moment the rising noise of the demons behind me muted and then it returned as his aura fell away and i found myself in sandals and a homespun robe with purple silk lining the moist wind tugged unfamiliarly at my hair and i reached up to find a ring of wilting flowers the entire outfit smacked of something that ceri als exfamiliar might have looked good in me not so much there now you fit in al stiffened as he returned his attention to the two demons reclining on a long bench before us there was an ominous wide ring of sunken ground between us like a barrier you promised youd never summon me i said nervous as newt gave me a bright evillooking smile and toasted me with something red in a wineglass that didnt fit the time period we had a deal i dont yank you across the lines and you dont yank me i tried not to complain but i was still shaking off the adrenaline and it was my godgiven right to be bitchy i was trying to get to my scrying mirror but i was across cincy at trents i hesitated sorry i added i really was trying al didnt meet my eyes instead gazing forward into nothing as he squared his shoulders they asked me to summon you and since you failed to contact me i complied they he meant newt and dali and i shifted uneasily my sandals scraping better and better al took pride in refusing to work in the systemcompliance meant we were up shit creek again nervous i followed his gaze to the dais and tried to smile at the big bad demons smiling back at me newt was the only other female demon in existence possibly driven nuts because the elves killed her sisters but more likely because kusox had tricked her into killing the ones theyd missed slim and gender neutral she was sporting a bald head again heavy black eyeliner edging her eyes was the only feminine touch beyond the spare curves showing past her toga her entirely black eyes traveled over me and a turbanlike hat misted into existence atop her head sliding her from androgynous to feminine the demon had trouble remembering what she was doing but she was powerful sort of the crazy wendy of the lost lordoftheflies boys she seemed to do better when i was around which made everyone nervous a good six feet away from her on the same bench dali reclined in apparent idleness he was squinting at me in irritation his decidedly round form half a civil servant half a hanging judge his toga didnt do a thing for him i glanced at the demons behind us assembled either to watch or take part i didnt know which and the distinction seemed important some of the faces were familiar demons whod asked me to make everything from backyard pools to cars to chandeliers for them i stiffened as i spotted kusox weaving his way to the front earning disdainful looks from those he passed he has ceri and lucy i thought my hands becoming fists as i fought the urge to launch myself at him id saved the tall psychotic demons life in the effort to save my own and i trusted him about as far as i could throw a mountain the admittedly attractive demon was the engineered child of the demons around me created with both science and magic in an attempt to circumvent the elf curse that kept them tied to the everafter and basically sterile except now he was chained here even more than they weresince id cursed him to be fixed to the everafter day or night the more i got to know him and his kin the more i wondered if most of the ugliness attributed to demonkind over the centuries could be lain at his feet the wacko habitually ate people alive believing that by doing so he would absorb their souls apparently he harbored doubts he had one even better the demons had designed him with the ability to manipulate as much ley line energy as a female demon that hadnt turned out very well seeing as that was probably why kusox had tricked newt into killing everyone who might have a hope of controlling him and now he was using nick to drop into reality whenever he felt like it it had to have been kusox who took ceri and lucy he had enough reason it was obvious and i snarled at the demon working his way to the bottom of the arena al was trying to turn me back around and i tugged out of his grasp i know what youre doing kusox i shouted as my face warmed and several nearby demons elbowed each other to get their neighbors to shut up hoping for some gossip the slightly gaunt youngish demon in gray smiled at me his charisma falling flat i doubt that he said his smooth melodious voice not at all like trents youre not nearly scared enough he added shoving several demons out of his way with his foot so he could take a front seat if you hurt one hair on lucys head ill throw you back into the ley lines from where i pulled your sorry ass i shouted and al tugged at me to be quiet you think i cursed you now wait until i put your ugly face in a jar al smacked my gut and gagging i turned back around al i hissed as the arena began to quiet kusox is up to something kusox is always up to something al muttered he stole ceri and lucy oh god that murdering bastard had lucy ceri could probably take care of herself but if he hurt one chubby finger on the girl i would tear both realities apart to make him pay al sniffed as if he didnt care how as you say you cursed him to the everafter and even if he found a way past that why would he because he cant snag trent and if he has ceri and lucy kusox has trents nuts in a vise soooo he drawled gazing up to the sky that had never seen a contrail my god al are you being intentionally blind i told you nick was stealing surviving rosewood babies trent can make the cure permanent if he gives it to kusox he wont need you anymore any of you als expression suddenly became worried you have more important things to think about than what kusox is going to do over the next hundred years he said a thick heavy hand falling on my shoulder and turning me around were on trial again i asked shaking as i leaned past al to eye kusox what are we broke no als voice was sour its your damned ley line it went wonky leaking like the bloody titanic remembering the increasingly caustic sound of the lines i turned to face him fully my line had it really gone that badly unbalanced als eye twitched a spot of ice slid down my spine making me stiffen wed been trying for weeks to get the line id scraped between reality and the everafter to close or at least balance but until i knew how to jump the lines by myself it wasnt happening the imbalance was slowly siphoning off the everafter into reality and the only reason that no one had said anything before was because it was only a trickleplenty of time to fix it that and because i was the only female demon they might get some baby demons out of after they tired of the trinkets i could solidify into reality for them theyd been losing maybe a cubic foot of their dimension a year not much at all how bad is it i whispered trying to smile as i looked at dali als parole officer bad als voice was faint but resolute stand up try to look sexy in a bedsheet i complained running my hands down it how can i look sexy in a bedsheet he cleared his throat and i grimaced never mind frowning i leaned past al to glare at kusox again certain that he was the reason my line had gone wonky the demons smile confirmed it and suddenly i realized just how deep in the crapper we were kusox had thriving rosewood babies he had the leverage to make trent give him the permanent cure he had a linemy lineleaking everafter enough to be a real problem he was going to kill the everafter and blame me for it oh shit i whispered and kusox inclined his head as he realized id figured it out i took a breath to shout out the truth hesitating only because kusox seemed to want me to there was more to this i could see it in his face feel it in the air moist and heavy frantic i turned back to al al i hissed tell them he broke my line right al muttered we dont know that and saying so will only get us in jail where you cant do anything but he did it crap on toast this had gone from bad to worse and al didnt care dont say anything to get me in jail love al breathed hardly audible over the noise you dont have enough to get both of us out well find out how bad the damage is and fix it i wasnt sure if al meant damage to my line or damage to my credibility frustrated i cocked my hip and fumed dali whod been counting heads by the look of it stood up his hands raised to quiet the rabble behind us quiet quiet he shouted his resonant voice booming the demon was used to being listened to and the last of the demons hustled to find their places every demon was equal in the everafter but some had more power than others and some had more money dali had both beside me al jammed a finger into my ribs to make me jerk straight ill do the talking he said if you cant shut your mouths and your minds in that order im going to clear the room dali bellowed none of you will have a chance to vent newt sniffed curving her legs up beside her on the bench to look oddly sexy and by the turn you need to vent she said her soft voice carrying to the back of the stands it smells like goats in a locker room there was a smattering of masculine guffaws and finally they all shut up it was like living with perpetual sixth graders dali lowered his hands moving his middleaged spread gracefully as he walked to the center of the narrow stage demons could appear as whatever they wanted i still didnt know what dali found appealing in being a fortysomething slightly overweight graying civil servant as als parole officer i am responsible for keeping algaliarepts behavior within acceptable parameters he said and al cleared his throat and made an elegant bow and you dali added pointing at al are responsible for your students that would be me and i turned a smidge to show off my curves so i wanted to appear attractive so sue me i was surrounded by perfection al visibly swallowed back his ire with a small breath he seemed to gain two inches again bowing with an overdone flourish and sending a foot to smack me to try to get me to do the same assembled countrymen he said as he gracefully straightened may i say no gally newt interrupted as she took up her wineglass again youve talked enough your students ley line has degraded to the point where were losing enough everafter to give me a splitting headache it might be the wine she was drinking but i too had a soft throbbing at the base of my skull where thered been none this morning i had blamed it on whatever had been in trents fridge but maybe it was more behind us the demons muttered agreement why newt said as she fixed her eerie black orbs on al havent you taught her how to line jump so she can fix it you think i dont want to al took a step to distance himself from me and i felt alone her gargoyle is a baby of fifty years but hes bound to her already so we simply have to wait and before you mention it the scar tissue my student received from that cretin in the front row trapping her in a ley line prevents any other gargoyle from breaking through her aura to teach her instead it was true and i winced when kusox rose up looking lean and elegant blaming this on me how gauche his expression turned mocking and typical im afraid why not i barked out unable to help myself youre behind this the demons around him eased back to give him more room and an uneasy murmur rose careful rachel al said as he leaned forward blocking my view of them jittery i pushed his hand off me kusox kidnapped kalamacks daughter and his ah commonlaw wife i said exaggerating and then the lines go sour all of them doesnt that seem a little odd to any of you again the demons whispered among themselves very aware of and not liking kusoxs genocidal tendencies al was a lot more direct and i pulled away when he pinched my elbow stop trying to distract them its transparent and obvious is it i said loudly to al but talking to all of them distraction seems to be working for him have any of you given any thought to why he might have kidnapped my former familiars child and wife my elfin familiar the mention of their ageold enemies got the expected snarls but newt and dali were listening their war had nearly killed all of them i say we kill her and be done with it kusox said loudly taken aback i spun the ring of flowers falling from me to land in the dry moat between us kill me i said unheard over the rising complaints are you nuts i cant think straight my head is ringing so badly from the lines one demon shouted as he stood getting a round of agreements before he sat down in vindication i was in the middle of some work and i lost it all a second exclaimed you owe me restitution for a weeks work down the crapper als brow was furrowed my student is not responsible for your failure to record your curses in the collective he said and dali nodded his agreement we have a problem a third said a band of blue fabric draped over his shoulders his voice was firm and i wondered who he was the imbalance is impacting everything it took two of you to summon her through the lines two thats not normal and its getting worse i took a step forward well that was because of trent i said and al jabbed me with his elbow to shut up newt and dali pulled their attention from the rising noise behind me trent tried to block our summons newt asked her long legs showing from under her toga before she tugged it to cover them its never taken a collective to summon anyone the demon with the blue sash said loudly enjoying the attention his claim had brought him the everafter is falling apart the sky is falling the sky is falling i thought derisively and newt shifted her feet to the floor her expression seeming to mirror my thoughts this is pointless newt said as she poised almost coyly stay on track gentlemen rachel love can you fix the line i didnt like being called love especially not by her but i let it pass no i said sullenly of course she can al shouted to drown out the immediate complaints his hands raised pleadingly as he shot me a glare we need more time is all we have no time kusox asserted aggressively riling them up she broke the balance killing her will fix it it will not i exclaimed but als wince and dalis sudden deflation as he sat down made me wonder it wont will it i asked al softly and the demon made a long drawnout regretful noise of possibility dali leaned forward his elbows on his knees ignoring the rising noise behind us for a moment unfortunately it might he said to me giving the demons time to argue lines created from a jump between reality and the everafter are permanent for the most part but lines made from a realitytoreality jump are not and killing you might erase it might panicking i looked at kusox hating his smug smile this is a setup i said wanting to retreat but there was nowhere to go the line was stable well not stable but it wasnt unzipping like this someones tampered with it it was as close as i dared go without actually blaming him and even so al lightly smacked me on the shoulder to shut up we have nowhere to go if the everafter collapses kusox said voice loud over the rising noise kill her before its too late wrong i shouted and al sighed heavily they have nowhere to go you do kusox beamed at me as if id played right into his hands not anymore but you do rachel perhaps you are trying to kill us me i stammered mentally backpedaling as i realized why he was so smug he was going to kill the everafter and everyone in itblaming it on me he had a way around the curse had to or he knew a way to force me to remove it maybe lucy and ceri had been kidnapped to force my hand not trents damn it all to the turn and back i didnt do this i spun to face the crowd behind me then back to dali i was on a horse in reality when the line started leaking this bad kusox stood then you admit it was leaking and you never told anyone al was holding his head in his hand and i wished id kept my mouth shut just a little i said then had to raise my voice when they all began talking i was trying to fix it before anyone noticed al stood stiffly beside me as he fidgeted in subtle ways that only i could possibly see will you shut up now he breathed roughly turning me to face newt and dali but he did it but you cant prove it al mocked my whiny tone there are thriving rosewood babies being stolen and he kidnapped hostages to force my freed familiar to make the cure permanent i shouted doesnt that sound a bit odd to you but no one cared are you done al muttered his back stiff as he faced newt and dali looking uneasy dali rose to his feet hands raised to quiet them rachel as it is your line and youre the only demon who can survive free of the everafter we are understandably concerned that your intent is to destroy us and the everafter my hasty breath to protest whooshed out as al poked me in the ribs to be quiet much as i regret my decision dali said moving to the front of the dropoff between us its my recommendation that if rachel admits that she cant balance her line then perhaps her death is the best way to ensure our continued existence i couldnt speak they werent serious were they kusox had done something i knew it by his smug expression as he listened to the demons call for my blood standing there my heart hammered and i backed up into al they couldnt i hadnt done anything dali looked at me and i quailed if its a choice between your life and all of ours then you will die he hesitated then added quietly even if youre not actually the one who should be blamed for it his eyes slid behind me to kusox and my hope leaped he believed me i glanced at al to see he realized it too and newt now toasting me with her wine proof we needed proof i could do that i could get the damned proof i just needed a few days gentle associates gentle associates al said his voice rumbling through me from where i was pressed against him of course she can balance her line his breath was like brimstone against me sharp and jolting tell them rachel he prompted his voice low with threat ssure i stammered scared to death als eyes closed in relief we can fix it he said as they opened then why havent you kusox said softly mocking us my rooms are shrinking another called we have nowhere to go kill her now before its too late a third shouted and it all started up again i began to panic only als firm hold on my arms kept me from moving he was not my jailer he was my rock whatever happened to me would happen to him i didnt altogether trust al but i trusted that no it was a soft utterance and my eyes went to newt still sitting calmly on her bench legs curled back up under her again i said no she said louder and the noise behind al and me abated i told you months ago that rachels line was unbalanced and you all said i was crazy you are crazy someone shouted from the back and she smiled as if in benediction truuuue she drawled when they quieted again but no one listened you will listen to me now call it your collective penance my heart gave a pound and i tensed against al was it a chance or a sentence knowing all eyes were on her newt stood gracefully i will give you space from my own rooms to compensate your loss cyclarenadamackitn i will compensate all your oneinch twoinch losses because i know how important every inch is to you aged decrepit men but in return i want to see if she can do it it would be a skill worth havingdont you think being able to balance lines scraped from a realitytoreality jump in case we someday can return to reality and abandon the everafter completely i swallowed hard as newt turned her black featureless eyes on me if she cant then you may kill her there was a breath of silence in which i could almost hear the demons thinking that over behind me al sighed his hands gripping my upper arms easing it was a chance i looked at kusox and his evident anger but he stayed silent as the demons came to a consensus i couldnt tell if dali was pleased or irritated as he stood frowning once at newts pleased smile as she beamed over all of them so dali said bringing everyones attention back to the stage are we agreed rachel and al have time to balance the line if newt compensates everyone al held his breath as no one spoke each waiting for the other to say something first kusox dali prompted it was clear that the bastard child wasnt pleased but if he continued to push for my death it would be obvious that he wanted it his face empty of emotion kusox turned on a heel pushing past the surrounding demons he distanced himself and then with a soft breath of air replacing his mass he vanished ill take that as a yes dali said as the rest of the demons began popping out in turn a soft muttering of conversations rising and falling like surf i finally began to relax turning to look up at al as he let go of my shoulders now what there was no way in hell i could balance that line al wouldnt look at me and i again wondered how i could have gone from fear to mistrust to understanding to reliance in so short of time we find a way to fix this he said or a way to blame it on someone else he added stiffening as newt rose and made her way to us dali was busy with a few lingering demons and i watched as al seemed to shift and change the mask he always wore sliding over him again as she came forward thats it then he said cheerfully as he clapped his thick hands again i guess well be off to look at the line see what we can do yes newt said her smile chilling me as she took my hand and looked at it noticing perhaps that i now had a metal pinkie ring instead of a wooden one you go balance that line and in the meantime rachels debt to me grows with each passing second i winced as i pulled my hand from hers but what could i say i did have some income here from the use of the tulpa id made for dalliance al was huffing and puffing but i knew there was no deal we could get that was better than our continued survival al newt said sharply before he could protest if your student dies that debt reverts to you al glanced at dali and then back to her looking forward to it he grumbled his hand on my shoulder tightening newts black gaze was on the wisp of my tattoo that showed and i managed a nervous smile thank you i said as she turned to leave and she spun slowly back to us dont thank me now love save it till the morning after in a hush of inrushing air newt vanished like a cheshire cat feeling ill and scared i turned to al can we go home no he said simultaneously leading me down off the dais and waving to dali as if everything was aokay not oh shit but i agree we need to leave i hopped from the raised stage and als hands left my wrist i felt small as i looked at the stone bench kusox had been sitting on its him i said and al growled kusox has done something to the line you know it too hes got those kids and this is all an elaborate con to destroy the everafter and blame me for it if you cant prove it it doesnt mean shit al said but as i balked he sighed and rubbed his head fine he grumbled as he took my arm as if to escort me the sun is still up but lets go look at your line how i said knowing he couldnt be in reality when the sun was above the horizon but it was too late and the soft ache of the ley line had taken me chapter eight the red sun of the everafter hurt my eyes and i squinted holding up a hand as i stood on dusty red soil made of pulverized rock and felt the gritty wind push at me al and i had come in on a slightly raised plateau before us snaked a dry riverbed to our left was a slump of broken rock where loveland castle was in reality sprigs of waisthigh yellow grass were scattered about and a few stunted trees were all that was left of the woods that surrounded the castle in reality here in the everafter it was desolate between us and the pile of rock a ley line shimmered more of a heat image than anything else in the sunbaked wind the line was making me feel slightly nauseated almost seasick the leak i wondered as a gargoyle bis would know but hed be hard to wake until the sun went down beside me al was again dressed in his familiar crushed green velvet coat lace and all black boots with buckles scuffed the dirt and he jauntily sported an obsidian walking cane and a matching tall hat dark round glasses protected his eyes but i could tell it wasnt enough as his expression was pained and the sun seemed to be picking away at our auras as we stood the sun was one of the reasons the demons hid underground in vast caverns overlain with the illusion of the outside the fact that structures tended to fall apart on the surface was another it was odd seeing al with his top hat and elegant grace poking about with the tip of his cane as he found evidence of other demons no surface demons i said the hot air hurt my chest the sun feels worse today al crouched to turn over a rock that someone had shifted i winced as the wind whipped my toga and tiny pinpricks of rock hit my bare legs all around me were the telltale signs of other demons a footprint here a scuff therean oval impression in the dust that looked like the bottom of newts staff theyd been here seen the damage incidentally obliterating the evidence that kusox might have been here earlier to make the leak in my line worse i sort of knew how the is felt al slowly exhaled as he stood his expression blank as he looked out over the dry riverbed to the scrub and trees his fingers fumbled in a tiny pocket and he sniffed a pinch of brimstone its a damn ugly place for a ley line i wasnt planning on making one to begin with i said then shivered when a wave of everafter coated me falling away to show hed changed me out my toga for headtotoe black leather no bra or panties but at least the gritty wind wasnt scouring me like the sun was stripping my aura and this outfit unlike most fitted me not ceri oh god ceri i was no closer to getting them back than when id got here unaware of my thoughts al shoved a prissy pinkandwhite lace parasol at me here the frail thing clashed with the leather but immediately i felt a sense of relief in its shadow id seen kusox he knew i was aware of what hed done hed make his demands soon enough and until then i had to believe that ceri and lucy were okay thanks i said as i looked at the stack of rubble shouldnt the line be over the rocks thats where i came in al began picking his way to my ley line his cane knocking jagged chunks of rock from his path lines drift he said his head down move theyre like magnets repelling each other they will shift across continents given enough time and impetus they only appear to be stationary because theyve balanced with each other ages ago yours here al sniffed in consideration it likely wont move much anymore has it always been this size i nodded as i came even with him and faced the barely visible shimmer in the air the ley line the university was built on was wide enough that you could drive a team of horses down it for a quarter mile the one in my graveyard was about four feet wide and twenty feet long an admittedly small line mine here was about the same maybe a little longer al pressed his lips together puffing his air out as he gazed at seemingly nothing but he was probably looking at my line with his second sight you got out fast the longer it takes the wider the wound really so a small line was a good thing which made me wonder who made the line in my graveyard then i wondered who had taken forever to get out of the one at the university al maybe walking the length of the shimmer in the air al turned and strolled back the line a haze between us a line this size cant be leaking this much on its own it wasnt when i left it i cocked my hip feeling naked without my usual shoulder bag als focus landed on me can you hear it he asked and my lips puckered in distaste youre not using your second sight he added and i shook my head tucking a gritty strand of hair behind an ear but at his dramatic prompting i exhaled and opened my second sight the ringing worsened scraping across my awareness in a discordant jangle the way the red sun seemed to rub my skin raw but as bad as it sounded it looked even uglier the line was the usual red shimmer at chest height but there was a sharply defined line of purple at its center running the entire length thickest at the center and thinning to nothing at the ends it was almost black at its core and streamers of fading red were funneling into it like bands of energy slipping into a black hole i could actually see the leak as it sucked in everything around it and it made my stomach twist is it safe to use like that i said to al looking distorted and red through the lines energy behind him the rubble loomed ominously he shrugged we used it to get here distressed i put a hand to my middle and dropped my second sight al i said that purple core wasnt there the last time we were here i know what did kusox do to it i said frustrated hands on his hips al searched the line with his eyes he reminded me of jenks somehow even though he didnt look anything like him i dont know he believed me relieved i eased my shoulders down i debated walking through the line to stand beside him then edged around it as he had done my boots kicking rocks and pebbles out of my way sooo i drawled feeling small beside him how do you unbalance a ley line shifting his arms at his side he glanced at me and then away no idea he said looking as if it had physically hurt him to admit it tell you what toddle through it to the other side to reality and see what it looks like from there i backed up a step seriously frowning he gave me a onceover the wind blowing his hair about his glasses get in the line will yourself through and see what the line looks like from reality if were lucky it wont be like this maybe its merely a curse we can break i hesitated then jumped when he swooped forward and took my arm stepping us into the line together hey i yelped as my stomach dropped and the sensation of an unending chalkboard scrape serrated over my nerves stiffening i yanked out of his grip but i didnt leave the line since he was still standing in it if he could take it i could too nauseated i brought up my second sight the purple line was so close i could touch it my heart pounded and little pinpricks of energy seemed to hit me by all appearances the line was sucking in energy but the discordant jangle clearly showed it was giving something off as well ill stay here in the line al said and i swallowed hard that way you can tell me what you can see do you think you are capable of that sure i licked my lips then wished i hadnt as my tongue came away gritty now maybe al prompted as he tugged his sleeves down its going to take me hours to get the sand out of my hair and stay out of that purple shit i looked at the evil purple line swirls of red vanishing at its black core not a problem taking a slow breath i closed my eyes and willed myself across the realities it was different from using a line to jump and demons seldom did it unless they were dragging an unwilling slave across realitiesit was akin to taking a horse downtown when everyone else had a hovercar the whine from the line shifted and i opened my eyes seeing a ghostlike al still standing beside me with a shimmer of red between us the air lacked the bite of burnt amber and the damned wind that always seemed to be blowing in the everafter was gone i could hear birds and under my feet were weeds and grass the sound of running water was faint and tall trees leafed out for spring stood around me exhaling i turned behind me loveland castle was whole again albeit a dumpy little building falling apartone mans dream of nobility crumbling from neglect noble ideas tended to do that when left alone well al prompted and i turned to him catching my balance in surprise the weirdness of the line was impacting everything the vision of the dusty sunbaked surface of the everafter was superimposed over the lush greenery of the raised garden area of the castle but the purpleandblack line looked about the same from this side as the other ugly i lowered the parasol and squinted up at the yellow sun its hard to tell mind if i step away and see what it looks like from outside the line hurry up about it he grumped and i took several hasty steps backward until the unsettling scrape across my nerves vanished my soft headache went with it and i took a breath of clean air i was completely in reality and i brought out the phone from my back pocket checking the time i had about fifteen minutes until jenks summoned me and knowing al was becoming impatient i texted trent i was okay and to have jenks give me another hour unfortunately the line looked about the same from this reality though the grating whine that remained was a slightly higher pitch snapping my phone closed i looked over the area to try to determine if anyone had been here the weeds right under the line were all ramrod straight as if they were being tugged upward it was weird and crouching just outside the line i ran a hand under it watching the grass spring back the ground between the clumps of weeds looked as if it had been vacuumed i stifled a shiver and rose thinking my parasol must look silly i closed it they did have tours at the castle occasionally i could see no evidence that anyone had been here in weeks and i stepped back into the line al seemed to relax as i became slightly more real to him slightly closer to his reality well he prompted i shrugged scuffing my boots in the grass it looks the same but the pitch of the whine is higher the grass though i kicked at a tuft its growing funny straight up like its being pulled even the ground looks like anything not nailed down got sucked up into it maybe it did al ducked under the purple line shuddering as he came up on the other side closer to me the purple seems to be a physical manifestation of a heavy leak of energy wheres it going i asked the energy i mean al held his arms behind his back adopting a posture of lecture that i recognized from our days and nights in his kitchenlab when the sun is up energy flows from reality into the everafter when the sun goes down the flow reverses his voice echoed ghostlike the problem is that less is flowing into the everafter than is going out that purple line i dont know what in the two worlds that is it appears to disrupt the natural ebb and flow sucking in energy like an event horizon making it worse than it should be event horizon i wish id paid more attention in advanced ley line physics al sighed and i willed myself back to the everafter the wind hit me like a slap and i popped my parasol back open im sorry i said as i walked around the line to join him for what he said sarcastically youve done so much i fidgeted for making the line to begin with i suppose how did you balance yours al gave me an askance look before rocking into motion distancing himself i tweaked it until it was within proper parameters but we cant do that with yours because it is a realitytorealitybased line besides you need to know how to jump a line first my jaw clenched then relaxed bis had to teach me and he was too young even so al said as he waved a dry stalk of everafter grass through the purple line then inspected it for damage grunting as if something pleased him i dont think knowing how to jump a line will help no this purple shit is different he straightened and dropped the stalk we should be able to do something about it buy us some time put us back where we were yesterday the first faint stirrings of hope began in me what do you have in mind he flashed me a quick grin and i felt as if id done something right stay here he said waving his whitegloved hands dramatically ill be right back al i called out but hed vanished nervous i gazed across the bleak sunbaked earth and the dry riverbed feeling the bits of windblown earth hit me i didnt like being alone on the surface and i twirled my parasol my hair was going to be impossible to get through tonight almost immediately he stumbled back in his head down and back hunched ah here he said his goatslitted eyes meeting mine from over his darktinted glasses put this on it was a small black ring and i looked at it in my palm seeing there was a new lump of a circlet under his glove uneasy i eyed him im not giving it to you he huffed its a loan for a few minutes i want it back its a ring i said flatly not able to tell if it was black gold or simply tarnished sharp as a tack that one al grumped you want to put it on now pick a finger i spread the fingers of my left hand and i swear he made a small noise of dismay i looked up to see his jaw clenched what does it do al grimaced shifting from foot to foot i ah its a life rope of sorts that is me in the everafter to pull your ass out of the fire if im wrong and you in reality fixing it fixing the line was the entire point and i didnt mind having a safety rope if it was a ring then that was cool still i hesitated the ring seemed to soak in the harsh light it was heavy on my palm and i had the insane desire to drop it into a fire and see if an inscription appeared i set the open parasol down and it rolled in the wind until catching against a large rock the rings will allow us to function as a single energy entity across the realities al said standing almost sideways to me as he looked out over nothing i think you think i said starting to understand is that like a power pull al leered the wind shifting the gritty lank curls of his hair if you want head shaking i extended the ring back to him no he rolled his eyes looking at the washedout sky and refusing to take it you are utterly without a sense of humor today he said and my hand dropped we will simply be able to borrow upon and find each others chi with minimal disruption these were more than just rings and i wanted the truth of it al i said forcefully what are these you have one too i can see it under your glove shoulders slumping he showed me his back nothing he said the wind almost obliterating his voice theyre nothing now but a way to yank your butt out of the fire he turned around and his lost look surprised me go through the line to reality he said gesturing you should be able to hear me whether youre in the line or not if you have the ring on youll have a better chance fixing it if you work from the reality you made it from i hesitated and he added think of them as a scrying mirror without the eavesdropping unsure i looked at the simple band of tarnished metal a private line to each others thoughts was a rather questionable connectionnot a violation as such but very personal it didnt help that they looked like wedding bands against my better judgment i slipped the ring on my index finger wavering on my feet i felt my consciousness expand it was exactly like a scrying mirror but the connection was tighter far more intimate i could feel not just als presence but sense his masculinity his worry his concern i could sense the limits of his chi and i knew to the last iota how much it could hold the power he could wield it wasnt as much as i could it wasnt that he lacked female demons had a naturally elevated ability to harbor two souls behind one aura as in having a baby mother pus bucket al said breathily youve expanded your reach rachel apparently he could see my abilities as well is it supposed to feel like this i asked heart pounding as i flicked a quick look at him this isnt a good idea al said seeming as uncomfortable as i was we might be able to do this with scrying mirrors i jumped when he took my hand to slip the ring from me there was a pain in the back of his eyes that had nothing to do with me my heart pounded and not knowing why i curved my fingers to make a fist als attention jerked up and i knew i mustve looked panicked as he froze ah im good i said tense that is if youre okay his lips twitched i didnt expect it to be what i prompted when he faltered exactly the way i remembered it he said sourly and he dropped my hand go let me know when youre in reality standing outside the line as i said they function much as a scrying mirror he turned away waiting and i hesitated he was staring out at the broken landscape of the everafter thinking of someone i could feel it in his thoughts the longing for something hed lost so long ago that hed forgotten even that he missed it my feet scuffed and he tensed spinning the ring on my finger i stepped into the line being careful to stay clear of the purple center immediately the harsh discord renewed my headache but almost before i recognized it the pain seemed to halve al had taken some of it sorry i said and he spun coattails furling and heartache carefully hidden thats what the rings do he said urging me away with his gloved hands its not anything i wasnt expecting go nodding i took a breath and moved myself into reality again i breathed the fresh air relishing the warmth of the yellow sun and the soft hush of the wind in the trees it was no wonder demons were badtempered they lived in a virtual hell remembering al i toned down my thoughts of relief good they work he thought and i squirmed as his masculine domineering presence solidified in mine i wasnt sure if they would between realities good lord can you ease up i asked feeling as if he was breathing down my neck and i felt him chuckle uncomfortable i looked over the fallow weedchoked garden seeing the outlines of a mans dream of a perfect spot of truth a little yes i said then sighed in relief when the spunadrenaline feeling he was instilling in me seemed to fade he was everything masculine and having it so close was unnerving thanks i said backing out of the line and looking at it with my second sight i could see al watching me like a foppish ghost from a romance novel so how do i fix it i changed my mind you watch ill investigate im going to follow the purple line inward see if theres an aura signature on it maybe i can plug it its clearly a manufactured flaw and as such it will have a beginning and an end with which to unravel it i smiled and with proof they will go after kusox id rather fix it he thought at me wryly if we cant do that we will all still die that is everyone but you and kusox my attention came up from where id been scuffing the grass then you think he has a way around that curse he nodded and my heart pounded but you said not to step into the purple line that was before the rings distrusting this i stared at him the red sheen of a dimensional barrier between us theres nothing in either reality that will sever our connection through the rings he thought glaring at me if i get stuck pull me out ah without physically going into the purple shit that is if both of us are in there whats the point of a lifeline still i looked at him weighing his body language against the emotions i was sensing through the rings he was better than me at blocking them and i wasnt sure why he was nervous al i thought at him hands on my hips i dont like this plan we dont have time to find a plan you like his thoughts slipped into mine oily with deceit newt is paying for the volume lost with her own space the sooner we get this hole plugged the better i just got my atrium back and i dont want to lose it he was moving toward the purple line and fear slid down my spine magnified by als own worry al i cried out hand outstretched al stopped turned and gave me a last look hold on to me i saw him say hearing it echo in my thoughts as well dont let go and then he stepped into the purple line i gaspedit felt as if an ice pick was hammered into my skull from the top right to the bottom left i screamed falling to my knees als pain it was als pain and i floundered forcing my eyes open i couldnt see him and i panted almost losing him in my thoughts forcing the bile down i closed my eyes and searched for him with my mind i was swimming in a black cloud of acid unable to open my eyes arms outstretched and burning as i followed down a rising trace of agony like bubbles to find him got you i gasped and i wrapped my soul around his i flung myself backward with him crying out because it felt as if my thoughts had been ripped apart my back hit the scattered tufts of grass and i stared up at a perfect blue sky the pain was gone al wasnt with me al i scrambled to my feet realizing what happened id tried to pull him into reality when the sun was up it wasnt happening i couldnt feel him anymore and in a panic i rushed back into the line willing myself into the everafter with wild abandonment the line burned scraping across me like sandpaper even with my second sight i couldnt see al and i wondered if he had been sucked into that purple line if i physically went in after him wed both be lost i had to stay where i was but perhaps with the rings maybe i could find him with my mind and bring both his body and soul back i gave one last look at the broken redsheened world the demons were consigned toa hell of their own making designed to entrap and kill the elves but that had only damned themselves and then falling to my knees i closed my eyes and sent my mind into the line letting it be pulled into the purpleblack nothing my breath came out in a pained whimper and i fell against the dry earth my hands spasmodically clenching on the broken rock my cheek pressed into the dirt my mind was squished to a thin line my thoughts reduced to a colorless state my heart beat and that hurt even more al i thought and the pain redoubled as i found him struggling to think starved for thought under the crushing pressure there were sparkles in my distant fingertips and toes i was suffocating if i didnt get us out of here soon i was going to forget how to breathe and wed both die my skin and thoughts on fire i wrapped what i could of myself around the echo of emotion that was left of al with one last agonizing push of will i sent us home back to where my body jerked in convulsions in the red dust the harsh wind of the everafter hit me like a slap the heavy weight of al slammed into me and we both cried out as he slid to the earth sharp fragments of stone bit into my side and i heard him take a sobbing breath of air i tried to move my scream of pain coming out as a whimper my thoughts still burned and i finally got my eyes open we were in the everafter the humming ley line still unchanged above us still holding that core of purple nothing beside me al lay askew his green velvet coat charred mimicking the state of his mind his aura painracked i managed to sit up tears running down my face as my eyes tried to clear my clothes were untouched and i wondered how much of this pain was mine and how much was als als body shifted as he took a ragged breath and i touched him my hand shaking and the ring glinting a bright silver white in the red air it was black no longer the tarnish burned away al i croaked the sun hurt but i couldnt reach the parasol shifting back and forth in the wind that scoured me to my bones i thought youd left me i could barely hear him and i leaned on his shoulder as i scooted closer he gasped at the added weight and the pain in my head doubled i couldnt pull you out into reality i explained i had to move to the everafter to do it im out he said and his jaw clenched as he opened his eyes hed lost his glasses somewhere and his eyes were blacklike newts he closed his eyes at my fear were out i said still panting at the pain we were out but i didnt think it mattered ill get us home he said and then we both screamed as he tried to jump to a line fire burned down both our synaptic lines and i fell back groaning as i forced my lungs to keep working if i was breathing i was alive right how could it hurt so much i was on fire we were burning to death from the inside out oh god oh god i moaned looking in my hand in wonder it looked the same but it felt like it was burning charring dont dont do that again please i cant jump us celfnnah im sorry save yourself the heartache in als voice cut through the agony and i focused on him seeing him curled up against the pain celfnnah you want me to leave i said in disbelief as my tears started again but whether they were to clear my eyes of the grit or because of al i couldnt tell al groaned and with a sudden jerk he finally got the ring off his finger my breath sucked in as the pain vanished he took one last shuddering breath and then he passed out his entire body going limp my hand flashed out as als ring pinged against the rock and i caught it silence filled me the cessation of pain almost unreal as the wind shifted a lank curl into my line of vision there was only a fading ache deep in my tissues as if i had been in a fever al i touched his shoulder my hand coming away with a sheen of sweat bleeding all the way through his clothes he still breathed but he was out cold dont you go to sleep al i shouted shifting to kneel before him stay with me i might as well be talking to the dead and i put his ring on my thumb so i wouldnt lose it stretching i reached for my parasol holding it over both our heads damn it we were in big trouble now my head jerked up at a clink of rock and my heart seemed to clench at the skinny raw figure silhouetted against the red sky his tattered clothes drifting in the neverstopping wind looking like the remnants of an aura as it fluttered i tensed where there was one surface demon there were many and they only attacked the weak yeah we fit that category now al i hissed shaking his shoulder but he only groaned wake up i cant jump us damn it i knew this was a bad idea a huge shadow covered us and was gone looking up i tapped my broken line crying out and shoving it away as the discordant jangle cut through me either id damaged my aura or the line was truly poison eyes on the empty sky i scrambled up not knowing if i could reach another line from here but willing to try but i froze when i saw what had made the shadow it was a huge gargoylehis skin gray and pebbly and his leathery wings bigger than a bus is long slowly my panic ebbed to a cautious alarm leaving me shaking and standing askew the surface demon had vanished and i stared as the huge gargoyle made one last circle and landed where it had been as if daring it to return my gaze flicked to the sun either this gargoyle was very old or they went by different rules here in the everafter my attention dropped to the heavy notched sword he had in his clawlike hand and i edged back to al feeling scared for an entirely new reason who are you the gargoyle said his vowels sounding like rocks grinding his consonants like iron shavings stuck to a magnet sharp and pointy what are you doing to the new rift his sword had drooped slightly and i took a slow breath gargoyles were protectors either i was in big trouble or i finally caught a break we were trying to balance it please can you help us hes burned we need to get out of the sun the gargoyle dropped the sword as if it were a worthless stick and it pinged against the rock until it wedged itself his craggy hind feet cracked the stone as he shifted his grip balance the line he said his voice rising and falling thats short term but possibly the only answer that i will allow for now i know you your gargoyle is too young to facilitate fixing the new this is your line it rings with your aura you let him break it why him i thought trying to shade al with my body he must be talking of kusox and i wished a gargoyles testimony would hold up in a demon court i didnt let him break it he did it to blame me for destroying the everafter do you know how i can fix what he did the gargoyle yawned and looked at the sun change damaged it change will fix it in time it will fix itself destroying everything here along with it from my feet al moved whispering newt call newt my gaze jerked to him glad he was conscious newt his eyes opened and i started at his black eyes she can jump us he breathed clearly not seeing anything shell be listening for you shes worried about you the insane bat wincing he tried to move then thought better of it do hurry i feel less up to par than usual nauseated i loosened my hold on my thoughts searching for the demon collective id never tried to contact anyone without a scrying mirror but as he said she was listening newt i shouted and the gargoyle lifted his wings in alarm newt i need you we need you the gargoyle made one leathery down pulse of air then hesitated his feet still gripping the ruins of the castle you wont find enough time to fix it before it fixes itself the lines are failing the world breaker wakes we need to leave save who you can he jumped into the air the wind from his departure making me squint and sending my lank hair blowing back he circled once before becoming lost in the red sun desperately worried i looked at al out cold again the sweat had dried on him and he was shaking maybe i shouldve asked him for help i whispered then spun at the clink of stone on wood it was newt and i was struck dumb for a moment reminded of the first time wed met shed been a referee to see how long id last after the sun went down marooned in the everafter by trents best friend she was wearing a long flowing robe like a desert sheik her black staff in one hand the other holding her robe closed against the wind her awareness though was clear this time her step sure as she made her way to us with a new urgency help me get him home i said before she had closed the gap and i shocked myself with the knowledge that id pay just about anything for it her long somewhat bony hands were gentle as she crouched beside him holding a hand over him as if testing his aura what did he do she asked tersely then paused as her glance fell on the sword the gargoyle had left behind i sniffed backing up a step with my arms wrapped around my middle he tried to find out if kusox made that purple line and fell to the bottom of it newt spun finding her feet in an instant and you let him he didnt say it was going to scrape his aura off i yelled back i got him out but my words faltered and i felt the prick of tears hating them it was al for gods sake you got him out newt blinked her black eyes at me drawing herself up when she saw the ring on my hand oh she hesitated he gave you where is the other one nervous i held up my other hand to show her my thumb he took it off he took all the pain so i could call you newt made a harrumph of disagreement he took all the pain so it wouldnt kill you fidgeting i came closer was she going to help or not newt please the sun her androgynous face twisting to look more feminine somehow she squinted up at it indeed she said sourly twitching the hem of her robe off al its like breathing in acid the gritty wind gusted against me with a sudden force and i closed my eyes feeling the dust suddenly halt and drop away before it could hit me it was newt yanking me into a ley line and with a nauseating twist the horrid red sky winked out of existence my heart thudded once twice and still we hadnt reemerged anywhere my lungs started to ache and at the last moment when i thought she might have forgotten me and i was going to have to scrape another line into existence trying to get out she yanked me into reality stumbling i caught myself against the bedpost in als room the oil lamp beside the bed was lit making shadows at the edges of the smallish chamber browns golds and greens mimicked a primeval forest and plush sinking textures made it a close secure space sorry about that newt murmured looking matronly as she tucked the cover over al already resting in my or rather his bed it took me a moment to get around the rooms safeguards i thought one jump right to his bed would be better than sliding into the library and having to drag him yes i whispered suitably cowed al had told me his old bedchamber was absolutely foolproof but apparently it wasnt crazyproof i let go of the bedpost and newt sat on the bed beside al looking like a bedside nurse i couldnt see anything but his face the rest of him lost in the voluptuous coverings giving als cheek a little pat newt looked up her black eyes taking in everything in a single sweep this is not als bedroom its far too plush its mine i rushed he gave it to me made me take it he sleeps in the closet you make him sleep in a closet very good you might survive him after all i edged closer to look down at al the bed between newt and me its not really a closet i just call it that its a tiny nine by twelve i got for making tron that car oh her hand touched als turning it over as if looking for the ring on my thumb is he going to be okay again newt blinked at me her eyes looking almost normal in the dim light you care her gaze was on the ring he had given me and i hid it behind my other hand my thoughts went to celfnnah but i wasnt going to ask newt from the bed als voice rasped out of course she cares im a god to her al i leaned forward over him and he squirmed as if hurt mother pus bucket he swore running a sweatstained dirtcaked hand over his forehead i feel like ive been across a cheese grater several times in quick succession his gaze sharpened and he tried to sit up panic edging him where are my rings my rings here i said as newt forced him to lie back down and i wedged both rings off my finger and thumb dropping them into his waiting palm he slumped eyes closing as his thick fingers wrapped around them his hand was shaking and i remembered the pain wed shared taking that doubled would have killed me i let go of him i said backing up from the bed and feeling as if this was my fault i had to i couldnt pull him through to reality while the sun was up i had to let go so i could move to the everafter to get him stop babbling al grumped trying to smack newts hand away as she tried to see his eyes it wasnt your fault let me sleep he opened an eye to glare at newt what is your problem bitch newt stopped trying to lift his eyelids and i shut my mouth im not babbling i said sounding sullen even to myself still sitting on the edge of the bed newt tucked the covers to his chin good thought bad implementation it looked as if he was going to be okay and i wondered if newt had seen the bottom of a purple line once and survived can i do anything i asked you no newt said but i have an aura that i can give al if no both al and i exclaimed and she looked insulted standing up to smooth her robe no need to shout youll just have to wait until you heal then here in rachels bedroom her eyes went over the ceiling where all your safeguards are i started to relax it lasted all of three seconds until al pushed newts hands off him again muttering kusox did it i stiffened and he added the entire leaking line is a ruse to get us to kill rachel for him a very expensive chancy ruse he made a wry face at me maybe you shouldnt have cursed him it was him or me and i like where i live i said loudly and al winced newt gave up on al and stood with her arms crossed before herself i saw to the bottom of that purple line al said his aura signature is down there he caused it whatever it is i lifted the mass of my tangled hair and let it drop wanting nothing more than a hot shower and a carton of ice cream so we can go to the collective and make him fix it right i said feeling good for the first time in hours had it only been that long newt had drifted from the bed tidying little things here and there snooping and my hackles began to rise if he caused it he can fix it she said but hell wait until after youre dead then save us so we are more indebted to him al snorted a brat after my own heart minus the killing rachel part of course but you know he did it i said we found the proof al said nothing and my smile faded al i questioned and he sighed even newt was avoiding me and a spark of anger grew we can make him fix it right al you saw his signature in the leak unfortunately al started and i got in his face waving my hand under his nose no no no i exclaimed there is no unfortunately in your next sentence we make him fix it im not going down as the one who broke the everafter al heaved a sigh then shivered when a blacksmeared coating of everafter slithered over him it fell away to leave him clean the soft shape of an oldfashioned nightdress showing between his skin and the coverlet newt obviously rachel he said as he studied his bare hands my aura is burned down to my soul will you wait a few days then we can go in accusations and hidden barbs flying okay i scrunched my nose up hating newt when she laughed at me ah the vigor of the young she said making things worse if it were me i wouldnt go even then why not i said feeling another unfortunately coming on newt touched a hand mirror that looked identical to the one id seen ceri use als testimony will be suspect even if he did nearly kill himself no one will risk verifying the truth of it after seeing what it did to him al would be dead now if not for you pulling him out she had been going to say those rings but i kept silent her word choice was telling frustrated i loomed over al and he closed his eyes ignoring me al i said forcefully and he opened them i hesitated at his black orbs then rushed ahead i am not going to take the curse off kusox its the only reason i can sleep at night besides i dont think he simply wants me dead he wants all of you dead too or why bother with the rosewood babies newt looked at al an unusual trace of fear in the back of her eyes i believe you she said her fingers tracing over the few things on the dresser but no one is going to help you why not i said in frustration because we know we cant control him and we are cowards she said it was your familiar who freed him and thus it is your responsibility to control him if you cant we will give him you to placate him and save ourselves this sucked i got him back in the everafter i said and she took up the hand mirror where we didnt want him she said and i slumped best him or we will kill you so he will save us im surprised the collective gave you any time at all they must like you i couldnt get the frown off my face if i tried like me huh funny way to show it al reached out to take the mirror newt had brought to the bed send her home he said sounding tired and then he started at his reflection what the devil happened to my eyes newt took the mirror back despite als protests oddly sexy as she sashayed across the bedroom to put it back on the dresser will they return to normal he asked and she shrugged no i said loudly and al looked at me this is bull crap i added so hed know i wasnt talking about his stupid eyes kusox is going to own up to this hell say you went in on it together and are now backing out love newt said my zeal evaporated at the moniker and cold i slowed my anger i didnt like being love to a demon it meant i was being stupid and foolish newt send her home please al said his voice low in fatigue the demon inclined her head and i waved my hands in protest hey wait whos going to watch you i dont need watching al mumbled burrowing deeper into the folds of goose down and silk go home call me in three days three days al smiled his eyes closed newt damn it no i shouted but my words caught in my throat as i was suddenly wrapped in newts awareness i snapped a bubble of protection around myself before she could send me home like a little girl eh i thought steaming in anger but as reality swirled around me and i found myself standing in my sunlit graveyard my church before me in the late afternoon light i sobered kusox could show up in my church day or night thanks to nick and there were ceri and lucy to think about hostages in the extreme i couldnt risk kusox taking revenge out on them turning my potential win to a personal loss getting him to admit that i had nothing to do with that ugly purple line sucking in everafter without compromising ceris and lucys safety wasnt going to be easy immediately i found my phone scrolling until i got to trents number i ought to put him on speeddial or something pixies were coming from everywhere and i waved them off as i began walking to the churchs back door my head bowed as i waited for someone to pick up your dad is fine i said glad when jumoke chased most of them back to their sentry duty three rings and a click and my feet stopped when i heard ray crying through my phone it was a soft heartwrenching sob of loss that no tenmonthold should even be aware enough to make jenks was singing to her about bloodred daisies im back i said even before i knew if it really was trent dont summon me did you see them trent asked his voice shockingly stark i took a breath to tell him my throat closing when i couldnt get the words out my eyes welled up for three heartbeats neither of us said anything and then softly trent added no i guess you didnt i think theyre okay i said but it sounded like a thin hope even to me my chest hurt and i began to weave through the grave markers one hand wrapped around my middle so it wouldnt cave in in a soft sound of wings and dust jumoke sat on my shoulder kusox has them hes going to use them to force you and me to do what he wants trent give me some time to find a way to get them back kusox cant do this ceri is a freed familiar all i have to do is file the right paperwork i dont have time for paperwork he said bitterly and then i heard him sigh as ray finally stopped crying i could hear her littlegirl snuffles and i figured hed picked her up give me some time to talk to dali then i said i need a chance to explain whats going on to him and then maybe hell help why would a demon help me trent said and i looked up at the church squinting to try to find bis there was another huge gargoyle up there and i frowned hed be helping me not you and im not going to ask him to do it for free i said then softened give me a few hours can you bring jenks home for me and maybe my car say after midnight i should be done by then and will have more information for you midnight i heard jenks shrill then i frowned when trent covered the phone fine midnight the pixy said sourly when i could hear again trent i said cautiously ill see you at midnight trent said and then the phone went dead startled but not surprised i closed the phone and tucked it away arms wrapped around myself and my head down i stomped up the back porch and wrestled the screen door open this was going to take a lot of planning i should have called ivy chapter nine nervous i wiped my fingertips off on a towel and tossed it on the counter almost before it hit i was reaching for it again carefully folding it to drape over the oven handle right in the middle exhaling i turned to look over my kitchen dim with only the light from the living room across the hall and the small bulb over the sink demons and shadows seemed to go together but they craved the sun like an undead vampire ceris teapot sat between two chairs at ivys farm table the antique porcelain was warm with earl grey tea two of ceris best teacups beside it a candle on the stove made it smell like a pine forest if i was lucky it might even overpower the burnt amber stench maybe i had an hour before trent brought jenks home i couldnt wait any longer id promised trent results and it was time to call the demon i turned to bis atop the fridge well i asked him look okay to you the catsize teenager brought his wingtips up to touch over his head his version of a shrug i guess he said his pebbly skin flashing the entire range from gray to white to black and back to gray again he was anxious so was i i spun to the sink and closed the blue curtains not wanting dali to see anything more than he absolutely had to for starters the leather outfit that id come home in was on a hanger hanging from a limb and airing out thanks for being here bis im not afraid of demons he said his high but gravelly voice giving him away smiling i leaned my back against the sink i didnt like anyone with me when i contacted al much less an unknown like dali but bis was involved up to his pointy ears and when hed refused to leave the kitchen upon hearing my plans id let him stay demons arent that bad when you get to know them i said as i got a plate from the cupboard and arranged the storebought petits fours around the pile of homemade gingersnaps in the shape of little stars i didnt know what dali liked and variety was nice the church felt empty with ivy still gone and the pixies asleep or out in the garden id been dogged by a growing feeling of unease since id gotten back from the everafter and not all of it could be lain at the feet of my current problems something was brewing with the vampires felix had asked after ivy twice and i knew rynn cormel ivys master vampire did not like that ivy had left the state even temporarily at least he wasnt sending assassins this time you sure you dont want to wait until jenks and trent get here bis said whats to stop dali from just snatching you nothing thats why he wont try besides he knows im als student what would be the point you sure you dont want to wait in the garden its okay bis shook his head trying to hide his slight shiver if it had been kusox i was calling id have used circles traps maybe waited for trent dali though was like al in that he got a kick out of those weaker than him trusting him to behaveas risky as it was i hope he knows how to help you bis almost whispered i dont like demons his red eyes darted to mine i like you just not them i mean if dali knew how to get ceri and lucy back wouldnt he have done it already i smiled faintly and nudged the teacups back from the edge no a sliver of unease slid into me the demons couldnt control kusox if i couldnt then theyd give me to him as a bribe to save them yay me bis looked toward the curtained window then me turning slightly lighter he nodded his clawed feet shifting okay im ready me too nervous i pulled out a chair and sat in it reaching across the narrow space to where i kept my scrying mirror under the center counter it felt cool on my knees the glass seeming to sink into me the ache at the back of my neck became more pronounced as i rested my fingers on the winestained glass i really needed to make a smaller one i could carry in my shoulder bag and i vowed if i ever got a weekend where i wasnt saving the world i would there was a faint unusual tingling from my wrist and i turned my hand over the raised circle of scar tissue there tied me to al a visible mark that i owed him a favor for bringing me home the night wed met id never gotten around to settling it and that it was tingling now was curious maybe it was responding to his ailment slowly my frown deepened tell ivy im sorry if this doesnt go well i said as i placed my fingers on the proper glyphs roses on your grave right bis dropped to the chair nearest me his craggy feet denting the back as he caught his balance he really was a good kid the coolness of the mirror ached into me and a new slight discord blossomed into an irritating whine at the back of my ears dallkarackint i thought in my mind avoiding saying the demons true calling name aloud it wasnt that i had a problem saying it but dali wouldnt appreciate my speaking his name on this side of the lines seeing as anyone who heard it would be able to summon him dali had taken great pains to keep his name secret almost immediately the cloud of buzzing seemed to hesitate part and with a surprising suddenness i had a second presence beside mine rachel it was dali and i warmed in embarrassment i didnt often talk to demons through my scrying mirror apart from al and having dali in my thoughts was unnerving whereas al used bluster and show to hide his true self dali was like a steel pillar everything seeming to slide off him um im sorry to bother you i said my thoughts carrying through the mirror to him irritation predictably joined my embarrassment in our shared thoughts im busy make an appointment with my secretary he was about to break the connection i was kind of surprised id gotten him at all and not one of his subordinates dali wait i have to talk to you and al is i stopped not knowing who might be listening in al is what dali asked interest coloring his thought i hesitated looking up at biss drooping wings ive made some tea i started outrage flooded me and i almost yanked my hand from the mirror youre summoning me dali exploded and i scrambled to assert myself before he drowned me i made some tea i said trying to match his anger and biss eyes grew round you want to come over here and drink it or not its earl grey i dont particularly like it but most men i know like bergamot i dont give a flying flip if we do this here or your office but if i have to bring the cookies over theyll taste like burnt amber and i spent two hours on them i took a breath feeling his anger subside i need to talk to you i said softly my thought mirroring the pleading sound i had my kitchen isnt much but my words cut off as i felt our connection shift turning from the light uppermost thoughts to a more enveloping placefinding sensation he was coming over using the mirror to locate me my eyes widened at the feeling and a small noise of idontknowwhat slipped from me part alarm part surprise part sexual titillation as he drew a small trace of ley line through me so hed show up next to me and not in the gardens ley line hes coming i said as i lifted my head flushing because of that weird noise id made holy sweet seraph bis swore as a swirl of red everafter coalesced in the corner of the room beside the fridge i didnt have a formal circle to mark a spot to jump in at maybe i should remedy that if i survived the next couple of days earl grey dalis americana businessman accent drawled as he shook off the last of the blacktainted swirls showing up in a gray suit and a red power tie instead of a togathank god he looked like a slightly overweight mob boss with his expensive dress shoes tailored pants and graying styled hair uneasy i stood bis shrank back his red eyes going wide he held his ground though trusting my judgment thank you i said wiping my palms on my jeans crap i should have put on a dress but it was my kitchen and id have felt stupid wearing a gownagain dalis attention had been running over my kitchen but at my whisper it returned to me you are far too quick in assuming this is a good thing he glanced at his watch then his red goatslitted eyes returned to the spell pots and the tea steaming on the table you dont have any wards protecting your spelling area i dont need it i looked away used to dealing with egotistical powerful people who got a kick out of my apparent total disregard for the danger they represented you want to sit down i said looking at the chair kittycorner to mine my brow furrowed as he stepped forward and eyed the hardbacked chair its probably more comfortable than it looks he said as he gingerly sat crossing his knees and trying to appear dignified but he looked even more out of place than trent usually did in my kitchen a memory of trent standing at my counter making cookies with me flashed through my thoughts that hadnt really happened id been in a coma of sorts and his mind had been trying to reach mine but it had been real enough so had the kiss that had followed biss nervous giggle made dali frown this wasnt going as well as i had hoped but with the determination i might use on a badly begun blind date i sat down and began pouring out the tea im only twentyseven i said dryly ive not had the time to gather much in the way of luxury possessions it was starting to smell like burnt amber and i wondered if i shouldve cracked the window and risked attracting the pixies on sentry detail dalis wandering attention came back to me speaking of time he said sourly youre rapidly running out of it or should i say newt is running out of room his expression became wicked as he took a gingersnap youre going to make a pauper out of the everafters wealthiest demon congratulations you should rent yourself out by the hour not a good start ive been out to the line i said pouring out my tea now i have some ideas seeing as he wasnt taking his cup i handed it to him this is bis my gargoyle dali took a sip his eyes almost closing in apparent bliss he tried to hide bis he said nodding to him and the gargoyle flashed an embarrassed black youre younger than i thought your lack of skill is excused its a pleasure to meet you sir bis said and i was proud of him im sure it is dali said lightly his attention on the cookies are those petits fours silent i pushed the plate toward him and he took another gingersnap mmmm he said eating the star in one bite where is al he has put a donotdisturb note on his mirror are you thinking of changing teachers rachel his voice was sly cruel almost think i can save your life think again youre not going to bankrupt me as well good i said trying to shift the conversation to where i wanted it you can go to your grave a rich demon al is busy renewing his aura i said and dalis eyes widened in interest he burned it off while finding kusoxs signature on that purple sludge currently taking residence in my slightly imbalanced line dali took a third gingersnap his stubby fingers sure and slow als findings cannot be used in court he said then bit the cookie in half he has too much to lose and isnt a reliable witness i doubt you can convince anyone else to confirm it if in the doing he burns his aura off i know that i said letting my irritation show thats why youre here i want to talk to you about the legality of kusox abducting ceri the paperwork hasnt been filed but shes a freed familiar kusox is using her as leverage and i want her and lucy back his expression dry dali took another gingersnap kusox didnt abduct ceri he abducted lucy ceri volunteered to come with her when the cookies are gone so am i what i exclaimed falling back in my chair in shock i glanced at bis then back to dali my chest seemed to cave in as hope left me it sounded exactly like something shed do ceri wasnt afraid of demons she was afraid of being helpless before them and with her soul back she was not but lucy is my godchild i said scrambling kusox and i have an agreement that he leave me and mine alone lucy is mine file the paperwork for breach of contract and ill see what i can do dali said it was like that then kusox is a touch erratic newt and i are watching him dalis eyes rose from the plate of cookies weve known for some time that he was up to something hiding his plans from everyone else is the only thing postponing your death i thought about newts carefully worded question becoming more frustrated then why are you letting him get away with it i said aghast you know i didnt cause that line to start sucking away everafter that fast why are you picking on me kusox did it dali wouldnt meet my eyes true he said but he used your unbalanced line to do so its your responsibility im confident that kusox knows how to control the leak hes trying to eliminate you making us miserable and reminding us of his power all at the same time the little prick there were two gingersnaps left i leaned forward a ribbon of anxiety running through me is that what you think i said shoving my cup of tea away from me so hard that it sloshed i hated bergamot you think hes going to save you after you kill me silent dali took a cookie kusox has threatened us before but hes never gone through with it hes young and angry you cursed his freedom from him dali smiled showing me his flat blocky teeth sibling rivalry maybe you should uncurse him dont think so i said quickly wondering how i was going to convince dali the threat was more than he thought look letting me die would be a mistake im not trying to kill you he is and i dont think that line can be shut down with that purple sludge in it even if i am dead and in case you havent noticed he doesnt need you anymore he has nick who stole the enzyme that keeps the rosewood syndrome suppressed enough to survive it and then you stood by and hid the fact that he circumvented my protection of trentthe only one who can make the cure permanent and able to pass to the next generation kusox doesnt need you anymore in ten years hes going to have a bunch of demonmagicusing kids to play with the rosewood babies are not for him they are for us dali washed down his cookie with a sip of tea and i gaped yyou i stammered and he nodded one gingersnap left thirty seconds theyre life rafts demonmagiccapable bodies that those loyal to him can slip into and escape a failing everafter dali said and i stared not having considered that and you believe him i said seriously dalis eye twitched telling me he didnt but it did make it easier to understand why no one would help me has it ever occurred to you that without a permanent cure everyone who escapes on kusoxs coattails will be completely dependent on him to stay alive dalis thick fingers were on that last cookie hesitating he tapped it on the plate which is why were not forcing him to give ceri back he said softly we want the permanent cure i leaned back in the chair hardpressed to not pound my head on the table hes lying to you dali to all of you hes never going to allow any of you access to those children and hes going to let the everafter collapse whether you kill me for him or not now quit blocking me and give me ceri and lucy back so i can figure this out dali set the last cookie down and wiped his fingers with a new stiffness in his manner he shifted his weight you think his intent is annihilation i nodded and my shoulders eased before newt got us back underground a gargoyle came to see who had been messing around in my ley line his carefully trimmed eyebrows high dali eyed me but if it was because newt helped us or that a gargoyle was involved i didnt know in the daylight he had a huge sword that looked like it had been propping up a laundry line for the last fifty years i said angry he said the line would fix itself in time but destroy the everafter in the doing of it and that they were going to leave and to save who they could the gargoyles are leaving it was a soft but alarmed utterance he also said i wouldnt find enough time to fix it before it fixes itself if you cant give me ceri at least give me some time i demanded four days i added thinking of als burn dalis intent gaze focused on me considering it sighing he crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back in the chair do you have any idea what youre asking adrenaline jerked through me as i realized hed probably come here with the intent to kill me and be done with it before he left i think i can fix the line i said scrambling to find something positive to take away from this i just need to borrow my words trailed off reluctantly as if not wanting to divulge just what it was not that i had no clue what i needed something from al i finished trying to appear cagey not confused dali peered at me his mouth a thin line you dont trust me sure i do i said and bis snickered making a weird snuffing sound the olderlooking demon frowned you dont have a clue how to fix that line he said but inside i felt a tiny spot of hope he was thinking about it beside him bis cleared his throat i can see the lines he said flushing a heavy black i know i can help im good at auras dali ignored him which made me mad and i said kusox cursed my line that purple sludge is demon made i have yet to find the curse i cant untwist his face scrunched up making him look like the benevolent uncle who wanted to give you the quarter of a million dollars to start your chinchilla farm but those darn investors just didnt see the potential its not that i dont want to believe you he said and i let out a loud exasperated sigh as he continued but belief will be a thin comfort if we get sucked into oblivion waiting for you to figure it out its not like you have much to lose if you dont trust me we both die dali i said not dropping his eyes even if the everafter vanishes do you think the coven is going to let me live after the lines disappear and theres no more magic i dont goatslitted eyes unfocused he nodded cant you choose what gets sucked into oblivion i said try bubbling your rooms let it pull on the empty spaces for a while perhaps dalis knees uncrossed as he set his feet on the floor he was ready to go and he eyed the last cookie no one will want to if theyre being reimbursed by newt wed all like to see her brought down a decimal place or two see if you can get them to think about it i said standing up and going to the counter where i had a bag of cookies for ray dali might be a better choice i have an idea but i need four days and your silence that we even had this conversation dalis attention jerked to me bright eyed he stood and took the cookies like the bribe they were really he said the plastic rustling softly secrets rachel i met his gaze squarely the fewer who know the better dalis head cocked suspiciously you trust me my heart gave a thump i didnt have a problem asking for things according to al but in this case i was asking for a lot youre a member of the courts i said if i fail go ahead and kill me i continued making bis rustle his wings i dont want to be around to see the fallout when magic fails on this side of the lines but if i succeed i want all my debts slid to kusox dali began to smile everything to date and any i acquire while resolving the mess he started i said feeling nervous it was quite a lot newts debts accrued because of his tampering too i added i want that demon so far in the hole that if we survive he will be spending the next thousand years as a busboy at your restaurant dali chuckled and i felt out of breath we he said and i blinked not knowing why hed said it until realizing id said it first i had said we i had lumped myself in with them and it had come out as natural as if it had been we for a long time i like the way you think morgan no wonder al has risked so much on you well i asked since it was obvious dali was leaving his fingers tightened on the bag of cookies you have four days more than that and the everafter will be too damaged biss ears pricked and the sound of the front door opening echoed through the church my gaze darted to the clock on the stove they were early four days i said al would be able to tap a line in three it would be close but maybe by then id have this figured out if its not fixed by midnight you die dali looked at his watch thats friday he said sourly as he squinted at bis as if he had failed in somethingand then he vanished i exhaled shaking as i went to prop the window open to let out the stink of demons dali had taken the cookies but left the petits fours thank you i whispered into the night though he couldnt possibly hear me never underestimate the power of homebaked cookies biss chair creaked as he eased his grip looking out at the dark graveyard empty of even the glow of sleeping pixies i felt my gut clench at the sound of trents steps in the hall i had no idea what i was going to do next but trent wouldnt be happy with what id found pepper piss it stinks in here jenks swore as he darted in fingers pinching his nose shut as he swooped a large circle through the kitchen and landed atop biss head the gargoyle twitched his big fringed ears and jenks shifted to the top of the roll of paper towels we kept on the table he left just now i wanted to talk to him i leaned back against the counter glad the kitchen was clean i think it was the first time trent had seen it when it wasnt covered in spelling supplies which is why i asked trent not to bring you home until now i said smiling thinly trents nose was wrinkled at the stench and worry warred with hope showing in the way his brow was pinched a long lightweight coat hid his suit he looked wary as he held a hat to hide his missing fingers the light caught his eyes as they traveled over the kitchen as if looking for a visible sign of dali but all that was left was the smell jenks said i could come in he said and my mouth went dry i had no comfort to give him and i stayed where i was with my arms over my middle i didnt care if i looked pensive hi i said jenkss wings clattered in surprise but i didnt know what more i could say looking polished and together trent came in another step he nodded to bis and the gargoyle touched his wingtips over his head eyeing me up and down trents hope slowly dulled and vanished that good eh i took a deep breath unable to meet his eyes i pushed off the sink my middle coming to rest against the center counter the petits fours were sitting there and the plate scraped as i pushed it away dalis hands are tied i said softly ceri went willingly with kusox what jenks rose up on a column of dust and bis turned an apologetic shade of black trents face became ashen kusox took lucy he breathed and i nodded and ceri went willingly to keep her safe jenks finished now darting between trent and me in agitation my head hurt and i rubbed it it was so simple so devious trents feet scuffed and i pulled my head up thats it then trent said every vestige of softness gone in the hard clench of his jaw if theres no chance at a political resolution then i will use more drastic means i froze a creak came from biss chair as he tightened his grip drastic measures the last time trent had instigated drastic measures san francisco was trashed and i ended up in a spellinduced coma for three days whoa whoa whoa i said hand in the air youre not going to give yourself up in exchange its exactly what he wants what all the demons wanted which is exactly why it will work i shook my head but he wasnt listening wasnt even looking at me as he stared at the wall two feet to my right cool and distant he ignored even jenks hovering inches before his face no fairy fart way elfman the pixy said a bright red dust spilling from him we talked about this remember you give yourself up and then rachels just going to have to bail your ass out again which means im stuck saving hers i cant take it anymore im not a young pixy shes a demon let her do her tinkblasted job trents ironhard hold on his emotions cracked turning he tossed his hat on the table if i call his bluff hell kill them he said you know he will then he will steal someone else for leverage and it starts again i do have feelings rachel i do love people im not going to let them die for me thats not what i meant i said softly and his glare fell from me we cant get them back through the courts but in the meantime ive got four days to balance the line clearly frustrated he spun away his coat furling how does that help lucy and ceri he said his back to me as jenks shot me a look and landed on his shoulder curious i thought as trents shoulders relaxed at something jenks said bis noticed as well clearly the two men had come to some kind of understanding if i can fix the line or prove that kusox made the hole the demons will turn against him i said but it was really more of a hope ceri and lucy will be returned i looked at the counter as if i could see the books on the shelf below there was nothing in them about ley lines nothing in them nothing in the library nothing in als library if there had been we would have found it by now exhaling loudly trent slowly sank down in a chair the last of his mask fell away and he slumped elbow on the table as he sat sideways to it i cant risk him killing lucy and ceri he said and a lump filled my throat he was hurting it wasnt my fault he was the one who had let kusox out but hed done it to save my life or rather my freedom jenks was making motions for me to do something and i grimaced finally moving around the center counter to stand there feeling selfconscious i wondered how long it had been since hed eaten al and i went out to look at the line i said hesitantly he got burned pretty bad but it did give us a better idea of what kusox did trent didnt acknowledge me making me feel more awkward as i edged back to sit in ivys chair my eyes went to trents ring and i remembered how it had felt to wear als i think i saved his life again i bet that was a surprise he said dryly chuckling i dropped my eyes it was he wont be able to tap a line until thursday and since i dont trust anyone else over there im stuck here until he heals i know i can fix the leak in the line with biss help i added and the gargoyle bobbed his head his tail whipping about to wrap around his feet if i can fix it i can prove kusox is trying to destroy the everafter ceri and lucy will be the last thing on his mind if the entire collective is after him none of them like him anyway trent said nothing staring at the table i wasnt even sure he had heard me my thoughts went to the demons and what dali had said about them fearing kusox together they could overpower kusox but fear had made slaves of them they were expecting me to take care of him hiding behind semantics that it was a personal vendetta between us were they really afraid or was apathy easier than survival maybe they just didnt care if they lived or died trent still hadnt moved and at jenkss exasperated motions i reached out across the table putting my hand atop his well get them back trent blinked as our hands met not in shock but as if bringing himself back from a deep thought his expression was empty when his eyes touched my hand and i gave him a smile and a slight squeeze before i pulled away i could smell hospital on him and i realized thats probably why my head hurt i hated hospitals hows quen i said trent eased back into the chair his hand sliding from the table to fall into his lap hes not conscious yet but his brain activity is good his relief made me smile again good i stood up but i didnt know why other than i felt uncomfortable sitting across from trent if there is anything i can do he looked up as he reached for his hat on the table they tell me theres nothing anyone can do but wait hes strong and his chances are good i wanted to touch his shoulder in support but i hesitated at the last moment going to throw the petits fours away instead you believe hes going to make it i said trent too had learned to believe in the eleven percent yes i do his voice was soft but determined give me a day or two before you start being noble okay he chuckled and i hesitated my thoughts spinning i needed more stuff he who has the most stuff in his toolbox wins hey you have a library right i said as i turned back around id moved too fast and jenks darted forward to catch one of the cakes as it slid off the plate do you have any books about line energy i asked as i set the dish on the center counter ignoring jenks swearing at me as he brushed the frosting off his clothes trent pushed forward his hand reaching to touch a pocket i dont have anything in my library about the lines no but i know someone who does he said his hand reluctantly falling from his jacket rachel would you like to come to tea tomorrow jenks looked up from his soiled silk jacket surprise in his angular face trent had stood and i started at how fast it had been he had a direction and it changed everything it was back the power and certainty was back and something in me shivered tea jenks was standing next to the plate of petits fours you want to have tea are you nerking futs the light caught the tips of his hair as trent came up to the center counter the fair strands beginning to float in his excitement i know of something you might want to read my pulse leaped why not now i said and bis sniffed his agreement if it was about the lines hed want to see too but trent was shaking his head ellasbeth has it he said and i remember his aborted reach for a phone it was my mothers book but i know shell let us look at it if she doesnt bring it i wont let her on the grounds and shes dying to yell at me in person we had a chance and it was frustrating that we had to wait okay i said hands behind my back so trent couldnt see them tremble tomorrow then trent when was the last time you ate he was sideways to me putting his hat on his confidence was clear his motions sharp i think something from the hospital vending machine he looked up and smiled something in me fluttered again and again i shoved it down deep i knew what was going on and i wasnt going to let it happen it was a fantasy and i was through with them youre not going to do anything stupid without me right im going back to the hospital for a couple of hours get another bag of salty snack food for dinner do you want me to tell quen anything my smile faltered i wasnt invited but i didnt like hospitals anyway no i said as i leaned to pull open a drawer and find a plastic bag for the petits fours but here run these under his nose they smell like demons they might snap him out of it trent fidgeted impatient to be away as i shook the cakes into a bag and tied it with a yellow twisty jenks landed on my shoulder and i frowned when he whispered go with him here i said holding them out and flushing as trent took them the plastic bag looking both the same and different from when id given cookies to a demon named dali for some reason giving trent petits fours felt a lot more dangerous thank you ill let you know if they do the trick he turned on a heel then hesitated in the threshold you made the six oclock news he said and my smile froze you did okay really good for what you had to work with thank you again for handling that i hid behind the center counter more relieved than i wanted to be im sorry about putting ray in front of the camera he shook his head looking down at the bag of cakes no it was worth giving them something positive to take away thanks he nodded sharply to bis and without another word he headed down the hall his thoughts already far away jenks hovered in my line of sight hands on his hips and frowning he gestured that i should escort him to the door and i squinted crossing my arms over my chest he shouldnt be alone the pixy grumped darting out after his fading footsteps i leaned forward as he left the new quiet seeping in maybe but he shouldnt be with me either i whispered even alone as he was trent didnt need me at all chapter ten ill be sure belle gets it i said smiling at the wingless fairy standing on the wroughtiron garden table her long white braid almost to her waist and her pale angular features in a tight knot still the mistrustful scarylooking fairy waited until i put the little packet of stitching into my shoulder bag beside her on the table jenks sighed and she hissed at him making me shiver sure she was only six inches high but she looked like a tiny silvercloaked grim reaper with her raggedy clothes made from spider silk her long fangs used to crack the shells of the insects she ate and the bow and toxic arrows she carried to shoot me or jenks if we did anything she didnt like her butterflylike wings were gone burned off when she and her clan had tried to kill me and jenks last summer and their lack made her far more mobile even if she was stuck on the ground mostly i thought as she shot a corded arrow into the canopy and climbed the string into the surrounding greenery taking the packet of cloth that belle had asked me to bring to her it had that stitching that matalinas daughters had taught her the one that gave beautifully around the wings true the fairies in trents gardens were wingless but their children wouldnt be it was odd seeing the first steps of understanding between two longtime enemy races jenks had come a long way knowing we were being watched by a handful of lethal assassins i leaned back into my chair and tried to look relaxed instead of uptight trents glassedin garden felt stuffy the proppedopen door leading to the exterior gardens let in very little air outside the early afternoon sun shone thinly on the largely empty spring gardens but it was here that trent had brought me for teawhich i thought totally weird id thought that tea had been an excuse something he could tell people instead of the ugly reality that he wanted me to come out so he could show me some illegal blackmagic booksand maybe thats all it was but tea and cookies were on the table and i was hungry besides ellasbeth had arrived late and i had bowed out of going to meet her ellasbeth had thought i was a hooker the night we had met arresting trent at their wedding probably hadnt helped the cord belles sister had climbed snaked upward out of sight and jenks sniffed nervously adjusting his garden sword on his hip i thought you were beyond that i said fingering my cup of cooling tea it smelled like earl grey but i could take a few sips to be social jenkss comment that trent shouldnt be alone drifted through me jenks edged to the silver tray his steps hesitant and his unmoving wings catching the light i dont know her he said as he glanced up into the potted fig trees well knock it off i grumbled youre making me nervous i dont know any of them he said again its not like i trust her with my kids but he trusted belle with them i thought small steps could make large journeys if admittedly very slow ones fidgeting i lolled my head back to look at the plateglass ceiling as i waited for trent to return ellasbeth was an idiot how long did it take to drive half a mile and get settled there were three chairs here i still think you should let the everafter collapse jenks said his knees up almost to his ears as he sat on the rim of the silver tray then got up when he realized his pants werent as good of an insulator as he had first thought frowning i stood to look at the orchid jammed into the crook of two branches jenks followed me and the brush rustled as the fairies shifted to keep him in their sights earth magic will work for a while before it fades he said demanding my attention as he hovered between me and the orchid a year at least you could take down a realitybased kusox before that ivy and i would help a spike of fear slid through me quickly shoved down deep id survived kusox by the skin of my teethevery single time but as i counted the new blossoms yet to open on the orchid the thought of the end of magic rang through me with a new clarity this was why nick was helping the psychotic demon an end or reduction to magic would put humans back in the drivers seat i couldnt believe that kusox didnt have a way to keep magic alive with the everafter gone doling it out to the highest bidder or maybe dali was right and this was simply a way to get me dead and the rest of the demons kowtowing to him i sat back down in trents chair so i could watch jenks now fussing over the orchid and the path i might not be able to hear you if magic fails i said as i took one of the gingersnaps i had brought over for ray ever think about that jenkss eyes widened tink loves a duck he exclaimed his wings clattering as he carefully untwisted a stem the cookie snapped between my teeth might be a good thing i said chewing wing clatter dropping in pitch jenks slowly dusted the plant it was nerves he gardened i ate i didnt think about that he said this isnt only about the demons i said making a face when i washed the cookie down with a swallow of that awful tea it was tepid and it sucked dishwater having no magic would piss off the vampires the weres and the witches wed all survive but can you imagine everyone would be at a disadvantage everyone except the humans jenks darted back to the table yeah there was magic before the everafter i took another one of trents fancy cookies that smelled like almonds the ley lines in the arizona desert are dead the demons killed them when they made the everafter jenks looked into the canopy when someone hissed hearing it he hunkered down trying to look meek in a butch sort of way i snapped through my cookie recalling how the dead lines in the arizona desert had been unusually close together overlapping like pickup sticks maybe theyd been forced together in order to make a hole in reality ergo making the everafter there was something here i just didnt have the time to think about it maybe youre right jenks said as if it pained him to say it i still say wed be better off without demons i wasnt so sure demons were mean cruel untrustworthy and just plain nasty but the memory of al sitting in front of his fireplace trying to remember what he originally looked like only made me pity them the elves had cursed them for trying to kill their entire species and the demons had returned fire i wondered if either side remembered what the original insult had been hadnt five thousand years of war been enough there was a lesson here too i didnt have time to think about this one either impatient i ate another gingersnap rubbing the crumbs between my fingers before i leaned back and closed my eyes jenkss wings buzzed as he flitted from flower to flower like a hummingbird if it stays warm were moving back in the garden this week he said out of the blue all of us great thats great i said not opening my eyes are you still in the garden wall belle is he started and i opened my eyes when he hesitated finding him at a nearby orchid i saw him shrug belle is going to move into the wall too he said quickly his wings turning red and his dust evaporating before it could hit the plant she can have the spare room wed just be sharing a front door is all like you and ivy ahh i thought as i sat up thats good jenks she gets cold fast he said as if i had protested her moving in with him but maybe he was really talking to her sisters in the foliage it would be easier to just have one fire chair scraping i moved the plate of cookies farther away from me so id stop eating them im proud of you jenks i said and he flushed his wings going full tilt yeah well shes not cooking for me my smile was faint but sincere im still proud of you jenks flew to the table looking tall next to the tiny cups trent was using shes okay i guess by the way that gargoyle that showed up last night is still there frowning i put my elbows on the table and rested my chin on the back of my hands i wouldve thought that it was the same one from the everafter but there hadnt been enough scars the one that looks older than the basilica nodding jenks speared one of the gingersnaps holding it over his head like an umbrella as he twirled it i dont like it rache bis wouldnt tell me what they were talking about and you didnt just spy on them you dont think i tried jenks angled his sword until the cookie was at his face his expression thoughtful he nibbled a corner off the cookie looking like willy wonka eating an umbrella the little turd kept spitting on me all the way across the tinkblasted garden they have better hearing than even jrixibell i squinted up at the glass ceiling bored ill ask him tonight when he wakes up i hadnt wanted to interfere but if he was still there i think theyre spying on us wiping his mouth jenks put the nibbled cookie back over his head resting his sword on his shoulder they have a right to be concerned where in hell are trent and ellasbeth my foot began to bob bis went ape when al cut off his contact with the ley lines can you imagine what might happen if they collapse foot slowing i thought about that maybe i could ask for their help they might know something the demons didnt something that wasnt written down spinning on a heel jenks took a breath to say something then hesitated when the cookie sailed off the tip of his sword and smackpattered into the surrounding greenery there was a rustle and hiss of delight and i wondered if hed done it intentionally tasting it first so they wouldnt think it was treachery piss on my daisies we have to save the demons he said his eyebrows high when my attention came back to him im not going to let bis go crazy ignoring his foul mouth i set three cookies on the retaining wall seriously how did my life get so screwed up that i was giving cookies to fairies and busting my ass to save the demons the faint taptap of shoes coming down the path caught my attention and i sat up its about bloody time i whispered moving back to my chair before they could round the corner but it was only trent and i watched as his somber silhouette moved slowly through the greenery his fingers reaching out but not touching the plants in passing like they were old friends i dont think he even knew he was doing it his stance was upright and he managed a faint worried smile something was different wheres ellasbeth waiting for coffee he said his green eyes meeting mine for a bare instant she doesnt like earl grey his fixed smile grew even more stiff id have rather looked at the book out here but do you mind coming in he looked at jenks both of you immediately i stood sure no problem his smile was a shade forced and he shook his head when i reached for the tray you can leave it his focus came to me and he took a cookie before he turned back up the path is that a new outfit it looks nice on you startled i looked down at my black slacks and linen top id spent almost an hour in my closet trying to find something professional and casual that ellasbeth couldnt label hooker ah no but thank you still smiling he gestured for me to go with him ellasbeth woke up ray when she came in and now she wont go down shes usually such a docile biddable little girl but shes been fussy since her sister is away he took a bite of cookie mood introspective i never realized how she depended on lucy to make her wishes known shes had to speak up more i suppose thats good the cookie id just eaten went tasteless trent his head dropped and my words cut off at his sudden stillness ellasbeth has been very cooperative dropped her petition for lucy i think she wants to try to make this work again i froze almost choking why is he telling me this ah thats great i said not looking at him as i spun to find my shoulder bag if you two get back together then there wont be any issues with lucy at all right jenks took to the air a sickening green dust sparkling from him what a little cat scrotum he said and both trent and i stared from the bushes three hissing laughs sounded and were shushed jenks i admonished him and he hovered his hands on his hips and a disgusted expression on his face what is your problem nothin wings clattering he flew between trent and me headed for the door a bright silver sparkle falling to show his path okay my first reaction had been not far from that of jenks but honestly there was nothing between trent and me and never would be if he could make it work with ellasbeth it wouldnt be simply the girls who benefited but an entire demographic of politically motivated elves sorry i said as i fell into place beside trent our feet hitting the cobbles at the same time he just doesnt like her trent was silent and i looked at him questioningly right he said quickly then ate that cookie hed taken but i wasnt sure what was going through his mind and that bothered me jenks had told me little of what happened when he and trent stole lucy from ellasbeth saying it was privileged information but trent clearly hadnt appreciated having to steal his own child this is good isnt it i said glancing back at the unappealing cold tea to see the fairies descending on it trent looked sideways at me yes of course it is it would make everyones lives much easier damn it i couldnt read the smile he was giving me and the nerves suddenly started what if that book was useless what if ellasbeth had brought it all this way and i couldnt figure it out what if we paused at the door and trent punched in a code on the pad it was too fast for me but i was sure jenks caught it there was a heavy thunk of a lock shifting and trent nodded easily moving the huge perfectly balanced door im anxious to see what you make of the book she brought he said and jenks buzzed in ahead of us ever curious i remember looking at the pictures when i was about ten i dont know where my mother got it probably stole it from ellasbeths mom seeing as she willed it back to her he chuckled but i thought he might be serious as i followed him inside the hallway was brightly lit and sported beautiful closeups of orchids in the morning dew but the air smelled stale after the rich scents of the garden youre going to have to look at it in the girls closet he said as we started down the carpeted hallway heading back to the great room a closet i said trying to keep up with him you keep your magic books in a closet you keep your splat gun in a mixing bowl true jenks flew ahead as we entered the lower level of trents great room to my right was the huge threestory window ward that lee had made letting in light and sound but little else beyond its faint shimmer was the highly landscaped outside living area with a grillkitchen and swimming pool at the far end of the gigantic room was a fireplace large enough to roast an entire elephant in in between was the grand staircase up to trents apartments since learning my fathers vault downstairs was not secure we moved everything to the girls closet trent was saying as he headed for the stairway ceri put some kind of demon ward on all the upstairs rooms they arent holy but it has the same effect theres no way in or out but the door which only ceri quen and i have access to if you ask me its safer than my fathers vault but the reason ellasbeth insists you look at it there is because its temperature and humidity controlled and the book is ancient that ceri had warded the girls rooms sounded about right and i touched the smooth finish of a couch as we passed the ground floor here was basically a big party room past the stairway was a dark and silent bar area and behind that the kitchen and underground parking i knew because id run through it more than once damn it what was i doing having tea and cookies with ellasbeth while ceri suffered all that kusox was capable of jenks dropped from the ceiling an excited silver dust trailing from him rache he exclaimed as he landed on my shoulder his wings never slowing as they drafted my hair back youll never guess whos here who i asked almost afraid from the thirdstory apartments i heard quens distinctive gravelly voice say ill speak to the chef immediately miss withon see that you do said an imperialistic feminine voice and i stopped short at the foot of the stairs quen he was okay he was back chapter eleven i spun to trent the smug brat was smirking why didnt you tell me quen was back i shouted my urge to smack him hesitating when quen dryly cleared his throat distracted i looked up at the railing quen was there his pox scars standing out strongly against an unusual paleness ray was in his arms and the little girl clung to him both quen and trent were smiling ellasbeth was not trents hand went to my arm to lead me upstairs why did you let me believe quen was dead the morning he recovered from his vampire bite he said and i jerked my arm away from him as we found the first step i was a little preoccupied with takata being my birth father i said heart pounding as i took the stairs two at a time trent kept up maddeningly graceful it wasnt my place to tell my eyes narrowed not your place are we even now you little cookie maker i exclaimed knocking him off balance when we found the eightbyeight landing for the first floor ellasbeth gasped but trent was laughing even as he caught himself quen was here he was okay finally something was going our way seeing me lurch up the last of the stairs quen straightened to try to hide his fatigue our eyes met and the older man nodded solemnly on his hip ray gurgled happily the little girl was in a sweet fulllength jumperindianlooking robe of some sort cut from a subdued orangeandbrown paisley her brown hair braided and looped out of the way hearing jenkss wings she pushed from her fathers shoulder to find him she was a beautiful blending of ceri and quen and again i was struck by the frailty of this small family rachel quen said simply and i pushed past ellasbeth in her creamcolored business suit and matching heels thats not going to do it i said as i pulled the older man into a hug getting ray mixed up in there somewhere the curious scent of cinnamon and wine that all elves had mixed with the throatcatching odor of hospital under it was his masculine pull a faint hint of controlled magic and ozone to give it some interest he smells different from trent i thought trents magic smelled powerful but quens had a darker tang than trents shadowed glow suddenly realizing quens arms had gone around me in what had probably been selfdefense i pushed back embarrassed they let you out when i said wincing when ray grabbed my hair and pulled me in the older man made a noise of admonishment disentangling her fingers and then unexpectedly tugged me back to him with one arm turning us both to the common living room visible through the wide archway they didnt let me do anything i left its good to see you he said his voice rumbling through me youre the one who sent those damn demonscented petits fours arent you they woke me up at midnight and i left at two i grinned as i slipped out from under his arm he looked tired but good the injuries to his nervous system obviously repaired enough to function are you sure youre okay no but everything will eventually come back he said and i gave him a light punch on his arm and wrinkled my nose at ray tomorrow morning probably i guessed three days thats how long it took to renew an aura so it didnt hurt when you tapped a line what had kusox done to him trent was making his way to ellasbeth having seen our reunionand not being a part of itthe woman had retreated to the small kitchen behind the large sunken living room four doors led to four suitesquen and ceris trents the girls the fourth had been ellasbeths when she had been his fiancée and by the sound of it it might be again my heart ached at the toys scattered in the living room and a crayonscribbled picture of horses was pasted to a door a sad two feet from the floor this was the closest that trent would ever get to a normal family life and i was angry that kusox had spoiled it suddenly unsure i followed quen and ray to the sunken living room having to wave jenkss dust out of my way the last time id seen ellasbeth was when id arrested trent at their wedding i hadnt known shed been pregnant with lucy at the time and i didnt know if it would have made any difference the welldressed sophisticated woman looked broken as she sat at the small kitchen table her expensive creamcolored slacks and coordinating top and jacket rumpled she was tired jet lag and worry having taken their toll on her perfect makeup and upright posture even so i balked as her eyes found mine her strawlike straight hair looked fake next to trents wispy strands and her build was too strong to have only elf in her she was not full blood and it showed money had a way of erasing that though and her family was almost as influential as trent jenkss wings shivered against my neck as he took refuge and a chill went through me oh theres trouble with a highend handbag he said and i agreed ah hello i said feeling awkward as if shed come home and found me naked in trents tub no wait she had once ellasbeth stood in a smooth controlled motion of grace and i jerked to a stop quen gave me a good luck look as he continued into the lower living room area with ray and jenks abandoned me wings clattering chicken but all she did was extend her hand a stiff expression on her face thank you for agreeing to help trent get lucy and ceri back that was not what i had expected and i cautiously took her unworked hand in mine her voice wasnt inviting but it wasnt cold either my thoughts returned to trents words in the greenhouse she wanted back into his life why power parental and social pressure lucy i didnt think it was to spend the rest of her life with trent but it wasnt my business ah its the right thing to do i said letting her hand go and forcing myself to not hide mine behind my back her touch had been cold and i maintained my pleasant expression no it wasnt my business but trent would tie himself to this woman if he thought it was what duty required of him hed do it for everything she represented despite her having nothing he wanted her smile widened but didnt get any warmer still she said her hands clasped before her to look like a proper s wife in her monochromatic dress suit and matching purse its very noble of you to risk your life when you dont have a personal stake in the outcome lemonyellow dust sifted from the light fixture ignoring jenkss silent comment i smiled right back at her but i do lucy is my godchild and ceri is my friend i freed her from the demons before and seeing her cry over having a home husband and children when she never dreamed of freedom makes me a tad protective of her when some demon tries to take it away i see i see did she say i freaking see besides i added when her eye twitched if i dont help him who will my unspoken you was obvious from ceris highbacked embroidery chair quen cleared his throat trent had his back to us busy in the kitchen making coffee and jenks simply sent down another shower of sparkling dust the crystal in the fixture tinkling as it shook from his laughter inclining her head ellasbeth smoothly sat back down ill make sure youre well compensated my smile froze as i suddenly became hired help standing before her damn she was good i dont work for trent i said suddenly feeling outclassed her eyes were on my pinkie ring and i think shed recognized it as matching trents i work with him stop it rachel i thought as i realized i was in danger of arguing with an idiot it wouldnt hurt you to be nice she just lost her daughter not once but twice exhaling i leaned against the counter forcing her to turn if she wanted to keep me in her sight kusox wont hurt either of them i said as trent passed between us to hand ellasbeth a cup of coffee kusox wants something and this is the only way he can get it hurting them will only piss me off and kusox knows that ellasbeths beaming smile to trent vanished can we please stop saying his name she asked and on his way back to the kitchen trent shot me a look to be nice why i crossed my ankles and leaned deeper into the counter its not like saying it does anything coffee rachel trent said as he shoved a cup at me and i scrambled to take it before it sloshed over a faint blush was showing on ellasbeth maybe that had been a tad petty ah you have a book for me to look at right i prompted then took a sip its in the safe room look at it in there chin high ellasbeth pushed away the cup of coffee trent had brought her out of her sight in the kitchen trent hung his head his free hand rubbing his temple quen rose his motions slow and pained ray was slumped against him the little girl valiantly fighting sleep and starting to lose ill show you jenks peeked over the fixture at me laughing it made me feel as if id lost something damn it i could be nice to this woman i didnt have to be her best friend just not smack her while we breathed the same air thank you ellasbeth this is going to be a huge help i said but it sounded forced even to me were going to get them back its going to be okay she looked up the worry and fear of the last two days pooled in her eyes as she met mine and held them i dont think anyone had told her it was going to be okay and upon hearing iteven if she didnt believe itshe began to break apart tears welled and she quickly turned away her posture becoming more stiff more closed it must be hard when the only comfort you got was from the person you most disliked in the room trent set his coffee aside the cup hitting the granite loudly quen while youre showing rachel the safe room ellasbeth and i will be in the gardens why ellasbeth said in distrust as she fumbled in her matching purse for a tissue i can help trent touched the womans shoulder and i shoved a twinge of jealousy away if youre open to it id like to discuss the possibility of joint custody ellasbeths eyes widened trent she said breathlessly i dont want to have to need a joint custody agreement at all from the chandelier came a tiny eeeeewwww i just want us to all be together as we are supposed to be she said gazing up at him tears spilling from her i want my family what if we cant get her back what if sobbing the elegant woman dropped her head into her hands and sat alone at the table and cried uncomfortable i glanced at quenwho clearly didnt carethen to trent he seemed unsure and i made a face at him to do something anything grimacing he pushed himself into motion pulling her to her feet so he could hold her that was even more uncomfortable but at least she wasnt crying alone shhhh trent soothed even if he did look a little stiff doing it but awkward or not they looked beautiful together sophisticated ceri lived among demons for a thousand years trent said holding the woman as she shook lucy is resilient and brave the demons wont hurt her as long as they have a hope ill give them what they want my stomach hurt and i looked away we can talk in the garden trent said starting to guide her to the stairway jenks dropped down from the light fixture and my lips parted when trent made a small finger movement to tell him to stay oh really i thought watching trent help ellasbeth down the wide stairs a hand under her elbow as she continued to warble about home and family and how she had been an idiot idiot sure my thoughts drifted back to her standing at the basilicas altar furious at me for ruining her wedding day as i handcuffed trent for suspicion of murder id ruined her day ray perked up at the sound of jenkss wings and she watched with sleepy eyes as he dropped down to me tinks little pink rosebuds you two are like dogs snarling he said and i scowled looking at the top of the stairway i didnt hit her did i he laughed but i still felt ill if ellasbeth was going to be in trents life id probably better start kissing ass if i ever wanted to see the girls again jenks landed on my shoulder as i went to help quen up the two shallow stairs i was still wondering about that finger motion is he seriously considering that the pixy whispered as ellasbeths voice rose from the great room looks like it i breathed if you ask me shes nothing but bad news but they look good together quen grunted as he got to his feet unbalanced from ray and his injuries that he wouldnt tell me about shaking off my offer for assistance he headed for the nursery his left leg sluggish on the two stairs is that what you see jenks said jerking me back to my last comment that they look good together i tried to eye him but he was too close you dont think they do pushing open the nursery door with his foot quen shook his head the joining of the two houses would do a lot in bringing the two factions of our society together im glad someone finally talked some sense into that woman he seemed genuinely pleased but i couldnt help but wonder what would happen to ceri ray and quen if ellasbeth entered the family good thing the man likes frustrating women jenks said and i tucked a strand of hair behind my ear to shove him off my shoulder i could still hear ellasbeths tearful protests bracketed by trents musical voice the farther they got from us the more hysterical she was getting and her voicing her doubts wasnt helping she is wearing your ring trenton echoed and then the door slammed shut we only had days and despite trents confident words i didnt have a plan i had a goal whose solution revolved around a book i hadnt seen yet my heart sank as i looked over the dark nursery lit by a friendly smiling full moon with cows jumping over it oh god ceri and lucy id get them back if i had to tear the everafter apart line by line was it nick in the woods i asked quen as he nudged a walknride out of the way to get to the closet door on the outside he said and the little girl felt his tension and squirmed to turn around his speech patterns were kusoxs quen shifted his shoulders painfully as he took a set of keys from his pocket his combat patterns were kusoxs as well im surprised the human survived channeling that much power but then he didnt have to do much once he got lucy it must have been horrifying and my eyes roved over the beauty here as he sifted through the keys the wellthoughtout toys the books and figures waiting for pretendthe twin cribs one messy the other tidy clearly not slept in with a lonely giraffe waiting for lucys return it about broke my heart and feeling ill i whispered im so sorry silent quen held the keys up to ray and the little girl took an interest quen looked distressed he knew ceri would be okay right ive been in contact with dali i said as ray patted the keys we have some time before things shift im sure theyre both okay quens entire body relaxed its what i pray to the goddess for on the door frame jenks shrugged but i didnt know what else to say quen still hadnt unlocked the door waiting for ray to lose interest in the keys i was all for letting children learn when the opportunity presented itself but i did have a timetable i took a breath to say something then hesitated as i realized ray wasnt playing with the keys she was sorting them her little fingers pushing them around until she found the one she liked with a pat abba she said in her high littlechild voice as she touched the keys and my eyes widened i had no idea what abba was but it was very clear what she was trying to convey very good ray quen said his voice soft and holding pride thats the one to get into the big toy box now will you go to sleep abba has to help aunt rachel pick out the toy thats going to get your mother and lucy back the elf name for father i wondered vowing to ask jenks about it later guardian protector moms mr significant i didnt know but it sounded like a term of affection rays face puckered i thought she was going to cry but when quen raised his eyebrows she thought better of it turning away from me to cling to him oh my god i said as quen held her to him with one arm and fitted the key in the lock with the other youre teaching her to be a little you i accused and quen flashed a smile not looking at all guilty someone has to keep lucy alive when im not around he said as the door creaked open and he reached in to flick on the light trents daughter is entirely too trusting and i doubt her days with a demon are going to change that go on in im going to put ray down ellasbeth already has the book in the cabinet but this will just take a moment he turned back to the dim nursery and i waved bye to ray the girl watching me over quens shoulder abba ray warbled as quen put her in the crib and two little hands reached for him quen stooped down to reassure her and i saw the love before the closet door arced shut i couldnt help but feel good jenks sighed and i jumped having forgotten he was there obviously hed seen the love between them too i knew he missed having newlings wow i said as i turned away and took in the closet it was impressive smaller than the vault trent had been keeping his most precious secrets in but more organized racks of paintings shelves of knickknacks of various styles and eras and one big glassfronted cabinet with leatherbound books took up most of the room cabinetry and a small sink ran along one wall and a library table with two wingback chairs filled the middle space underfoot was a rug that looked old enough to fly and given the location it just might if you knew the right word dont touch anything jenks i said and he scowled at me as he hovered before a rack of shiny ley line baubles i wont break anything he said then spilled a flash of silver dust as something caught his attention and he darted to it hey trent still has that elf porn statue you stole eyes rolling i came to see if it was as graphic as i remembered but i lingered over the pair of rings below jenkss feet one was a simple gold band the other heavy and ornate they looked like mismatched wedding bands reminding me of the rings that al and i had used when we had shared each others strengths ah quen jenks had his hands on his hips as he looked over that nasty statue of three elves in the middle of a threesome tinks titties he said i suppose thats possible his head tilted youd need a lot of grease and two straps though quen i hissed and quen pushed open the safe rooms door almost shutting it completely behind him ray was babbling to herself in the other room but shed probably drop off if we didnt talk too loudly let me get you the book he said limping past the library table to the tall cabinet i pushed close to ask him about the rings and he handed me a pair of soft gloves lying out on the table they looked too small but i tugged them on thinking they were likely ceris quen was putting on a second pair thanks i said feeling the soft knit mold itself to my fingers those rings by jenks how old are they the hiss of escaping air from the temperaturecontrolled cabinet was soft and quen glanced at jenks as he swung the doors wide not sure he said shortly old i can find out hey quen jenks circled the statue avarice in his gaze let me know if trent ever wants to get rid of this i have a spot in my front room it would look ace in i held my breath as i leaned toward the open cabinet avoiding any possible demon stink are they demon made i asked as i looked over the books some so old they were falling apart quen looked at me suspicion in his eyes the rings no elven why al has something similar i took a hesitant breath pleased when i found only the honest scent of leather and decaying ink quen snorted the rude sound seeming odd coming from him i doubt that he said as he scanned the spines theyre chastity rings jenks sniggered coming to make annoying circles around me too late for you rache irked i waved him off i thought it odd that trent would keep chastity rings next to his elf porn but it wasnt like he used any of these things i think this was his fathers collection like some dads have stamps or guns quen reached for a book set aside by itself more accurately theyre binding rings he said his face showing the strain as he stretched for it it creates a continuous bond between two chis so the wearer of the alpha ring can snuff the magical ability of the other if needed they were used to keep younger inexperienced elves from exposing themselves as magic users they dont work though the charm in them is long spent the books dont smell i said as he set the book on the library table bad i mean when he looked at me no they didnt smell but there was a faint whine at the back of my ear like a highpitched echo of leashed magic that made me uncomfortable none of them have been in the everafter for at least five hundred years his voice was distant as he stood over the book and carefully turned the yellowed pages until he got to a section marked with a black ribbon the binding made a cracking sound as he shifted the last page and i swear he winced standing over the tattered book i looked down to read ley line corruption and manipulation in big squished loops that i sort of recognized my eyes went up and i squinted at quen suspiciously thats ceris handwriting no shit jenks said finally abandoning the statue to come hover over the text i know quens eyes shifted as he read the text we have six books here that ceri has copied a handful of other scripts she doesnt remember doing them ellasbeth insists that the book stays here youre welcome to spend the night if you want to read it cover to cover but i believe this is what you want i read it before it was returned to mrs withon sitting i looked at ceris extravagant loops and swirls i sucked at research if hed done it already i was good with that though i might come back and read it all later thanks i said as i tugged the book closer quen cringed and i curled my tingling fingertips under so how come it was at the withons jenks said his feet lightly touching the pages quen sat in the chair across from me motions slow as if he wasnt sure he was going to hold together trents mother and ellie were good friends there was more to the story than that but it didnt really matter jenks flew up when i shifted to a new page and his dust spilled over everything to make the letters glow seeing it quen leaned forward interesting i met his eyes you didnt know pixy dust makes demon texts glow no he admitted leaning back and steepling his fingers wondering if this was where trent got his little nervous tell from i went back to the text youre shooting yourself in the foot quen jenks has six bucks looking for property this spring they can all read and they dont mind fairies hey jenks said quit trying to farm out my kids just pointing things out i said as i turned the page to a map of the dead lines in arizona a second map showed where the author thought theyd been before theyd been shoved together quen was right there might be something here it was all theory but theory based on fact and observation seeing me intently quiet quen asked do you want something to drink eat nooo i drawled feeling like i was close to something hesitating quen shifted his chair forward id like to go out with you the next time you look at the loveland ley line i thought of his sluggish left leg he probably couldnt tap a line yet either i said nothing embarrassed he wasnt ready to battle demons again maybe next week but next week would be too late quen frowned at my silence knowing what it meant clearly frustrated he leaned closer until i could smell his aftershave over the characteristic woodsy wineandcinnamon scent i think i know how kusox made that event horizon i paused in my reading and looked up event horizon jenks asked but that was what al had called it too the purple line within a line sucking everything in he stated and i shuddered no wonder id felt squished even if it had only been my mind al was lucky to be alive that the collective had something for him to pattern himself on was probably how he had survived quen carefully lifted the book toward him his eyes on the yellowed pages i think kusox made it by gathering up the small imbalances that already existed in the other lines concentrating them in the leaking line you made he said carefully flipping back to the paragraph where the author mentioned the possibility of small line imbalances having no effect if the individual lines were spaced out enough and aligned to the polar forces of nearby lines i scooted my chair closer to quens and read the first passage again al did say that the lines were balanced to within safe parameters implying they all leaked to some degree must have been small leaks jenks said hands on his hips as he hovered over it all his dust bringing the print back to a newedged brightness thats just it quen said his thick fingers tapping the table they dont add up to whats in the loveland ley line they would if they acted on each other exponentially i said quens expression twisted in doubt why would they do that how should i know im shooting at fairies here my fingers were starting to cramp from holding the book and i took my gloves off to rub them i had enough information to go on a factfinding mission out at the line i figured things out by doing not reading about them al told me that the lines push each other apart like giant magnets i said unclenching my teeth god am i the only one hearing this whine if the lines are positive pushing away from each other then maybe the imbalance is negative maybe you cant have a line without a little imbalance like those little black and white magnet dogs that dont like each other unless they go facetoface jenks laughed but i thought he had it almost exactly right quen adjusted his position inadvertently telling me his hip was sore lines dont move mine did i said a good hundred feet from the second floor of the castle to the garden outside al said lines moved a lot when they were new but they stabilized reaching over i tapped the page with my naked finger which made quen wince my head gave a throb and i curved my fingers under wondering if this might be why al wore gloves maybe all the lines leaked at first like mine i said wishing i could ask al about it but the farther apart they got the smaller the leak became and when kusox put the imbalances together again bang big leak quens lips twisted in doubt which made his hospital stubble more obvious jenks though was bobbing up and down like one sticktight stuck to your tights compared to a ball of them or a bunch of dust scattered in a huge vacuum having no effect compared to the same amount balled up into a planet i added and quens expression smoothed as he considered it if thats how kusox got that purple sludge in my ley line then all i have to do is divvy the imbalance back up again and the leak will go back to its original pace clear the crud out and anyone can see the curse that kusox used to break my line theyd have to side against him jenks dusted an excited gold but quen still had doubts if his sour expression was any indication hell simply break it again he said as he closed the book and stood maybe i admitted feeling a stab of worry but ill be waiting for him this time if i catch him at it then hes in trouble not me if i can prove kusox broke my line they wont kill me but band together and make him behave i frownedthey should just band together and be done with him regardless cowards the hiss of the door was less this time as quen carefully put ellasbeths book away it bothered me that trent was with her right now believing whatever drivel she was feeding him and you know how to do this quen said as the door sealed shut with a cold sound separate imbalances no i admitted but if bis and i went out there we might be able to figure it out hes really good at separating line signatures neither one of them said anything jenks sitting on quens shoulder and both of them eyeing me in doubt he is i said in biss defense you look at him and all you see is a kid but ive seen the lines through him and he knows what hes doing besides i added either of you abbas got any other ideas im all ears quen flushed as i used the elf name hed given himself but jenks flew almost into my face youre not going into that purple line you saw what it did to al he spun to quen an alarmed gold dust making a sunbeam on the table it fried his aura and they both almost died ignoring him i chewed on my lip id be careful i said then stifled a shiver what if i got sucked into it by mistake or kusox shoved me youre not going out there jenks shrilled and quen winced looking at the closet door its not safe and you know it when is my life safe i said trying not to get riled up trent could spot me if i used als rings would that make you happy jenks dropped several inches before he remembered to move his wings still leaning against the cabinet quen seemed to stiffen i knew being almost helpless bothered him als rings jenks scoffed coming down and kicking at the gloves id taken off you think demon magic is going to work with an elf my eyes went to quen he was frowning in thought i dont know you got anything on demon wedding rings i asked but he was already at the cabinet putting his gloves back on i yanked als soul out of that event horizon using a pair of rings i babbled they sort of melted our minds together jenks made a face his dust shifting green not like that i said it was weird though as if i could pull on his strength and he could pull on mine without asking quen reached high to pull down a slim volume it was falling apart and had no title so i figured it was a demon text you sure they werent slave rings chastity rings sounded far more slavelike than als rings pretty sure i said as jenks peered over quens shoulder the connection felt equal like a scrying mirror but more complex sort of like the difference between a phone call and talking in person al said the rings made an unbreakable connection i said stifling a shudder at the memory of feeling his pain then squishing the thought of what sex might feel like daaamn feeling two orgasms at once might be worth the invasion of privacy quen eyed me in my sudden silence setting the volume down before me and pointedly handing me my gloves i put them on my curiosity growing as quen opened it to almost the last page i think what you want is here no matter how i tugged the gloves they felt too tight but i smiled as i saw the rough drawings it faded as i read what the demon rings were actually for increased sexual pleasure was on there but they were really created as an implement of war allowing a sort of superdemon able to overpower elves and whatever more easily there was no clear master or subordinate ring as there was in the elf chastity rings how they decided what curse to war with was up for debate but perhaps that never came up in the heat of battle i thought it interesting that it was assumed that it took two demons to overpower wild elven magic one thing was clear though the two people wearing them had no defense against each other if there was treachery wedding bands indeed look there it is jenks said his dust sinking through the pages to make them glow from underneath demon use only you dont make something your enemy can use he was right but i wasnt going to give up on this and leaning back in my chair i racked my brain for an answer well why not use the chastity rings i said suddenly and quen started you said they made a bond if its tight enough to quash someones magic i bet its tight enough to pull me out of trouble hunched over the book quens eyes came to mine those are elven chastity rings not demon wedding bands he almost growled right i pushed my chair out and went over to them but he could yank me back just like als wedding rings they were both staring at me as if i was nuts but i knew it would work it had to theyre broken quen said and jenks bobbed his head up and down the knowledge to make new ones is gone the women burned all the texts big surprise not ready to let this go i looked at them on their little black saucer one was tiny like a childs ring which made sense if it was to keep young people in line i know someone who can bring spent ley line charms back to life i said as i picked them both up quen made a small sound and i jiggled them in my hand pierce jenks exclaimed his wings a harsh rattle youre talking about pierce hes newts familiar rache what have you been putting in your coffee smiling i looked at the rings in my palm quen was right they were dead not even a whisper of magic dont put the little one on quen said as i angled it to my pinkie to see if it would fit and i hesitated thats the subservient ring once it goes on it doesnt come off until the master ring allows it oh thinking i jiggled the rings just to watch quens reaction you said they dont work you want to risk it go ahead put it on jenks came to hover over them frowning in disapproval even if you could get the rings reinvoked pierce is in the everafter he said kicking the larger one into the smaller it made a ping that seemed to echo through me why are you two always debbie downers i said closing my fingers around them jenks landed on my closed fist just what do you plan to do call newt and ask her to pop you over shes nuts from behind me trents soft voice said she doesnt have to i spun warming as if id been caught stealing his stuff again shit how long had he been there sorry he said as he came farther in and took his hand from the closed door i didnt want to wake ray up sure thats what he said but jenks was smirking at me and quen seemed smug that i was the only one trent had surprised his manner quick trent held out his hand and i dropped the rings into them he smelled like the outdoors and of ellasbeths perfume i stifled a surge of pique there was a new drive in him a purpose he could again be what the elves wanted and i forced myself to smile quen looked pained as he stood there but i couldnt tell if it was because of his injuries or because trent was behind me on this how do you propose she get there sahan trent looked up eager to explain my fathers vault door perfect i exclaimed softly oh god jenks muttered theyre at it again im not going to get out of this one alive i know it i can see the web on the wall already relax jenks i took trents hand and turned it palm up so i could gently pry his fingers open youre not going my eyes met trents and i took the rings you either trents expression cascaded through about six different emotions all finally vanishing under a cold calm i am a part of this he warned me obviously i said as i backed up out of his easy reach he was still wearing the matching pinkie ring and something in me felt like it was a victory ill get the rings working not you i know you youll get over there and youll do something noble and throw everything off plan i will not you will i affirmed besides if im over there slumming in the mall looking for pierce everyone will think im taking care of al if youre there it will be noticed looking as if he were eating slugs trent dropped his head making his bangs fall into his eyes he knew i was right and it was killing him those are my rings and my door trent said his head coming up and holding his hand out im going chin high i refused to back upbut my hand was in a tight fist hiding them i had a fleeting memory of having done something like this before involving a key and the counselors locked office its my old boyfriend so you stay ill get the rings working and then we can go out to the line and see what we can do deal ah sahan quen interrupted at the we trents entire mien shifted from frustration to sour acceptance backing off he licked his thumb and held it out a challenging slant to his expression my heart pounded deal he said and i licked my thumb and we pressed them together quen hunched into himself in disgust jenks was on his shoulder shedding a weird purple dust but i was ecstatic you wont follow me i insisted and trent looked up from under his bangs again making my heart stop with his half smile i just thumb promised didnt i yes he had thumb promised and that he wouldnt dare break or id throw him down the camp well and leave him there for three days chapter twelve the last time id been in the room outside of trents vault id been stealing that elven threesome statue jenks was so enamored of to gain trents undivided attention the outer chamber hadnt changed the air still flat and unmoving the floors and walls bare with no furniture i stared at the blank wall jenks on my shoulder and trent beside me quen was down the hall turning on trents magnetic imaging device it would shift the ley line running through trents compound down into the earth more proof that the ley lines functioned as magnets on some level once the line was out of its natural course i could enter the everafter not through the surface which not only sucked dishwater but had no direct access to the demon realm but right into their underground mall from there i could buy a jump to newts rooms if she was there wed have a chat and id borrow pierce for a few hours if she wasnt then id save myself a few bucks and talk to pierce with her none the wiser i was hoping for the latter there it goes trent said softly staring at the wall as if it were a bigscreen tv and feeling a sudden hiccup in my balance i unfocused my attention and brought my second sight up sure enough the red smear of a ley line now ran through the room at chest height right before and through the blank wall it would be an easy matter to step into it will myself across and be safe underground trents father kal had used the ley line as a way to have a temporary door to a doorless vault accessible when the magnetic resonator was on and completely impossible to enter when the machine was switched off it had been off for almost a year now since nick and i had burgled the vault behind the wall i agreed with trent that having a vault full of precious artifacts where any demon could see them using his second sight was a bad idea but then again trents dad might have been using the room for another reason nervous i wiped my hands on my pants and turned to trent startled at his aura it wavered over him like a gold sheet like he was on fire the slash of red through it hadnt grown but there was a new hint of black to it that i thought might be the first visible signs of smut the room with the resonator was fairly close we had a few minutes until quen rejoined us is an hour enough trent asked calm as ever as he looked at his watch but i could see by a flicker of darker gold aura that he was nervous i wasnt leaving until quen was here to keep him from following me you want to make it two i countered not sure how long this might take jenks flew from my shoulder his rainbowlike aura trailing him how about five minutes he said tightly and i pleaded with my eyes for him not to make a stink it was daylight and pixies couldnt stay in the everafter when the sun was up same as demons couldnt stay in reality ill have a better chance of success if i go alone i said then craned my neck to look through the low ceiling at the banners and dappled light patterns that the demons decorated their mall with it was early yet and there wasnt a lot of traffic just a few harried familiars and disgruntled demons whod been pressed into service to clear a debt i thought i could hear s music being piped in echoing against the flat places it was weird standing so far underground and feeling as if you were outside but the demons had had thousands of years to build their pretend trent eyed me askancemaking me wonder if he was checking out my aura for smutthen fixed his gaze firmly ahead to the shop sign visible through the wall the coffee vault someone had a sense of humor we can turn the magnet on at fifteenminute intervals trent said then we both turned at a scuff at the door sahan quen protested out of breath but clearly having heard him the risk trents pleasant expression never changed we can turn the magnet on at fifteenminute intervals he said again and quen nodded reluctantly satisfied trent turned to the humming ley line the sour whine to the ley lines throughout cincinnati was getting worse seeming to hear it as well jenks hovered before the line hands on his hips and glaring at an oblivious man behind the coffeehouse windows there was no reason for the familiar to be using his second sight and unless he did we would be invisible i stepped forward dipping a hand through the line and deciding it felt okay even if it sounded bad the flow even and smooth perhaps trents dad had had a deeper relationship with demonkind than trent wanted to admit being able to step through a ley line and into the demon mall and coffee shop was a little too convenienteven if it was going to save both our asses ready to go i ran my hands down my linen blouse it was going to stink to high heaven when i got back quen dont let him follow me i said as i took a step forward into the line rachel wait trents voice stopped me cold and i turned still in reality even if i was in the ley line he was digging in his pocket and i warmed when i realized id almost left without the rings he held them out and a spark of magic jumped between us as the rings fell into my hand it was the ley line not him but i still shivered thanks i said sheepishly nodding he stepped back with a quick sharp motion gesturing for me to go jenkss wings clattered and with a final thin smile i willed myself into the everafter nose wrinkling i took three steps within the line walking through the wall in reality and into the demon coffeehouse i jerked as the muggy stink of everafter and the echoing sound of a european band singing about red balloons hit me what is it with demons and the s i wondered not for the first time the familiar looked up from behind the counter by the two worlds colliding dont jump into reality in here he berated me perhaps not even knowing about the door and thinking id jumped in he looked oddly familiar with his green apron and cap i dont care how much of a hurry your demon is in for his coffee if you mesh with the wall im not paying for it i gave the guy a quick smile backpedaling for the door sorry wrong store use the circles at the fountain he said eyes narrowed stupidass newbie he looked like a scottish lord from a romance novel the bushy sideburns and thick blocky muscles not doing a thing for me but as my scrabbling hand found the doorknob he muttered an oath hey wait youre rachel morgan right he said dropping his rag hold on i got something for you my hand slipped from the knob and i turned me his head was down and he was rummaging in a bin behind the counter yeah my boss has a proposition you might be interested in shoulders slumping i sighed trent quen and jenks were probably watching with their second sight and i did have a timetable sorry i said as i yanked the door open and the music got louder im not making tulpas right now saving the world you know again no wait just take it ill give you a coffee on the house i couldnt care less about the nasty coffee but the guy at the fountains jumpspot might and i reluctantly took the envelope he was eagerly extending it was thick contract thick and i shoved it in a back pocket to look at later an everafter job might be advantageous if al and i ended up being strapped for cash again was my life truly this predictable or did i just keep making the same mistakes over and over straight up black right the guy was saying hustling behind the counter for a togo cup and filling it with something black and bitter it wasnt coffee but it was the best they had and i took it just to get out of the place great thanks i said hoisting it mmmm good on the house he affirmed backing up and looking both nervous and pleased with himself let me know about the contract there was no bell to jingle as i went out into the mall and after a quick look up and down the wide avenue i headed to the central fountain and the jumpdemons though demons could jump lines at will familiars needed to buy them and to facilitate ease of passage demons convicted of minor crimes such as uncommon stupidity paid their debts by providing jumps on the weekend there might be as many as ten jumpdemons clustered around the center fountain moving people out but this early on a tuesday morning and with the impending line trouble there was only one head down i angled to him he might have just been a demon waiting for someone but the hat he was wearing said differently jump me to newts for a coffee i said as i got close and he opened one eye it was really weird i knew i was deep underground but between the shifting lighting shadow fitful breeze and wide space it felt as if we were outside on a cloudy day a really hot cloudy day newts he said around a lazy yawn then did a double take pulling himself upright when he actually looked at me a panicked expression raced across his face until it was replaced by mistrust my eyes narrowed when he poked my shoulder as if trying to decide if i was real by the two worlds colliding you really are rachel i thought you were newt damn girl wait until i tell my familiar touch me again and youll really be in pain i said shoving the cup at him newts kitchen you know it he took the coffee and looked at the ceiling costs more this week i forced my jaw to unclench look im trying to save your asses you really think its a good idea to try to skin me for a sliver of smut the demons gaze came back to me no look up there the ceiling is down by about a foot from yesterday space is shrinking and unless you want to end up in a wall i need a gargoyle assist shit it is happening already no wonder it is so warm well he said how bad you want in if i didnt get these rings fixed nothing was going to happen i really didnt give a flying flip about the everafter but i wanted ceri and lucy back ill take the smut i said and he grandly took his cap off to dust the nearest circle two demons across the plaza had noticed me damn one of them was dali i gave him a bunnyeared kisskiss and he vanished leaving his friend to eye me in speculation great this was going just great can we make this fast i said as i stepped into the circle it was taking too long grunting he gestured and the line iced through me dissolving me to a thought and back to substance again the line felt sour but it was still even in flow the gargoyle assist made the materialization smooth without the barest hint of unequal air pressures or misstep i misted back into existence in my kitchen hey i shouted turning to him but the jump was complete and i was yelling at my old refrigerator my eyes narrowed it was my old refrigerator the one you could put a goat into not that ivy and i ever had id blown it up almost two years ago on the solstice i vowed if you ever put her image on your twisted bones again i would not stay my hand you foul carrion i spun pierce i shrieked as he came at me from across the kitchen grabbing a knife from the counter as he ran pierce its me my breath exploded out of me as i hit the wall his arm under my chin and a knife at my middle this wasnt my kitchen the fridge was old the light was wrong the copper pots were too tarnished its me i choked blood pounding get off but he only snarled the scent of coal dust and shoe polish filling my senses hey i yelped when the knife pricked me and i kneed him getting my arms up and between his when his grip eased get off clutching himself he fell back pissed i tugged my clothes straight and kicked the knife away a wave of everafter coated him and i touched my side my fingers coming away wet with blood damn it hed cut right through my shirt pierce knelt on the floor before me in wool trousers and a colorful vest looking like an actor from an early movie his expression pained he leaned back on his heels his arms spread wide and his neck bared to me go ahead he screamed eyes shut as if daring me to strike him with lightning rip my heart out you foul beast i could use the time off to plan your demise i stared he looked okay other than the total surrender thing he had going on his dark curly hair was down to his shoulders again but his beard was gone making him look younger if he was upright hed be almost my height exactly well proportioned and looking like no stranger to hard work he opened one eye and when i didnt say anything a hint of confusion made him all the more appealing i thought i might have loved him once but he was too quick to use the black magic and he kept trying to kill the very people i needed to survive ah pierce i said thinking this might have been a mistake you okay his breath came in a heave and he scrambled to his feet his face became ashen then red rachel he said echoing my same hesitancy i looked over the kitchen so clearly a mockery of mine now that i had a moment to look at it my god it was hot in here newt isnt here is she if newt was making duplicates of my kitchen then she was probably taunting pierce with images of me as well either that or the man was truly off his rocker by the horrified expression he was now wearing though i thought he was stonecold sane by all creation its really you he exclaimed and i fell back to the wall when he rushed me my lips curled up in a smile when he gave me a quick hug my arms going about him to find he felt both familiar and different almost immediately he dropped back pumping my hand up and down i am powerfully sorry he gushed eyes bright i thought you were her the hag appears as you to get a rise out of me when shes bored are you hurt did i bruise you i should have known it was you gods im a toad im fine i said hoping he didnt see the tiny cut sorry about ah hitting you are you okay he went scarlet glancing at the floor where hed prostrated himself on my mercy im of a mind i deserved it and more looking shamed he fell back a step i agree my situation isnt ideal and a far cry from the pomp and circumstance of a coven member but i understand the world here unlike the one you live in and every time i try to kill her i get a little closer i came out from against the wall both curious and afraid to see the rest of newts apartments oh i almost had the harlot the last time but she turned into you he gestured weakly his eyes pinching at the corners as he tried to explain the last five minutes i couldnt do it pierce i started my hand on the table so alike but not the same as the one ivy had perhaps i should have tried harder to get him back on the reality side of the lines its who i am he said solemnly taking my hand and making me look at him i think she enjoys my trying to kill her he winced looking worried youre on her mind be careful thats not a healthy place to be thats why im here i said pulling away shes out right oh aye shes out on the surface the everafter is shrinking and shes trying to talk to sleeping gargoyles he leaned back arms over his chest we could almost be in my kitchen if you didnt look close theres talk of killing you kusox is petitioning for it in soft whispers he pushed forward eyes eager we can kill him you and i rachel is that why youre here it is isnt it why else would you risk it especially now no pierce i cant kill kusox he turned away opening cupboards to show tools and instruments my kitchen had never had not alone certainly he said confidently with my help its possible let me gather my things and we will be away that monster dead in five minutes distressed i felt the rings in my pocket not even with your help i said and he glanced up from a drawer frowning i remembered that frown and i stifled a surge of tired anger pierce ive fought him before and hes too strong too fast im not that good mmm he grumbled then shocked me when he opened the gas oven and pulled out a heavy lockbox i have a curse i was going to inflict on her next time i found her sleeping the box hit the floor with a thud and i jumped he wasnt listening pierce here is the wicked thing he said having opened it up thats a demon killer if i ever saw one pierce stop he had stood and i took his hands folding them about whatever ley line charm hed made eye to eye he squinted at me in mistrust and i slowly let go im not going to confront kusox in a test of magic im not afraid of him i said when pierce took a breath to protest but everyone else is and i know my limits rachel i know my limits i said again silent until he brought his sour expression back to me i dont have to kill him just prove that hes the one who unbalanced my line pierce frowned looking capable and disappointed in the fake sunlight coming in the window it was foggy past the blue curtains it would always be foggy then why are you here if youre not seeking my help to kill him heart pounding i brought out the rings these i said and he picked up the largest one i need to reinvoke them you said it was possible theyre deader than a threeday possum he said dryly handing it back what do they do create a bond between two people theyre elven chastity rings pierce started his blue eyes jerking from me to the rings and back again shoving the demon killer ley line charm in a deep pocket he slid the box back into the oven smooth muscles moved under his thin cotton shirt and i remembered the feel of them under my fingertips he was a beautiful man but i didnt trust his decisions especially when they impacted my life in a big way chastity rings he questioned when the oven door shut the rings felt heavy in my palm i think i can fix the line but i need a spotter to pull me out if i get lost and since the rings make a connection between two magic users an allfire close one id think he muttered his manner closed as he wiped his fingerprints off the oven door with the towel drying on a cabinet knob can you do it his eyes flicked up to mine id rather kill him my sigh was heavy and i waited i needed his help and i knew he wouldnt let me leave without it i hadnt been able to love him but he had loved me head down he gestured and i jumped when a circle tinged with his green aura rose up around us it was a great deal stronger than i rememberedhis time with newt had done him good perhaps id misjudged him does she often make her kitchen look like mine i asked as i came closer the corner of the center counter between us only when youre on her mind im powerfully concerned for you rachel i wasnt embarrassed by asking for his help but it was hard knowing that i meant more to him than he to me thank you i whispered as i put the rings on the counter the trick is to not flood them he said ignoring my guilty look you cant use a ley line that would break them for sure even your aura is too much when its all together but if you splinter it he picked up the rings positioning the smaller inside the larger fill them with one resonance before allowing the rest in you can make a pie of it he set the rings in my palm cupping his hands about it a shiver went through me and he smiled its much like a rainbow is the sum of visible light you first put in the red then shift it to orange then yellow then green and so on until you finally get all the colors singing together and they melt into a white light and the charm invokes he was standing close his warmth and the scent of coal dust and shoe polish were bringing back memories good but uncomfortable show me i asked and we both looked at the rings in my hand his cupping mine push your aura off your hand he said and my head snapped up thats why the circle he soothed go on do it my face puckered up but i imagined my aura going thin at my fingertips peeling back from my fingers soaking into my skin and vanishing to leave a huge gaping hole in my first line of defense cold pinpricks stabbed my hand my aura wanted to return but i held it off good it had been a hopeful grunt of approval and i caught back my adrenaline before i lost control before me pierce shifted his shoulders clearly uncomfortable as well as he removed his own aura the rings felt unnaturally heavy in my palm and pierces loose grip around my hand intimate now im of a mind that your gargoyle bis has been leading you in the practice of shifting your aura he said and i nodded nervous then simply tune the entirety of it to the clearest red you can imagine i met his eyes seeing an unknown emotion i couldnt see my aura but he could and flustered i shifted it knowing i had it right when he nodded just so he said let a thin ribbon of it spill down into your hand mind you keep it a trace he exclaimed and i backed off it was hardly a whisper but as it touched the rings nestled in my palm i swear i heard them chime like the ringing of a glass when you run your finger along the top i could feel my aura like warm silk tracing down the soft part of my arm and making a warm pool in my palm you have a knack he prompted clearly pleased but even so theres too much it is an art and you have to plan ahead such that it just fills the memory and no more i licked my lips eyeing the rings and my aura echoing from them hows this i asked as i backed off until there was almost no sound at all perfect but be of a mind that its harder to remove it once given err on the side of hunger smiling i looked up there was a happy contentment in his eyes my smile faded pierce i cant do this youre halfway there he cajoled and i shook my head pulling my hand from his no i mean you youre standing there looking at me as if we just came out of that hole in the ground in trents woods i cant do this i cant ask you to help me when you think there might be a chance that someday my words cut off i was helpless to continue head shaking ruefully he took my hand back in his own i know when ive been given the shrug he said tilting his head to keep me quiet when i rushed to explain you did well by me and we both turned our attentions elsewhere id be a cad to expect you to think of me as anything other than fondly but a man cant help but remember now hold the aura as it is and shift it to orange what is needed of the red will remain within the charm easy now if you can do this then you can do the rest thank you i breathed hanging my head and closing my eyes because i couldnt bear to look at him anymore orange i thought shifting my aura as bis and i had been practicing this was easier than the melding of colors that we usually did sitting at an outside café and trying to mimic the auras of people passing by and pierces grunt of approval was like a wash of hope through me now to yellow he prompted more than before since yellow is so thin to begin with i knew what he meant and like hearing a partial chord of a song and knowing what came next i layered another complexity over the rings seeing it soak in as the excess orange melted away the rings were starting to hum taking on a note all their own the blues and purples he whispered excitement in his voice you are a caution rachel the demon you will be i almost lost it but caught myself concentrating on the feel of his hands around mine as i added the last sweat trickled down and i cracked open an eye at the funny tickle of feeling in my chi my aura wanted to flood the rings with power and i held it tight my god pierce breathed easy rachel hint at a shadow of black it should have invoked it needs a harmony of something else something dark ive never charmed elven silver it needs something else i was holding my breath and i let it out as i turned my aura to an ultraviolet hue it was as if smut snaked down my arm but when it hit the rings it pooled around them refusing to join and then tiny cracks appeared in the cold dead metal shit easy pierce whispered as he stared at them let it soak in my head was starting to hurt and my arm felt dead pinpricks coated it and i began to shake the cracks grew sending spiderwebs of instability through the surface of the rings panicked i froze there wasnt enough energy in there yet to rekindle the charm but any more and it would break pierce i warbled and his fingers around mine grew warm i cant do anything he said rachel you have to finish it its going to break i said i cant hold it its that damned elven magic he said and i caught my breath when his hands left mine your energy is not mixing with the original makers can you think elf thoughts think elf thoughts i mocked in my head but the cracks werent going away i couldnt stop and i couldnt move forward i knew it would blow them to hell if i just let it go elf thoughts i muttered frowning as i thought of trent tricky proud arrogant the skin of the rings seemed to shimmer and i took a quick breath the cracks were still there but it felt right my teeth clenched and the memory of trents music as he sung my soul to sleep slipped into me hazy from my subconscious it was his plea to his goddess that he didnt believe in to listen the source of his wild magic it circled around and around in my head until i felt a somnolent nothing seem to take notice hesitating in its glorious song turning one of a thousand eyes to me hear me i thought begging see what im doing lend me your skill wild magic smiled at me and the skin of the rings warbled my last shining of aura reached for the rings and with a ping of sound that echoed in my soul the magic vibrated through me and became one that simple the rings reinvoked themselves and sealed i gasped staring at the rings glowing in my palm like glory itself well ill be pierce beamed as his protective circle flickered and went out you did it first time out of the box elated i clutched the rings i had a chance now i had a chance to fix the line to free lucy and ceri i looked at the clock on the stove before i remembered where i was i had to get back to trent we had to move on this and now thank you pierce thank you i said pulling him into an expansive hug my clenched hand with the rings tight to his back i couldnt have done it without you i can do something now thank you he was smiling when i dropped back his curls at his forehead damp with the heat and my expression froze when he touched my hair you did it not me he said all of it i only told you how you never needed me even when you were but a young woman i let go of him the memory of what lay in his eyes rushing back i did i said needing to be honest i did need you i was strong with you you helped me find that eyes down i shoved the rings away im sorry i said knowing it was over but not remembering why pierce took a step back to put more space between us i demanded too much he said his sadness at himself not me i see in your heart you found someone who makes you strong who does not hold too tight who has learned that the pain of losing you to fate is more than the pain of you dying in a cage who is he i looked at the clock again no one ivy he guessed immediately shaking his head no someone new no someone old he said firmly his eyes going to my pocket an elf he guessed then became ashen kalamack he blurted taking my shoulders rachel no he pleaded i know i have no right but he lies he deceives it is their nature this is his plan isnt it that you come here risking yourself instead of him it was my plan i said pulling back in anger oh yes now i remembered why it hadnt worked it was all i could do to make him stay and not follow me here he wouldve been recognized i have a right to be here i glanced at newts kitchen well not here here but the everafter besides would youve taught him how to invoke the rings damn it hed made me mad at him again and i didnt want to be he made you think it was your idea pierce pleaded dont trust him hes a kalamack he i started not knowing where i was going with my argument pierce had said id found someone new to love and trent wasnt it but to say so sounded like i was protesting my way into a bag of truth theres no reason i cant work with him i said belligerently making a fist to hide trents pinkie ring kusox stole ceri and his daughter i can trust his hate there was a small circle on the floor where id popped in and i stood in it waiting for his help to get out of here nothing like needing an exboyfriend to slam your door for you as you make your dramatic exit but he will spoil you rachel pierce said and i stared until i realized he meant ruin not overindulge hell turn your heart hard and you will become as him a shallow selfindulgent shell of what you are now dont trust him let me help you i have an arsenal we can destroy kusox together right now this very hour your strength and my charms our magics blend so well with those rings we can make a fist of it for sure i looked him up and down not surprised the rings are not for attack theyre a safety net for fixing the line you keep telling me that trent is going to change me but youre the one who keeps trying to get me to kill everyone but it needs to be done he insisted and i crossed my arms over my chest send me to the mall please i said tightly i appreciate your help more than you will ever know rachel it was stifling and i brought my attention down from the ceiling pierce stood before me looking capable and strong with his curls about him and his eyes promising me success i remembered how thick his circle had become and imagined the skills hed been honing since becoming newts familiar had she been training him for this can you leave newts rooms without being detected i asked already knowing the answer his head dropped no my posture eased and my anger vanished im sorry pierce i said touching his arm youll jingle like bells in the forest and i have to move with stealth youve given me a tool that i didnt have before i can do this thank you jaw tight he looked up hearing the truth in it do you need anything i asked not wanting to leave like this only that which you cant give and i will not ask for it yep thats about what i thought sick at heart i shifted foot to foot i have to go a savage light lit through his eyes and his chin lifted wait there is one thing moving close his expression became almost taunting let me kiss you goodbye for if fate allows that i see you again you will not be you anymore pierce i whispered but hed taken both my shoulders and pulled me close my breath caught and as our lips touched he filled my soul with the memory of his love tears warmed my eyes and i didnt pull away wanting just for a moment this perfect spot of what we might have had our auras already sensitized to each other mixed with swirls of pinpricked energy sparking over our skin as our lips moved against each other and his hands pressed into me with the memory of what had been slowly he let go and i wiped my eyes with the back of my hand not ashamed for my tears i could have loved him but he demanded too much im not going to change i said meaning several things at once chin high he let go and stepped back elves are more evil than demons they warp you to suit their needs and make you think it was your idea you will always be in my heart rachel morgan go before my foul jailer comes back pierce he turned away and gestured go i vanished seeing him standing in a spot of sunlight that never moved alone and apart but wanting more i am not becoming trents tool i thought as i misted back into existence at the fountain and the trite sound of synthesizers and cheerful lyrics beat on me i was making my own decisions not trents pierce was seeing the world through ancient glasses but as i pushed past the few meandering demons in search of the coffeehouse i couldnt dispel a faint whisper of warning chapter thirteen cool and carrying the hint of rain the night wind pushed against me sporadically sending my hair to tickle my neck it brought to me the smell of early lilac and the sound of spring frogs and running water far in the distance was the sound of interstate traffic barely a whisper behind me loveland castle loomed dark empty and forbidding trents snazzy black sports car sat parked in the dirt lot my car was still at his gatehouse the light from the camp lantern on the retaining wall behind me barely made it to the surrounding forest stretching around usjust far enough to make the place feel creepy edgy i shifted my feet into the gravelly scree of the lower garden path as i stood in the glow of the lantern my hands on my hips and bis on the crumbling retaining wall behind me four feet tall it almost put him eye to eye with me together we looked across the tall grass at the damaged ley line stretching across the lower longfallow garden and waited for jenks and trent to return the ley line looked ugly with my second sight worse in the lamps glow than it had in the sun with violetpurple streamers coming from the line to soak up the energy leaking through but for all its nasty appearance i was sure the line itself was fine apart from the original leak kusox had moved all the minuscule imbalances from the other lines concentrating them in mine to make an event horizon it was an event all right the last one the demons would ever see i shivered despite the nights warmth and bis tightened his grip on the retaining wall making the stones crack i didnt want to let the little guy know how nervous i was but it was hard with him so close trents rings were in my pocket i had refused to give them to him when id come back through the vault afraid hed come out here with quen and do something stupid quen wasnt up to magic yet and it had taken both of us to convince the man to stay with ray tonight lest ellasbeth take her to the west coast for her own hostage demands trent was helping jenks canvass the nearby area for pixy intel but i still felt naked knowing that al wouldnt be able to save my butt if kusox showed for the first time i was really on my own well i whispered to bis wishing they would hurry up what do you think bis shifted his clawed hind feet and bits of rock pattered down it hurts he said simply ears pinned to his skull depressed i went to sit on the stone wall beside him scooting myself up until my feet hung above the lower path but do you think we can separate the imbalances he shrugged looking lost as his ears perked up i was asking a lot and i edged closer rocks pinching me let me hear i said touching his foot so i could feel the lines resonate my teeth clenched as suddenly every single ley line within my reach sung inside my head it was a heady experienceand why i usually had a bubble of protection around my thoughts when i touched bis this time though the harsh discord of my nearby ley line cut through the beauty making my teeth ache and my head hurt my god i said as i let go of him and stared at the line with my second sight how can you stand it and how am i going to separate anything from that noise the catsize gargoyle shrugged touching his wingtips together over his head i dont have a choice everyone is tired of listening to it ive been told to fix it and fix it now my thoughts zinged back to the three gargoyles id seen tonight before wed left perched on the roof of the church and spitting at the pixies to keep them out of earshot as they talked in low rumbles i wouldve gone up into the belfry to eavesdrop but i was afraid they might take bis and move to another church you i said surprised but its my line his red eyes glowed eerily in the lanterns light and im responsible for you having made it bis this isnt your fault neither is kusox exploiting the tear to try to break the everafter even if you hadnt left me i would have scraped that hole trying to get out i clutched my arms around myself cold as i remembered it i might have managed to jump the lines but id damaged my aura and scraped a hole in reality in the process but i left you he said unable to look at me smiling i bubbled my thoughts and touched his shoulder it was my fault not yours for trying to jump a line before i knew what i was doing he was silent and i gave his shoulder a squeeze before letting go i knew he still blamed himself hed changed a lot since then waking up in the day for brief periods becoming more somber less prone to playing tricks on the pixies he was getting older and i worried that id brought an end to his childhood before its time is this why there have been gargoyles on the roof with you i asked not sure how much hed be willing to tell me immediately bis brightened theyre teaching me the vibrations of their lines he said proudly usually a gargoyle is taught by only one other gargoyle but the lines arent acting right so theyre taking turns by singing me only their line the one they know by heart ddemons i stammered youve been talking to demonbound gargoyles he nodded almost going invisible as he flushed a deep black to make his red eyes stand out theyre trying to teach me all the lines so that i can teach them to you i only know a few since most wont leave the everafter and their demons they want me to come to them he dropped his eyes scared of the idea and i frowned the lines arent acting right he said clawed feet shifting as he looked at the line demons arent jumping on their own at all everyone needs their gargoyle like theyre brandnew to line jumping remembering my jump from the mall to newts kitchen i nodded theyre teaching you line jumping i said and he grinned a glint of light showing on his thick black teeth yup i looked at the line then him so you know what some of the lines sound like he nodded making a face i know what theyre supposed to sound like theyre off because their imbalances are here in my line fingers tapping the cold stone i thought that over bis if you know what theyre supposed to sound like and you can hear what they sound like now then maybe i can find whats missing in my line here and shift it back its the misplaced imbalance thats causing the trouble biss eyes blinked slowly maybe thats what they were talking about he said his heavy brow furrowing pigeon poop rachel talking to those old gars is like talking to crazy old men they never come out and tell you what they mean everything is spoons and twolegged chairs what does a spoon have to do with a ley line i dont know do you clearly he was frustrated i could sympathize having listened to enough wiseoldman crap to fill a wheelbarrow no i admitted but if we can separate even one imbalance and put it back it might make a big difference in the leak buy us some more time or kusox might show up bis said true i exhaled heavily and turned in a slow circle looking into the dark for the silver tracing of pixy dust jenks should have been back by now trent was slowing him down sounds kind of hard bis said the tip of his tail twitching i turned to follow his gaze to the ugly shrill line slumping as my first excitement died i know i said dejectedly i have no idea how to separate the imbalances bis moved his wings the hush of leather against leather making me shiver why does it have to be hard biss head turned a second later jenkss wings clatter became obvious it always is jenks said as he hovered before us dusting heavily and clearly having heard biss last statement behind him a black shadow strode out from the surrounding woods it had to be trent or jenks would be having issues besides no one else i knew moved with that kind of grace well i asked jenks trying not to look at trent as he rejoined us pierces warning was still ringing in me i was not in love with trent and never would beespecially with ellasbeth back in the picture and trent on a mission to save the elves true we worked marginally well together his unexpected surprises were annoying but they did generally work out and yes he looked more than a little attractive in his sturdy black jeans tuckedin stretchy shirt and lightweight rain jacket his fair hair was covered with a black cap to keep off the damp and the black gloves were probably just for effect because i knew he wasnt cold but to entertain anything more than a casual work relationship was laughable seeing jenks hovering over his shoulder i was struck by how they managed to look as if they went together though they were nothing alike there isnt much here for pixies unless theres a tour coming through jenks said his face glowing from the dust they remember you being here yesterday and a bunch of demons before that but not one on his own like kusox we did a quick survey and were good for at least a quarter mile unless you count the raccoons i squinted at the line okay im going to take a looksee youre not getting in that line jenks shouted and biss red eyes widened in alarm im not getting in the line i said glancing at trent to see him watching me with the same intensity as jenks you think im out here sniffing fairy farts bis knows what some of the lines are supposed to sound like and by comparing that to what they sound like now maybe we can find the imbalance bubble it and move it out my words trailed off when trent tilted his head that wasnt our original idea jenks hovered right before my nose wings clattering belligerently yeah then what i winced maybe if i move it out it might just get sucked back into place bis was making this weird noise and we all turned to him i think it was his version of clearing his throat but it sounded like rocks in a garbage disposal ah bubbled imbalance wont get sucked anywhere he said apologetically but if you tune the bubble holding it to the same vibration as its parent line his words trailed off and his wings shifted trents exhale was long and slow it wasnt the immediate no i had expected and seeing him consider it jenks seemed to become even more frustrated tinks little pink rosebuds he grumbled landing next to bis and checking the sharpness of his sword now ive got two of them to watch whose idea was this he looked up at bis yours i waited nervously as trent thought it over his boots scuffing the gravel tuning your aura to a line pulls you into it so tuning a bubble which is basically an auratainted field of force will pull whatever is in the bubble to the line its worth a look since we have the rings as a safety net he turned to jenks jenks what do you think my eyebrows rose asking jenks for his opinion maybe the time theyd worked together had made an impact after all i think youre all screwy in the head he said when bis nodded his encouragement but go ahead ive got quens number in my phone ill call him if you both explode in a flash of black underwear and money so i wont have to fly all the way home bis made a snuffing snort of a laugh but i was thrilled and my heart gave a thump and settled lets do it i said as i turned to the line bis you want to sit on my shoulder he nodded and as jenks crossed his arms over his chest and hovered over the wall bis made the threebeat wing flap to me landing with his toes spread wide so he wouldnt gouge me when he landed the lines flashed into existence at his touch but prepared for it i gritted my teeth at the tinfoillike sensation it was awful seeing as we were so close to a line and i could understand why the gargoyles on both sides of reality were having issues rache jenks said suspiciously when my eyes closed in a strengthgathering blink fine i said then choked when bis tightened his tail around my neck sorry he said as he loosened his hold the little guy was the size of a cat but had the weight of a bird smelling like cold stone leather and feathers from the pigeons he ate my god i said as i stared at the line a sharp pain starting just over my right eye this is awful bis can you show me what one of the line signatures youve learned looks like trent cleared his throat you want to use that safety net or keep it in your pocket ms morgan i jerked sheepish at jenkss severe look as i wiggled the rings out and extended them to trent on my palm bis wiggled his toes as they glinted in the lanterns light i think youd have more control if you took the bigger ring i said and as trent reached for it i closed my fist no funny stuff i warned opening my fingers again trent put his hand under mine to hold it steady jerking back in alarm when the full force of the lines hit him through bis holy ah wow he said eyes wide in the low light distress clear on him is that what the line feels like to you biss feet tightened on me it kind of hurts can we hurry up immediately trent took the larger ring i put the smaller one on my pinkie but if it was like our practice run earlier nothing would happen until he put his on it bothered me that the only way i could take off my ring now was if trent slipped his over mine nesting them on my finger to remove them both at once it had been a scary five minutes figuring that out here we go trent said as he took his gloves off and jenks frowned still not convinced the glint of the pinkie ring twin to my own caught my eye and i wondered at the connections we had i still wore als demon mark was it the same thing or different my shoulders wiggled as the ring fitted about trents finger and a weird sensation of entanglement sprung up around me bis actually sighed in relief as the connection to the discordant line dulled it was still there but it felt dilutedthe best i could put it was that the energy was now going through a maze of passages to find me it was the chastity ring and when i nodded trent eased the grip of it until the flow was again its normal self almost as if he had lifted me above the maze and i could connect normally trents presence was faint in my uppermost thoughts sort of like a teacher walking the aisles during a test we were ready and i closed my eyes okay bis loosened his tail about my neck and shivered ah im going to sing you newts line first my concentration shattered newts i exclaimed heart pounding newt has a gargoyle jenks exclaimed and biss tail tightened until i nearly choked rachel will you listen i think im going to spew pigeon feathers newts was the first one i learned okay i nodded closing my eyes again which made me feel dizzy give me a sec i said as i sat down in the puddle of lantern light but then it only felt like the world was tilting rachel trents voice was close and i put my palms on the ground for balance dizzy i said smiling at him were okay jenkss wings clattered this is as smart as sleeping outside in november jenks grumbled you sure you got her cookie maker ive got her just watch the woods pixy listen bis demanded as he resettled his wings and i closed my eyes feeling the pure ting of a rise and fall of sound glittering in my minds eye like a silver thread of light a bare hint of jagged red and gray and silver half a beat out of step with the glorious hum it sounded sort of familiar comfortable like the line in the graveyard got it he asked and i mmhmmed this is what it sounds like now he said and i jerked as if struck when the world seemed to hiccup the feeling of the line i was looking at with my mind shifted slightly and sure enough the ragged half step was gone no way i whispered and my eyes opened trent was standing guard with his eyes on the forest line jenks was hovering at my eye level his angular features pinched behind him the line glowed like a deranged fair ride dangerous and unreliable rache he warned and i held a hand up to forestall his next words trent has me and im not going to do anything bis doesnt want i reached up to touch the gargoyles feet bis you want me to try to find that ragged half step in the imbalance bis jumped to the ground before me the expansive backdrop of the lines in my mindscape had vanished along with his touch and my shoulders relaxed bis shifted from foot to foot as his tail whipped about until he curved it over his feet and sat like a little lion im sure this is how to fix the line he said and i heard a big unsaid however ill be careful i said to jenks then looked at trent i wont do anything until bis tells me i can okay jenks squinted at me and when trent nodded the pixy gestured sourly to bis to get on with it a fourinch man ruled us all maybe you should bubble yourself first trent suggested in case kusox shows it was a good idea but as i sketched a small easytohold bubble around bis and myself jenkss dust went an alarmed red okay thats it jenks shouted hovering before all of us i didnt like this before and i like it less now rache there has to be another way bis met my eyes shaking his head so narrowly it was almost no movement at all i looked past him to trent his stance stiff and his expression fixed kusox was stronger than me if we couldnt fix the line and prove that kusox had made it then how would we ever get lucy and ceri back jenks i said softly and he hummed irately at me its going to be okay trent will yank my butt out if i get stuck im going to do a perimeter he muttered you and trent do your magic thing he buzzed off into the dark and my gaze went to trent i didnt think jenks was jealous but it had to be hard to bear that i was putting myself in a narrow spot where anything bad could happen and probably would circle trent suggested his expression holding both determination and frustration for not being able to do this himself i didnt have a problem helping him i loved ceri and ray too feeling odd i reached a hand to the informal but securely scratched circle in the dirt it was small but i was sitting rhombus i whispered within my thoughts and a moleculethin sheet of everafter sprang up it wavered as trent tested his hold on me through the rings and at my nod the circle sprang up strong again we were good bis was well within my circle and he fidgeted a wingtip sliding out and back in through my bubble he was the only person in two realities who could pass through my circle it was why it took a gargoyle to teach a demonor a witch for that matterto line jump gargoyles could hear the lines and tell those they were bonded to how to tune their aura so they would be sucked into the right line what gargoyles got out of the deal was beyond me okay bis said as he reached out to take my hands the harsh discord immediately fell on me and i tried not to wince his hands felt small in my grip and i forced myself to smile reassuringly take a look at your line here bis went on im going to focus on it and hopefully the rest of the background noise will go away my breath came faster as suddenly the only thing i was hearingseeing in my mind was my ugly ley line with the purple core screaming at me i couldnt even hear the pure ting of energy behind it it was disgusting rachel bis said in a pained voice and i opened one eye a little behind him trent was scribing a larger circle around mine that could hold all of us wise man right i turned my awareness to the purple sludge careful not to get my thoughts near it and possibly get sucked in purple everything was a blaring purple with fading striations of red the sound of it rushing through me like ants but the deeper i looked at it the more i was able to listen past the purple coating to the twining colors behind it reds blues greens oranges and even browns and gold just like auras they swirled together but never mixed find newts imbalance bis whimpered and i peeked at him again newts jenks shouted and my eyes opened wide to see him sitting on trents shoulder unable to stay away you telling me the line in the backyardwhere my kids playis newts biss face was screwed up and he nodded the tufts on his ears waving i didnt like the idea that the line i had claimed as my primary source had been created by newt either but it was what it was trent looked a little ill and i wondered whose halfamilelong line was running through his office back room and gardens fingers holding biss i resettled myself on the gravel path it was obvious that this tight of contact with the line was hurting him the discord was too loud too painful biss grip on my hands tightened now rachel i plunged my thoughts back in the line ghosting through the purple haze finding it easier now that id done it before searching discarding sifting until i found the half step of red tiny and lost among the rest got it i whispered heart pounding as i gathered it to me struggling to pull it free of the rest it was stuck like velcro bubble it bis said bring it out with you with us with a curious flipflop of thought i bubbled the colorsound my eyes snapped open as the connection broke and i suddenly found myself holding the memory of a mess of halfstep red vibration in my mind trent was sitting before us just outside the bubble with the line behind him his eyes were wide and i wondered how much he was getting through the rings whoa whoa whoa jenks said rising up on a dusting of blue that sounds like line jumping to me isnt this what you did to make your broken line to begin with bis was smiling looking exhausted as his wings drooped shes just going to move the imbalance not herself he looked at me his craggy brow furrowed in warning right my hair was tickling my face but i didnt dare let go of biss hand to brush it aside right i said and besides jenks ive got it already trents face was alight and i nodded at his unspoken question yep i had it it was doing flipflops in my soul and i didnt want to think about what might happen if i accidentally let go of the bubble and the imbalance became a part of me but i had it it sort of hurt your line sounds better already bis said his hand still in mine do you remember what newts line sounds like without the imbalance i bobbed my head afraid to move tune my aura to it no bis shouted startling me as his wings half opened and then softer almost sheepishly he said not your aura just the bubble around the imbalance i fidgeted embarrassed that trent had seen the near miss should i think about newt biss red eyes widened i dont think so i wouldnt jenks said sourly rachel will you just dump that imbalance and get on with it your aura looks really creepy holding a chunk of newts trent was nodding his agreement so i closed my eyes to better focus on the bubble of imbalance trapped in my minds eye it was coated with my cheerful gold aura and a thin layer of demon smut and i needed to shift it to silvery gray red licking my lips i screwed my face up as i tried to imagine silver pinpricks blossoming on my gold sphere growing to encompass everything tune it higher bis whimpered clearly in pain im trying i said tightening my focus my breath sucked in as the bubble flashed silver overfocusing to a solid black with a curious sideways shuffle i pulled it back to silver imagining a shading of a pure tinge of red lined with gray for one breathless moment i held it feeling my entire soul chime with the sound of silver light and then it was gone there was a faint tug and then even that severed my awareness snapping back with a twang rachel my eyes flew open at trents call hed felt it i thought he might heart pounding i looked at bis in the lamplight trent standing behind him with jenks on his shoulder the gargoyle looked as shocked as me holy crap i shouted my voice echoing back from the trees did we you did the small gargoyle exclaimed and i ducked as he made one push with his wings and was through my circle and airborne flying loops with the bats and yelling in delight i beamed at trent we had done it and if we had done it once we could do it again and again until the line was fixed you did it rachel bis said startling me as he skidded to a landing on the gravel path peppering my circle with kickedup stones his wings were spread and his eyes wild you did it look at that line it sounds better already we all did it i said as i dropped the circle to put a hand on his shoulder the glory of the lines flooded me and yes once i got past the discord i could tell there was the faintest lessening of the leak relief filled me and i swear i almost cried nicely done rachel smiling up at trent i accepted his hand and stood our pinkie rings glinted together in the light and i didnt know how to feel about it my hands were shaking but i was ready to put another imbalance back if bis was pulling my hand from trents i looked for bis another one i asked my intention obvious and he nodded from the retaining wall his red eyes glowing in the lamplight jenkss wings clattered as he dropped down shrilling something so fast i couldnt understand him you surprise me rachel came an oily voice from the dark and i spun heart pounding as i turned to the river kusox crap on toast its kusox jenks shouted dripping an angry frightened red dust his sword was out and his wings by my ear harsh not in that you figured it out kusox said a small sphere of light blossoming in his hand to show his presence beside my screaming damaged line but that youre stupid enough to be out here alone bis landed on my other side puffing up as much he could by sucking in the moisture from the air the size of a large dog he crouched beside me with his tail thrashing shes not alone jenks spat hovering at head height and brandishing his sword back off cute socks i cut your nose off before ill do it again kusoxs globe of light flickered and with that as my only warning i invoked my protection circle still scratched in the dust around me bis yelped at the energy i yanked through me the gargoyle shrinking as a ball of greenish black bounced off trents larger circle invoked an instant before mine kusoxs spell hit the nearby retaining wall and stuck glowing a weird greenish light i dropped my circle i stood whitefaced and the ugly line hummed through me harsh and dizzying as i pulled it in trying to become stronger i cursed you i exclaimed as i stood behind a grimfaced trent you cant leave the everafter i havent smug he walked into the light of our hissing lantern and my stomach clenched as my first thought was borne out nick he had possessed him a doppelgänger curse was easy demons did them all the time al had once possessed lee to walk about in reality in the daytime youre fortunate that your boyfriend is rather light in the loafers when it comes to manipulating ley line energy kusox said confirming my thoughts or i would tear through your familiars paltry circle and be done with you right now hes not my familiar i said as kusox halted before us and nick is not my boyfriend he is a mistake nodding absently kusox poked at trents circle evaluating the dimple he made as bis continued to hiss and jenks landed on my shoulder in solidarity the demon was in a threepiece suit and it looked dumb out here in the weedy garden at the foot of a homemade castle whereas als crushed green velvet had somehow seemed right at home the light coming from the spell that had hit the wall supplemented the lantern showing his silverygray hair slicked back and reflecting off his shiny shoes his expression was smug as he eyed me running his eyes up and down my silhouette in a way i decidedly didnt like this body im in remembers what you feel like inside and out trent stiffened and the psychotic demon turned to him your whore and child are alive come with me now and they will stay that way i gripped trents arm but he shrugged me off the rising scent of cinnamon nearly overpowering the stench of everafter kusox reeked of if you go with him nothing will stop him i said and trents frustration grew until his circle hummed with it dont you think i know that i wondered if he was wishing hed never freed kusox i knew i was sighing dramatically kusox rolled his eyes as entertaining as this is would you mind if we flipped to the last page i want that curse lifted you put on me rachel i want trenton aloysius kalamack to make me a brandnew generation of demons to play with and i want the ancient demons dead i want the everafter dead so i may never be trapped there again and i want it all in that order notice you are not on the list yet his gaze traveled over the lines of my tattoo and i stifled a tremor feeling it jenks lifted from my shoulder are you fairyfarting kidding me jenks said and biss tail lashed through my bubble rache you dont actually believe this freak do you kusox almost snarled at the insult but then his eyes lifted from bis to trent working with elves really rachel i think you should be commended for stretching your abilities but newt would be most displeased with you i pushed to the front of trents bubble heres my list we fix the line i said as i carefully siphoned energy off the discordant line and filled my chi then the ancient demons grow a pair and we all shove you in a little hole in st louis again thats my list i dont care if its in that order either kusox dramatically rolled his eyes my god you are so like a woman thats because i am one oh this is tiresome kusox moaned and then he gestured his hand glowing look out jenks shrilled shooting straight up both trent and i instinctively crouched trent gasped as kusoxs spell tore through his bubble breaking it and i threw a wad of energy at the incoming ball deflecting it the night wind shifted my hair and kusoxs energy pinged over my ley line and into the woods to die there was a tug and trents circle was up again kusox jerked to a halt so close the circle hummed a warning trents eyes met mine and slowly we stood i felt ill looking at the grim hatred in his expression i didnt think it was the rings that had saved our skins we just knew what to do curious kusox said walking the edge of our circle like a lion in the shadows both of you together unexpected his eyes slid to the ley line and potentially troublesome satisfied i stood straighter a drop of sugarcoated anger slipped through my fear we can prove you did this i said and he rolled his eyes im going to dali and my words cut off as a wash of energy made kusox flicker trent moaned when it melted away to show kusox holding lucy on his hip the fairheaded little girl was only a year old innocent of the monster who held her and happy with the world her little mouth curved up in a smile when she saw me and then she cried out when she saw trent reaching with her hands for him to come take her rachel i cant trent said ashen shes my daughter youll go to dali and what kusox said as he held her on his hip his arrogant expression mocking beside me trents breath quickened shit he might do anything i thought and i grabbed his arm refusing to let go lest he walk through his circle and break it this was what had happened in the clearing with quen and lucy and i vowed it would have a new ending down lucy demanded imperiously when she saw trent then no no when kusox tightened his grip shes my godchild you broke our agreement i said as the little girls pout drifted into the realm of a tantrum and the cleanshaven demon in his threepiece charcoal suit smiled a perfect evil smile file the paperwork frowning kusox jiggled lucy but she wouldnt be distracted her hands extended to trent and pleading for him to come get her i didnt think i could hate kusox any more trents hands were fisted his breathing shallow biss ears were down in indecision and jenks hovered at the top of trents circle waiting for instruction i didnt know what to do kusox might hurt her seeing us frozen kusox turned the magic wreathing his hand inward making a fist he opened it to release a dozen tiny winged horses pink purple and red love is such a fine weapon when utilized fully he said as lucy caught sight of them and was predictably distracted i stiffened when he set the wildly wiggling toddler down but then he gestured and the horses galloped into the dark down the broken path and away from me shouting in delight lucy wobbled after them her little riding outfit making her a darling of wealth and privilege trent jerked catching himself before i had to if we broke the circle kusox would have us at his mercy still within our sight lucy lost her balance and plopped backward onto her butt laughing at her own mistake she crawled to a retaining wall and regained her feet my teeth clenched and my heartache turned to hatred ill kill you if you hurt her and then ill kill you again jenks said his dust an eerie black if either of you touch her i will eat her soul alive kusox said mildly brushing nonexistent dust from his shoulder from somewhere in the dark lucy giggled this could all be over if you agree to come with me trenton aloysius kalamack he said as he stood before us ceri is no good at fixing things he added looking scornfully at the small gargoyle when bis hissed at him you need to learn some respect goyle lucy toddled up the newly risen moon making her hair a silver halo shouting in glee she threw herself at kusoxs knees a purple winged horse in her grip trent groaned and my stomach twisted at kusoxs fake smile arent you a love he said brightly as he took her in his arms and rose giving me an empty black stare when the little girl looked away trent was beside himself as you can see ive not hurt little lucy kusox said smiling i think elf children are sweet actually i dont have that grudge against the elves that my kin do the new world wouldnt have that ugliness genocide is not a viable path to world peace i said seething i can prove you broke my line seeing my anger lucy began to frown the horse in her hand was dead but she didnt let it go kusox didnt seem to care do that he said holding out a cookie to the little girl but shed have none of it anymore and wanted down ill simply say we were working together and you backed out of the deal leaving me to take the blame i thought of those life rafts in the form of infants the panic i was holding seemed to shake its chain gaining another few inches of freedom theyd likely kill me for sure four days or not dali was right my silence was buying my continued existence lucy ignored the cookie kusox kept pushing at her holding her hands out to trent instead down lucy shrilled squirming and kicking him doooown she howled when he held her tighter throwing the cookie kusox was trying to pacify her with at him she truly was ellasbeths daughter and had the vocal power to prove it daaaaddy she cried reaching out to trent her little hands opening and closing daddy kusox gave her a little jerk and she screamed at him filling the night with her anger fear lit through me and i swear he closed his eyes in bliss when he saw it lucy kicked furiously howling and pinching his arm having endured enough kusox gave her a shake and the little girl vanished in a wash of everafter for a moment her last cry of outrage echoed against the trees and castle and then even that was gone no trent raged a blur as he lunged at kusox i gasped as he threw a ball of blackrimmed energy it tore through his circle jenks was up and away in an instant bis hot on his dust trail trent i shouted as the cooler air rushed over me kusox snarled deflecting whatever it was right back at trent every blade of grass every leaf took on a razor edge i lunged for trent but was jerked back by my hair ow i howled my scalp on fire as kusox swung me around and threw me to the ground i got my knees under me and the demon shoved me down again so hard my breath was knocked out just within my sight trent writhed on the ground taken out by his own magic you are troublesome kusox said and he sat on me pinning me there was a circle around us keeping both jenks and bis powerless but i could still tap a line i flooded him with it and he only sucked in his breath enjoying it get off i shouted into the gravel then screamed in pain when he wrenched my arm back nearly dislocating it playing with elves kusox said and the agony let up he traced the outline of my tattoo with a soft finger and i shuddered breathing in the scent of carrion and trying not to throw up this was exactly why i hadnt wanted to try to fight him why did no one listen to me you kill me and they will be looking at you to fix the line i rasped in the dark scared to death as i felt him fingering the elven chastity ring they know youre responsible for it as you say he drawled and i felt the ring spin on my finger but we also both know theyre cowards and if you cant overpower me then theyll kill you to gain my good graces again is this how you found the strength to shift the imbalance back to the proper line he said tugging experimentally at the ring ingenious melding your abilities with an elf to best me tsktsk mustnt play with wild animals no wait i shouted helpless and he gave a tug kusoxs cry of pain was like audible lightning jerking through me my arm thudded down on the gravel path numb and unmoving as he was suddenly not sitting on me but writhing three feet awayhis circle broken it was the ring it had its own safeguards and they had just saved my ass rache get up jenks was shouting his sparkles filling my vision and lighting the night dazed i sat up dead arm cradled in my lap get up he yelled again and i staggered to my feet kusox was picking himself up off the ground he was between me and trent the elf still gasping at his own spell for an instant we froze and with a snarl kusox turned to trent no i shouted as the demon went for him but it was too late and i ran smack into kusoxs circle trent i exclaimed as i hammered on it shocks of fire cramping my arm kusox had pulled trent to his feet and i was sure it was the last id see of him but with his arm around trents neck the demon bared his teeth at me teeth clenched i pushed my fingers into his field there had to be a weakness a hole pinpricks turned to fire and agony pulsed with my heartbeat as i pressed harder rache youre burning your hand jenks shouted and with a cry of frustrated pain i spun away fingers throbbing i couldnt do it he was stronger than me but id known that already kusox looked me up and down evaluatingclever giving your elf the master ring he snarled clearly out of sorts for the wallop hed taken his back hunched and his perfect hair out of place im willing to wager i can take this one he said wrestling trents arm up trent tried to wiggle free and kusox flooded him with energy i saw it dancing over him like ants sparkling in the dark trent groaned and went still his eyes bloodshot as he hung in kusoxs grip his hand with the chastity ring splayed open you son of a bitch i shouted burned hand cradled as he pulled the ring from trent and let him fall to the ground a slumped shadow in the dark there was a quiver in my chi as the connection failed but it didnt matter he was going to take him i thought in anguish as kusox made a fist around the ring and let the twisted mass of metal hit the ground beside trent mustnt play with demons little elf kusox mocked as he leaned over trent and nudged him with a foot youll end up dead and i need you come with me of your free will or i will cause you more pain more heartache than you can bear nooo trent breathed the pain in his voice cutting me to my soul im not going to let you do this i shouted and kusox straightened the lamplight making his expression on his long features ugly looking at him past the strands of my hair my hatred grew i know how to fix the line and we will stop you i vowed this will see you dead im done being nice trents head came up with a lipcurling sneer kusox dismissed my words kill me chances are you wont but no need to take chances i stiffened when the circle surrounding kusox and trent fell but he wasnt interested in me anymore you i can take come with me kusox said pointing at bis and the gargoyle spread his wings in alarm bis i shouted as both he and kusox vanished in twin pops of inrushing air shocked i stared unbelieving in the new silence kusox had taken bis why but the answer was obvious without bis i couldnt fix the line rings or no rings ashenfaced i stared at trent he was as stunned as i was the lanterns glow fell upon the three of us jenkss dust shifting to a dismal blue they were gone they were gone i stared for three seconds at where bis had been no i shouted unbelieving this had happened this is not fair i shouted at the sky staggering three steps but there was nowhere to go its not fair i said softer then began to cry i didnt want to but the tears came sobbing i dropped where i was curled my knees to my chest and just cried he had lucy he had ceri and now he had bis bis he had bis damn it i was responsible for the kid and kusox took him like plucking a flower from a field i was so stupid rache you okay jenks asked from my shoulder and i lifted my head wiping my eyes only to get grit in them jenks was okay i knew he would be kusox must think he wasnt a threat ask me saturday morning i said my resolve beginning to gather jenks flitted up to my knee his flight wobbly but growing more steady how are we going to get him back he asked his face tight and his determination obvious moving slowly i got to my feet too numb to even look at trent he had lost lucy again and i didnt want to see that pain plan c i said trent had seen me cry i didnt care that butcher had bis lucy ceri jenks landed on my good hand and my arm ached where kusox had pulled it whats plan c taking the remaining chastity ring off my finger i threw it into the dark between me and the river was the broken line and i looked at it shaking hed taken bis lucy and ceri if i got the chance i was going to kill him you dont want to know chapter fourteen the teakettle was whistling it had been for some time angry i shoved my chair back from the table leaving the demon spell book open as i went to the cupboard muttering under my breath i grabbed the first cup i touched only to realize it had blue butterflies on it who in hell bought a mug with blue butterflies on it i shouted slamming it on the counter beside the stove we are serious people doing serious things i dont have time for butterflies chamomile thats supposed to be soothing right i thought as i ripped the individual package open and dropped it into the cup i didnt drink tea often but it was getting late and i was going to have a hard enough time getting to sleep as it was gone bis was with that monster and i was more than livid i was panicked unthinking i reached for the teakettle jerking my hand away and shaking it as the steam hit my fingertips burned from trying to break kusoxs circle damn it i exclaimed slamming drawers until i found the potholder and more carefully this time filled my cup bits of herbs floated up and the fragrant steam bathed my face crap on toast the bag was broken my shoulders slumped and i stopped from the hallway came the tiny whispers of the pixiesfresh from their midnight napwatching my tantrum sniffing i pushed my hair out of my face and tried not to cry into my tea as i imagined bis trapped with kusox the little guy was my responsibility he was probably terrified staring at my stocking feet with one hand over my middle and the other holding my forehead i forced myself to breathe then i put my arms down exhaling slowly i could panic later right now i had to concentrate the sun would be up in a few hours and if i didnt have a plan by then id never get any sleep my hands shook as they encircled the mug the ceramic was hot on my burned skin and i changed my grip as i carried it back to the big farm table i had to shove my spell and curse books to the side and they threatened to spill off there was nothing in them i was coming up empty depressed i set the tea down with a soft thud elbows on an open book i stared at the yellowed pages the plop of a tear on the faded print surprised me and i wiped it away sitting up and away from it bis was gone lucy was gone ceri was gone quen was with us again but unable to do magic i had until friday midnight to fix the line and prove to the demons that i could keep kusox from killing them i knew how to fix the line but i couldnt do it without bis if i told the demons what kusox was doing kusox would turn everything around onto me i didnt have any demonmagicinvoking babies for them to escape the dying everafter with they wouldnt help me the truth didnt matter it was all about perception i jerked my head nearly exploding as in shrill shrieks six pixies skated in from the hall on my slipper scoottheshoe could usually make me laugh as five or six pixies jammed into my slipper their screaming like they were on a roller coaster and being chased by an orange cat was hilarious but tonight jenks i shouted my frustration finding a convenient outlet jenks darted in his voice hushed as he corralled his kids almost unheard as his kids complained fussed and finally left flying my slipper out three feet above the floor sorry rache theyll leave you alone i looked up he was hovering miserably in the dark threshold a faintly glowing yellow dust slipping from him immediately a layer of guilt slathered itself over my already bad mood making me even more depressed im sorry i whispered my hand gesturing uselessly as it sat on the table your kids are okay god help me id only made things worse he drifted up and down looking as helpless as i felt well get him back he finally said then darted out when someone yelled at her brother to leave her alone i turned to the book not seeing the print flipping a page i felt the tingle of black magic stab my burned fingers hissing i curled my hand into a fist and shoved the book away i flopped back angrily into the chair almost knocking myself backward i knew how to fix the line but not without bis i could get bis back but only if i fixed the line jenks and belle were in the hall belles lisping whispers obvious but not clear enough to decipher depressed i slumped i was ruining everyones day yay me i was still staring at the faded demon print when jenks edged into the kitchen looking as meek as a flying man capable of lobotomizing fairies in his sleep could ah how you doing rache my teeth were clenched and i forced them apart fine fed in the extreme as ivy would say i should have called her yesterday not three hours ago she was on her way back but it would take a bit jenks hesitated then dropped down beside me wings flat against his back its going to be okay he said i knew he meant to be encouraging but it grated like fish scales i stared at the wall my throat closing jenkss kids were soulfully watching from the hallway sitting on the lintel with their dust like tinsel im not ivy but i bet we can come up with something he said i managed to dredge up a smile from somewhere i dont know where to start i said as i closed the book the binding cracked and i didnt care when was the last time you ate i listlessly picked at the binding then quit when i realized it was probably someones skin i dont know last year maybe he chuckled but it sounded forced ill call for takeout what sounds good i knew he was trying to be helpful it bothered him that he couldnt do anything for me or for bis and that the two worlds were about to collide in a big kind of permanent way i simply couldnt find the strength to meet his hesitant smile with my own im not hungry i said and his dust faltered as his smile faded i couldnt eat knowing that bis was scared my failings had put him there trent must be frantic about lucy and ceri i didnt know how he had managed it remaining calm when he drove me back home silent jenks sat on the book wings unmoving my chamomile tea grew cold beside me i know it hurts jenks said but i couldnt look up remember when you told me id find a way to live without matalina my head jerked up bis isnt dead bad example he admitted but i didnt believe you and i should have it would have made those first few weeks easier rache we will get him back believe it but i didnt know how and my helplessness welled up oh thank god jenks exclaimed suddenly rising up on a column of gold dust and darting into the dark hallway i wiped the back of my hand under my eye then sagged again when i heard the bong of the churchs front bell the pixies clustered on the lintel peeled off one by one to follow jenks to the front with the enthusiasm they reserved for elves swell i whispered as i looked down at my socks jeans and black tee id changed into after crying in the shower turning in my chair i eyed the clock over the stove it was after four in the morningjust about my bedtime but an elf would be brighteyed and fresh i had nothing for trent or quen nothing at all my heart seemed to quiver as i recognized the soft scuffing of trents shoes i sat up and tried not to look so bedraggled as pixy excitement grew and trent strode in looking calm and focused in his long overcoat spotted with rain he carried a takeout bag from a doughnut shop and a large paper bag with handles in one hand a small briefcase in the other jenks was on his shoulder looking as right as snow on a mountain trent had lost ceri and lucy and was keeping it together if he could do it i could do it rachel he said wincing at the noise the pixies were putting out i cant stay but i had to come into the city to take care of some legal business and i wanted to drop these off and discuss something with you i hope you dont mind me stopping in unexpectedly no thats fine i said glancing at where the coffeepot had been wanting to offer him something i still hadnt gotten a new one stuff kept interfering my chest hurt and i looked at the top of the fridge where bis usually sat jenks gave me a look to pull it together then lifted from trents shoulder let me get my kids out of here his voice rose hey how many times have i told you to leave the shoelaces alone head going down trent shifted his feet and three pixies flowed out the door at ankle height giggling and laughing jenks was tight on their dust and the noise level dropped his relief obvious trent came farther in and set his briefcase down before placing the bag of doughnuts on the center counter and the paper sack on the table with a heavy thump he was silent utterly still and i looked up are you doing okay i closed the demon textbook and shoved it to the center of the table no trent dropped his rainspotted hat on the table and began to unpack the leatherbound books of odd sizes from the paper sack it was a hard night i couldnt stop my sarcastic laughter his daughter had been dangled before him and he had been given a horrible choice a minor entrusted to my care had been abducted bis was only fifty years old he shouldnt have even been there the tears welled and i held my breath not wanting to cry in front of him again look at me i said as i dabbed at my eyes trying to make light of it im such a baby i cant stop crying its okay he said as he stood by the table and carefully folded the paper sack no its not i protested and trent walked over to me and placed his hand on my shoulder his shoes were untied and i looked up startled when he crouched to put our eyes at the same level his eyes were dark with a shared pain i meant its okay to cry he said and i remembered to breathe youre wound so tight right now you need a healthy release i shook my head glad he wasnt trying to convince me that everything was going to be okay it wasnt this was bad really bad knowing that he understood helped he had lost his child how could i even come close to his grief his frustration i thought again if he can function then i can too with a surprising touch on my cheek he stood up and edged away well get him back well get them all back i could feel a tingle where his hand had been and i gazed at him numb i dont see how i can fix the line but not without bis and no one will help me if the line is broken it was a trap my mind kept circling and until i broke from it i was dead in the water still in his coat trent pulled ivys chair out of the corner his motions held a restrained excitement as he sat down to retie his shoes thats why im here ive been thinking about tonight he said glancing up as jenks flew back in me too my voice was a dull flatness compared to his excited eagerness kusox did a few things tonight to show what hes afraid of trent insisted what does it matter they engineered him to be stronger than everyone i said glancing at the books hed brought more books that ought to help i thought sarcastically then i looked closer sitting up and reaching for one they all had library stickers on themfrom the restricted section hey these are from the restricted section i said taking one did you steal them trent flushed the rims of his ears going charmingly red no of course not they let me take them out my eyes slid to the brown paper bag hed brought them over in out of the restricted section of the library yes so please dont get anything on them he said moving my cup of chamomile tea to the center counter oh its gone cold he said softly standing up and taking his coat off i still couldnt wrap my mind around the fact that theyd let him take restricted books from the library grounds clearly discomfited trent dropped his coat over ivys chair reaching for his bag of doughnuts he muttered its amazing what they let you do when you supply a new roof for the childrens wing and pay for the salary of the childrens events coordinator they let him take restricted books out i said to jenks and the pixy shrugged behind the counter trent rustled in his bag ah would you mind if i ate i sent the staff home monday and havent called them back yet ellasbeth can boil water but she wont he paused you dont want any do you the scent of fried doughnuts was strong tearing my gaze from the books i eyed him standing behind the counter his head almost touching the hanging utensils his hair was darker than usual in the electric light and his face was freshly shaven tall and unbowed the calmness he radiated soaked into me pushing my panic back to the edges so i could think again no go ahead jenks where are the plates trent asked and the pixy landed on his shoulder to point the cabinet out it felt funny with trent in here but the pixy kids were keeping it to a dull roar the scrape of a plate was loud and trent put six pastries on it taking a stark plain doughnut from the pile when he set the plate before me and moved the books all the way back to the wall kusox broke our rings trent said as if it was important and i watched him take a bite from his plain doughnut thinking it was odd seeing him here in my kitchen in his suit and tie at four in the morning i think that is significant he didnt know we were using them as a safety net he said meld your abilities to an elf to best me kusox thought we were using them to join our skills to make ourselves stronger my stomach rumbled at the smell of the fried dough and hearing it trent gestured for me to help myself i shook my head eyeing the one with the sprinkles thats how the demons overpowered him before trent said still standing in the middle of my kitchen hes afraid of us demons elves anyone working together all his actions are to pull the demons apart break alliances i cant argue with that though trent was clear across the kitchen i felt as if he was too close too accessible as he stood there looking good in my church eating a nofrills doughnut and bis he said making my stomach clench he didnt take him because he wanted leverage on you if it was only that he could have twisted the knife and gotten you to take the curse off right then and there i shoved my panic aside he took bis so i couldnt fix the line i said and trent nodded exactly my thoughts he said setting his doughnut with one bite out of it on a napkin from the bag he needs it broken with purple sludge gone everyone can see the curse he used to damage your line thats why he cant allow you to fix it but if you could move all the imbalance at once you might get the same effect would you mind if i made something to drink my lips parted at the new thought sure go ahead i said and he wiped his fingers off on a second napkin turning to the fridge damn i could move all the imbalance at once i mean i knew what my line was supposed to sound like all i needed to do was bundle up everything that didnt belong and drop it into another line silent i jiggled my foot as trent went to the fridge jenks was on his shoulder pointing things out trent came out with the milk surprising me he likes milk with his doughnuts you learn something new every day no hot chocolate i decided when jenks darted around the kitchen and trent followed collecting sugar cocoa and salt you think i can move the entire wad of imbalance without bis i said the hell she can jenks protested but i sat up pulse quickening she cant line jump thats what started this she isnt line jumping shes moving imbalance trent said to jenks waving the pixys dust from the two cups that trent had pulled from my cupboards and filled with powdered cocoa shes already proven she can do that i stood up coming to stand with the counter between us i know the signature of the line in the graveyard i can dump it all there trent looked up from pouring milk into two mugs when jenks whistled newt is going to be pissed the pixy said and my enthusiasm faltered but only for a moment ah is one of those mine by chance i asked and trents smile widened yes jenks hovered between us a bright shimmer of redtinted dust spilling from him i dont like this he said it sounds risky its perfect i said as trents spoon clinked stirring them both once its moved anyone can see the curse he used to break it in which case hell just say you were backing out of a deal jenks prompted my shoulders slumped and i chewed on my lower lip maybe i could borrow als wedding rings and we could bind our strength together i said hesitantly and jenks scoffed they dont work between demon and elf jenks reminded me but trent had set the spoon on the napkin beside his halfeaten doughnut and had gone to his coat we have options he said as he triumphantly slapped a museum brochure before me that is if you can reinvoke them eyebrows high i pulled the colorful brochure to me with elven artifact show emblazoned on it in a metallic mythological script i knew there was no such collection at the cincy museum there was none anywhere the elves had just come out of hiding it was then that it clicked and i looked for the date quen had mentioned a museum outing at the end of the week sure enough it started this weekend and ran for three months before going on the road jenks would you get this for me trent asked standing before the microwave with his two mugs and the pixy darted away hitting the door button with a twofooted punch apparently the afternoon they spent together stealing lucy had changed both their attitudes toward each other they almost looked like friends finally the incongruity of a pixy helping a multibillionaire figure out my microwave was over and trent came to the table the microwave a humming background to jenkss wings i smacked the brochure down before trent a museum show of elven artifacts you arranged this jenks buzzed into the hall to settle another argument and trent ducked his head to look charmingly embarrassed six months ago as a show of solidarity and pride in our heritage ive been slowly convincing the people i know that we need a public expression of our history and its gratifying what they have kept most of the magic artifacts are defunct but it is an amazing collection nevertheless cincinnati will have the show for three months and then it will be touring for the next three years while i build a new wing standing at the counter i opened the brochure colorful pictures and descriptions of ancient artifacts met me suddenly it looked like a shopping catalog trent leaned closer close enough that i could smell cinnamon and wine under his aftershave tell me what you think will work the best and i can have it loaned to you for a few days my eyes came up to find him deadly serious they will just give it to you they might not get it back he nodded but if it does it will be working theyll risk it the microwave dinged and needing a moment i went to get it eyeing the restricted library books in passing trent might be able to do that yes you probably know better than i what these things can potentially do i said as the scent of warm milk and chocolate hit me my stomach rumbled when i reached for the two perfectly steaming mugs ah i know what their owners say theyre supposed to do he said and i hurriedly moved the hot mugs to the counter shaking the heat from my burned and sensitive fingers seeing it trent seemed to go still youre burned i hid my hand behind my back its nothing nothing fairy farts jenks said and i scowled at him she burned it trying to get through kusoxs circle its fine i said but trent was reaching for me i stiffened but he already had my wrist in his grip its fine i protested again yanking away jeez rache hes not going to bite you jenks griped and trent sourly held out his hand head cocked and challenge screaming from his confident posture i wasnt going to show him but as jenks had said he wasnt going to bite me feeling funny i extended my hand my demon scar was obvious and i flushed when his eyes lingered briefly upon it before bringing my hand closer to him i cringed a bit as his breath met my raw skin and he frowned it will be fine tomorrow i said and i exhaled in relief when he let go here drink your chocolate i pushed his mug to him and he took it his missing fingers showed then he hid them again silent we both took a drink thinking our separate thoughts i held the hot chocolate to my face breathing it in before i tasted it debating telling him that quen had asked me to accompany him to the show it seemed almost petty now what the artifacts actually do is in the books somewhere trent said and i met his eyes over my mug hot chocolate sweet rich bitter and warm slipped down warming me almost as much as trents sly smile he was sticking me with the research but i didnt care for the first time since losing bis i thought we might be able to do this nodding trent abruptly put his mug down and reached for his coat just so ill leave the choosing to you then he said as he gracefully put his coat on i need to get back thank you for the hot chocolate you suck at research too huh jenks said perched on his mug and hazing the surface with his dust painfully horrible trent said shrugging his coat over his shoulders and grabbing his hat and briefcase his motion stopped and he smiled faintly let me know what piece you want i will i said then started when trent turned on a quick heel and headed for the hall hey what about your doughnuts you can have them he said already halfway to the sanctuary im not hungry at a loss i glanced at jenks and he shrugged jolted into motion i followed trent having to wave the pixy dust from jenkss excited kids out of my way trent wait i said finally catching up with him at the door thank you i said breathless when i almost ran into him when he turned at the old twin doors i think we can do this now standing there in the dim glow of the light over the pool table he hesitated can i ask you something sure hands in his pockets trent looked totally unlike himself what would you have done with dr farin my smile faded your geneticist the one you killed he nodded opening the door to let a chill spring night breeze eddy about my ankles now that you know everything what hung in the balance what was at stakehow would you have stopped him from going to the press and bringing about the end of everything that youd spent your life trying to save life imprisonment such as a demon demands bribe him with even greater wealth knowing youd forever be his slave or would you end it cleanly kill one greedy man to save thousands maybe millions from suffering my mouth was dry and i didnt know what to do with my hands i dont know i finally said and he nodded deep in thought thats a fair answer he said lightly id wondered if youd given any thought to the decisions i make and the possible reasons why i stared at him thoughts racing through me i didnt i didnt know what to think anymore his expression blanked and my sadness began to creep back i knew where his thoughts had gone im sorry about bis he said i know it hurts and yet i managed to smile he did know he knew the guilt the panic and the strength it took to focus that energy on finding a way out thank you i said refusing to cry in front of him again he smelled like rain and leather over the scent of his aftershave and my throat tightened and my vision threatened to swim again im sorry about ceri and lucy i dont know how you can keep moving forward his eyes rose from my burned hand and he unexpectedly tucked a strand of hair behind my ear shocking me you were the one who taught me any chance is viable if i didnt believe that i would be a total wreck i know how it hurts forgive me for my choices maybe was he going to try to kiss me i didnt know how i felt about that anymore i did that a long time ago eyes holding an unreadable emotion he hesitated his attention running over my snarly hair down i think he whispered and making a sharp nod he turned away i backed up shoulder knocking the door frame as i misjudged and stumbled inside embarrassed i shut the door before he found the sidewalk but i watched him get into his car from one of the sanctuarys windows his form blurry and wavy jenkss wings were a familiar brush of sound as he landed on my shoulder and together we watched trents car lights flicker to life what did he mean by that i said feeling alone even as i could still smell him in my church jenkss wings shifted fitfully i dont know trent drove away and i tried to look at jenks on my shoulder failing you called him i accused you asked him to come over red dust pooled down my front he was coming in to cincy to talk to his lawyer the pixy hedged i called him yeah i thought he might be able to help it worked didnt it youre thinking again right i turned back to the window staring out at the nightemptied street uhhuh with ivy gone you needed someone to ground you rache and im not big enough to slap you i thought back to my frantic useless state he was right sorry dont worry about it feel better i put my burned hand on the window the cool bloodred glass soothing my fingertips slowly i nodded trent had grounded me how about that the hot chocolate and doughnuts were his idea though jenks said then darted off to tend his children chapter fifteen the faint ringing of the phone vibrated against the inside of my skull and though i tried to incorporate the sound into my dreams of tiny purple hallways and black doors the size of acorns it pushed itself into my conscious thought shoving me awake the phone is ringing eyes open i stared at my clock glowing a steady are you kidding me i whispered and i rolled over on my stomach and put the pillow over my head id only been asleep for a couple of hours and wasnt planning on getting up until noon id gone to bed late not sleeping well with my dreams of shrinking rooms and being crushed in that singularity that al had been trapped in making my sleep restless that the sun was up seemed an insult the bright rays making it past my curtain jenks would get the phone it wouldnt be for me anyway no one hired a demon and not at seven freaking fortyseven in the morning i sighed in relief as the phone finally quit then it started again i groaned wishing it would go away raaaache jenkss voice scraped along every nerve i had and i propped myself up on my elbows what i shouted all the way awake now my kids found waydes glue im unsticking rexs whiskers will you get that are you serious i exclaimed you want to hold the cat instead i threw my pillow to the floor grumbling i swung my feet down jerking them back from the cold its not even eight yet i muttered trying and failing to get my hair to lie flat as i looked in my dresser mirror no i didnt want to hold a hysterical cat who had had her whiskers glued together god id be happy when ivy got home i reached for my blue terrycloth robe and jammed my arms in the sleeves i couldnt find the slipper the pixies had been playing with yesterday and staggering down the hall with a scuffpad scuffpad i tied my robe shut ready to ream out the magazine salesman who was likely trying to work his way around our answering machine everyone important had my cellphone number if it was an emergency theyd call me there i squinted in the brighter light in the kitchen feeling ill from the lack of sleep trents stack of books sat waiting there wasnt a single pixy anywhere and i wondered if jenks had finally gotten them all out in the garden it was spookily quiet im coming i griped as the phone kept ringing and ticked i reached for the receiver my heart seemed to catch when i saw the caller id it was trent i picked up the phone not knowing what was going on anymore trent i said as i hesitantly put the receiver to my ear not sure if i should be worried or mad what by gods little green apples are you doing calling me at seven fortyseven in the morning there was a short silence and then a familiar feminine voice said sorry wrong number i took a fast breath ellasbeth i exclaimed pushing the receiver tighter against my ear is that you again there was silence i could hear ray crying in the background and my spine stiffened ellasbeth i said softly a hand to my forehead as i turned away from the bright kitchen window trent and i have not slept together ever i think you and he make a great couple can i please go back to sleep now this was ridiculous leave it to ellasbeth to go poking around the first chance she got i didnt know it was you the woman said the thread of fear in her voice waking me up faster than slamming a double grande youre the first number on trentons emergency list ray was still crying wheres trent she didnt say anything and i hunched over the phone as jenks came in a worried gold dust slipping from him look you elf woman i said not wanting her to hang up on me i know you dont like me but so help your trickster goddess if you dont tell me why youre calling trents emergency numbers im going to crawl through this telephone line and strangle you jenks landed on the rim of my vat of saltwater his expression becoming concerned when ellasbeth took a frustrated breath hes gone i think he went into the everafter to get lucy my grip on the phone tightened and jenkss wings hummed to life trent went off on his own he dropped a perfectly good plan in my lap and went off and left me here son of a bastard jenks darted out and i stalked across the kitchen waiting for ellasbeth to take a breath but she was well practiced getting in three sentences belittling trent before i could attempt even a word ellasbeth can i talk to quen please i asked seething he was gone the smartass elf was going to get himself killed im alone up here ellasbeth shouted this baby wont stop screaming and theres no one here to help me belle came in with jenks the fairy concerned as jenks dropped down and smacked rexs paw aside as he filled her in ellasbeth stop having hysterics i said as i met jenkss eyes where is quen and how long has trent been gone finally she stopped i dont know quen is in the basement trying to open the vault fear thick and cloying slithered out from the hopeful promises id been telling myself how long has trent been gone i told you i dont know she shouted and ray cried all the louder frustrated and forgotten in her crib by the sound of it the only thing i could get out of quen was that trenton used the vault door to get to the everafter but before he left he set the machine to overload and it burned out the fuse its going to be days until we can get a new one the last time i saw trent was when he went to work this morning that was about five five in the morningnot long after leaving me son of a bitch what was he doing going to confront kusox by himself alone damn it all to the turn and back i should have made him thumb promise he was going to get himself killed but then the thought occurred to me that maybe that had been his plan hed said hed been at his lawyers office shit my eyes came up jenks was pale waiting to see what i would do ellasbeth hold on a second i said interrupting her latest harangue dont you tell me to hold on you little witch i covered the receiver i think trent went to confront kusox alone jenkss face darkened the idiot he shrilled he promised me he wouldnt yeah he sort of let me think that too i said as i looked past him to the kitchen trying to decide the best way to deal with this as a freed familiar trent had some immunity from kusox but not if he attacked him hed only been there a couple of hours maybe he hadnt done anything yet my gaze dropped to my hand and the pinkie ring twin to trents the one time id used it trent had been pulled to me the question was had he been wearing it the last time i saw him ellasbeth had been razzing him about it and i knew he was trying to appease her make it work my heart pounded and i put the phone back to my ear ellasbeth was still going on clueless that i hadnt been listening ellasbeth ellasbeth i shouted shut up and listen to me how dare you i want you to take ray i said my tone caustic i want you to pick her up out of that crib and i want you to give her a bath i want you to bake cookies with her i want you to read her a book i dont care what you do but you are not going to let her sit in her crib and cry you got me you want me to read her a book ellasbeth said in disbelief my fiancé is battling a demon and you want me to read a child a book my face burned you are going to read her a book i said my words slow so i wouldnt yell at her if i find out you put her in her crib to cry im going to be pissed understand when quen comes up for air tell him that im trying to yank trents ass out of the everafter before he goes and does something stupid can you do that for me finally there was silence ellasbeth i took a slow breath trying to find a state of calm im not trents emergency contact because i look good in leather the click from the line being disconnected was loud lips twisting i hit the button to end the call and set the phone back in the cradle well jenks asked i tightened the tie of my robe just a guess but i think trent got tired of waiting for results and went to talk to kusox i pushed off the counter and jenks took to the air ah rache im just getting dressed okay i said as i stomped down the hallway to my room jenks following me i cant fight the bad guys wearing a robe i shut my rooms door in jenkss face and the pixy simply darted under the crack in the door his wings clattered in nervousness as i threw open my closet and started grabbing things first ceri and lucy then bis now trent thank god ivy was on her way home i needed her help damn it i am tired of this rache jenks said coming to rest on a bedpost as i tugged on a pair of jeans my nightgown riding up my heart was pounding it was almost eight hed only been there a couple of hours maybe it wasnt too late turn your back or ill ask belle where you sleep wings shifting tone the pixy spun away rache i cant be in the everafter after sunup his voice was scared and shocked i slowed as i pulled my nightgown over my head snagging my hair im not going into the everafter i said then covered myself when he almost turned back around youre not the cotton shirt rubbed my nose as i yanked it over my head i couldnt help a faint smile at the amazement in his voice you think im crazy i said as i stuffed the shirt behind my jeans then dropped to my knees to find my boots under my bed kusox is psychotic then what are you doing jenks flew down to light the underside of my bed stretching i snagged my boots and dragged them out you want me to call felix bring the is in on this i sat on the floor of my room and tugged my boots on over my bare feet no is i said as i got the second boot on and looked at jenks my stomach empty and hurting but i am going to snatch that idiot out of the everafter if im lucky hell be with lucy and ceri and well have them both maybe that is his plan the pixys wings took on a bright silver hue thank tinks little pinkah rosebuds he said in relief as i stood and reached for my door handle i thought you were going after kusox not this time my boots clunked on the hard wooden floor i was not stupid but i was angry trent had gone off without me right after we had a plan all worked out maybe the books were to distract me shes not running off jenks said brightly as he zipped into the kitchen ahead of me and belle turned from the kitchen window her expression shocked shessss not she said and i made a face at both of them good god you think im stupid i said then frowned when neither of them said a word why should i go to the everafter when all i want is trent i said holding up my hand so the light caught my pinkie ring hot piss on a toadstool jenks exclaimed and belle waved at his orange sparkles in annoyance i forgot about that you think it will work my feet felt funny in my boots without socks between me and the leather and i tapped a toe on the center counters footplate cant hurt to try if it didnt work i might try newt my gaze became distant as i remembered being bloody and beaten under cincys streets and using the ring to jump me out and finding it jumped the other person in it hadnt been exactly what i had wanted but thats the way wild elf magic worked it had better work again i thought as i looked down at it my knees feeling funny as i recalled the words to invoke the charm ta na shay i needed to find out what that meant i took a breath grownup decisions i thought thinking that ivy would be proud of me one seriously angry elf coming up i said tapping the line out back and spinning the ring on my finger ta na shay but then my breath came in with a gasp as the ley line in the back reached out and yanked me into it no i shouted the last thing i saw before the line took me completely being belles and jenkss shocked expressions as i vanished from my kitchen chapter sixteen wild elven magic coursed through my mind electricity tasting of wine and music sparkling to my fingertips the usual welcoming hum was a screeching din and my stomach gave a heave when a wave of dizziness hit me evidence of an unbalanced line i was in a freaking ley line bring trent to me i wailed promising the goddess that trent didnt believe in everything and anything he needs you more than you need him tinkled through me alien and wild and i was shoved out of the line arms flailing i skidded on a white tiled floor it shimmered under a cold electric light and my nose wrinkled at the bitter bite of brimstone mixed with the acidic stench of burnt amber i stood from my crouch turning from the bank of electronic equipment and lab benches lining both the three sides and a short peninsula of the room to look behind me toward the muffled sound of crying babies a glass wall stretched from waist height to the ceiling showing what looked like a hospital nursery complete with rolling bassinets and young women in uniforms tending them there was no door the women looked okay and i wondered if they knew where they were or if they were borrowed familiars trent i whispered glad that kusox hadnt felt me arrive he had to be here somewhere stupid rings i hated wild magic it wasnt that there were no rules i just didnt understand them my heart pounded when the familiar sound of a pen hitting the floor and a chair rolling joined the humming of machinery and trent rolled backward out from behind the peninsula of shoulderhigh machines shocked he stared at me he was haggard wearing a lab coat over his expensive slacks and linen pinstripe shirt as if it was a uniform his usual tie was absent redrimmed and haunted his eyes blinked numbly at me his hair was mussed and his posture as he sat in that chair gave the impression of his insides caving in he looked as if hed been gone a year not four hours what are you doing here he rasped the music entirely gone from his voice are you crazy he needs you more than you need him echoed in my memory maybe i held up my hand with the pinkie ring on it im trying to get your ass back to reality i thought we had some sort of understanding understanding that wasnt like an agreementwhich had definite expectations understanding was more nebulous more dangerous what was i doing trusting trent with an understanding his expression cleared somewhat and trent frowned im not leaving he stood so fast that his chair rolled backward lab coat furling he scooped up his dropped pen proving he could do businessman playboy and lab rat equally well you need to leave he said as he jotted something into a lab book go now before kusox finds you go now i wasnt a dog but seeing as i had no easy way of leaving other than jenks summoning me back i crossed my arms and stared at him kusox wouldnt know i was here unless he walked in the door or i tapped a line my eyes went over the assembled machinery all humming and clicking obviously he and kusox had come to some understanding damn it i thought we had a plan must be the cost analysis had finally tipped the scales is that it i said and trent looked up still standing hunched over his book his back almost to me stiff and cold is that what i gestured at the instruments the machine that saved my life it was as close as i would go to an outright accusation of his helping kusox and his ears reddened no its better by about three generations he said still making notes once i get the strand of dna i want i incorporate it into a mildacting virus that targets the mitochondria im not entirely happy with the strand im currently using i didnt have a chance to clean it before proliferation his pen stopped slowly he straightened and looked down at his lab book it has a seventyseven percent perfection which will cause problems in some of the subjects but kusox is a butcher and if twentythree percent of his children die then he will be happy with the seventyseven remaining i blanched turning to look at the empty bassinet and the rows of babieseating sleeping crying there had to be at least a dozen out there thats inhuman trent gazed at the nursery a lost expression on his face he wouldve been happy with twenty percent my lips curled youre helping him i accused and trents eyes narrowed you told me youd never give him what he wanted his eyes bore into mine is that what you think im doing hey if the lab coat fits making a low sound of discontent trent hunched back over his book thinking that might have been harsh i went to the nursery window my hand cold when it touched the glass it was obvious that the women could see us but they went about their business with a blind furtiveness that told me they knew they were alive on sufferanceuntil kusox didnt need them anymore he took their nurses too i asked in guilt i couldnt save everyone in some cases his words had come from the back of his throat and the hidden tight disgust in it made me take a second look all the women had red hair oh i said feeling uncomfortable is there another way out of here i said i was not leaving the anger in his voice turned me back around stay here i said hand on my hip i thought we had a good plan thanks for nothing wheres bis have you seen him snagging his rolling chair with a foot trent expertly wrangled it around until he could sit hes fine he said so low i could almost not hear it the older gargoyles are very keen on talking to him when kusox isnt watching maybe theyre teaching him the resonances of their lines i said wondering if there might be something good in this after all his head bowed trent kept writing ticked i came to see what he was doing and he looked up bis knows the line in the garden i said wheres ceri and lucy his jaw quivered and i added bis can jump us all out what in hell is his problem i thought when trent ran a slow hand over his face almost ignoring me you keep saying you want to work together well how about accepting a little help trent pay attention to me finally he looked up anguish flashing behind his eyes before he whispered ceri is dead and pierce my heart seemed to stop i took a faltering step my face cold he had to be joking but trents face was pale and his redrimmed eyes had new meaning as i staggered back against a bank of machines ceri and pierce i whispered looking through the wall as if i could see pierce id just seen him just talked to him why but then i figured it out id just seen him just talked to him oh god this was my fault id talked to pierce rekindled his belief that he was a demon killer ceri would help him hand to my stomach i tried to find something to say my mind blank seeing my understanding trent turned back to the lab book as if it was the only thing real left to him what happened i breathed i already knew the why for everything why trent was here doing what kusox wanted why hed left with no warning breaking the only easy way for anyone to follow why he was closed and distant kusox had called trents bluff what happened my hand shook as it landed on trents shoulder he didnt move either to acknowledge my touch or shake it off she and pierce got it into their heads they could overpower him if they worked together he said flatly and i closed my eyes against the heartache this was my doing oh god quen ray kusox told me they tried to kill him in his sleep and that in retaliation he had every right to burn pierce alive with their own joined curse he said his tone frighteningly empty i have no reason to doubt thats exactly what happened if ceri thought she could take him shed try especially if he had been threatening lucy ceri died several hours later as best as i can gather i could hardly breathe my chest hurt so badly i wanted to rage that he was wrong that kusox was tricking him into giving him what he wanted but the memory of ceri and pierce working together to twist a black curse to kill fairies in my garden rose up making my stomach sink shed been impressed with his skill and pierce had been trying to kill demons half his living existence and all of his dead it had been all i could do to keep pierce from trying to attack kusox yesterday had it only been yesterday i thought gazing at my burned fingers a tear brimmed and fell splashing on them and i made a fist i didnt love pierce but it still hurt still ached and ceri she had been so happy so alive she finally had the family that she thought she never would now it was gone she was dead my grief began to shift to anger i could do things when i was angry ellasbeth didnt tell me any of this i said and trent looked up blinking as if he was rearranging his thoughts ellasbeth doesnt know trent said his chest heaving with a sudden breath quen i asked my voice rising at the end into a squeak does quen know ellasbeth said he was in the basement trying to get the vault door open if he managed it he would be cut down in seconds helpless without his magic trent was writing in that book again his numbers careful and precise quen removed her body from my office he said dully kusox left her there for me i thought i was going to throw up trent was calm but i could see the rage underneath lucy had to still be alive lucy bis i asked and his writing hand faltered alive he said and my rapid breathing sounded harsh for the time being you should leave before he finds you our plan can still work youll have to do much of it alone though my anger bubbled over and i pushed up from the machine shaking our plan i shouted and he looked up his expression horribly blank how can you sit there making notations theyre dead trent looked down at the book his mutilated hand showing strongly on the lined paper he has a book mirroring mine if i dont keep writing hell know something has captured my attention and hell come and see you need to leave numb he wrote the time and initialed it the pen hitting the paper sounded loud and he turned to look at me straight on numb he was numb but there was a seething anger fueled by helplessness underneath my mouth went dry as i realized he was on a knifes edge he could do anything he had vowed to keep his daughter and ceri safe and now ceri was dead trent im sorry i whispered and his eye twitched this is not fair fair he said his anger showing when has fair ever entered into my life i backed up as he struggled to take one careful deliberate breath after another when fate levels the field he said flatly the rich man finds himself struggling to survive while the man plagued with bad luck his entire life is ironically strong enough to prosper im both rachel im both he hung his head his fine hair hiding his eyes i wanted to believe that love could survive that which fate decrees that love could remain when all is taken from you but now the goddess has surely left me i didnt think you believed in her i whispered his eyes were empty when they met mine chance cant build such a pit as im in only a god trent rocked forward and i jumped startled theres no reason you cant carry on with our plan he said suddenly his voice holding a frantic determination i cant help you even after you find something to bind multiple strengths together i have to stay here and keep lucy safe he took my shoulders and gave me a shake i will not leave her im going to do everything he tells me to you have to find what you need get it and make it work understand his resolve scared me and i nodded yes he let me go and i breathed again quen maybe he said he will protect you when you move the imbalance show the demons what kusox has done and if they do nothing i will be here to kill him i blinked fast kkill him i stammered my thoughts flashing to pierce trent you are not a warrior poet if ceri and pierce couldnt do it what makes you think you can trent turned looking furious dont he shouted a finger pointing to make me drop back and he lowered his voice his eyes still virulent dont tell me what i can and cant do he whispered the scent of spoiled wine and broken fern grew strong frustrated i rallied my courage no one else will i know youre upset im upset but you cant kill kusox he walked to the nursery wall and stood looking out at his handiwork your morals are going to be the end of two worlds morals i could not believe i was hearing this and i got in his face standing between him and the nursery this has nothing to do with my morals and everything to do with how strong he is you were there you saw i dont care if the one ring to rule them all is in that museum we cant overpower him you dont have a plan you have an obituary ceri tried with the help of an experienced powerful witch and now ray has only one parent trents hands clenched you dont think i know that he shouted and i could hear babies crying through the window why do you think i burned out the fuse to the vault you shouldnt be here either why are you here he was going to try to kill him he was going to dump the task of proving kusoxs guilt onto me and if the demons turned a blind eye he was going to sacrifice everything to save lucy ceris death and lucys vulnerability had tipped him over the edge please i said taking his hand and forcing him to pay attention to me promise me you wont try to kill him youre right about everything you said last night give me a chance to make it work trent you came to me asking for trust it goes both ways trent grimaced his head down to look at my hand in his his fingers moved against mine his delicate touch skirting my burned fingertips you dont know how powerful he is i whispered pity surging in me and he brusquely pulled away im sorry i said trying again and this time he let my hand stay on his shoulder it was rock hard with tension im sorry i loved her too just breathe i continued and listening he took a ragged breath holding it its going to be okay i moved closer the bitter scent of burned cinnamon mixing with the burnt amber stench and making me ill stay here and do what you need to do to keep lucy safe ill find something to allow us to work together its a good plan and it wont get us killed i hope for a moment he stood before me and then he slowly went back to his book brushing his hair from his eyes before he made a hasty notation i thought i could do this trent whispered to the uncaring pages i thought i could sacrifice anything to save my species he looked up shocking me cold i cant shes my child rachel i cant if i cant find a way to make lucy safe i will do everything he tells me to i will fail everyone and everything i will sacrifice even my species for her wellbeing its upside down and i i cant change it my heart went out to him he had changed and everything was painfully new now he might understand me you arent doing this alone i said i knew the anguish of knowing what to do but not wanting to pay the cost for it heartache showed in his eyes behind that was a desperate need to believe no there was the barest hint of air movement and trents eyes shifted over my shoulder his expression went ugly and heart pounding i spun nick at least i thought it was nick my relief was shortlived adrenaline shoving it out for my hatred you i exclaimed sure it was him when i saw his smug expression he was in jeans and a casual tee slippers on his feet looking thin but satisfied with a cleanshaven face and a haircut that showed every one of his scars did you know kusox killed ceri and pierce nick leaned back against the window his ankles crossed confidently who do you think helped cover pierces absence from newt long enough for them to attack kusox my jaw dropped for three seconds i took that in the awful truth sifting through my brain he had nick had lied to pierce pretended he was helping them kill kusox and then left them in the lurch you son of a bastard i screamed launching myself at him nick put up a hand to ward me off shifting at the last moment to shove me into the wall i floundered at the change of direction snagging nicks shirt i yanked him down with me i had time for one good breath before his elbow landed on my middle we were a tangle on the floor and my abdomen felt like it was on fire struggling to breathe i grappled with him slamming his back into the floor and straddling him he pushed at me and i pinned his arms with my knees grabbing a handful of hair i thunked his head into the floor you betrayed pierce i wheezed hearing babies start to cry muffled from the glass he killed them you helped him kill them ceri is dead because of you ceri and pierce are dead and i could have loved him twisting nick shoved me off a nasty snarl on his face you could have loved me too he jumped at me and i rolled my back crashing into one of the machines i shook my head to get the hair from my eyes nick was still coming right at me and i braced myself we went sprawling again nick hauled me into a sitting position slamming my back up against the machine this is for bringing that putrid witch of yours into my apartment my eyes widened and i gasped in pain as his open hand met my cheek in a slap that sent stars through my vision trent was yelling the babies were crying and my eye felt like it was going to explode and this is for the hell of it nick whispered i put a hand up to stop him and he grabbed it his other hand was coming at me and i struggled trying to get him off but before his hand could connect he was yanked backward and up knees going to my chest i tossed the hair from my eyes at the sodden thunk of fist meeting flesh nick reeled into the counter his feet slipping on the tile floor until he went down trent stood between us his back hunched and shaking the pain from a bleeding hand son of a bitch touching his bleeding lip nick got to his feet i could feel him begin to gather power slowly but gaining momentum as a weird keening from the damaged line he was pulling on grew in the back of my head i stood so frustrated that i was almost crying nick had lied to pierce and ceri both told them he was helping when he was really setting them up how could i ever forgive that rachel trent shouted as he dived in front of me i jerked my attention from him to nick a ball of greentinted aura was headed right at us without thinking i flung up a hand rhombus i shouted and trent stooped as nicks spell struck and slithered down to the floor where it bubbled into nothing nick was grinning when i brought my attention back up and i felt sick now id done it trent was holding my arm are you hurt i shook my head i just rang the doorbell i said then added glowering at nick who knew exactly what hed been doing i tapped a line kusox knows im here trent stiffened and then he spun as lucys childlike voice rang out in delight daddy trent went down on one knee as if hed been shot his breath a quick gasp as he stared at kusox lucy on his hip his expression was fierce with love and desperate hatred and i dont think i despised kusox more than at that moment he was going to pay neither kusox nor nick had ever loved anyone and they would pay my pulse thundered in my ears and i forced my arms to remain at my sides as i backed up to stand by trent dressed in a casual black kimono kusox had misted into the room beside nick before the nursery window lucys dress mimicked his and her hand reached for trent delight in her eyes bis was with him too and my jaw clenched as the little guy launched himself toward me only to be snagged by kusox and tossed behind him like a kite the gargoyle spun through the air out of control his eyes bright and cheerful as he found the wind in his wings before hitting the wall id swear he was having fun as he changed his outofcontrol spiral into a snappy landing on top of one of trents machines where he perched glowing a bright black he was all right he was all right guilt rose and i shoved it away i would not feel bad that i was happy for bis when ceri and pierce were dead nick had betrayed them why what had he gained you stay where you are the psychotic demon said lightly to trent as he rose face awash with heartache i already took your second childs mother make a move i dont approve of and we will explore what else you hold dear understand the scent of cinnamon became strong as trent struggled with himself he had admitted that he couldnt sacrifice his daughter it made him both strong and weak he knew what it was to love maybe hed always known and i had been too blind to see it down lucy demanded looking sweetly petulant in her asian kimono and kusox shifted her into a football hold her little feet kicking behind her and her hands pushing at his arm as she made a face and squirmed daaaddyyy clearly not liking lucys frustration bis curved his tail around his feet his ears going flat against his skull nicks feet scuffed as he edged even with kusox and the demon gave him a disparaging glance wait your turn nicholas gregory sparagmos kusox said as he shoved nick behind him with one hand splayed on the mans chest you can beat rachel when im done with her besides i want to hear why shes here she might i dont know want something bis spread his wings and kusox looked at him until the gargoyle eased back a cup of sugar an egg perhaps kusox said struggling with an increasingly vocal lucy are you doing a little cooking this afternoon love my eyes narrowed there was no need to kill ceri and pierce a hint of a smile lifted kusoxs thin lips simple enjoyment he glanced at the nursery what a marvelous woman she was al taught her so many many things she lasted the entire morning i didnt even have to be careful ahh thats so rare so invigorating trents jaw was clenched and my stomach twisted lucy had both hands out craning her neck to see trent as her fists opened and shut struggling to reach him little whines of frustration punctuating her loud demands you should have left trent said i could see parts of him starting to reassert themselves assessing the situation deciding what would be cast aside as unrecoverable and what might be salvaged i wondered which side of the scale i was on kusox wont kill me i said my insides shaking as i shifted my feet to find my balance if he does the demons will start looking at him to fix the line kusoxs expression twitched just so unless you give me provocation its best to leave you alone for a few days now he smiled and again my loathing fought with my fear which begs the question of what you are doing here rachel rescuing your familiar kusox was moving my heart pounded and i backed up trent though didnt move as he has probably told you he is here of his own free will the demon said stopping to keep trent just out of lucys highpitched angry reach were good friends kusox said as he smacked trents cheek the elf freed me and in return im going to free him of everything that binds him no ties to anyone at all arent we little lucy trent was almost panting as he stood inches from his daughter afraid to reach out laughing kusox turned away under his arm lucy cried her frustration im not leaving here without bis and lucy i said and nick leaning against the window and nursing a swollen lip made a noise of derision lucy is my godchild and bis lives with me i think that comes under not harming me and mine i get ignoring the me part since youre an ass but you will not harm them sure enough kusox smiled rachel rachel rachel i have no intention of harming youunless you attack me first of course no one will fault me for defending myself please do try then i can drop this charade and we can all move on with our lives thats what this is all about you know getting others to kill you for me but interpretation of the law is sooo difficult he drawled as i told you before get the proper papers filed and i will gladly hand lucy over i slumped where i stood the machines clicking behind me to mark time in this nightmare trents face was ashen as kusox struggled with lucy down lucy cried down down dooown giving the girl a little shake kusox shifted her to his other side and her cries went from frustration to hopelessness behind him bis was waving me off his grayskinned hands making the pixy signal to go to ground he wanted me to leave standing at the outskirts nick saw the gesture but trent didnt his attention on lucy as he became more and more agitated they know youre lying i said so the demon wouldnt notice bis talking to me of course they do he turned to nick growling get me that chair his expression again pleasant he smiled at me is it not deliciously ironic my lie is far more attractive than your truth if they subscribe to my lie they dont have to do anything about meleaving it for you to handle or die which you will do if you persist his motions furtive nick darted between trent and the machines for the chair he looked like a bug and my lip curled i know demons better than you do kusox shakuru they always bite the hand that feeds them nick trundled the rolling chair back to kusox and it was all i could do to not reach out and kick him daddy down lucy demanded her eyes wet as she stared at trent as if betrayed kusox held lucy in front of him looking scornfully at the little girl as she howled youve noticed that as well he said dryly as he sat with lucy on his lap she began squirming her little feet kicking as she struggled my god kusox said his patience clearly wearing thin this child is intractable i should have taken the younger one honor our agreement i said or i will drag your ass before dali right now of course i will honor it go file the papers come back in three months kusoxs eyebrows were mockingly high unless you want to settle this a different way trent paled and in the corner nick shifted to make himself look smaller if i could free lucy then trent might be free to act when i got that line cleared of the sludge in it im a reasonable man kusox said bouncing lucy which made her cry even harder im sure we can come to a mutually agreeable arrangement i want my freedom rachel now i backed up remembering the feel of kusoxs breath on my skin his grip on my body the way his eyes touched me i shook my head and kusox smiled knowingly down down down lucy raged and his gaze never leaving mine the demon let her slip from him immediately she got to her feet running awkwardly to trent my heart seemed to break as trent dropped down to meet her holding her tight as his eyes closed his hand covering the back of her head and his arm around her lifting her to him his eyes opened and i saw his fervent surety that nothing short of death would ever convince him to let go of her again son of a bitch i thought looking at kusoxs soft smile of satisfaction we were his playthings dancing to his whim to say no now would start a bloodbath none of us would survive trent would never let lucy go back to kusox again what do you propose i said flatly having a pretty good idea he had killed ceri and pierce i wouldnt give him the chance to kill lucy rachel bis complained wincing when kusox raised a hand trent looked up his arms still about lucy the little girl was complaining fretfully to him her words unclear but serious behind kusox i could see the women and children beyond the glass im sorry im so sorry i cant save you all i want my freedom kusox said with a disturbing lightness i want that putrid elven curse you put on me lifted and i want it lifted now i want bis and lucy and a trip home i said and he laughed wiping a spot of baby drool from his sleeve what horrid things babies are leaking from every orifice you said what you want well i want bis and lucy i demanded again as nick fidgeted behind kusox trent held lucy tighter standing up with her as if he would never let her go hed do anything for her anything kisten had looked at me that way once and it had killed him ceris death was both trents awakening and his downfall he loved he knew loss and he would fight to keep what was dear to him the rest be damned kusox told nick to stop fidgeting with a sharp look both no trent is a nasty little elf with lucy gone he will become most intractable see hes sullen already and bis well thats obviously no with him your chances of preventing the end of the everafter slip into the double digits bis seemed to deflate in relief i didnt like the way nick noticed and i cringed when kusox half turned to look at the gargoyle dont think i dont know what youre doing flying worm youre talking to everyones gargoyles and learning the lines because i see fit when the demons die their gargoyles go with them and i will want someone familiar with the old lines so i can reinstate them reinstate the lines the words hit the pit of my being with a cold certainty he was intending nothing less than complete destruction this wasnt just to get the demons to kill me then return to business as usual kusox was aiming at genocide then i guess we ought to just duke it out now i said as i reached out with my thoughts and tapped the line it filled me screaming a discord that melded with my thoughts and flashed through me like grief god please give me another way out i would consider giving you lucy though kusox said glancing at trents pinkie ring and i froze not believing id heard him right trent looked up hope so deep in his eyes it hurt nick stiffened in his corner llucy i said a part of my mind realizing that the scum bucket was afraid of me he was afraid my air came in with a rush and i dropped the line pulling myself straight and seeing kusoxs fear in the way he held his head squinted at the light lucy for his freedom two days ago i would have spit in his face but now my gaze shot to trent his grip on his child almost frantic smiling as if giving benediction kusox inclined his head i will give you lucy he said softly but his hem was shaking that ishe looked at trent silent across the room with lucy in his graspif trenton aloysius kalamack agrees to take the place of his daughter as my familiar and you take that curse from me so i might see the sun again i do so miss the color yellow trent stood ashenfaced as lucy softly complained of nothing he knew what it was to be a demon slave i had rescued him from it and he had saved my life now he was going to give his own again to save his daughter to save two worlds done trent rasped his expression riven with grief as he pushed lucy into my arms take her rachel he said his arm stretched out to touch his daughters hand as he stepped back his eyes fixed to the little girl reaching back to him she leaned toward him whining and i held her close smelling the clean scent of her hair under the stench of burnt amber take the curse from him he could go anywhere i say done trent shouted send them home kusox seemed shocked i know i was things were moving too fast and i jiggled her weight settling her to me until it felt natural i thought elves were known for their patience kusox said and my gut twisted when he looked at me rachel is this acceptable to you providing the elf holds to his end and i have him body and soul crap on toast if trent was his familiar he couldnt help me that wasnt even considering that kusox would have access to everything on my side of the lines but with nick he had that anyway torn i jiggled lucy oh my god i was going to do it and i felt lightheaded take her i beg you it was trent and i took in his hope his grief take her he whispered again i need to know they are safe my girls oh they will never be safe kusox said and trent stiffened they will or i will not agree eyes rolling to the ceiling kusox idly pushed his rolling chair back gesturing lightly as long as you serve me faithfully why not trents grip on my shoulder tightened his breath coming fast in the moment of success but i was having doubts my eyes slid to nick sullen in the corner i took a breath to answer kusox waited poised nick was tense behind him looking like a spider trent was energy chainedfrantic and bis i held my breath trying not to be obvious as i watched him signal me to fly go flee no i think that particular motion meant fall back and circle around my heart pounded bis was learning how to line jump and with lucy safe with me there was only trents life in the balance he clearly was ready to sacrifice it the question was did i trust him enough to give him a chance to kill kusox i needed help with my plan and quen and al were still out of commission i didnt know who to ask throw in a trip home for lucy and me and you have a deal i whispered and kusox clapped his hands springing to his feet to make me drop back several steps awkward from lucys weight but you will stay out of my church and the environs swear to it kusox capital i agree i swear kusox said looking amused but seeing a black haze blossom on his hand i bubbled us lucy and i werent his target however i spun as trent hit the floor choking as he grasped his throat hey i shouted backing up with lucy the little girl frightened and growing heavy you kill him and all your demon babies are going to die kusox strode over and i backed up breaking my circle that is my foot you feel across your neck the demon said leaning over trent as he gasped serve me without elven trickery or it will crush your throat and then i will move on to your children your family and everything you hold dear do you understand sprawled trent nodded hatred burning in his eyes his hand splayed out to show the missing digits that al had taken from him if you harm them nothing will save you he rasped and kusox straightened his kimono with a soft hush good he said looking down at him you have spirit ill enjoy it after the everafter no longer occupies me making a sudden puff of distaste kusox reached down yanking trents pinkie ring off my eyes widened when he made a fist opening it to let a shapeless mass of black char ping dully on the tile floor hed melted it two in a row get up his attention shifted to me and i held lucy closer turning her so she couldnt see her dad pick himself up off the floor my feet moved uneasily i still needed to get home my freedom my eyes flicked uneasily between trent and kusox lucy felt heavy in my grasp as she cried for trent it wasnt as if i could just pop out and conveniently forget to free him the curse had been embedded into his dna and wouldnt lift easily the best i could do was modify it swallowing hard i reached out and tapped the line again i could feel the collective hovering just outside my awareness and i let a small portion of myself slip into it id need the strength of them to make any changes and i was disgusted when i found them waiting quiet and still in a watchful unease the sons of bitches knew they knew my head began to throb behind my right eye as the discordant twang the collective had absorbed from the broken lines soaked into everything lucys crying stopped and i wondered if she was picking up more than she should si peccabas poenam meres i whispered the faint memory of a beating drum and stomping feet drifting through my memory as i began the curse anew tingles of wild magic sparked through me and a hazy lassitude dulled my headache there was an odd pulling sensation as the curse gathered itself within kusox kusox stiffened his shoulders twisting as if something had struck his back his eyes were alight and his hands in fists finish it free me i licked my lips my heart pounding i couldnt look at trent he had taught this curse to me learned it from kusox it could not be untwisted but it could be given away or modified i curse you kusox shakuru to be free of restraint that you may freely travel between reality and the everafter at your will for as long as you leave me and mine alone the demons breath sucked in and he leaned forward grimacing at the added restraint that means you stay out of my church you bastard i said relishing his anger you break it and youll find out how the goddess rewards liars i barked at him heart pounding when a sleepyeyed presence seemed to swirl through me laughing languorously before dulling back to slumber crap on toast elven magic was slippery stuff and i gave a little jump to shift lucy to a more comfortable position and hide my shudder kusox lifted his chin as if to denounce me but when he nodded with very bad grace i sealed the curse facilis descensus tartarus the curse was in latin but i knew it was elven magic by the tiny laugh of wicked delight echoing in my mind it hadnt come from the collective and kusox shuddered as the wild magic slipped reluctantly from me and onto him the last bit twanging from my outstretched hand my headache came back pounding and before i dropped the line i felt the souls of the demons in the collective withdraw they were somber and still unusual for the usually vocal and selfassured demons theyd agreed to this but it had the transparent feeling of ambiguity kusox breathed slowly and in the corner nick hunched into a small shadow of fear it will do kusox said and then his eyes became slate gray leave you smell like baby shit lucy was starting to fidget and i glanced at trent he looked crushed and beaten i told you i wanted a jump home al cant do it i said deciding he would refuse unless i gave him a reason he burned himself at the bottom of your purple sludge kusox looked me up and down in surprise and he got out how he wasnt wearing the smile i expected and i patted lucy rocking like id seen parents in the grocery store line do through his wedding rings kusoxs eyes went wide in amazement and i shook my head backing up send us home i demanded now trents eyes closed and i saw his lips move in a silent thank you but if he was thanking me or the goddess he didnt believe in i didnt know go kusox said curtly and i tensed slapping a bubble of thought around lucy and myself as i felt his broken slimy presence enfold us and push us from his reality for a moment i thought he might leave us halfway there and id have to chance shifting my aura myself but then the stink of everafter fell away and the ground grew firm under my feet the latemorning sun spilled through the new spring leaves and i shivered feeling winter in the spring damp home again home again jiggity jig i said patting lucy aant achel the little girl said laughing as she patted her middle tickles i could only assume she meant the sensation of the line through her but then her eyes widened as she saw the sleeping gargoyles perched everywhere shhh she said bizzzz nap i shifted her weight not wanting to put her down and risk her trying to touch one thats right i said as i headed for the church bis is napping lets go call your abba oh god quen trent had been fond of ceri but quen had loved her with the depth reserved for one who thought hed never love at all for once i was glad he was injured and unable to do magic if he had been otherwise hed likely be dead by now too having pitted himself against kusox abba lucy crowed wiggling in delight before she went still in thought cookie she added hopefully and my eyes filled as lucy patted the dandelion fluff tattoo on my neck the sun was shining and i was home but the reality of what had happened was falling on me anew ceri had died protecting lucy id make sure that lucy knew that when she was older and a cookie i said miserably as jenkss kids found us distracting the little girl and making her stretch for their clattering wings and bright voices i slowly trudged to the church through the pixy dust wondering if the kitchen at least was baby proofed id have to move my splat gun bare minimum what had i been thinking kusox was free ceri and pierce were dead trent was a demon slave again and the son of a bitch was free chapter seventeen the late afternoon sun was gone from the kitchen as i sat at the table depressed as i stared at the defunct disguise amulet perched in my fingertips i wasnt in the best of moods to be trying something so difficult as breathing life into a ley line charm that had been dead for more than ten years but i wanted some practice before i tried this again with some rich elfs oneofakind family heirloom id already found the charm i wanted from the brochure checking the description and the owners claims of powers against an account found in one of the books trent had gotten from the library quen was going to bring it over when he came to pick up lucy he was overdue and i hoped everything was okay rings i said sourly looking at the charm balanced on my hand why couldnt it be a sword or whip or something pointy but no elves apparently had a thing for rings and the set id chosen seemed perfect allowing a strong connection that would allow me to join my strength to quens or trents it wasnt made for war and i hoped that meant elves and demons could use it that al would be healed up enough to help me was nothing i wanted to count on if if if i muttered as i stared at the charm balanced on my fingertips i was putting the f back in if and i didnt like it time was stealing my buffer for when if turned to no i was starting to hate twoletter words id thought that practicing reinvoking old charms would be a good idea i just wished i wasnt blowing my dads old charms to hell one by one it didnt help that i was trying to be quiet as jenks read to lucy in the back living room or that a handful of pixies were playing in my dads dusty box giggling and whispering as they plotted mischief between the catchy rhymes from next door the giggling whispers and me thinking jenks had hidden pierces old watch from me so i couldnt try to resurrect him it was hard to concentrate indecision had made me cranky but i figured if pierce was able to be summoned back to a temporary life he would be changing my ringtones my phone had been distressingly silent ceri and pierce were gone and my heart ached more than i could have imagined stifling a sneeze from the dusty box i exhaled balancing the defunct disguise ley line charm and pushing my aura off my hand the weird mental gymnastics needed to shift my aura to different shades was getting easier but leaving my hand mostly bare of protection made it ache hey i shouted when the flap of the box flipped out almost hitting me dust rolled up and i sneezed earning six highpitched blessyous from the pixies giggling inside okay everyone out they rose up a charm between them as they apologized begging to stay out i reaffirmed holding my hand under the charm and they dropped it the tarnished silver fell into my hand a pool of gold pixy dust seeming to warm it as they apologized again out and stay away from lucy shes finally settled down i called after them and they were gone out through the flue in the back living room if the squeals of lucys delight were any indication i relaxed a bit as i listened to jenkss voice murmur in rhyme soothing as i set the charm back in the box wiping my nose i sneezed again but it was only a sneeze i didnt expect to hear from al until it was too late i was on my own and i thought it ironic that elves were going to help me save the everafter and all demonkind exhaling i emptied my mind of everything but the ring of metal perched in my hand imagining the smallest whisper of red i could puddling under it with just the barest nudge i sent a tiny mote of aura up to the amulet i held my breath as my aura drifted closer the glyphs etched into the charm beginning to glow my heart pounded and i squinted as the ping of energy grew closer closer almost touching the metal a glowing haze over the amulet moved faster and when my aura touched the charm ow i shouted as my hand cramped up jolts of energy darted through my fingers as the full spectrum of my aura raced to protect my hand and i dropped the charm from the window came a tiny shattering of glass you okay jenks called lucys voice rising as well mimicking his tone perfectly though the words were nonsense fine i exclaimed frowning when i looked at the window the brandy snifter on the sill was busted als chrysalis amid the thick shards nice setting the defunct amulet aside i stood my nose wrinkling at the burnt amber smell coming off the chrysalis rachel quens voice called strong but faint from the front of the church shortly followed by the slamming of the door into the wall are you in back a bittersweet feeling took me and i plucked the large chunks of glass out of the sink and dropped them in the trash yes i exclaimed and lucy mimicked my call again a feminine clatter of high heels in the hallway gave me pause until i remembered ellasbeth i barely had time to run a hand over my hair before the woman skidded to a halt in the kitchen doorway her eyes bright her lips parted hair a mess and her coat buttoned wrong where she said her eyes roving my kitchen and my empty arms abba lucy called from the back living room and ellasbeth spun abba it was demanding this time and ellasbeth bolted oh my baby she said but she was gone and i was alone wondering how this was going to go over lucy probably didnt remember her sure enough frightened intolerant baby protest rose amid ellasbeths dramatic tears lucy are you all right i missed you so much look at you you smell terrible but i missed you so much oh you got so big i probably didnt smell all that good either and i shoved the window open a crack to let the cool spring air pool on the floor in the back room lucy began to fuss in earnest her complaints almost unheard over ellasbeth its going to complicate things jenkss voice came softly from the hall mixing with quens footsteps we just have to be more careful jenks and quen came in as i turned from the window ray on quens hip looking sweet with her dark hair and in her tartan kilt and hat ceris death came rushing back and suddenly tears blurred my vision damn it i hadnt wanted to cry but seeing him there with his motherless child and knowing that the girl would grow up without ceris love was almost too much to take dont quen said raggedly as jenks hovered uncertainly at his shoulder and i forced my eyes wide sniffing the tears back quens own eyes glistened the limitless pain in his soul showing please dont he said stoically ill grieve when the war is over i cant afford it now i nodded head down as i shoved my heartache away war that was about right quen looked capable in his short leather jacket and cap like a bad boy grown up with a harley parked in a threecar garage and a huge mortgage the child on his hip somehow worked perfectly grief shimmered under his tight jaw and haunted eyes im sorry i said feeling helpless as he came into the kitchen and set ray on the center island counter his hand never leaving her steadying her as she sat upright and silently watched the pixies who had come in with them none of this was your fault it feels like it is but it wasnt and i leaned against the sink aching at the sounds of ellasbeth reuniting with her child it hurt knowing ceri never would the pixies in the rack were taking turns dusting different colors and ray was riveted both quen and jenks began to look uncomfortable as ellasbeths noises became louder quen steadied ray and remembering jenkss cryptic comment when he had come in i said so whats up jenks more trouble sitting on the faucet jenks frowned jax is around the draft from the window pushed his depressed copper dust from him like a wayward aura the kids heard his wings not five minutes ago and where jax is nick probably follows kusox is trying to get around our agreement i said as i went to get a paper towel from the roll we kept on the table a must when living with pixies kusox had trent body and soul he was also uncursed which meant he didnt need nick anymore that made the slimy man dangerous because he would be trying to prove to kusox that he was still worth something the rip of the paper towel was loud as i listened to ellasbeth say mama not abba mama lucy mama i couldnt help my frown ceri was her mama not ellasbeth jenks flitted to the counter his wings still as he walked to the edge dont worry rache we wont let crap for brains or jax close enough to know whats going on thank you jenks i said as i dampened the paper towel and wiped the inside of the sink to get the tiny shards of glass i had the beginnings of a plan that hinged on two rings i might not be able to use even if i could get them reinvoked quens guilty frown when i turned back around stopped me cold what i said flatly and he winced jenks clattered his wings aggressively coming to hover beside me together we made a united front ellasbeths continued efforts to get lucy to say mama an ugly backdrop grimacing quen crouched with ray setting her on the floor and gruffly saying go say hi to your sister ray leaned forward into a crawl for the hallway hesitating to study the feel of the circle id gouged out of the linoleum before crossing it ray lucy crowed and the little girls feet disappeared with a gurgling giggle my faint smile faded as quen rose his eyes going to the scorch marks then the ley line charms sitting next to the dusty box what arent you telling us i demanded and he clasped his hands before him how badly do you need that particular pair of rings jenks rose up with a sound of disgust and i threw the towel with the glass shards away letting the cabinet door slam pretty bad i said tightly why i couldnt tell if his grimace was because of the rings or because ellasbeth was now crying at the girls enthusiastic reunion ah the family that promised their use wont give them to us now that trent is missing great thats just freaking great ellasbeths soft onesided tearful conversation filtered in from the living room as quen reached for a chair and sat down it was unusual but he was still recovering from the beating hed taken monday morning hed be on the cusp of having his aura back at full strength tomorrow it sat sour in me that id be risking ray growing up with no parent at all but i needed someone to watch my back and quen would be shamed if i didnt ask him ill talk to them again quen said clearly embarrassed unless you want a different pair i frowned the only other pair that had any chance of making a strong enough connection between elf and demon was a pair that touted itself to be demon slavers i dont know how much its going to matter i said frustrated as i started tidying dropping my dads old charms into the box one by one im having a hard time getting anything to reinvoke friday i had until friday night what do you mean they wont let me use their stupid rings i blurted suddenly ticked dont they know this is for the good of all elfkind quens eye twitched at ellasbeths ongoing passiveaggressive conversation with the girls aimed at us not them dont you have some kind of authority in his absence i can probably move the imbalance but without some power to back it up im going to get smeared into a dark stain on an everafter rock before any other demon can come out to verify kusox was behind it quen lifted a hand and let it fall clearly at a loss jenks just shook his head and darted out of the room his dust a bright silver yelling was getting me nowhere and tired i leaned back against the sink ivy would be back tonight maybe we could just go steal the damn rings rex came in to curve around my ankles and i ran a hand over my face cant you simply explain to the demons what kusox is doing quen said they arent stupid surely one of them can spot you al maybe i never thought id ever see the day he would recommend a demon help me and i smiled it was shortlived though no i said flatly theyre afraid down to the last one and im not going to count on als aura being full strength in time quens eyebrows rose and i wiped my hands and leaned into the center counter they know what kusox is up to better than i do but the rosewood babies nick stole are kusoxs bribes life rafts for the demons who back him theyll take a sure riskfree bet that might get them permanently in reality over standing up to kusox and possibly losing everything i hesitated watching rex make a slow nonchalant way to the other side of the kitchen her tail up and whiskerless face searching in a fumbling unbalanced jump from her lack of whiskers rex leaped onto the counter by the sink i smoothly lifted her and set her back on the floor the tip of the cats tail twitched in displeasure as she stared up at the chrysalis i have to empty the line of the imbalances and survive long enough for the other demons to agree he broke it kusox is stronger than me stronger than newt really smart huh making a child that no one can control quen exhaled in thought and my stomach knotted there were too many ifs too many maybes i turned to the cupboard to get something to cover the chrysalis with if they dont give me the rings im just going to go steal them the scrape of the glass going over the chrysalis was loud and the silence grew as the pixies sang to lucy and ray captivating themand getting ellasbeth to finally shut up on a sudden impulse i twisted trents pinkie ring off and shoved it under the glass with the chrysalis two days two freaking days i didnt have the time to steal some dumb rings jenks darted in wincing at his offsprings noise youre overthinking this the pixy said as he came to rest on ivys monitor where he could see the kitchen and a slice of the living room too i say you get the rings reinvoke them forget the line and just pop over to kusoxs lair so you and trent can kill the sucker thats what trent wants i said and quen jerked his head up clearly alarmed ah rachel the older man said and i raised a hand relax im not going to try to kill kusox i said though part of me cried out for revenge a smarter bruised and battered part of me knew better im going to need your help though to hold off kusox after moving the imbalance will you be up for it friday night friday night why did i always have to cut these things so close just try to do this without me he grumbled clearly unsure jenks dusted a dull gold his wings blurring to nothing as he stood on the monitor then thats the plan i said watching rex pad out of the kitchen qed quite easily done or quite easily dead as my dad used to say it wasnt a great plan but it was a plan and the depressed silence in the kitchen grew until ellasbeth began shouting at the pixies to get out they were singing now and lucy was joining in shrieking just for the hell of it the woman needed help but i wasnt going to go in there neither was quen by the look of it wincing from the shrill voices raised in rhyme and mayhem unable to take it anymore rex slunk past the kitchen probably on her way to hide under my bed chaos my life was chaos so i guess the first thing would be to get the rings preferably without nick knowing jenks darted to the hallway to rescue ellasbeth were going to have to steal them quen stood his pox scars standing out sharp against his pale expression ill talk to them again he said but jenks was right wed have to steal them and i stared at the ceiling going through what id need rope silence charms something to remove aura residue worth a try i said as jenks yelled at his kids to get outside finally there was only lucys loud singing as jenkss kids left and ellasbeth staggered into the kitchen the weight of both girls nearly bringing her down abba lucy cried her eyes alight as she reached for him it about broke my heart but in a good way quen immediately took her having to forcibly pull the blanketwrapped lucy from ellasbeth when the woman indicated he should take ray instead coo ox coo ox lucy crowed as she patted her blanket then gently touched quens chin abba coo ox my face warmed as ellasbeths eyes scanned my kitchen lingering on the scorch marks the water glass overturned on the windowsill and finally to the dusty box she said nothing and i would have given a lot to know what she was thinking jenks whispered something into quens ear to make him blink and she frowned ever stoic quen gently took lucys fingers and pulled them from his face she was still going on about coo ox i had a bad feeling i knew what she was saying ellasbeth though was clueless what does that mean anyway coo ox the woman asked clearly thinking our sudden silence meant wed been talking behind her back ah thats kusox i said and ellasbeths expression blanked coo ox lucy crowed making a show of smelling the blanket quen was mystified but i winced as i figured it out thats the blanket that al gave me i said it probably smells like the everafter horrified ellasbeth stood her face red it smells like a demon she exclaimed and ignoring lucys triumphant coo ox coo ox she snatched lucy from quen pulling her out from the blanket and letting it fall to the floor staggering under the weight of both girls she settled herself in ivys chair thank you for getting lucy back to me ellasbeth said her expression flashing into irate when she realized her coat was closed wrong as ray patted the buttons surprised i stood straighter ah i just wish i could have gotten everyone out of there ellasbeths gaze came back from the window behind me pixies had plastered themselves against the kitchen screen distracting the girls and making jenks scowl quen told me you bought lucys freedom at great risk to your own she insisted i cant ever thank you enough if there is anything ever at all i said nothing a hundred things racing through my mind she was going to be trents wife before too long and something there really rankled me he deserved better jenks looked up at my silence his motions to get his kids to leave faltering there is one thing i said and his dust shifted to an alarmed orange ellasbeth blinked in surprise name it she said as if granting boons was her hobby be nice i thought though it was hard seeing her holding ray and lucy when ceri no longer could i ah get that you and trent are trying to make this work i said and quen paled i think its a great idea and all for everyone except trent rachel quen said and ellasbeth shot a look at him to shut up really do elaborate i knew it wasnt the polite thing but no one else would say this so i had to do you think you could make half an effort to understand who hes trying to be i finished almost plaintively i beg your pardon jenks winced darting to the rack and out of range of anything quen also quietly stepped back but hell i had fought banshees and crazy vampires if push came to shove i could take her besides what was she going to do with two babies on her lap hes great at being what you all need him to be i said gesturing at nothing saving the elves and seeing you safe from the threat of extinction but did it ever occur to you that he wants to be something else dont crush what he can keep for himself thats all im asking let him have what he can ellasbeth was white in anger lucy jumped in her lap blurting nonsense sounds but ray stared up at ellasbeth and patted her trembling chin never mind i said dropping my head and sighing go get married have more babies rule the world youll both be great at it how dare you i calmly watched her stagger to stand and knowing it would infuriate her i turned my back on her to get a glass of water if she tried anything id throw it on her quen take these children let me go she exclaimed from behind me and i heard a scuffle take your hands off me the pixies at the window were watching with rapt attention and i stifled a smirk dont do this quen said to her his low voice gravelly you will take your hands off me she insisted and i let the water run until it got cold go wait in the car quen said then louder go take the girls and wait in the car finally he shouted go wait in the car or i will stand by and let her say what she really thinks of you i turned around with my glass of water jenks was watching from within a copper bowl hanging from the rack a weird silty dust falling from it tense quen stood beside and a little in front of ellasbeth she was chalk white her painted lips a bright contrast i didnt care if she was insulted it had needed to be said i owed trent that i understand the strain youre under she said chin high as lucys hand patted her face so the door of friendship is still open between us you mean a lot to trent he explained to me what happened at camp and i understand your feelings for him my feelings for him what happened at camp what was she talking about seemingly satisfied at my cautiously puzzled expression she pulled herself straighter please bring my fiancé home to us thats my intent i said dryly and quen tugged at her elbow but when i do dont kill him slowly let the man breathe eyes narrowed she turned slowly under the weight of the girls and stalked to the hall quen she said imperiously i will be waiting in the car call ahead and see that a bath is drawn for both girls by the time we get to trentons holdings i want to stop on the way for an entirely new set of clothes for lucy its only the clothes she has on that are tainted quen said and the woman glared from the hallway this entire church smells she will have a new wardrobe she exclaimed then clickclacked her slow ponderous way to the door the two girls calling in delight at the pixies waiting for them in the sanctuary okay that was probably going to come back and bite me on the ass but i didnt care trent would thank me for it someday setting the water aside i scooped up the blanket ellasbeth had let fall and brought it to my nose after three wash cycles i couldnt smell anything but i wasnt an elf jenks whistled long and loud damn rache you sure know how to make friends quen took the blanket from me giving it a sniff as well thank you for making the next forty minutes of my life hell he muttered clearly not smelling anything either a tiny smile quirked the corner of my mouth up im sorry no you arent he said darkly you enjoyed it oh youre just mad that i could say it and you couldnt taking the blanket back i folded it up quen ellasbeth shouted come open this door my hands are full with the children ill get it jenks offered and quen shot him a thankful glance immediately my mood swung back to melancholy as jenks darted out halfheartedly telling his kids to leave lucy and ray alone still holding the faint remnants of a smile i pushed away from the counter to give quen a hug ceri was gone and it hurt my eyes closed as his arm went around me and the scent of burnt amber mixed with the smell of wine and cinnamon im sorry i said as i stepped back and his eyes took on a deeper shine thank you for bringing lucy back to us he said and i shrugged with one shoulder i wish i could have my throat closed damn it how could ceri be dead it wasnt your task quen said and i forced myself to look up it was no ones fault but he smiled the pain thick in the new wrinkles around his eyes shed tell you to mind your own business and to not blame yourself my head dropped probably in loud small words so i wouldnt run the risk of misunderstanding she would at that i said and he touched my shoulder as he turned away quen i said and he halted from the front of the church came a loud boom of sound as the door shut then blessed silence i looked at quen i had things i wanted to say that trent was braver than i had thought and foolish that i trusted him but i also knew there were limits to magic and luck that i didnt see a happy ending to this i dont think trent is planning on coming back unless he can kill kusox i said flatly and quens lip twitched that lucy is safe has given him more freedom to act but unless we can convince the other demons to band up against kusox i dont see a happy ending to this i lifted a foot and rubbed the back of my calf to hide my trembling quens expression gave me no clue as to what he was feeling you think he can do it my breath came fast kill kusox frankly no not alone all the demons together were only able to shove the psycho in a hole in reality it might be different now i looked at the ceiling avoiding his eyes sorry about ellasbeth i dont know what came over me quen chuckled his shoes scraping as he put a light hand on my shoulder again thank you for trusting trent he said his eyes heavy with emotion not many do and even fewer for the right reasons he looked toward the front of the church i should be able to manipulate line energy tomorrow it would be my honor to help you at the loveland line my heart pounded and a wave of relief took me even as i worried it might end in more grief more pain thank you but i have a favor to ask my head snapped up elves asking for favors was never good what i said flatly quens gaze dropped then came back to mine i asked this before and im asking you again shit quen i whined im not going to do your job look at that woman out there you think she will let me anywhere near him again and thats even assuming we all make it out of this alive taking my hand he turned it over so the demon mark on my wrist showed his eyes were filled with grief as they met mine rachel i didnt mean it to happen but i have someone else i have to protect now someone besides trent i remembered ray on his hip and lucys hands eagerly reaching for him it was the right thing to do but still panic slid through me quen i dont even like him i mean i do but i live here and you live there and how am i supposed to keep track of him when ive got my own stuff to do and that woman please quens expression was pained im not asking you to do my job just understand that i cant be what he needs anymore to survive i cant devote myself to him ray his voice choked off it was low when he spoke again ray needs me all of me not the thin sliver of me thats left when trent needs help she wont be safe until kusox is dead but after that i am hers not trents you dont have to work for him just be there when he needs it thats all im asking and maybe dont let ellasbeth snuff everything he wants to be my pulse was hammering i recalled trent pulling nick off me the power that had flowed through me when hed broken the charm hiding me from al waiting until i knew what i would lose if i turned my back on my future and finally that kiss we had shared it had only been a kissno feelings behind it but my own selfish pleasure then i thought of ellasbeth he had a duty there one i knew he would sacrifice everything for but i wasnt sure until now but i know youll be what he needs what he needs what about me who is going to risk their life for me quens eyes came back to mine he will of course his voice was confident and i could do nothing but stare with my mouth hanging open i have to go before she learns how to drive he said seeing my confusion ill talk to the owners of that charm again i havent said yes yet i said and quen turned in the threshold not in the kitchen not in the hall its said that the reason the elves and demons began their war is because of a broken alliance he said the worldweary damage to his face making him look wise ive always found it to be truethat the best of friends make the bitterest of enemies elves and demons forever fighting who is to say that demons werent the slaves of elves first my eyes were wide as he inclined his head spun slowly on a heel and went down the hall dont worry about reinvoking the charms he said loudly his steps going faint your dad was a good man but cheap the silver is too frail youll be able to fix the good ones i dropped back against the counter crossing my arms as i listened to him pass through the sanctuary and into the late afternoon sun work with trent with that dragon in the background watching me was he nuts chapter eighteen my boots thumped dully on the sidewalk before the church and with a bag of groceries on my hip i smiled as i passed the red mercedes parked at the curb looking gray in the new dark but still sexy ivy was back early ivy didnt have a car much less anything as flamboyant as a red mercedes but nina did and if ivy had caught an earlier flight nina would have offered to pick her up at the airport which was good seeing as my car was still at trents gatehouse the sound of kids playing in the dusk a block over was comforting but when something ghosted over my head i instinctively ducked spinning to follow the shadow floating between me and the sky still holding the pink of sunset slowly my pulse eased as i recognized the shape of a small gargoyle swooping through the springnarrow leaves large wings beating heavily as he or she came in almost vertically to land on a tombstone yellow eyes swiveled to me and then her shape melted into the darkness my steps had bobbled and knowing they had heard it i quickened my pace there had to be at least a dozen that had flown in since sunset most on the tall wall surrounding the graveyard but a few of the smaller ones sat in the neighborhood trees like huge vultures none of them was on the church which i thought telling jenks had talked to one yesterday and apparently they were watching biss church to make sure kusox didnt damage it while he was in the everafter it both pleased and worried me god help me i had so much to do between now and friday it will be easier with ivy back i thought as i took the wide stairs of the church fast shifting the reusable tote so i could get the door but it opened as i reached for it and ivy stood before me her silhouette sharp in the light pouring onto the stairs oh thank god youre here i said shifting the bag to my other hip so i could give her a hug right there on the stoop on top of everything else we have to lift two elven rings from the museum i should leave more often she said as her arms went briefly around me her low throaty voice an audible version of the vampire incense now pouring over me like fragrant oil giving her a last squeeze i stepped back beaming though clearly glad to see me she was tense and furtive her jeans and black sweater were more casual than usual and her hair too was free from its typical ponytail the new boots she was wearing had a distinctive western feel to them but she made it work with her sophisticated trendy jacket a tight band eased about my chest as i breathed her in her vampiric incense laced with the stale plastic scent of air flight and rental cars under that was the sweet honeyed smell of daryl and glenns masculine scent they were fading though and ninas expensive perfume was by far the strongest outside influence ivys hand on my back trembled and i let her completely go thoughts of jax and nick making my smile falter i could hear nina inside talking to someone jenks maybe or on the phone perhaps you should have called me sooner ivy said her tone accusing as she stepped back into the church but then her posture slumped and pain slipped into her black eyes hows quen doing mood darkening i followed her in waving the new pixy dust aside as jenkss kids dove into the bag to see what id brought back hes fine meaning hes holding everything in letting it fester she said nothing and i looked up reading the concern in her eyes she had liked ceri too how are you doing a hundred answers rose up a hundred frustrations a hundred raging cries at the world im fine too i said flatly ivys new boots scuffed on the sanctuarys old floor her hair falling to hide her face as we headed to the kitchen ninas excited and cheerful voiceno sign of felixstood at dark odds with my thoughts so how are glenn and daryl i asked and her chin lifted concerned i pulled her to a stop at the top of the hallway ivy but she wouldnt bring her eyes down from the rafters a hint of emotion welling up as she bit her lip shit i whispered flushing as i realized what id done i shouldnt have called you her eyes flicked to mine and she shook her head i was already on my way back she tried to push past me to go into the hallway and i got in her way what happened i demanded did he dump you ivys eyes went pupil black but i didnt back down even when her lips parted to show her teeth finally she dropped her head saying someone tried to sideswipe us on the expressway yesterday the way she said it precluded that it was an accident glenn handled it she added voice low as nina laughed oblivious to us apparently hes had some defensive driving classes almost as good as the vampire who tried to kill us her voice was light but i was too befuddled to do anything as she pushed past me with the intoxicating scent of angry vampire the complex cocktail plinking through my brain to make my skin ache id thought it was a mistake for her to leave cincy but i knew how badly shed wanted the relationship to work cormel told me not to leave i stayed too long his lapdog is back in the fence she said bitterly halfway down the hall he was right i was wrong everything will be fine now shed given me a reason but something else had happened out at flagstaff something she didnt want to talk about but probably needed to groceries on my hip i followed her into the brightly lit kitchen id mention it to jenks he could push her a lot further than i could seeing as he couldnt get bitten nina looked up from ivys computer as i entered a slim finger running down a search engine list jenks hovered over her clearly interested in the screen what will be fine nina said as i dropped the bag on the counter and the pixy kids flew out startling me id forgotten theyd been in there and i exhaled trying to get rid of the flash of adrenaline everything ivy said but her mood seemed glum when she strode to the window and shoved it all the way open cool evening air tasting of sunset seeped in shifting my hair nina wrinkled her carefully powered nose she looked exceptionally polished tonight wearing a versatile black pantsuit and functional low heels her makeup was light but exquisite accentuating her fabulous cheekbones and dark coloring if i hadnt known by her voice and cadence i would know it was just her not felix by the color in her cheeks even if her pupils were edging into a dangerous black her eyes were bright and eager as she typed her way through a questionnaire with a speed that was borderline impossible secrets the woman said goodnaturedly her red lips curving up in a smile nose wrinkling again she glanced at me then away oh god i hadnt had a chance to shower since coming back from the everafter i probably stank that was why ivy had shoved the window open not to get rid of the scent of her anger or my flash of surprise ivy sashayed over to her and startled jenks rose up wings clattering secrets ivy breathed as she leaned over ninas shoulder her lips inches from her neck always and forever nina its what keeps us alive her eyes on the screen nina reached up to touch ivys cheek hardly noticing embarrassed at my apparent stink i unpacked the bag organic raspberries for an illegal doppelgänger curse white thread since the pixy girls had absconded with mine a new coffeemaker ivy watched in question as i set it clunking on the counter her eyes went to the empty spot beside the toaster and i shrugged a faint wish for hot chocolate lifted through me as i took the coffeemaker apart and squirted a splat of soap into it filling it with water i realized my old scar was tingling suddenly a lot more awake i reached for a dish towel and turned the coffeemaker could wait having my back to two amorous vampires was not a good idea ivy was still hunched over nina a pale finger tracing something on the monitor and i felt a pang of loss when nina smiled beautifully up at her nina was on top of the world it was right about then when things usually fell apart thats the school wayde used jenks said hovering between nina and the wall as he pointed to a link on the search engines list he said the rates were high but the equipment was stateoftheart and thats what you want right nina pulled back to see ivy well ivy you me and fifteen thousand feet next friday i almost choked skydiving ivy hated taking unnecessary chances like two days from now still bent over nina ivy met my eyes maintaining our connection she found her full height before turning to the fridge the week after you want to come nina froze realizing id be a third wheel on a bicycle made for twoor whateveri turned back to the sudsy coffeemaker no thanks it would be all over one way or the other by then ivy moving on was a good thing ivys motions were intentionally slow as she came out from the fridge frowning at nina shed caught that jealous stiffening as easily as i had were out of orange juice she said as the door shut hard enough to make the cookie jar rattle we didnt expect you back this soon i said as i rinsed the coffeemaker and set it to dry they have juice at the corner store nina offered ill run down and get it i could use the fresh air her nose wrinkled again because im stinking up the kitchen i thought sourly ivy glanced at jenks with a pleading look and the pixy brightened as nina reached for her purse hey ah ill come with you he said making me more than a little curious ive got to ah stretch my wings see if were the only church on the block with gargoyles on it we were the only church on the block period that wasnt why he was going with her but content to wait and see i leaned against the counter and dried the coffeemaker as nina gave ivy a quick peck on the corner of her mouth ivys hand was on her shoulder the first softening of her mood showing whatever was bothering her wasnt nina nina strode confidently from the kitchen jenks right behind her his dust a hot silver as he yelled to his kids that belle had the conn hes guarding her i put the coffeemaker back together as ninas footsteps grew faint her voice rose pleasantly as she said something to jenks and then there was silence the door boomed shut ivys jaw was tight and her head was bowed i exhaled long and slow it had been a while since wed been alone together i hoped whatever it was it wasnt too late nina is in a good mood i fished if ivy wanted to talk she would ivy pushed herself into motion she should be she said a hint of pride in her as she went to her stack of mail and began sorting on the way home from the airport she shoved felix out of her mind no i put the coffeemaker back in its spot and levered myself up to sit before it i didnt think she had any say in the matter maybe this was why jenks was with her felix would be pissed ivy lifted a shoulder and let it fall focused on her mail if hed been conditioning her from adolescence she wouldnt even think to try but she grew up without him their relationship is only a few months old she frowned at the duplicate catalogs from vamp vixen hes been relying on her willingness until now and nina has a very strong core of self she said smiling faintly its the first positive step shes taken to become less dependent on him her smile faded he uses her too much unease trickled down my spine though no was in a vampires lexicon it was only to give the other words like sex hunger and violence something to bump up against you encouraged her to do this i said and a delicate flush crept over her cheeks damn it ivy do you know how dangerous that is to flaunt your independence before a master her fingers faltered as they sorted and i slid from the counter yes you do i said glad now that i smelled like burnt amber and that the window was open fine play with the master vampire but dont do it here i put you back together once im not going to do it again if you go out looking for it somber ivy turned to me her hair swinging i dont tell me you know what youre doing i said angry that shed knowingly pushed nina into something that might get ivy hurt hes a master vampire and hes not even yours since when do you have anything to say about what i do ivy exclaimed her eyes flashing black i stood even with the center counter measuring the space between us worlds there were worlds there since i am your friend i pleaded letting go of my anger so my concern could come forward i know i said to try to help her but goading her master like this proving he doesnt have control hes going to be furious cormel cant protect you from everything hes pissed you left turning away ivy ripped open an envelope sorting everything into keep and toss piles ivy i pleaded youve come so far why is it because you love her i dont know she said her eyes black not in fear not in hunger but in heartache it didnt work out between me and glenn and daryl okay we tried and it all fell apart bad i slumped this was where her turmoil was coming from your needs are not wrong then why couldnt i make it work rachel she shouted and i drew back why did they have to move halfway across a continent to get away from me throat tight i crossed the room to her because you need someone who needs you and i dont anymore i whispered ivy im sorry her shoulder under my hand trembled and she backed out of my reach theres no reason to be she said softly hair falling to hide her face i have to do this i like nina shes alive smart always moving but never toward anything that doesnt have meaning the way she loves life reminds me of you and she is good at making me do things that im afraid to do but what felix is doing to her it draws me to her as much as it disgusts me shes so much like a master but innocent eyes bright with unshed tears she looked at the ceiling i left for a week and i came back to find hes in her thoughts almost every waking moment the sun is up and half the time at night filling her with power and desire as he sucks in the memory of the sun and love he wont leave her alone i dont think he can anymore again she looked at her fingers among her mail shifting them aimlessly the man is using her like a drug hes not tapping her for blood anymore which might mean shes become an extension of himself in his mind nina is balanced on a fine edge of control and you like it head down she nodded tucking a strand of hair behind her ear she felt better for having told me i could tell or maybe it was because i was asking about what she could do plan fix shes as dependent upon him for control as he is on her for stimulation at this point he can die twice for all i care but i dont want her to pay for his mistake the only chance nina has to survive is to take control and tell him no for as long as she can even if it puts her in more danger and it would i could tell this wasnt good ninas control when alone and under stress is almost nil ivy said eyes lowered toward the table thats why i asked jenks to go with her to buffer any conflicts i know i can help her learn control if i can keep them apart long enough her head came up meeting my eyes fully she has a chance if she really wants it she has a chance i managed a smile to match her own tremulous expression ivy had a tremendous need to give to lift others above the muck she had pulled herself out of watching nina innocently and willingly slip in over her head had been hard accepting the challenge to help her was even harder be careful i said as i reached across the distance between us and touched her arm im proud of you ivy her smile slowly vanished and her dark eyes drifted aimlessly over our kitchen touching parts of our lives as if shed never seen them before felix is going to be looking for her tonight i have to get her to a safe house but ill be back to help plan the museum job she took a deep breath her chin lifting as if she was taking on a new responsibilityor maybe accepting that i wished her well the hell they put us through she whispered i didnt know what to say i could tell she was about to leave i should probably go ivy said jenks wont be able to do much if she loses it i didnt want to bring up the safe house while she was in the church she thinks shes got the world by the tail yet another trait that nina and i shared thats usually when you get bitten i said and ivy smiled nina was far away and distant from me but there was enough there to make an easy comparison ivy might not know it yet but she was falling in love again ivy reached for her purse then hesitated are you sure youll be okay for a few hours my gut hurt and i smiled widely oh hell yes nick is around somewhere but ill be fine especially with all those gargoyles kusox wont show afraid the curse will bounce back at him go still unsure ivy started to back up to the hallway and out of my life stay on hallowed ground until i get back okay she knew the kitchen wasnt hallowed ground you got it i said turning to look out at the silent damp garden and ivy i know what i said but i will always be here to put you back together if it should come to that her smile faltered as she stood in the threshold i know thank you head down she turned away the keys to ninas car jingling her footsteps were slow as she made her way through the dark to the front of the church the boom of the door shook through me arms wrapped around my middle i smiled even as the tears threatened this was good this was very very good it had to be if it hurt this much chapter nineteen ms morgan why is your church the only one with gargoyles the woman on my front stoop was saying as i smiled and waved at the camera guy waiting for the last pixy to come back in before i shut the door in their faces what a bitch the newscaster added as i bolted it probably not aware that voices carried through the wall of the church well enough that we didnt need an intercom a peephole would be nice though i thought as i put an ear to the door and listened to them pack up and head back to the news van the camera guy was talking about going down the back street to get a shot of the graveyard and the gargoyles perched on the tombstones but the woman was in too bad a mood to care about aesthetics it wasnt that i didnt want to talk to them after they misaligned misinformed and generally blew everything out of proportion when it came to my lifebut that i really didnt care to speculate on local tv as to why every single gargoyle in the cincinnati area was now perched on my churchs wall and in my graveyard sighing i headed back to the kitchen with pixies in my hair wishing id taken the time to take my apron off before id answered the door i was a mess from spell prep bits of green stuff and ground herbs marking me pixy dust was everywhere and the ugly red stain on my sleeve from the organic berries looked ominous at least i wasnt barefoot boots clunking i headed for the kitchen my pixy escort going before me in swirls of cheerful color and noise though the night was warm they were all back inside to avoid the gargoyles id been spelling for hours and i had to clean something before i could make anything new as i ran the water into my spellgrimed pots jenks flew in smelling like garden and sounding like wind chimes cutting a startling image he landed on the center counter beside my drying charms no longer in his usual gardener green or even his alternate thiefblack skintight ensemble he all but strutted a few steps clearly liking the sound of the bells that belle had sewn into the top of his new boots that shed made to go with his new black jacket and pants silver and ebony meshed in a sharply angular pattern that never seemed to repeat and indeed seemed to change with the light making a mesmerizing pattern that would get anyone to stare even if jenks didnt look like a million bucks in it you sure you dont want me to harvest more of that yew jenks asked as he came to stand on the spigot the gargoyles out there dont bother me i smiled and ran the nowwarm water into the nested spell pots no id rather wait friday sunrise is the equinox jenks nodded jingling his bells when rex padded in with belle on her shoulders jeeenkssss she hissed her angular features drawn up in annoyance i told you to take that off those are not fighting clothesss its black im wearing it he said his wings blurring to invisibility i dont have anything else to put on that wasnt entirely accurate and i hid a smile and moved the graduated cylinders and mortar to the sink piling them in the sudsy spell pots wringing out the saltwatersoaked rag i began wiping down my spellprep area thinking it rather useless when half of jenkss brood was up there dusting heavily the tailsss are too long if an enemy catches it he will have you at a disssadvantage she said the buttons are too large they glint in the light the bellsss will give you away i nodded agreeing with her and jenks began to look worried i can muffle the bells he said tugging the coat straight i like it fairy woman im wearing it your vanity will be your death she hissed at him and jenks put his hands on his hips yeah scowling belle nudged rex toward the door but the fluffy yellow cat purred her way to me instead coming to twine about my feet and beg for some attention seeing her intent belle slipped off shaking her clothes straight and adjusting the bow across her back jenks flew to the center counter where belle couldnt see him from the floor are you sure all this is going to work he asked looking over the assembled charms and spells as long as i can keep your kids dust out of them i said then bent down to pick rex up hi sweetheart i crooned trying to distract the cat from the pixies arguing over the gumdrop they had found left over from solstice cookie decorations i cant pet you right now im still cleaning the kitchen jenks rose up on a column of muddy gold everyone out he shouted and the handful of pixies in the rack whined their disappointment go play in the belfry or something he added and the complaints turned to delight were spending tonight inside he added when half of them darted out you hear me i dont want any of you out there pestering the gargoyles they might squish you before they know youre there jrixibell you hear me yes papa the little pixy moaned then darted out her dust a bright red of mischief thanks jenks i said with a long exhalation then glanced out the window at the dark garden the gargoyles eyes winking eerily the older ones looked huge this close to the ground wings as big as sails stretching in the shadows no wonder jenks had corralled his kids back inside for the night creeped out i rinsed the ceramic spoons and set them aside to soak in my saltwater vat rex who had hid under the chair with wide eyes and flattened ears at the noise from the departing pixies came out meowing up at me for an early dinner jenkss wings began to glow as he took to the air i dont like leaving the lines this vulnerable but nick isnt going to show with those gargoyles out there they probably hate kusox more than you do i made a sour face the fact that my line was the only one on the us continent that wasnt screaming probably had something to do with them being here too i dont trust my kids jenks said as he rose up wings clattering and limbs stretching ill be on the steeple ill join you belle said resettling her bow i dont trussst your kids either jenks hovered where he was dust pooling under him you want a ride up there shocked i stared belle too seemed taken aback at his offer do you think you can handle my weight little man tinks panties yes i watched amazed as jenks darted over picked her up from behind by the waist and rose belle hissing in delight wings humming they flew into the hall a line of descending silver stars marking their path by the goddess youre more maneuverable than i ever was i heard faintly then even the sound of jenkss wings was gone huh i said softly feeling good how about that smiling i turned back to the sink past the blue curtains and als chrysalis the hunched shadows of gargoyles were thick among the tombstones but i could imagine it a month from now with the early flowers blooming and pixies out there instead of in here i hoped i was here to see it i had gotten rid of most of the ifs but it would only take one to bring it all crashing down please be okay bis slowly the silence soaked in as i finished rinsing everything and set my spelling supplies to dry my smile faded and the feeling of being watched pricked through me there was nothing outside but the low rumbles of the gargoyles but i knew nick was out there somewherebecoming frustrated the hair on the back of my neck rose and even knowing jenks was on the steeple i felt as if i was being watched the air was thick with the scent of vampires evidence of ivy and nina and nervous i ran the tap to warm the water as i messed with the soap head down as i tried to scrub the burnt amber stink out from under my fingernails goose bumps rose and i couldnt say why stop it rachel i whispered as i turned shocked to see a young thin vampire standing at my table holy shit i thought panic icing through me first that he might know what i was doing and then because there was a undead vampire standing in my kitchen and i hadnt heard him come in who in hell are you i said heart pounding no wonder id felt as if id been being watched for an instant i thought he looked like kisten the same blond hair falling about his eyes and when he tossed his head i almost forgot to breathe but it wasnt kisten this vampires face was thinner younger less worldly wise his frame wasnt nearly as bulky giving him a bookish intelligent mien his black suit fit him perfectly a dull white shirt paisley ascot and handkerchief finishing his polish his shoes looked as if theyd never seen the dirt before today i startled you he said hands clasped innocently behind him but i wasnt fooled ivy isnt here i said cautiously thinking that word she was back got around fast i can give her a message and then you need to get your ass outta my kitchen dirt nap talking to undead clients in the unsanctified back rooms was standard practice but they usually knocked first damn this one was old if he could get past jenks and me without my even hearing him a message will do the man said and i moved to put space between us i knew it made me look scared but i wanted to be able to react if i needed to slowly his voice filtered through my memory i recognized it from somewhere or rather i recognized how his voice pulled at me the cadence both mesmerizing and soothing unnervingly so suddenly i was a lot more concerned breathing in my alarm he moved the silk of his suit rustling against itself as he tucked a foot behind the other just the tip touching the floor his eyes flashed black and i froze i want nina returned to me he said and that fast swirling madness entered his eyes shit felix i whispered and he inclined his head never taking his eyes off mine this was felix he was out of his hole i was looking at him not a willing mouthpiece ivy had called him out by encouraging nina to rebel and he had come looking for her my fingers slipped from the stainlesssteel counter felix moved i got a gasp of air in and he was on me pushing me back until i found the wall beside the archway his arm was under my throat his breath was on my skin delicious tingles sparked through me and i shoved them aside refusing to let him take me this way where is nina he began and i pushed him off me he stumbled back clearly shocked that he hadnt bespelled me i was shocked too the guy looked like he was eighteen i didnt sense any magic keeping him this way he had died young im only going to tell you one more time felix i said trying to pull myself out of a defensive crouch i dont care what you want you will keep your hands off me got it oblivious to my threats he licked his red lips gaze darting over the ceiling she was here i can smell her eyes closing he breathed deep exhaling to fill the room with the sound of desire she has been willful she needs gentle correction this time i had a bare instant of warning as his eyes met mine before he lunged get off i shouted tapping the line out back as one hand gripped my shoulder and the other twined in my hair he jerked my head back to lay my neck bare energy sizzled as it raced from my chi running down my hands and burning as it flowed through eversmaller pathways until it found my palms i cried out as it burst from me arcing to him with a tiny pop of sound snarling he flung me away as it struck him my back hit the wall and i stumbled falling into ivys chair tossing the hair from my eyes i scrambled to my feet heart pounding he stood a good eight feet back almost to the sink the imprint of my hand showed clearly on his jaw and neck and he touched it gingerly you said what you wanted get out i threatened moving farther into the room so he could leave without getting any closer to me where in hell was jenks and what was it with the gargoyles letting this guy through apparently undead vampires werent on their watch list but felix only tugged the sleeves of his suit coat down clearly trying to calm himself it wasnt working ivy had been right this guy was halfway off his rocker ivy put nina up to this disobedience he said voice smooth and persuasive but i wasnt buying it i need her directly tell me where she is or ill take my needs from you my eyes narrowed at the threat but i was spared threatening him in turn when jenks darted in blade drawn who the hairyass fairy are you you all need correction felix said and i swear he swallowed back his saliva especially ivy ive heard about her been warned she could satisfy me bring me to my knees i can bring you to your knees right now i whispered felix the pixy shrilled whats the point of having gargoyles in the backyard if they let this crap through troll turds im sorry rache my eyes never left felixs he was fast faster than jenks still was i a demon or not no need to apologize felix was just leaving werent you no felix had lost his smile his youthful features tight in anger that i might be able to stand up to him it was starting to smell really good in here but i could ignore it mostly give me nina and ill leave you alone for a time she has it coming how many times had i heard that how many times did the abuser blame the abused ivy is trying to help you and nina both i said keeping my eyes away from the floor and the circle etched into the linoleum if i could get him two steps closer hed be in it you are dangerously dependent on her let her go its going to kill both of you kill me he shouted and jenkss wings clattered still felix remained outside the circle pacing like a predator afraid to take the bait nina is what is giving me life she is mine to do what i want with mine ivy is hiding her if you wont give me nina restitution is mine to claim where is she fingers crooked into claws he jumped at me again this guy is out of his friggin mind i thought as i stood where i was eyes screwing up against the impact jenks darted up and away the ringing of his sword echoing through me mixing with the unreal sound of felixs anguish my eyes flew open as his bonecrushing grip knocked us back into the wall again again i poured the line through him his fingers tightened as he screamed his frustration and then he was gone whirling in anger eight feet away his black eyes pits blood dripped from his face just under his eye mirrored on jenkss sword i will have someone felix shouted and my lips parted as he crouched preparing to jump me again is he trying to get me to kill him i thought shocked when a low sound of hatred rumbled forth growing as he slid closer dancing to music that maddened him i will have someone felix were trying to help i cried then traced an informal circle about myself seeing it felix lunged arm reaching instinct pushed me back and my heel broke my circle even as it formed i gasped then stared shocked as a shadow from the back living room flew into the kitchen jerking felix from me and spinning him into the corner by the fridge ohem a voice boomed from the short stocky man somehow standing between us find yourself holy crap its cormel jenks shrilled and i fell back against the wall hand on my throat as i realized it was rynn cormel probably here to talk to ivy that one needs punishing felix pointed at me pacing back and forth before him totally out of his mind she is mine mine rynn cormels jaw was tight as he raised a hand his felt cap lay on the floor and his coat smelled of cashmere and vampire let go of the thought of her sir he said calmly and i pulled myself straight grimacing id filled the air with my fearid known better jenks hovering at the ceiling with a bloody bared sword was tense enough for both of us the demon witch encouraged my scion to defy me felixs voice was softer now more calculating scaring me rynn cormel shook his head his brooklyn accent sounding odd as he firmly said this is mine not yours i punish her not you no one was going to punish me but i was smart enough not to say anything my heart pounded and i was glad cormel was here felix was out of his mind felixs angry pacing slowed and cormels outstretched hand shifted to one of welcome you are in need sir he said respectfully distraught and drunk on the sun let go of this idea and turn to a new one before my ward kills you shes not for you shes not for me she is for ivy ivy felix snarled and i held my breath as felix thought that over his youthful face was twisted into an ugly mask of anguish and fear his eyes black and showing a lack of control id expect from the newly undead not one older than cincinnatis tunnels i am drunk on the sun he said suddenly his beautiful voice cracking oh god he said the words with anguish falling back against the counter as if having abruptly found himself what have i done what jenks dropped from the ceiling to my shoulder and i jumped what am i doing felix lamented his head bowed until his hair hid his eyes he was shaking and only now did cormel glance back to make sure i was okay you think its wise to turn your back on him i said as cormel came to me a cold hand landing on my arm to push me into the hall he was wearing a tidy suit that made him look like a middleaged politician and his smile that had saved a world was now focused on me it wasnt working i was scared shitless im sorry you saw this rachel he said and i slid out from under his hand on my shoulder the diseases of the undead are not easy to understand might i have a moment alone with him head shaking i backed up into the corner not in my church no my eyes flicked behind him to the undead vampire felix looked crushed beaten as he slumped against the counter and threatened to slip to the floor was this what happened when vampires got old they slowly lost their mind until they walked into the sun cormels eye twitched at my defiance but it wasnt until jenks clattered his wings that he turned back to felix i cant felix said his voice wispy and beaten nina showed me the sun and i stared too long i cant bring myself to forget again now that i know what that looks like i took a breath to say something my words forgotten when felix brought his gaze up and i saw the agony in him he had come here looking for me to kill him he wanted to end it but walking into the sun took too much courage let nina be cormel said turning his back on me let her have her time felix was shaking like an addict in withdrawal and maybe he was i cant i cant he said his voice broken the sun pulls me god its too easy to just and then im alive through her i am alive his face became animated almost too beautiful do you remember being alive i do i didnt get enough when i was alive taken too soon why are you stopping me you dont know how can you cormel had crossed the room and i watched unbelieving as the younger undead comforted the old you know it will never be enough he said a hand on felixs shoulder youre lost to the sun if you dont let it go it will kill you nina is too bright felix licked his lips confusion slipping into his eyes nina loves me youre killing her cormel said and i wondered if i should have left when i had the chance ivy is right in teaching nina control let nina live her time felix took a huge breath i need her he shouted and the hum of jenkss wings increased in pitch who are you to say no to me you are a pup he strode back and forth never getting any closer never any farther a squalid puking whelp snuffing along the edges of the birthing box unable to see the depth of pain beyond it perhaps cormel inclined his head standing very very still but i sir know not to look i believe the lie and so i survive another day you cant have nina anymore i will not give you justification on ivy or rachel the darkness will warm again if you turn your back on the sun sir please its not too late felix spun into an ugly hunch the hem of his beautifully tailored suit quivering in his anger it is my right he hissed his gaze starting to dip back into madness i hunger because of her she alone satisfies me frightened for ivy i moved cormels backflung hand stopping me you may not claim justice on ivy he said firmly something had shifted his voice was still respectful but the subtle subtext of subordinate vampire was utterly gone and by felixs reddening face i think he recognized it as well it was too late for him he couldnt let go he couldnt become what he had once been there was only the task of seeing it to the end now your favored child is stealing from me i demand compensation i exchanged a look with jenks seeing he had seen the shift as well felix was no longer a functioning undead vampire but one who was ailing one to be humored and lied to he was old forgetful lacking control he had done it to himself and i pitied him remembering seeing the controlled confident vampire through ninas eyes not three days ago he had known what would happen and he had done it anyway all for the chance to see the sun ill give you compensation but you will not have ivy or rachel cormel said and i pitied felix as he all but whined ivy could satisfy me he wheedled looking ugly as he tried to hide his emotions but he was broken and couldnt be fixed cormel shook his head rachel is going to find our souls with her and ivy needs to remain untouched she will find our souls so that the sun may find us again and end this lie we live will you wait with me for that day felixs ugly gaze slid to me and i held my breath thats fallacy the youngerlooking aging sunaddicted undead vampire said still you will leave me to my fantasy and shun ivy and rachel as i ask cormel shifted to open a way for him to go incidentally placing himself even more firmly between me and felix my car is out front the driver will take you wherever you wish it would be my pleasure to show you my children if you will wait but a little felix straightened at that almost finding his old bearing i am so hungry he whispered the blood doesnt help anymore theres never enough cormels head bowed im sorry give me a moment with rachel ill join you soon my children will slake your thirst i will stand beside you and be sure of it my god it was enough to turn my stomach but it was what they were down to i stiffened as felix shuffled out past me a slight tilting of his head the only indication that he knew i was there and i shivered when a black eye watched me from under his shifting bangs jenks followed him out staying just below the ceiling as a quiet guard i am not yours i said hotly to cormel before the back door clicked shut in a wash of incense cormel moved swiftly to the archway leaning to look down it into holy ground his lips were pressed in anger and i marveled at how alive he appeared practice practice practice you are i just saved your life i could have taken him i shot back and cormels irate gaze finally came to me his eyebrows went high in a mocking question i just didnt want to hurt him no doubt i think you killing him was his plan and then what you would be accused of murder as no one but you saw him ailing you could flee to the everafter but we all know how you feel about thatrachel he was right and it irked me you make me sick i said instead pushing around him to get out of my corner the two of you going off to a blood orgy together offering your children to him like theyre candy theres no love there no caring ivy was right why should i help you find your souls cormel stooped to pick up his hat and dust it off because i am here saving your life i huffed in disbelief and he turned to give me his full attention im joining felix in his bloodletting so he doesnt kill my children in his grief for the sun i am there so he wont take too much or be too brutal for their desires to withstand i doubt very much ill enjoy watching an old man gum his food his gaze became distant there will be no finesse no beauty there i had hoped that he was still recoverable but it wont be long now his eyes met mine they failed to tell me that caring for the old as well as the young would be my responsibility when i took this job it was as i had thought then felix had faltered and was failing fast dragging nina down with him this was so ugly ivy is trying to save both their lives i said softly and cormels bad mood seemed to hesitate as he saw my own soften doesnt that count for something she still broke the rules he is mad rachel he is mad and no amount of blood can save either of them but ivy broke the rules by interfering ohem is already lost but for his final walk into the sun and leaving nina to lose control cormel leaned to look down the hall his thoughts already in the car and the remainder of his night theyll have to shoot her down like a dog to stop her once she starts to look for solace as it was he would have only taken himself and one other but your ivy wants to love again and so we all suffer so that you might save her soul save all of ours jenks arrowed into the kitchen bringing with him the scent of ash from the fireplace he looked agitated that cormel was still here and the undead vampire raised a tired hand to tell him that he was on his way my children will suffer indignities and pain tonight because of you he said and my gut tightened in guilt all my children are paying the cost for ninas possible survival all to keep one vampire happy cormel put his hat back on and buttoned his coat i pay it willingly but you will give me what i want morgan and soon my chin lifted and jenkss dust turned a glittering gold that sounds like a threat he smiled from under the brim of his hat it was the smile that had saved the world and it was ending mine it was supposed to cormel stepped into the hall then paused i know youre occupied with repairing the lines so im willing to wait but rachel i will not end up like ohem his expression darkened his pupils going wide and his eyes black i will not be a shell of myself pitied and grasping for the sun when i know my soul is lost to hell if ivy leaves cincinnati again i will kill her myself tell her that for me cold i wrapped my arms around myself i want my soul back find it between one breath and the next he was gone the door squeaking shut the only sound marking his passage shaking i sat down in ivys chair if ivy leaves cincinnati again i will kill her myself he had said dont think so chapter twenty juniors was frighteningly busy the clientele mostly human at the early hour stumbling about in search of their first cup of coffee either humans appreciated their coffee more than the average inderlander or marks marketing gamble of claiming to serve coffee that demons crossed the lines for was paying off i couldnt help but notice that the floor had been repainted with circles and spirals and i wondered if the lock access to the back door had been changed as well the talk was loud and the music cranked decibels higher than normal made my head hurt i truly sympathized with the rare inderlander accused of eating humans they were annoying and obnoxious when they thought no one was listening my mood couldnt be entirely blamed on the noise and early hourseeing as id not gotten to sleep until ivy had come home and then gotten up at an insane seven in the morning to get here by exactly but if my mood was bad ivy had me beat glowering in the corner of the darkest booth we had been able to snag the three beatniks bemoaning the unfairness of life and the publishing industry had been taking up the spot when wed arrived but after ivy stood over their table with her grande and bad attitude theyd packed up their doublespaced pages and red pencils and moved to a sunnier table ivy was better now that most of her drink was inside her and her head was down over the museum blueprints but if my evening with felix and cormel had been disturbing hers spent getting nina into a safe house had devolved into terror as ivy had expected nina had gotten angry at the mere suggestion and without felix to steady the overwhelming sensations clarity of perception and power that hed gifted her with shed quickly spiraled out of control ivy had gotten her to the safe house just in time the morning was bright and chill and jenks was warming himself on the light fixture it was just us three the way i liked it and i had a suspicion that we were at the very same booth where we had made our agreement to go into business together i wondered at all the changes in our lives since then we were all better werent we i wasnt so sure anymore id loved and lost so had ivy so had jenks there was good stuff too wasnt there ivy checked her watch folded up the map and shoved it away is she here jenks asked his dust an odd light blue edged in gold id never seen that before and i wondered if his extended life span was giving him a wider repertoire ivy shook her head casually pulling her coffee to her with long pale fingers silent she stared out over the patrons at nothing as she tried to put her night in perspective her hair was perfectly arranged and her short jacket made her look like a model people were eyeing her in envy she looked like she had everything looked was the keyword her eyes were red with worry and fatigue pulled at her like a cur i would rather have done this at night i said thinking that the idea to just walk in grab the rings and walk out was great if you were fourteen and trying to steal a candy bar but not twentyseven and aiming for a piece of irreplaceable elven heritage then again the oldest tricks worked the best security is impossible at night she murmured ana eesides ache jenks said as he dropped down his words slurred as he chewed one of the nectar and pollen balls belle had made for him ee dont ave time to plan ah eel job oull e great he swallowed a chunk its not that much different from legit work you get busted for doing that too half the time resettling my scarf i eyed him sourly his cheek was still bulging like a chipmunks as he furiously chewed belle had made his travel food her size not his and his kids had had giggling fits this morning when the fairy had gruffly given them to him in a paper sack she had folded herself jenks had only said thank you even as hed gestured for his kids to leave off i was proud of him piece of cake i whispered wanting to ask ivy for the map easy as pie the pixy said his fingers now sticking to a napkin frustrated he lifted off the table taking the napkin with him his dust shifted to an irate red and ivy pinned the paper with her index finger wings clattering he drew his sword and with three frustrated motions he rose up a piece of napkin drifting down under him if you two dont relax im going to jump rachels jugular ivy muttered and i slumped into my chair taking my double shot grande italian blend skim milk shot of raspberry no foam coffee with me al liked whole milk but i thought it was too rich that way sorry it bothered me more than i wanted to admit that we had to steal the stupid rings involving an innocent kind of bothered me too but as jenks had said there hadnt been enough time for ivys usual beautyinplanning we had to go in dirty and fast get in move to the secure area where the pieces were being held under the cover of a distraction do a little lightfingered shopping and leave a pair of fake rings before walking out the front door with what wed come for it was that skinflint elfs faultgoing back on an arranged arrangement trent was still in the everafter and it bothered me a lot i fiddled with my cup of coffee feeling the silence become uncomfortable im glad youre back i said and ivys eyes flicked to mine its been quiet her brow furrowed and she looked away ill try not to make so much noise anger flickered and died and i watched her pupils dilate and return to normal in response shed had a difficult night i could cut her some slack i didnt say you were being noisy i said its been quiet i also said im glad youre back im sorry you had such a hard night with nina is she going to be okay felix was i hesitated my anger vanishing as i remembered his hunched shadow as he stood anguished in my kitchen in a moment of lucidity his eyes rolling as he looked for me to kill him as a way out of his new hell i dont like undead vampires the way they use people like tissue and discard them but seeing him broken like that and losing his mind i looked up seeing her own pain i feel bad for him ivys eyes were haunted as she watched her fingers encircle her cup hey ah im going to check out the perimeter okay jenks said then darted off through the driveup window scaring the crap out of the barista managing it though the sun was bright this morning it was too cold for him to be outside long hed be back chicken i thought but i didnt blame him ivy exhaled still avoiding me either she would talk or she wouldnt maybe i shouldnt have interfered she said and i strained to hear her over the noise of background music and conversation ivys eyes came up heartache mirrored in them people suffered for me last night good people not just my friends at piscarys who fed that monster but the ones at the safe house too nina agreed to this arrangement with felix who am i to try to help her i leaned over the table and ivy flinched as my hand covered hers the cup was long cold but her fingers were warm nina did not agree to this she bought into a lie one coated in power and euphoria people suffered for her but they did it knowing it was to help one of their own come back if nina can survive if you can bring her back from where felix filled her with ecstasy and then dumped her then theres hope for them thats why they took your pain you gave them hope that they might survive too ivy looked away in guilt and i remembered the wild abandonment id seen time and again at piscarys under kistens management living vampires going there to lie to themselves that life was good and they had the world on a string they needed knowing that there was a way out perhaps more than they knew my eyes were warm with unshed tears and ivy blinked fast when she pulled her hand out from under mine she wanted to believe but it was hard for her to accept others sacrificing for her keep nina safe i said hiding my hand under the table a resolve had filled me somewhere between finding felix in my kitchen and ivy stumbling home last night crying over someone elses pain i couldnt let ivy suffer the hell id seen felix trapped in i had to find a way to save her soul i had to thank you ivy whispered her motion slow as she balled up her ecofriendly napkin taking a deep breath i could almost see her focus on the now it was a rough night it took six of us to hold her down when the bloodlust hit her if this goes okay im going to try to be there when she wakes up so she knows im okay she couldnt look at me and i wished she wasnt so ashamed of what we had to do to survive we all fell what mattered was what we did after that tell nina for me that she can do this okay that its worth it that youre worth it i will she whispered next time i see her thank you tears pricked my eyes but i was smiling and so was she nina was strong she would survive i never would have thought that ivy would ever be on the other end of the addiction and i was proud of her ivys gaze flicked past me she didnt move but something shifted in her a predators quiet breath slipped in and out and i suppressed a shudder just that fast everything changed reaching for a napkin i pretended to dab my mouth as i turned to the line is that her i said seeing a blonde with her sweater cut low and her spring skirt cut high she was in a tight jacket and she seemed to know everyone behind the counter talking loud and cheerful as she flirted waiting for her turn ivy was already reaching for her purse yes she said standing up and not looking at her five minutes to eight right on time jenks dropped down his wings giving me a bare instant of warning she came in in the blue mustang he said still picking napkin from between his fingers i think its new since the cover is open its too cold for that unless its your first convertible ill get you the keys ivy youre going to want that top closed thanks she said giving me a soft smile before she turned away and breezed out coming within inches of the woman i stood as the blond woman shivered as if chilled chicken i berated jenks as i moved to get in line right behind her you think im going to get involved in that hearttoheart women crap he said as he snuggled in behind my scarf hell no aw shes sweet you sure we have to lock her in the trunk when im done with her shes going to be more pissed than a cat in a well i thought as i took a quick step back from her as she ordered i was afraid if i got too close i might catch whatever cheerful bug had infected her it was too early to be that sickeningly bouncy but i suppose if your job required you to dress as a professional distraction a happy disposition might be an asset right now she was making me ill on smile overload holy toad piss jenks muttered this woman is even bouncier than you after youve got some rache shut up jenks i havent seen you like that in hell how long has it been shut up i muttered tightening my scarf until he called uncle laughing at me it had been a while and even worse it had been with pierce everyone i had sex with died except marshal and that had only been because he left in time adrenaline hit me when ms bouncyhair finished her transaction catching my eye as she moved to the pickup counter she must have heard me telling jenks to shut up but being the crazy woman would only help and i gave her a neutral smile and hitched my shoulder bag higher sweet or not she was our fast and dirty ticket into the museum and behind security doors i hated locking people in their own trunks except for francis that had been fun i was still wearing my smile as i stepped up to the counter ah two grandes black a skinny chai tea tall and a vanilla grande with a shot of pumpkin in it if you still have it i knew they did the drinks i ordered were was the exact same ones ms bouncyhair had ordered right down to the size oh and can you put it all in a togo bag thanks got it the barista said never looking up never noticing it was a duplicate order junior would have and i was glad he wasnt here i handed the barista a bill to cover it turning around to see the blue mustang in the parking lot the top still open to the sky thank you i said around a yawn as he gave me my change eight was it really eight adrenaline or not this was an insane time to be up that was humanitys problem right there they were brain damaged from the early sun ah rache jenks whispered poking me in the neck and i jumped giving the barista a faint smile as i moved down i stood just inside most peoples personal zone and sure enough ms bouncyhair noticed shifting down a smidge my pulse quickened i couldnt help it maybe i was as bad as ivy when the womans order slid onto the counter in one of those paper trays i was ready thanks bill she called out cheerfully reaching for it as i leaned in as if going for it too the woman got there first her hands full of hot coffee as she turned smashing right into my upraised hand it would have gone all over me but i was the one planning accidents and with a little flip it went down her front instead what the fuck the woman exclaimed staggering back with her entire order spilled on the floor well not all of it and her pink vneck sweater was now an ugly brown ooh mouthy jenks said and i heard him take to the air wings clattering my shock was fake but it looked real enough id had plenty of practice oh my gosh i exclaimed standing there with my eyes wide and hands up in the helplessme position i am soooo sorry the baristas were already moving to mop it up and she dropped back to the tables and chairs disgust swamping her bill can i have another set she said and then muttered at me why dont you watch where youre going as if embarrassed for the f bomb shed dropped she was on the defensive and that was fine with me it didnt make the guilt any less but it did tend to put it off till later oh my god im so so sorry i said grabbing napkins like mad and shoving them at her here let me give you my address i said head down and fumbling in my bag as she took them dabbing at her front until she realized it was useless jenks was at the ceiling and i dumped my bag out to distract her when the napkins hadnt done it ive got a card in here somewhere send me the bill for your cleaning oh thats got angora in it doesnt it i can tell seriously its okay she said but she was watching me now not jenks in her purse hell everyone was watching me ivy and jenks had helped me stock my bag and the tampons diaphragm jumbo condoms and fuzzy cuffs that jenks had picked out were garnering snickers i am such a klutz i said snatching up the pen ivy had given me from a hollows strip joint i scribbled the downtown bus depots address on a matchbook no really its okay she said hand up to keep me at arms length her expression was a mix of disgust and contempt i was a doofus and everyone could tell please just take it i said and she finally did just to shut me up i must have been half asleep my order came up in its bag and the woman realized she was going to have to go home and change i could see it in her eyes behind her in the parking lot the top was almost closed at least let me pay for your drinks i said reaching out as if i was going to take her arm she backed off fast i already paid for them she said bouncy no more grimacing she plucked at her sweater and looked at her watch bill i gotta go forget the coffee catch you tomorrow barbie one called and i almost choked barbie really was that legal but the car again had a roof wait your coffee i exclaimed taking my own bag of duplicate brew and following her look its okay the woman said starting to get angry as she headed for the door i have to go home and change just forget it okay accidents happen i hesitated a forlorn expression on me as she stormed out accidents do happen especially when you plan for them the chimes jingled merrily and my eyes fell to my feet well i tried i said to everyone then darted back to the counter and shoved everything back in my purse hustling after her i stiffarmed the door open she was almost to her car and she jerked when she saw me really its okay she said as if knowing i was going to follow i almost smiled my gaze slid to the nearby dumpster looking for a leprechaun catching a smoke beside it today i might risk accepting a free wish jenks dropped down and i fluffed my scarf as he snuggled in hey you think its gotten colder i asked him as we clickclacked to her more to be sure he was watching his temps than any need for conversation jenks tugged the scarf tighter around himself dropped two degrees since this morning well be inside tonight adrenaline flowed sweet and beautiful she was standing at her car fumbling for her missing keys in her cluttered purse it was so easy to take someone really it was astounding it didnt happen more often she was so frazzled she didnt even remember the top had been open when shed gone in here take some money i said arm out to her as i came forward i owe you for the drinks i said it was okay she shouted clearly pissed still no keys in hand she got in her car thinking it was safer the door slammed and i stood there tapping on the window leave me the fuck alone she shouted open purse on her lap my god are you trying to pick me up ivy sat up from the backseat a pale arm sliding around her neck no were trying to abduct you she whispered theres a difference youd have more fun if we were trying to pick you up the woman took a breath to scream and i tapped on her window shaking my head i wouldnt ivy breathed her eyes a nice steady brown yeah jenks shouted through the glass at her as he hovered at her eye level it will only get her excited you wont like her if you get her excited unlock the door ivy demanded and barbie fumbled for the lock scared i opened the door smiling now so she wouldnt be so frightened but it kind of backfired slide over i said gesturing go on youre skinny get in the passenger seat money she said whitefaced you want money i dont have any brimstone here take my purse take it ive already been in your purse jenks said from the dash you dont have any just slide over i said concerned someone was going to notice me now barbie or ill turn you into a frog jenkss wings clattered his dust a happy silver shell do it he warned i used to be six feet tall ivy rolled her eyes but the woman awkwardly moved over the console you really need to stop making up stupid names for people you come in contact with the vampire muttered shifting with her its not respectful mood improved i flipped the seat to put the bag of coffee on the floor thats her real name i said as i got in and ivy winced sorry please dont hurt me barbie said really scared now and i felt bad as i took the keys ivy handed over the seat and started up the car with a satisfying rumble hurting you isnt in the plan i said as i carefully backed up and put it in drive so please dont do anything to change it all we want is your car for a few hours and then we will drop you off in downtown cincinnati with a story that will get you a ghostwritten novel and a movie of the week okay barbie licked her lips youre rachel morgan arent you she said eyes wide i met ivys eyes in the rearview mirror not sure if i should be flattered or not ivy shrugged and when jenks snickered i turned to the woman smiling my warmest yep and youre going to help us save the world whats your parking spot barbie chapter twentyone but i want to help save the world barbie said plaintively as i helped her into the backseat of the cab my hand on her head so she didnt hit anything her hands were bound with those fuzzy cuffs and it made her balance chancy i can help oh god dont leave me here it smells like bad tacos my nose wrinkled and i took her id tag from around her neck and stuffed it in a back pocket larry gets one of the nofrill blacks susan the pumpkin and frank the chai right jenks hovered over the roof of the cab impatient youre gonna be late for your first day he warned yes but i can help she insisted and i leaned back in to wiggle her shoes off i hadnt worn the right heels and the doppelgänger charm would only glamour me to look like her it would be more convincing if we were the same height trust me i said as i shifted out of the backseat youre helping really i stood and looked over the empty park hoping no one was watching from the town houses across the way ivy was bent over talking to the cabdriver giving him a wad of cash and a peek at her cleavage as she told him to take the woman to the hospitalthe mental hospital by law they had to give everyone who was dropped off an exam and with the story barbie had theyd give her the long version it was the best i could come up with on such short notice not very nice but better than stuffing her in the trunk of her car or leaving her tied up somewhere good i asked the driver and he met my eyes through the rearview mirror nodding wait barbie cried as i shut the door and she pounded on it with her fuzzycuffed wrists how will i know she shouted muffled but understandable through the glass i motioned for the driver to roll the window down and she leaned toward me breathless how will i know if you save the world the really really long version if were all still here saturday then it worked i said then patted the top of the cab to let him know we were done i want to help the woman cried as they drove off and ivy crossed the pavement to stand beside me jenks flitted close with a strand of barbies hair and using it i primed the doppelgänger charm the ley line up here was barely usable on the best of days running right through the manmade ponds and under the twin lakes bridge but now with the lines unbalanced and screaming in discord it was awful i shuddered as i invoked the charm and dropped it into a pocket jenks made a long whistle and ivy nodded i looked at my hands seeing nothing different but obviously they could even my voice would sound like hers illegal everything we were doing was illegal and not for the first time i wondered how id gotten to this place doing illegal things to help trent help him save the world maybe i should be the one in the cab going to the hospital seeing my mood ivy put an arm over my shoulders and turned me back to the cars you were nice ivy said as we crossed the nightcooled pavement nicer than id have been shell have an interesting morning and be home for lunch dont beat yourself up about it i dont like involving her i said as we came up to barbies car and trying to be her is going to get us caught i cant be a real person yeah jenks said as he checked himself out in the side mirror shes too bouncy frowning i opened the door and sat down my feet still on the pavement have you ever tried to be someone youre not i said as i pulled off my boots tossing them into the back and put on barbies heels all the time ivy wasnt looking at me her eyes on the hollows across the river thats not what i meant i said then used barbies keys to start barbies car i didnt like this not at all but i needed those rings and this was the only way to get them ivy looked at me through the open window i could still smell barbies perfume and it made me uncomfortable you okay with this or you want to scrap it right now jenks hovered behind her and i put the car in reverse to back out she knew as well as i there was no choice still i stewed over it all the short drive to the art museum becoming more and more angry the only reason we were trying this on such short notice was because i was familiar with the layout nick had worked here and hed given me a private tour on more than one occasion the entire basement was a maze of storage and offices and thats where the showpieces would be until the night before the exhibit opened ivy was behind me in her moms blue buick as i pulled into the museums parking lot knowing it would be what barbie would do i parked in a spot where no one would scratch the paint finding a place that would be in the shade come noon ivy slowly drove past headed for a spot closer to the door she was going in as a patron and had a sketch pad and folding chair once i got downstairs jenks would give her my id and shed come down in the far elevator clearing our exit en route the coffees were cold when i picked up the bag and slid out and after locking the car i crouched to put the key on the front wheel where i had promised barbie i would leave it not wanting to ruin my story with cold coffee i reached for a ley line and warmed them up with a charm my thoughts firmly on the dark bitter brew so i didnt warm up say the radiator of the car ceri had taught me this one and thoroughly unhappy i stomped to the main entrance the unfamiliar heels making me trip on the curb i didnt look up as jenks rejoined me having ridden to the museum with ivy silent he worked his way past my hair now down like barbie had hers shell be fine jenks said as he resettled himself behind the curtain of my hair i didnt like that i was telegraphing so much and i said nothing barbie probably wouldnt come to work in black slacks and a sweater that covered her cleavage but i had an excuse for that too late i took the stairs at a mincing hurry fumbling for my id these heels are killing me i muttered to jenks when i got to the top and the security guy cracked open the door for me relax rache youre sweating yes i was sweating i didnt like this i had abducted a woman and was pretending to be her it was daylight and i couldnt shake the feeling that nick was somewhere watching me hey hi im late i said cheerfully trying to match barbies bouncy attitude when i reached the door some witch spilled her coffee all over me and i had to go home and change larryby his name tagsmiled and held the door as i slid in before him you got five minutes he said and i hesitated just inside the echoing space crap id forgotten which one he was supposed to get youd better hustle though the man said eyes alight as he took one of the tall nononsense black coffees bull is on the warpath my brief relief that he knew which was which died bull i thought then juggled the remaining coffee to get my id to show thanks for the headsup i said rolling my eyes because it seemed the right thing to do thank you he hoisted the coffee in salute hiding it behind his security podium when a masculine shout echoed from somewhere deep inside i gave him a last smile then turned away heart pounding barbie worked the informationsecurity stand just across the lobby but there were two and i wasnt sure which one to go to the elevator to the basement was through the great hall but there was a stairway across from larrys post that only the employees and their exgirlfriends knew about my heels clacked on the marble floor and i angled to the woman watching me from the information booth i was willing to bet that was susan barb a high masculine voice called and i smiled at susan when our eyes met jenkss wings tickled my neck ah barbie he prompted and that first call registered feeling out of control i spun to the guy in the tweed vest hanging out of the museum gift shop girl wheres my chai he called goodnaturedly and i reversed my direction i was guessing this was frank sorry i gushed as i hustled to him my voice raised in the echoing space as jenks darted off my shoulder zipping up and into the ductwork to find the main security junction i am so ditzy this morning some witch at junah at marks spilled her coffee all over me and i had to run home to change i havent been able to think two straight thoughts in a row since frank took the chai tea a smile on his face thank god he drawled running an eye up and down my outfit that swill they serve in the cafeteria sucks honestly i dont know why you dont wear black more often its classic and with that figure of yours you can get away with it go on now youd better make with the busywork hes on the warpath some tightass is jerking his chain and we peons get the horns my smile took on an honest warmth as he took a sip waving me off thanks i said guessing they had a good friendship and he smiled right back and sipped his drink damn girl he exclaimed dramatically how did you get it here so hot larry was opening the doors to the public as i hustled to the last woman her polyester navyblue suit with a white blouse screamed tour guide and her eyebrows were high at my black outfit susan i blurted before she could say anything oh my god you wouldnt believe the morning ive had nervous i slid behind the counter praying i was doing this right hows the bull susan took the pumpkin latte and i exhaled in relief glad i got to keep the straightup black hes on fire she said making an mmm of appreciation and wiping the foam from her lips something about that new elf exhibit thanks this is good this morning black is a new look for you whats up i shrugged not wanting to sit down and claim the space until i knew it was mine a witch dumped her coffee on me you like the purse i lifted my shoulder bag for her inspection it doesnt match but i was in a hurry susan shrugged and i set my bag on the counter beside my coffee elf exhibit i prompted scanning the security cameras at the ceiling for jenkss dust wed had zero time to plan this and though i liked working by the seat of my pants i didnt want everything to come tumbling down because of new security coffee in hand susan eyed the first people coming in something about the security not being adequate here they come is it friday yet dont push it i whispered hand to my middle i fell back not wanting to do a tour just inside the door were two moms and three kids they were getting their strollers and diaper bags arranged as the kids hooted listening to their voices echo behind them larry gave ivys sketch bag a cursory glance she got the allclear and the stately woman strode by the young moms with their kids with a tightjawed stance at the lack of planning but under it was a wistful need i dont feel so good i said still standing behind the information counter as if i belonged susan seemed to think i did and i was going to go with it you look awful susan said eyeing me in concern sit will you youre making me nervous ill take the first tour thanks i whispered sinking down and while youre there organize the brochures will you she added cheerfully grabbing a map and going out to meet the moms now trying to get their kids and move forward i gave her a sour look when she simpered at me over her shoulder it was the right thing to do apparently ivy was gone and i looked to the hallway that led to the stairs and employee break room i was anxious for jenks to get back the less i had to play tour guide barbie the better good morning susan said maps in hand as she approached the two women were gathering a tour up in the great hall if youre interested it takes about forty minutes and is free ill be along in about five minutes if you want to wait jenks dropped down scaring the crap out of me and i coughed to hide my surprise ivy is setting up beside the elevator that will take her down to the basement he said grinning because he had made me jump im going to trip an alarm in the courtyard dont go until it trips the second time got it second alarm got it i said waving his dust away before susan turned and saw it soon as youre downstairs ill do a flyby for your id and take the elevator up for ivy it wasnt a bad plan but i knew the maybes were driving ivy crazy got it second alarm go i hissed as susan gave up on the two women and started back maps smacking her thigh giving me a thumbsup jenks dropped down below the level of the counter and flew off at ankle height his sparkles making a brief flash against the marble floor any bets susan leaned against the counter like a tired tourist i stared at her blankly and she looked at her watch and added if i get out of here before bull shows up ahh i hedged and she leaned to look down the hallway and into the great hall damn they arent going to wait she said dropping back a step barb im going to go snag them i do not want to be sitting here for the next hour if anyone else comes in send them down ill keep them in the great hall until the tour is supposed to start i made a face as if i was going to protest and then an irritating whine of an alarm shrilled into existence my pulse quickened and i spun the fake rings on my fingers go i said wanting to be out of here its probably nothing she hesitated and i added youre going to lose them her breath a quick exhale she reached over the counter and grabbed a tour guide flag thanks i owe you her heels clickclacked away just as the alarm cut out no thank you i said dryly then waved to frank standing at the opening to the gift shop he abruptly ducked inside and i spun my chair to see three men striding importantly through the lobby and toward the café one was in a suit and tie one in a security uniform and the third was maintenance way to go jenks barb the man in the suit exclaimed when we made eye contact his pace never slowing i want to talk to you wheres sue i spun my chair nonchalantly tour i said scanning the ceiling for pixy dust dont go anywhere his head dropped and he barked into a handheld radio i want an answer now not in five minutes just as they vanished into the corridor the alarm began again i smiled at the masculine pg swearing frank was laughing i could see him shaking through the glass walls it was time to go and i grabbed my shoulder bag and dropped the back in five minutes sign on the counter bathroom i mouthed to frank when he noticed and he nodded and went back to testing out the headphones for the soothing sounds display alarm still shrieking i angled to the employees restroom waving to larry and heading down the cold stairwell to run barbs card through the reader at the bottom cement walls painted white and a tile floor put down in the s met me grimed in the corners and looking like they hadnt been washed in five years heart pounding i fingered the doppelgänger charm in my pocket eager to get rid of it my heels were noisy and i passed the break room trying to be quiet when i heard the hum of a microwave barb someone shouted stopping me cold shit yeah bull is looking for you i exhaled why do you think im down here whoever it was laughed and i hustled down the corridor taking my heels off as i went and stuffing them in my shoulder bag i had a rough idea where the show was being stored and i wove through the maze thankful that nick had given me the grand tour the sound of jenkss wings slowly became obvious how long we got i said when he hummed around a corner taking it tight so his dust made a wide arc depends how long that alarm stays on he said and as if mentioning it had been the trigger it went off seven minutes he muttered wheres the elven crap we should have done this at night i said as he flew off faster than i could run they have dogs at night he said hovering before a pane of glass for a second before going to the next the floors now had carpet squares and air smelled like lemons instead of tuna fish we were close and i fingered barbs id i like dogs i said peeking into the room though jenks already had dogs and i get along great seven minutes it was going to be close rache three doors down he was dusting heavily and i jogged forward before i even got there he had darted under the door i looked past the glass to see long tables covered with artifacts in cases ready for display my heart pounded got it jenks sang out run your card smug i ran my card and the door clicked open barb wasnt cleared to be down here but thanks to jenks the doors security system was recording the last number that had been used go i said as i went in my fingers already unhooking the lanyard to lighten the load jenks snatched it his flight bobbling as he headed down the hallway to the elevators i didnt like separating like this but if all went well ivy would join us soon like clockwork i said as i shut the door behind him and turned riffletic i thought as i scanned the room for the rings i needed the pair donated by riffletic they were perfect and probably exactly what riffletics estate said they were seeing as i had found two confirmations of it in trents books crap id forgotten to take those back this morning i took the doppelgänger charm off shuddering as i felt the magic leave me i smiled when i saw the rings were all together in one case and i scanned the little cards under each one concentrating on the few that had pairs of rings slowly my smile drained away no riffletic concerned i paced through the entire exhibit thinking that such valuable rings as elven wedding bands might have been given their own case statues books pictures and even an ancient tea set but no more rings son of a bitch i whispered hearing the sound of softsoled shoes in the hallway then pausing when i spotted two of the three tarot cards id once seen hanging in trents great room had the riffletic family pulled their rings from the show upon hearing i wanted them the card reader beeped and annoyed i spun to the door where are riffletics rings i asked ivy as she came in then froze when i realized it wasnt ivy a smallish woman in a businesslike skirt and lab coat was standing there staring at me her glasses were thick and she had a folder in her hand and a sketch of what looked like a gallery who are you she said clearly affronted youre not supposed to be down here crap on toast i thought scrambling then decided to play it to the hilt i said where are riffletics rings i repeated tartly wishing i had a clipboard or something a clipboard and a hard hat could get you just about anywhere i flew all the way here to pick up some stupid rings and i dont see them who are you head tilted the woman eyed me suspiciously im marcie im arranging the displays for the show and riffletics rings have already been picked up well thats obvious i said hand slapping my thigh as if she was being stupid if riffletics rings are not on display then the cumberland estate wants their pieces back as well the woman frowned and i added with a sniff there seems to be some question as to the safety of your facility my god i got down here with no problem at all marcie looked at her open file folder i dont have a record of any cumberland pieces you lost our rings what kind of rinkydink museum are you we are one of the oldest art museums in the united states she said hotly dont move never taking her eyes off me she backed up to a landline phone it looked like it had been down here since they put the carpet squares in me moving will not be an issue im not leaving until i have the rings in my possession i said haughty damn it ivy where are you i cant believe you misplaced them who did you say you were she asked and we both looked up as the door beeped ivy i thought in relief then choked when nick walked in cool and calm in a pinstripe gray suit and a blue tie i almost didnt recognize him with his hair slicked back and his shiny shoes because of him ceri and pierce are dead it was all i could do not to crawl over the tables between us i clenched my teeth when our eyes met and he smiled the woman set the receiver back in the cradle and who are you she asked pushing her glasses farther up her nose he beamed reaching behind his coat for his wallet nick sparagmos fib he said and i couldnt help my bark of laughter thank god you found her he added grimacing at me and flipping his wallet open to show an id he closed it before marcie could do more than lean to look stuffing it away where hed gotten it from hands in fists on the top of your head he said to me dont make this hard on yourself why are we surrounded i thought sourly but he was between me and the door kusox might drop into him and then id be banned from the museum for blowing it up or setting it on fire or something i slid away from the table i was leaning against you touch me and you die nick damn it how was i going to get the rings now not only were they gone but if i took my second choice hed know and tell kusox the woman looked from me to nick someone better tell me whats going on she threatened and i leaned back gesturing for nick to say something dying to find out myself this is learch the notorious art thief from the united kingdom nick said pointing at me as he came in have you searched her yet oh my god i said not sure id heard him right nick please tell me you did not just make an anagram of my name please just please his jaw clenched and he took another step forward he was almost far enough from the door that i had a good chance of making it through but without the ringswhich were not even here anymorei was dead anyway she has a history of claiming to be agents of big corporations and walking away with priceless artifacts he said and the womans hand came away from the phone how long had he been listening at the door and where in hell were jenks and ivy well nick wasnt the only one who could tell pretty stories marcie this jerk is my old boyfriend he doesnt work for the fib and hes been stalking me all week the man is a thief nick stiffened im a thief he said looking odd in his new clothes as he advanced another step im not the one stealing ancient elven artifacts to break the ley lines you are a menace and im trying to stop you how dare you blame me for that i shouted im trying to stop him his jaw clenched and i turned to marcie the woman hadnt picked up the phone but she was ready to marcie im sorry i said still trying to turn this into a stalker boyfriend issue im going to file a restraining order as soon as i get out of here he doesnt work for the fib and hes lying to you to get me in trouble with my boss if i dont get those rings out of here im a dead woman true enough nick made an exasperated sound when marcie looked at him with doubt starting to believe me neither of you move has she taken any pieces yet nick said but it sounded desperate what rings did she ask after marcis eyes narrowed her belief swinging back to him riffletics nick leaned to see the ring case theres a pair missing there is not i said affronted but marcie had already pulled away from her corner rushing to look no i exclaimed when she lowered her head to see and nick grabbed a heavy vase it hit the back of her head without breaking and the woman hung for a heartbeat eyes wide as she slowly collapsed you son of a bitch i said lunging forward to catch her my bare feet burning on the carpet squares as i struggled with her weight what in hell are you doing now its assault the door beeped and nick barely got out of the way as ivy yanked it open i say we return the favor and get the hell out of here she said as jenks flew in sword bared and his dust a dismal blue something bad had happened where is jax i carefully lowered marcie to the floor rising up mad enough to plow my fist right between his smiling teeth as nick backed out of ivys easy reach he was still kusoxs toy i could tell what are you doing down here nick said idly his head tilted so he could eye a row of artifacts and me at the same time jenks landed on ivys shoulder clearly distressed can we just get out of here but i didnt have the rings yet and at a loss i shook my head nicks smile widened dont have what you came for he mocked running a finger on a glass case to leave an obvious mark you got pierce and ceri killed i accused how dare you smile at me his smile vanished but i couldnt tell if his sudden contriteness was real or contrived im sorry about that i didnt know he was going to kill them hes a psychotic demon i shouted then lowered my voice when jenkss wings hummed a warning and he darted into the hall he doesnt need a reason to kill people just a reason not to you are one dumb warlock i said with a sneer kusox is going to kill you too nick chuckled tugging his sleeves down to cover his cuffs on trent it looked good on him it looked nervous kusox needs me hands on his knees he leaned over the case of rings mmm riffletic rings i understand they were pulled werent they the elven wedding bands seriously he straightened better than chastity i suppose ivy had inched closer and seeing it nick shook his head stopping her he still belonged to kusox and i didnt want the demon showing up if we were going to take nick out it would have to be fast but i didnt know if that really mattered anymore my plan was royally flushed kusox wasnt stupid three seconds after nick told him what we were after he would have it figured out maybe i could make that work for me kusox doesnt need you i said caustically and nick looked up from the display as if i was being stupid or maybe i should say he wont thanks to trent those rosewood babies dont need your lame enzymes the only reason he hasnt eaten you yet is because youre spying on me nick smiled as if giving a benediction as i said he needs me yeah for how long i said clearly distressed jenks hovered just outside in the hall at the ceiling he tapped his wrist like a watch ivy wasnt close enough though maybe you havent noticed but ive got an expiration date i added youre going to be deadweight after tomorrow whatever happens nick frowned his fingers twitching didnt think about that did you crap for brains his head came up you know nothing he looked at ivy stop moving vampire ivy rocked back cut it short or bring him she said we have to go bring him i barked my chin lifting then i said to nick there is no hole deep enough or dark enough to hide you when kusox decides hes done with you and pulls your plug arms swinging i headed for the door figuring hed get close enough to smack him if he thought i was leaving sure enough he reached for me and i let him grab my arm we used to be good he said eyes angry yeah well i used to be stupid grabbing his wrist i spun to put my back to his front and levered him right over my shoulder he hit the floor in front of me with a groan and ivy was there her long arm against his neck even though he was out jenks flew in at the noise hovering over us when do you want him to wake up she said and my lip curled jenkss dust was still that depressed blue how about never he suggested there was a long tear in his new clothes jax ten minutes i said in disgust and she let go shoving him across the narrow walkway to slide into a lower cupboard i like jenkss idea better she said as she got up yeah whats up rache jenks snarled you know he doesnt deserve it i nodded as i turned back to the rings we all have a part to play i said as i looked over the selection time was pressing on me making me jittery it couldnt be because nick was helpless on the floor and i was walking away ivy smelled of darkness and earth as she eased up beside me anything you take hell know and tell kusox the ones i really wanted are gone anyway i said wishing i had my cheat sheet then remembering marcie had one jenks check marcies sketch there who donated the demon slave rings slave rings this was a mistake this was a mistake in a big way but i had to take a huge leap if i was going to survive he whistled his dust a shade brighter as he darted to the woman and leafed through her papers ahh cabenoch he flew up his dust settling on the velvet background to look like stars on a moonless light cabenoch thats german isnt it its elvish i said finding the rings i wanted something in me quivered seeing them there plain circles of battered metal they were both tarnished but one looked as if it had been on a hand that had never seen dirt and the other had never seen the sun slavers that would work though it curled my lip thinking about reinvoking them okay its rigged right i said and ivy carefully slid the entire box almost entirely off the table jenks darted under it and from the door marcie groaned we had maybe thirty seconds i didnt want to hit her again jenks i prompted and a wash of depressed blue bathed our feet standard stuff he said not coming out i dusted you about ten seconds of electronic memory so make it fast ready i nodded eyeing the rings i wanted and pulling the fake ones off my finger i still dont see how this is going to help ivy griped hes going to know the ones you took just hold it still i muttered ready jenks on my mark go he said and i opened the lid feeling a pull of a magnetic field breath held i grabbed the rings slipping them both on my index finger as i dropped the fake rings in their place ivys eyes widened when i then moved the donated by card then another how long jenks i said give me a count four three he said me moving cards like a con artist on the corner two he said and i pulled my hands out shutting the lid one my eyes met ivys and she exhaled muscles easily managing the weight she slid it back onto the table jenks flew up and all three of us looked at the lumps of metal sitting in my hand they felt as dead as they looked but something in me quivered i could bring them back to life i could make this anew demon slavers i shuddered can we go now jenks said his dust still that dismal blue and i nodded not looking back at nick as i walked out the door next time i had the chance he wouldnt be so lucky chapter twentytwo my protection circle hummed with the satisfyingly pure sound that i was identifying with the narrow ley line out back in the graveyard the belllike ting a spot of beauty in the chaos of sound and abrupt faults every other ley line was spitting out right now frustrated i set the nested slave rings on my palm and after jenkss somewhat unenthusiastic thumbsup i peeled my aura off my hand leaving it bare to everything all the way to my wrist the steady ringing snick snick snick of ivy sharpening her secondbest katana in the corner was a soothing rhythm but i still felt uneasy as i imagined the thinnest whisper of red aura spilling down my arm mirroring the shadow of veins to puddle under the rings rising to gently enfold it and breathe the first hints of life into the cold metal looking good rache but it wasnt good and my heart pounded as i exhaled empting my mind of everything but the rings the red had taken i could feel the cold metal resonating and i shifted my aura to orange pinpricks racing over my arms like goose bumps jenkss wings clattered and my brow furrowed the sliding sound of ivy sharpening her blade hesitated and i stiffened as the orange rose up and over the ring completely unabsorbed take it damn it but i knew it wasnt going to id been trying all afternoon and i had never gotten any further than this and i didnt know why damn it all to the turn and back i muttered letting the rings drop into my palm and lowering my hand my full aura raced down my arm and i shivered feeling protected again jenkss wings slumped and i shoved the rings into my pocket like a guilty secret if i hadnt done it once i would have said pierce made it up i said sourly as ivy held her gray length of steel up to the light and i dont know why youre sharpening that blade its like bringing a knife to a gunfight its always good to have a backup plan she said mildly and before you say anything just shut up about it jenks and i can keep whatever demons there are at bay while you and quen do what you need to do i wasnt going to say anything i said and her easy motion on the blade hesitated mmmhmm her tone made it clear she knew i was lying id feel better if they were here and out of harms way it was going to be warmer tomorrow night but maybe too cold for jenks and ivy was going to be more of a liability than an asset trying to defend herself against magic there was a reason even the is didnt send vampires after a witch i didnt like quen being out there with me either but if anyone could help me it would be him keep it simple and everything will be fine jenks said and i jumped when a thrown fishhook and line snagged the edge of the counter and belles pale scary face popped up with an acrobatic flip she levered herself up and away from the drafts to stand among trents library books i still had to get them back and i wondered what kind of late fee i might be risking keep it simple i thought as i reached to tidy trents books nothing about any of this had been simple id been trying to get these stupid rings to reinvoke since getting back from the museum all with no results it was as if something was blocking me maybe because the sun was up slave rings were foul just the idea made me uneasy and here i was trying to reinvoke them for a good reason i kept telling myself but did i really want to be the person who believed the end justified the means it will work i said as i stacked trents books with a thump and the draft blew belles spiderweblike hair back you cant lose with a vampire vanguard and a pixy backup ivy glared at me and i gave her a questioning look until she darted her gaze to jenks he was slumped over again his wings not moving damn it that was supposed to have cheered him up not remind him of his stupid son i hadnt known it at the time but jenks had found jax in the back halls and thrashed him soundly so he wouldnt raise the alarm i was sure his son was okay but jenks was depressed jenks i pleaded wiping my hands off on the apron and coming to sit kittycorner to ivy jenks standing between us im sorry about what happened with jax but id be lying if i said i wasnt thankful it was the difference between walking out of there and being carried jenkss face was frozen in grief and guilt i hurt him he said bitterly i tore his wings to shreds my own son he wont be able to fly for months if ever again a dark pool of black dust spilled off the table for rex to paw at hes my son even if he is blind ignorant and his words cut off as his head drooped heartache clenched my chest and i curved my hand around jenks wishing i was smaller so that i could give him a hug and then maybe a shake hes been misled i said softly and jenks angrily wiped his face his hand glowing with a silver dust hes your son jenks whatever happens clearly depressed jenks sat down where he was his legs crossed and his head down i dont think my son will be spying on us anymore i scared him i scared him into believing id kill him if he ever came home again jenks im fine he said with such bile that i knew he wasnt head coming up he flew to the sill standing beside the overturned water glass and looking out the window with his back to us as he gazed into his garden shadowed in the coming sunset i exchanged a worried look with ivy i had no comfort for him nothing to say he will forgive you it had been ivy who spoke and jenks spun the anger so thick on him that i was glad i hadnt tried to make it better what do you know he snarled his wings humming to a transparent brightness but his feet were nailed to the sill ivy didnt look up staring at the light glinting on the cool length of steel as she held it up i scared someone i loved like that she said softly i was young and stupid the sex play got out of hand i cut him deeply and wouldnt stop i ignored him when he told me no i carved deeper when he begged me to stop the sword dropped and her head drooped to follow the steel in her hand i knew he could take more and that his pain was fleeting i thought i had a right to correct his assessment of his abilities but what i was doing was confusing his mental limits with his emotional ones i was riding high on his fear and i bled him within an inch of his life only now did she look at jenks he forgave me eventually jax will too i shifted uneasily guessing she was talking about kisten it sounded about right kisten could forgive anything since hed done terrible things himself i thought about that wondering if only those who did horrible things would ever be able to forgive me this had to stop i thought feeling the bump of the rings in my pocket your son made a serious mistake ivy said and jenks shuddered you beat him told him he was making an error that was going to end his life and you told him to walk away before you came back and finished the job you saved his life he will forgive you jenks blinked fast looking like the nineteenyearold that he was with all the insecurities and inexperience that that came with he wanted to believe i could see it in his brilliantly green eyes he took a breath to say something then changed his mind i suddenly realized i had to leave ah i need to make a call i said leaning down to slide my scrying mirror out from my cookbooks ill be in the garden i added thinking jenks might open up if i wasnt around god we were a messedup bunch ill come with you belle said snaking down her rope make sssure the gargoylesss leave you alone i looked back as i left seeing that jenks had flown to ivys monitor his wings were drooping and the dust spilling from him was making an oily pattern on the dark screen i left him there bleeding out ivy he cant fly neither can belle and you cant call her any less a warrior you saved his life and perhaps ours im sorry that it was so costly i thanked my lucky stars that neither of them said anything else until i grabbed my spring jacket and fled to the back porch standing in the cool breath of the coming sunset i shoved my arms into the thin leather and glumly sat belle taking up a position two feet to my right where i probably wouldnt squish her i set my scrying mirror on my left the squeak of the cat door was loud and glowing eyes turned to us from the graveyard when the more mundane sound of the screen door hadnt moved them huddling into my coat i waved at the gargoyles i wasnt altogether comfortable out here with them looking at me but i wanted to interfere with jenks and ivy even less besides i really did want to talk to al the rings werent invoking i knew i could do this since id done it before i just needed the confidence of someone who could see what the hell i was doing with my aura jenks was good but he couldnt hear the lines like a demon rex jumped into my lap a spot of warmth that i buried my fingers in the cold damp of the early evening soaked into me as i breathed in the coming night low clouds threatened more rain and last years leaves rustled in the cold flower beds mirroring my mood perfectly spring cleanup was slower this year now that jenks was losing kids going off in pairs and alone to find their way how did my life get this complex so fast rachel belle lisped as she stood beside me bow unslung as she watched the gargoyles suspiciously do you think jenksss will find his strength of will again yes of course hes just having a bad day he is the strongest person i know except for ivy my fingers lightly touched rex as the cat purred and i wondered if i could beat someone i loved that badly even if it was for the greater good i often punished fledglingsss for risking the nest my mother grounded me a lot i said thinking it hadnt done me any harm it hadnt made me any smarter either jenksss shouldnt be hard on himself belle said firmly hes a warrior jenks is a gardener in a savage eden i said believing it he was a savage gardener with a protective streak ivy was just as savage just as protective when push came to shove and me what was i what choices would i make when the world hung poised on the arc of the pendulum and i was ready to send it in a new direction you will call your demon now for advice belle asked and i followed her gaze to my scrying mirror i dont know i said shifting my feet down a step he might not be healed enough again the silence stretched im sorry about ceri belle said stiffly and pierce i almost smiled the three of us had killed most of her clan and left her wingless but perhaps it made more sense to her with her warrior mindset thank you belle they were great warriors pierce jenks tells me you were nearly joined with him i nodded bringing up my second sight newts ley line hung at chest height a hundred shades of red glowing mixing swirling i desperately wanted to see pierce there or even al but there was nothing it would have been a good match youre both strong perhaps i said softly id thought i had loved him once but after the shine of his uniqueness had dulled id come to dislike his loose morals more than i had been attracted to his power and dark strength steadying myself i reached for my mirror reluctantly slowly i lifted rex down and set the heavy glass on my lap instead i stared into the winecolored depths in the sunset shadowlight seeing the roof of the church rising overhead the steeple distressingly free of bis it had been three days al should be healed by now have jenks and ivy summon me if im not back in two hours i said and belle nodded swinging up onto rex for her warmth i shivered in my jacket feeling as if i was being watched as i took a last look over the sunsetgloomed garden gargoyles i thought my way home settled i closed my eyes and put my hand on the mirror hoping he was healed al there was only the uncomfortable screeching that the collective had absorbed from the unbalanced line al i thought again hope growing since i hadnt gotten a donotdisturb notice just no response algaliarept my eyes closed as the unholy chaos of the collective dissolved into the rushing sound of water or wind and i felt the lofty sensation of having doubled my mind relief coursed through me and i took a slow breath sensing green trees old and damp id found him i think in my thoughts there was a pool of water among the tree roots only a few inches deep and looking like glass the air was moist and warm i could hear water dripping and smell both moss and fog there was no wind no grit no stink of burnt amber dancing over the still water were tiny blue butterflies the size of my thumb it was a forest pool primeval the light barely making it through the leaves on the far side of the stoneandmosswreathed pool was a black figure hunched and sitting on the largest smooth boulder his back to me al at least i thought it was al he didnt look right hes dreaming i thought but he must have heard me as he turned scrabbling to hide whatever he was doing on the rock al i said in our shared dream remembering having done this once before i wasnt sure it was him he was thinalmost malnourished like a fairyhis skin very dark and his hair a tight curl he stood and i realized he had leathery wings draped down over his back like a cloak his eyes were redslitted goat eyes but so wide they looked black id never seen him this thin and spindly the angular sharpness even in his face narrowing down to a very small pointy chin he looked like a creature of the air alien rachel he said his voice the same as i remembered even if it was a shade embarrassed and deeper than it should be for such a slight frame nervous i focused on his eyes are you okay is this what demons originally looked like apparently not hearing my dream thought al turned around to look sadly at the rock hed been sitting on i broke it he said they cant leave until i fix him and if they stay theyre going to die they need the sun too i edged closer wondering how long this shared dream might last on the rock was a handful of blue and silver shards as sharp as glass ive been trying to put her back together al said gesturing but the pieces dont match no matter how turned oh okay this was really weird but no weirder than the last dream we shared about blue butterflies vanishing into the walls of a maze grown from wheat the edges are torn he said gesturing i dont remember when i broke it i frowned bending over the mess look youve got this piece upside down i said then jerked when the shard cut me a drop of my blood glistened on the silver sliver and then like magic the splinters just sort of melted together into a whole the entire butterfly turning red from my blood to look like stained glass some things cant be fixed al said forlornly as i watched the red butterfly flutter her new wings on the rock and then fly up to join her friends al didnt look up from the rock and i wondered if he was still seeing broken shards where there was now nothing al youre dreaming i said and he brought his eyes up to meet mine there was an uncomfortable innocence in them and i started to wish i could back up and start again can you bring me over i need your help his gaze went to the butterflies dancing up through the canopy blinking in surprise as he looked back at the empty rock sure he said clearly preoccupied come on over i gasped in pain as the line took me hearing als bellow as everything vanished in a flash of whitehot agony i didnt understand it had been three days he should be healed by now and i hit the ground hard as realityor the everafter actuallyreformed around me my face plowed into the black marble floor of als spelling kitchen and my shoulder gave a twinge as i rolled toward the large circular fire pit with its raised benches ow i said softly hearing al cursing nearby it had been a rough landing but i was here and with a renewed hopeand embarrassmenti untangled myself and propped myself up on an elbow my scrying mirror was lying on the floor and i scooped it up checking it for cracks before setting in on the bench the new ragged hole in the wall gave me pause als bedroom looking gray beyond ita door into the once doorless room apparently hed wanted in before he could jump a line a pained sound jerked my attention to the small hearth at the front of the room it was lit and between the shadowy coals and the slate spelling table was a hunched figure on the floor mother pus bucket al groaned throwing back the blanket he had been wrapped in to scowl at me i was asleep he yelled his new black eyes glaring as he held his head what do you mean by asking me to jump you over here when i was asleep the lines are all a bloody hell mess you cant jump without a gargoyle assist or it bloody hell hurts really i had no idea i said as i sat up wishing my head would stop throbbing at least he was healed though and i cautiously sat on the hearth across from him recalling that weird batlike image he had had in his dream and wondering if he remembered it he was in his robe not surprising me at all sorry i said as he felt his ribs and grimaced you okay do i look okay he griped and i couldnt help my grin why the hell are you laughing you think this is funny no i said unable to stop smiling im just glad youre okay he grumbled under his breath groaning as he reached for a lump of dirt he then threw onto the fire the stench of burnt amber grew stronger im assuming you have a reason to be here he said watching the fire not me besides wanting to see me in pain i scooted closer wondering if the room was indeed smaller there wasnt the floor space that i remembered but maybe the new door would account for it i need your help dali gave me until friday to settle with kusox but i think hed rather kill me if he gets the chance i cant imagine why he snarled hunching into his blanket and looking miserable i took a breath i can prove kusox broke my line but i need he looked at me as my words cut off in guilt oh god they were elven slavers he wouldnt help me what was i doing here what do you need rachel he said suspiciously licking my lips i tugged my coat closer it was unusually cold in here ah i can prove kusox broke the line by moving all the imbalance at once to the line in the garden and thereby exposing his curse but i have to keep him off me until someone comes to look and that wont happen until i prove i can best him and to do that i need help al didnt shift didnt make a single indication that he heard me blacksouled student thinks she can just come anytime she wants he grumped reaching back to scratch his shoulders under his blanket were you in my dream no i said and then when his blackeyed stare fell on me i amended yes al ive got a workable plan i need help he sighed but if it was because id seen his dream or that i had a plan he was sure would fail i didnt know damn blue butterflies he whispered watching the red sparks drift up the chimney they dont mean anything are you hungry what was it with men trying to feed me all the time no al i am he said interrupting me as he reached for a covered basket beside the hearth it was tied with a checkered bow and i imagined it was from newthopefully on one of her good days ive not eaten in weeks it feels like he said as he undid the ribbon and looked inside al i need your help oh his expression fell i am not eating that rachel this is foul come smell this al al stopped fussing with the basket his head down i know you want to use my rings you arent strong enough to overpower kusox alone no one is not even two demons together not three five it took last time and since only four walked away from the encounter no one is willing to try again especially when there are bribes of mended demon babies with which to escape to the sun in you know i said my surprise quickly vanishing he eyed me as if embarrassed of course i was burned not lobotomized my wedding rings are not enough pulling them from a pocket he pushed them around in his palm with a bare finger even if you and i wore them and stood before kusox they would not be enough i was starting to get mad why did i have to do this all by myself youve given up a weary slump came over him rachel we made him to be better than us able to crush an elf warlord on his own my rings are not enough but i know how to fix the line i protested and he reached up to set his rings on the slate table beside him its not broken just overloaded kusox shoved all the tiny imbalances in your collective lines into mine making them more than the sum of their energies bis and i separated newts signature imbalance from that purple sludge and got it back into the line she made his eyes widened and i stifled a shudder at the new blackness of them interesting he said tossing another chunk of earth on the flames the loss is keyed to individual lines and you separated one settling himself deeper into the flagstones he seemed to find strength with the fire behind him is this why newts room are not shrinking anymore probably i said wondering if there was a direct connection between the imbalance the leak and the missing mass if so she wasnt going to like my dumping the imbalance into her line thats why kusox took bis but i dont need bis to move the entire ball of sludge to newts line and expose kusoxs curse als expression twisted whereupon he will descend upon you and turn me into a dark spot on the everafter floor yeah i said picking at a seam in the floor i was hoping that once i proved he did it that maybe some of you might i dont know help me maybe i shouted frustrated chuckling al resettled himself i would but it will take at least five not counting you because you dont know squat i would have argued with him but he was right quen will stand with us and trent if we can get him free al stiffened at trents name elf magic might prevail where demon cant he admitted grudgingly as much as im loath to admit it trent would be the better choice he poked at the fire to send up a flurry of coppercolored sparks hes a savage beast with a strong bond to his trickster goddess his eyes met mine in warning powerful but chaotic untrustworthy it wasnt a ringing endorsement but surprisingly promising and i eyed him from around my snarling hair are you saying that elf magic is more powerful than demon i would never admit that he said with a guffaw but kusox knows demon magic elf magic from the old wars not so much the way he was looking at me made me nervous and i dropped my eyes mmm he grumbled apparently satisfied demons acting in concert isnt enough to surpass kusox there must be a complete melding of thoughts into one action my rings only work between demons theres no way to join an elf soul to a demon there is i thought suddenly scared to say it ah thats kind of why im here heart pounding i extended my arm and opened my palm the firelight glinting on the rings al leaned forward in interest his thick bare fingers brushing against mine as he took the rings these are where did you get these he said his black eyes narrowed as he made a fist around them hatred pouring from him my lips parted scared i fought to keep from backing up his grip on the rings looked tight enough to crush them my thought went back to what quen had said about demons perhaps being slaves first the museum i wanted something else but they were gone when i got there and these were i gasped when his fist clenched al no i shouted grabbing his hand and trying to pry open his fingers dont break them its all i have please he snarled at me the lines in his square features heavy and ugly with a grimace he yanked out of my grip and threw the rings into the corner my breath came fast and i lunged after the twin pinging sounds scrabbling like a spider as i found first one then the other i held them tight to my chest my back to him as my pulse pounded he would never help me head high i walked back to the fire with the rings in my shaking hand elven slavers al growled they are ugly and i have done a lot of ugly rachel kusox is uglier i said stiffly this is what i have im going to use them if i can hold him off long enough maybe the rest of you cowards will stand up to him except the rings are dead als voice was harsh i stood before him the fire warming my shins i wasnt sure how he was going to react once i told him i could bring them back to life i ah can reinvoke them he looked up at me a sour anger in the tilt of his head no one can reinvoke them sitting down i scooted until our knees almost touched i reinvoked elven silver two days ago with pierces help taking up a poker he jabbed it into the flames they were slavers hed never help me so go ask him al muttered clearly not believing me hes dead nick helped him escape newt so he and ceri could try to kill kusox ceridwen als head snapped up what does she have to do with this i suddenly remembered that shed been with him for a thousand years that hed been so careless when replacing her as his familiar that id been able to save her life looking back i think hed done it intentionally and all this time id thought that id been more clever than he god i was stupid i think he had loved her al im sorry i whispered kicking myself for not considering that he might feel pain at her loss kusox al extended a shaky hand to stop my words his head dropping enough he said the hard sound of his voice a band of metal around my heart squeezing hurting i shifted closer the scent of burnt amber coming from the fire stinging my eyes al had taken a deep breath and i watched as he slowly exhaled his hands unclenching im sorry i thought you knew didnt newt tell i said enough i hunched into myself my own grief welling up as i watched him shove his own down denying its existence al i need your help i whispered and he seemed to become a dark lump before the low flames i only have until tomorrow midnight ive done this before i dont know why its not working als shoulders were slumped under that blanket and his expression was numb i wasnt even sure he was listening anymore you dont know what you ask its the only way to make a sure connection between an elf and a demon i said and since no demon will help me als head turned from the fire his black eyes bore into me and i stifled another shudder top shelf he said flatly behind the books i followed his gaze to one of the few open bookcases silently i stood and shoved the rings in my front pocket feeling his eyes on me i crossed the room counting my steps it was smaller by about a foot my hands were steady as i stood on tiptoe one hand on the shelf for balance as i moved three books out of the way my hand searching blindly in the small space behind them a jolt went through me as i found the cool smooth shape of a ring dont put it on al cautioned as my heels came down and i turned with a ring in my hand it was tiny almost a pinkie ring i wondered whose it was since it wouldnt fit on als hand unless he was in the shape of that gaunt black bat what is it i asked cold but too wary to come back to the fire half of a set he grudgingly said his eyes down as he snatched it from me cradling the ring to him as if it were alive my eyes widened as i realized it was his shackle his tie to a miserable past i want you to see this he said to know what you risk im sorry i said softly as i came forward to sit crosslegged before him again he was flushed embarrassed and ashamed to be clearly still tied to it wheres the other half al smiled a savage ugly smile gone along with its owner my eyes fell i couldnt look at him al had been a slave al i trusted once i couldnt say anything huddled cold before his fire in his shrinking room failing world youre willing to risk your life he said but what of your soul what if the master ring falls to someone else what then its only the slave ring that cant be removed by its wearer my eyes fell to als hands just visible among the folds of the blanket he wasnt wearing gloves and they looked hard and worn but i had no choice miserable and unsure i looked up i have to do this i couldnt tell what he was thinking his eyes catching the red glow of the low flames seemed almost normal then why have you failed oh god i knew why id failed and i dropped my gaze im afraid i whispered and he smiled damn it its not funny i shouted im afraid still smiling al looked at my fingers knotted around one another but he didnt reach out to touch me do you trust quen miserable i thought of quen his morals his loyalty his strength of character ceri had loved him and ray was his entire world i knew exactly what i would get with quen and i nodded i trusted him do you trust trent al said my head snapped up and al bobbed his head at my deerintheheadlights expression ahh there it is al said infuriatingly smug trent wont ever have access to it i said quickly chances are he will if you trusted him you could invoke them show me what you do to invoke elven silver flustered i dug the rings out i trust him i do i asserted but my stomach clenched telling me i was lying al shrugged his shoulders and his blanket fell away then show me fine mood sour i carefully snuggled the smaller ring into the cradle of the larger shifting on the hard flagstones i perched the rings on the tips of the fingers of my left hand holding it right at eye level between us one last look at al who had fumblingly put on a pair of glasses i could only assume would let him see my aura easier and i closed my eyes god please help me do this i thought i need to do this exhaling i pushed the aura off my hand feeling it hang about my bent elbow like a shirtsleeve warm and soft al grunted in surprise when i made an odd twist in my head and my entire aura flashed red you layer your aura he breathed one vibration at a time nervous i wondered if showing al this was such a good idea the demon was a packrat no telling what defunct charms he had lying around but i nodded not opening my eyes as i sent a tendril of red aura to snake up my arm i shivered as it skated over my pulse points and crawled up my fingers twining over the joined rings and thickening my pulse hammered this was where it usually all fell apart and i carefully slowly shifted my aura twining about me and the rings to the slightest shade of orange careful al breathed and my head started to hurt as tiny cracks in the rings showed i can do this i said through my clenched teeth i had to do this i had no choice but it was trent and i felt tears of frustration prick my eyes and my hand start to shake he had caged me hunted me and made my life hell even as i had fought to shove down his throat that he was immoral and deserved punishment but my breath came out in a sob as i realized i didnt believe that anymore i remembered his agonized expression in the everafter basilica when he begged me to see his people to health his anger when he pulled nick off me his willing sacrifice to endure death and the end of everything he had worked his entire life forto save one child rachel al whispered but the tinkle of wild magic plinked through my soul as one whirling eye of a thousand turned and focused on me others were drawn and my courage faltered as they laughed at me for thinking i had any power but the power of choice and at that my conviction grew choice damn it i trusted trent damn it all to hell i trusted him down to my soulnot because i had to but because i chose to tears rolled down my face and i shook at the realization i trusted him even with my soul and he isnt meant for me the wild magic laughed and it was as if the eyes marked me with the blackness of the night making me theirs i am yours i agreed miserably but it was true and more important it was my choice it always had been i shook as the entire rainbow skated over my skin flashing to a blinding white that sank inside itself to an impenetrable blackness with an echoing ping the rings reinvoked gasping i opened my eyes wide to see the rings glowing like glory itself with a sudden implosion of thought the making of the rings imprinted on my mind the degradation that the rings in my shaking hand had once caused echoed through me the cruelty of the master the anguish of the slave the petty bitterness and the savage backlash that ended both lives and broke the rings it was all there in the tinkling laughter of wild magic savagely honest in its cruelty lives had been ruined beyond belief with the power contained here and now it was mine in two tiny bands of hard metal rachel i couldnt look away from the rings i could feel tears on my cheeks and sense ala dark bear of a shadowhovering before me his hands outstretched afraid to touch me rachel it was questioning this time and i blinked curving my fingers around the warm metal they were alive all i wanted to do was destroy them these are evil i said choking back a sob as my aura thickened pinpricks of energy welling up through me in protectionprotection against stuff such as what i had made and i would trust trent with this these are evil i said louder seeing them through my tears my arms hurt and i jumped as a blanket smelling of al and burnt amber landed around my shoulders you did it al said in wonder and i looked up shaking you trust him i wish i hadnt sniffing i wiped a hand under my nose no wonder you hate elves i went to hide them and al caught my wrist slowly my fingers opened and he took them his expression solemn as he held the rings up to the firelight his glasses were gone and he held them close squinting how sure are you of his commitment he asked his tone guarded and soft i wiped my eyes and held my shaking hand out the memories of the rings still echoed in me still coloring my thoughts as i tried to readjust my world id known elves were savage fighting for their existence under the boot of the demons i had guessed that the demons were seeking revenge for the elves cursing them into a slow spiral of extinction but i hadnt realized how deep it went how convoluted it was how old shaking the feeling off i took the rings from him and jammed them away in a pocket hiding them id use them and then when done id destroy them they were tools and i wouldnt let fear rule me it doesnt matter i said answering him its the choice i make al sighed and looked into the flames through them maybe at nothing and everything perhaps you should concentrate on saving yourself he whispered let us all die were broken beyond repair i thought of al in his dream looking nothing like this more like an elegant bat broken perhaps but i had put his butterfly back together with my blood i never liked the movie titanic i said and he grunted his gaze sharpening on me they both could have gotten on that damn door al smiled and a weird kindred sensation filled me standing i took his wedding rings from the mantel and handed them to him dont try to forget her i said and his hands closed on them wonder in his eyes as he looked up at me you dont know what youre asking yes i do i had to leave the rings were awake and the sooner i used them the sooner i could destroy them could you send me home he blinked then got to his feet with a huge sigh my student just reinvoked wild magic and she cant get herself home he laughed but it fell flat and i jumped startled when his thick finger touched my jaw turning me to make me look at him if he betrays you i will finish what i started with his fingers he said and i shivered tell him that i will the smooth finish of my scrying mirror slid into my arms and he backed up eyes running over me as if it might be the last time hed ever see me we are such cowards he said softly and then my breath sucked in as the line took me my head exploding in pain i think i passed out because i didnt remember hitting the hard red cement slab that covered pierces grave in my backyard but thats where al dropped me sitting up i rubbed my bruised hip looking past the silent gargoyles perched around me as i pulled my scrying mirror to me ah hi i said as i got up nervous and stinking of burnt amber leathery wings rustled and red and gold eyes blinked i hope i didnt disturb you i said as i edged onto holy ground my hands touching the outside of my pockets to be sure i still had everything i had reinvoked wild magic somehow i had done it i had everything in place tomorrow was going to be a long day chapter twentythree i could feel gargoyle eyes on me as i began picking my way back to the church taking the shortest path but giving their hulking shadows as much space as i could the sun had gone down while id been in the everafter and i wondered if i had time to take a quick shower to get the stink of burnt amber off me before i started in on some charms i wasnt sure what would be the most helpful seeing as kusox could take anything i could dish out and throw it back to me with four times the power dont let me down trent i muttered feeling as vulnerable as new skin damn it why did i have to trust him my life was a lot easier to understand when i didnt behind me the gargoyles rumbled like elephants and i ducked when a shadow arrowed over my head it was a gargoyle my first wild hope that it was bis dying as she did a flip to lose her momentum and land atop a grave marker facing me i knew she was female because her eyes were yellow and the tuft of fur at the tip of her tail was black instead of white she was more slender than bis too and had a definite grace to her motions as she resettled her wings i thought you were bis i said trying to cover my surprise im glissando the young gargoyle said her ears almost flat to her skull and her higher but gravelly voice rumbling biss friend uneasy i flicked my gaze behind her to the church the glow from the uncurtained windows spilling out into the garden im sorry i said as my attention returned to her a demon took him yes glissando interrupted me the slant to her golden eyes becoming angry his father would like to talk to you hes out there i said voice squeaking and then i mentally kicked myself of course he was out there every gargoyle in cincinnati was in my backyard ill take you to him glissando said and my pulse pounded damn it how was i going to explain this to him why i had put bis in such danger i shouldve tried to get ahold of biss dad right when it happened i muttered and glissando ruffled her wings in agreement i slowly turned wondering which one of the pairs of watching eyes belonged to biss dad what was i going to say to him did he know that i was a demon that bis was bonded to me bis had said he had talked to his dad just last week but hey dad im bonded to a demon isnt the kind of thing that came up in casual conversation glissandos ears swiveled catching the sound of jenkss wings before i did the irate pixy dripped a weird mix of blueandgreen glowing dust as he arrowed across the damp graveyard oh god you stink worse than sixweekold pepper piss rache he said as he hovered before me eyeing glissando suspiciously everything okay i nodded my hand touching my pocket where the slave rings sat i was going to trust trent with my life i was an idiot i need to talk to biss dad i said and the pixys dust flashed a surprised gold ah you dont mind if i come along jenks said daring her to protest but the catsize gargoyle lifted her wings and shrugged muttering halfheard comments about the back of an outhouse jenks snuggled in behind my hair just under my ear it was too cold for him to be out here but i wasnt going to insult him by saying so we turned back to the waiting gargoyles and i flinched it was one thing to tell yourself that the kid you took in is playing with demons to learn the lines but another to tell his dad you sure you dont want ivy jenks asked as glissando flew past us to land on the next tombstone and blink at us impatiently shes bigger than me you saw her sharpening her knives i said as i picked my way back the same way i came out you want that out here in the dark with this there had to be over two dozen pairs of red or yellow eyes turned our way glowing in the twilight glissando shifted nervously as i passed her hopping to a marker only a few feet ahead can i talk to you she asked and i hesitated surprised sure with a small jump the gargoyle landed on my other shoulder startling me and making jenks swear i braced myself but there was no echo of the lines in my mind bis had bonded with me his images were the only ones that could reach me now i was hoping bis would be my life mate she said and jenks made a pained whine sorry i said as i followed her pointing finger and shifted my path through the long wet grass i didnt mean its okay she said interrupting me i simply wanted you to know that ive known him all his life and now theyre calling him the world breaker the one weve been waiting for who will set the lines ringing to a new song or destroy us completely my eyebrows rose world breaker the gargoyles that id seen when id popped in had all turned and with a sinking feeling i realized thats where we were headed can i make a good first impression or what glissando i started but heavy claws pinched my shoulder bringing me to silence hes always been just my friend she said her voice gruff and yet feminine now she hesitated snuffing i mean can the goyle who spends half his waking moments trying to spit on a bird in flight really be the one whos supposed to change everything she finished plaintively making jenks snicker hes a person not the savior they all think he is the stupid halfflat is so noisy he cant catch a pigeon off wing savior i thought confused they thought bis was something out of their collective foretelling how come this was the first i was hearing about this im ah trying to get him back back she snorted and jenks yelled at her when her tail whipped around my neck for support hes learning the line she said sarcastically he cant do anything from here she really cared for him and guilt tightened around me damn it id really messed up his life and now he was in real danger glissando i really like bis hes important to me because hes a member of my family not because of an old wives tale were going to fix that line i wont let him down the small gargoyle took a deep breath thanks she said her head down ill tell them youre coming thats them right over there she spread her wings behind my head and i stiffened wait if they are calling bis the world breaker what are they calling me her tail slipped from around my neck and her weight shifted youre his sword to break it with i blinked and gaped after her as she effortlessly took to the air holy crap jenks exclaimed ive been taking rent from the gargoyles savior i swallowed hard glumly forcing myself to keep moving forward and his sword i said thinking it was a lot to put on the kid what does that make you it makes me the landlord he said in satisfaction hurry up will you its cold unable to see the humor in it i inched onto the small patch of unsanctified ground marked by a red slab of cement and pierces grave six large gargoyles male and female lurked on the surrounding stones their wings draped over their backs behind them dozens lurked watching as well a huge gargoyle was perched on the angel statue his claws leaving delicate scratches on the angels face like tears nervous i scuffed my feet and his big red eyes narrowed at me it was obvious they didnt like being this close to the ground but it put them nearer to the one line in cincinnati that was humming instead of screaming uh hi i said pulling one hand out of my jeans pocket to give him a little wave and the rest of them shifted their wings in a leathery hush i have two of the worlds most powerful rings in my pocket and im in danger of being squished ah you must be biss father im etude the gargoyle on the statue said his vowels grinding together low and deep in his throat he shifted his claws and a flake of stone broke from the statue hitting the cement to shatter his ears flattening for a second he flushed a deep black suddenly i felt more relaxed having seen bis do the same thing when embarrassed dont worry i said i never liked that statue much this is jenks jenks made a burst of dust but stayed on my shoulder im here to make sure none of you hulks hurt rachel he said loudly and the gargoyles around us murmured sounding like a distant avalanche im just warning you is all he finished and i lifted my shoulder to get him to shut up ah about me losing bis in the everafter bis the old gargoyle said and i sighed at the interruption yes ah can i talk to you sure confused i stuffed my hands back in my pockets not knowing what was going on anymore this wasnt what i had expected there seems to be some confusion etude said gesturing to the gargoyles surrounding us everyone seems to think bis is going to do this great thing but this is my son were talking about we all know the mistakes hes made the errors he sings the gargoyles watching nodded their eyes showing impatience not liking their attitude i cocked a hip hes saved my life more than once all im saying is that its a lot to put on someone so young biss dad said hes only fortyseven he told me he was fifty jenks exclaimed etudes wings opened and i backed up in alarm but he was only making the jump to the flat slab of cement my expression blanked as he came forward on widely spaced toes my god he was huge i froze and jenks darted away when the gargoyle put a sinewy lightly furred arm over my shoulders towering over me you and i both know that bis is a good kid but hes just a kid he said softly shifting his wings to block the other gargoyles sight of us unnerved i let him move me forward back onto the softer ground and away from the others theyre calling him the world breaker i prompted and etude snuffed his pricked ears going flat for a moment he smelled like an iron bell and somehow it made my teeth hurt hes my son he said hes bonded to youa demon i can see it in your aura this isnt what i wanted for him everyone wants their child to grow up a little better than they are etude continued settle down raise a few goyles sing songs that resonate with the universe thats not what i want for my kids jenks said i accept his choices biss dad said far too reasonably to make me comfortable even if it means that he might have to live in the everafter and never see the stars again i wouldnt make him do that i protested and his hand on my shoulder tensed his claws pinching me for a bare second in warning but you and i both know that bis is not a great hero he is a lobwinged klutz my mouth dropped open and i pulled out from under his wing etude i think you have sold your son short i said facing him squarely not liking that i had to look up at him he was the size of a small elephant your son at the tender age of fortyseven found and pulled my soul out of the ley lines when i had hardly a scrap of aura left to find it i jabbed a finger up at etudes bare wellsculptured chest and the gargoyle took a step back he jumped me to the only person possibly able to keep me alive i said following him chin raised as i got into his face he sang me two resonances that exist in one line so i could repair it ah rache jenks said hovering over etudes shoulder looking worried that line right there i said angrily pointing the one that you are all clustered around like its the last fire on a neverending night right now bis is in the everafter playing pattycake with a psychotic demon who is trying to destroy the everafter hes trying to learn all the lines in an ungodly short amount of time so we can save your fuzzy asses rache gargoyles were winging in from all over their black shadows landing menacingly in a large circle if your son is the world breaker im going to see him through it i shouted shaking i dropped back suddenly aware that glowing red and gold eyes watching me were backed by strong muscle that could wring dust from a rock like water from a sponge but i wasnt done yet now you all can stay in my graveyard because i know the lines suck right now and if they are giving me a headache you must be in agony but if you ever call bis a lobwinged klutz again im going to hunt you down at noon and chip your ear off ah rache jenks warbled what do you want pixy i snarled my knees shaking as i stood with my hands on my hips never mind etude was eyeing me his big red eyes assessing and my arms somehow got tangled up over my middle i knew it made me look afraid but i was trying for pissed i was both perhaps etude rumbled his ears perking forward at me my son made a wise decision after all in his choice of weaponry can you keep him alive his voice had changed becoming respectful i took a breath hearing it shake as i exhaled i intend to i said softly believing it everyone wants me to protect someone whos going to protect me down to my last breath etude looked me up and down again rising to his full stature he gestured to someone behind me i couldnt stop my instinctive half step back but etude was smiling a savage blacktoothed grin at me when he looked back in that case he said shifting his wings behind him what do you want us to do with these two we found them skulking about and think theyre up to mischief no fairyfarting way jenks exclaimed and i felt my face flash hot nick i said not surprised all my bile and anger distilled into that one word i couldnt help my smirk as i looked at nick hanging between two gargoyles his toes inches from the soggy chill earth jax was sitting on the palm of another gargoyle his wings tattered and his back to us clearly wishing he was somewhere else the hand of the gargoyle holding him was radiating a visible gentle heat and seeing him jenks swore loud enough to make his sons shoulders come up to his ears i didnt care if nick could read the emotions on my face none of what i was feeling was particularly nice satisfaction maybe that wewell someone anywayhad caught him anger that he had slapped me hatred that he had betrayed ceri and pierce to their deaths that ivy and i had downed him in the museum was only a minor consolation he was here to steal the rings and i felt my pocket to reassure myself they were still there thank god the garden was full of bright eyes tonight jenkss wings were turning blue from cold but he hovered before nick looking as ticked as i felt nick nick nick i said hands on my hips i wish i could say it was a surprise sullen nick grimaced from the pain in his shoulders his face had a swollen bruise and i wondered if kusox had beaten him because he hadnt gotten the rings from us he said are you going to let me explain or just assume you know whats going on the corner of my eye twitched hold him i said curtly keep him on holy ground jenks get a strap will you holy crap the pixy said as he realized the danger nick could turn into then darted to the church leaving an unsettlingly thin band of dust to show his path hearing his wing hum fade jax went scarlet his wings were tattered beyond belief but the main lines were undamaged hed recover for all his anger jenks had been careful the surrounding gargoyles moved their wings whispering in elephant tones as they chuckled at my precaution he wont evade us etude said his voice holding a mocking assurance and i tapped the line to make every single gargoyles ears prick that demon i told you about i said pulling in the clean energy and filling my chi the one that has bis he can drop into this piece of crap like hes an old slipper etudes tail curved up into a question mark and nick grunted as the sharp claws holding his shoulder pinched so you dont mind if i strap him do you i added walking a sodden heeltoe heeltoe toward nick over the grass simply being on holy ground wont stop kusox from taking over nick a strap though will at least prevent kusox from using a line if he should feel the need to drop in and see how his favorite human is doing our agreement to leave me alone aside kusox isnt possessing me nick said and i shrugged things change i stopped before him feeling confident with my belly full of energy and fifty gargoyles backing me are you telling me you dont doooo that anymore nicky baby forgive me if i dont believe you maybe i shouldnt be so cocky but i was so angry at nick that i was beyond caring the gargoyles had hoisted him up giving me the impression of him being crucified nick squinted down at me clearly hurting you were right he said his words thready from the pain in his back and shoulders ow im here to help will you stop hurting me the grinding sound of rocks had to be laughter and a tiny thrill of anticipation dove through me oh please im right huh i said as i cocked my hip right about what ive said so many things about you hurry up jenks im no good at monologues nicks feet twitched and a gargoyle hissed trent is licking his boots nick said unable to meet my eyes you were right kusox doesnt need me anymore i want to help you i leaned in ready to smack his feet away if he tried to kick me with two gargoyles holding his arms it might be a really bad life choice because of him ceri and pierce were dead my eyes narrowed we dont need you either nick the door to the back of the church slammed into the siding and i turned backing up out of nicks reach a silver sparkle arrowed to us leaving a bright trail the time inside had warmed jenks up as i had hoped it was too cold for him to be out here tomorrow wasnt going to be any better how was i going to convince him to stay home he would see through any excuse ivy was behind him moving fast until she found herself among the hulking shapes and she slowed to a respectful pace one of her katanas was in her grip and she lowered the tip becoming a slowmoving shadow as the gargoyles responded to her with pricked ears strap the fairy louse jenks said as he dropped the flexible band of silvercored plastic into my hand i swung my hair off my shoulder to give jenks a warm place to land but he went to etude instead looking tiny on the giants shoulder a wave of heat was coming off the gargoyle my eyes went to nick and i hesitated i didnt want to touch him he might jump me out allow me etude said after jenks buzzed discreetly into the giants ear and i gratefully gave the plastic strip to him his clawed hands moved dexterously and with a finger gesture the two gargoyles holding nick set his feet on the ground so they could strap his hands before him thanks i whispered softly and etudes ears flicked back nick grunted shifting his shoulders in relief as the band tightened over his wrists with a sound that made me shiver i understand why you dont trust me oh i doubt that i backed up to where ivy waited not trusting him when there was no one ready to rip his arms out of their sockets if he did so much as sneeze if you did you wouldnt be here free of his guards i looked him over seeing the wear and tear of living with a demon his eyes darted stubble was thick on his cheeks the suit was gone and he was wearing a pair of black jeans black shirt dark sneakers shivering in the cold scars covered his neck and wrists and had turned his ear into a soft mess of scar tissue if i didnt know hed gotten his scars as a rat in cincinnatis illegal rat fights id say he was a vampire junkie either that or a brimstone addict wheres your suit i asked and his eyes met mine blue and haunted he didnt answer me and ivy sidled close whispering did you get them fixed nodding i touched my pocket is that what you came for nickk i said and ivys eyes went black trying to buy your way back into kusoxs good graces might be expensive more than a thief like you is willing to pay kusox will kill me if he sees me again nick said and ivy sashayed closer the tip of her sword making a soft hush in the springlong grass so will we she murmured i couldnt help my smile she was always so honest with her emotions it was truly refreshing even better nick was falling for it it didnt matter if he was lying to us and kusox has sent him to sabotage it didnt even matter if he was telling us the truth and he really wanted to helpwhich i didnt entertain for a second what mattered was nick believed us that we thought we had the strength to stand up to kusox if he believed kusox would too my ifs were disappearing and bis was a freaking world breaker how could we lose i glanced at the church wondering why none of them had perched on it clearly a more comfortable place for them than a cold stone a foot off the ground lets go in i said shivering in the damp everyone who fits that is its cold out here you want to take nick inside ivy asked and jenkss dust turned an ugly red hes lying the pixy said looking severely at nick and jax i couldnt help my snort i know but its cold out here we can do this inside leaning toward ivy i whispered besides i want to see how far this goes and we cant when were standing around out here in the garden its going right to kusox thats where ivy said shifting foot to foot i winced ivy im cold jenks is cold as soon as jax gets off that gargoyles hand hes going to be cold nick is strapped and the risk is minimal can we please go inside i have to save the world tomorrow and i dont even know what im going to wear yet ivy eyed me then pointed at nick with her sword move she said and nick blew his breath out in a long sigh before he started walking jenks clattered from etudes shoulder shedding a thick dust over nick as he followed him i hoped he wasnt pixing him i didnt want to have to deal with a sullen itchy nick a sullen tricky nick was bad enough seeing them headed for the church i turned to the gargoyle who had jax hesitating when i realized etude had taken the pixy and was extending him to me as if he was a gift thank you i said as i held out a hand and jax made the short wobbling walk his head down and clearly ashamed for everything i added so etude would know i wasnt just talking about the pixy etude grimaced his long canines making him look fierce bring bis home he said and then his wing circled around me as if in protection he might be the world breaker but he was my son first i looked up at the craggy face wishing things were different al had once told me that the demons were responsible for the beginnings of the gargoyles they were a young race nearly as young as witches wed been created as magically truncated demons twisted and lied to until we believed what the elves told us the gargoyles had been created to serve demons shaped to the demons needs both smacked me wrong i will i said then curved my free hand over jax when he sat in my palm if youd like to perch on the church that would be okay etude looked at the steeple this is my sons home i need his permission i had no idea what to say and still holding jax i turned away the gargoyles shifted to let me pass and i hastened to catch up with ivy i could hear jenks berating nick long before i reached them and i hoped he wouldnt be so harsh with jax the pixy still hadnt said anything and i was torn you know your dad loves you i said not knowing why he has a funny way of showing it the pixy muttered so do you jaxs head came up yes but he started then seemed to deflate im sorry ms morgan he said his long hair shifting to hide his eyes i waited another moment then realizing he wasnt going to say anything more i curved my fingers around him to try to keep him warm you want me to lock them in my closet ivy said when i caught up her sword tip never wavering from nicks kidneys as she stepped over the wall its soundproof i hadnt known that but i shook my head i didnt know what to do with them but i was cold and i wanted to get inside we should just stake them jenks darted back to us and jax shifted against my fingers right here in the garden let the spring fairies make nests in their insides that was just nasty understandable but nasty i replied not that i want to spend time with nick but id rather know where he is wouldnt you ivy frowned her concern clear in the porch light as we went up the wooden steps he makes one move i dont like im going to give him to nina to bleed dry even if it will set her back a week it was the best i could hope for and i hung back on the bottom step as nick opened the back door and went in ivy tight behind him shoes off i heard her bark but it was more to put him off balance than to keep the floors clean then again i mused as i came in to find her scowling at nick the man leaning against the wall to wedge his shoes off without using his hands i debated whether to change the zip strip for one encircling one wrist not twothen decided not to i was sure he was kusoxs ace in the hole otherwise hed be dead by now okay were inside sit ivy said tightly and nick dramatically fell into the soft leather sofa to send up a puff of vampireincensescented air i came to help he protested when she poked her sword tip at him to move down and i set jax on the top of the couch so i could take my coat off it smelled of everafter and in a splurge of motion i tossed it out on the back porch to air out help ivy leaned forward stinking of angry vampire her fangs showing as she gripped his shoulder and put her head right next to his you want to help yourself she shoved him into the cushions and nick flicked a nasty look at me for not stopping her he was a big boy he could take care of himself i was coming to talk to you when the gargoyles grabbed me he said i was on the front walk i wanted to tell you i was sorry but youre not jenks nearly spat it his wings transparent as he hovered at eye level nick turned to face me as ivy pointedly sat in the chair across from him i made a mistake im trying to fix things he said but his tone was too hatinhand jenks laughed bitterly so is rachel actually shes trying to save all the demons and the entire everafter so whats your point crap for brains didnt you expect the deranged freakofnature demon to turn on you i didnt like jax being so close to nick and i put my hand down for him to climb on so i could move him to the end table im sorry ms rachel he said as he got on and sat down tattered wings tickling my palm i said nothing mad at all of them as i set him under the table lamp and turned it on to warm him still angry i sat in the chair beside him and snatched up the remote turning the tv on for any news that would indicate we were in worse trouble than before setting the remote clattering onto the end table i traced my cheek where nick had slapped me not hurting him for the hell of it was harder than i thought it would be i knew you wouldnt believe me nick said and ivy shoved the coffee table into his shins to get him to shut up i want to help this time it was belligerent and jenks laughed help jenks exclaimed and jax hunkered down under the light his back to his dad and looking miserable no fairyfarting way he yelled and his kids who had been hovering vanished you are not switching sides you are lying rache why are we even listening to this nick put the lie back in believe i dont know i said listlessly maybe because if hes sitting in front of me hes not coming behind me with a knife besides theres nothing on tv nick pushed the coffee table away from his knees and ivy pushed it back clearly at the end of his patience he tossed the hair from his eyes and held his wrists up asking to be released i shook my head and he lowered his bound hands kusox dying is the only chance i have of surviving this you think jenks said but i could feel nicks eyes on me as i watched the newsnothing so far about surface demons at the park not even a teaser for the end of the broadcast i was mad nick continued i thought he hesitated as my teeth clenched i was trying to get back at you okay it went too far my eyes flicked to his holding jenkss wings clattered and he rose too far he said destroying the everafter and magic to tell your old girlfriendwho doesnt even like youthat you were mad at her was too far i didnt have to say a word jenks was doing all my yelling for me i appreciated it it freed me up for more important things like watching the latest insurance commercial but even so my anger grew because of him ray would never know her mother i was wrong nick said staring down at the table his hands in his lap you were right at that i couldnt help myself im the better bet now huh relief slipped into his expression as i finally talked to him im trying to survive rachel doesnt owe you crap you lying sack of toad shit jenks said i put the arches of my feet on the edge of the coffee table i dont owe you crap you lying sack of toad shit that one i wanted to say nick pressed his thin lips together his stubble showing strong when he flushed fine ill leave he shifted forward to stand getting no more than three inches before ivy stood the pointy part of her sword touching his chest looking at it he sank back down the tension was getting thick i didnt have a clue what to do with him much less what i was going to wear tomorrow let him go ivy jenks said bitterly we dont need him he cant go i said as three of jaxs sisters brought the miserable pixy a blanket damn it he was crying silver tears i was going to smack nick into the next dimension for having misled jax so badly hell run back to kusox and tell him how im going to smear him into demon pâté is that what you think id do nick said his words clipped go back to kusox i leaned over the table if the crap stinks wipe your ass i made a mistake nicks gaze was fixed on mine and his words were precise throw me a goddamned life preserver will you my eyes went to the low ceiling remembering thinking that myself so many times before his mistake had cost ray her mother lucy too nick shut up sullen he pushed back into the cushions jax was staring across the room at belle shed come in and was standing beside rex at the archway her bow strung and her expression severe rex had been jaxs cat and id give a lot to know what jax was thinking both about the cat and that belle a fairy was living under his fathers roof rache this is dumb jenks said wings going full tilt as he landed on my knee call the is to come pick him up so we can get on with what we have to do standing before nick ivy shrugged which told me she agreed with jenks i thought for a moment my gaze lingering on jax miserable as he huddled under a blanket his mother had made im not happy about this either i said but the is cant hold him if kusox can pop him out i told you nick started shut up i snapped and jenks dusted a heavy black to pool on the floor i used to listen to you but you lied and i walked leaning forward i caught his eyes and held them tell you what ill keep kusox off you if you stay in the church thats it rache jenks complained and i held up a hand like i believed for one second that he would stay in the church set one toe out of it and i dont care anymore nick exhaled loudly clearly wanting more he wasnt getting it i have stuff to do heart pounding i looked at the clock on the cable box excuse me nicks expression became alarmed at the prospect of my leaving him with ivy and sure enough ivy smiled to show her teeth her motions slow and sultry as she almost crawled over the couch to sit beside him can i leave you two alone for five minutes i asked as i looked down at her not altogether kidding and she smiled even wider i want to talk to you jenks said rising up with an aggressive wing clatter sure i said the memory of jaxs tattered wings swimming up behind me i heard nick tell ivy to fuck off either she would kill him or she wouldnt to be honest i was more concerned about what i was going to wear tomorrow than nicks survival how are you doing jenks i said as went into my room despairing over finding anything in my closet wings clattering jenks landed on my dresser his gaze on the wall as if he could look through it to see his son peachy damn keen he grumbled i could hear the gargoyles in the garden rumbling like elephants as i shut the door a feeling of pity swept through me ivy was annoyedbut ivy often was i was angryagain understandable jenks had parental guilt mixed with a strong streak of protection and he was having the hardest time im sorry about jax i said as i opened my closet door and shoved everything to one side maybe there was something at the back that id missed but the only things there were the clothes my mom hadnt wanted to take with her and were of too high a quality to give away jenkss expression lost its anger and he sat slumped on a perfume bottle wings drooping i didnt think id have to face jax again he said softly and my heart nearly broke i imagine thats what hes thinking i said and jenks met my eyes i pulled out a filmy scarf drawing it through the air and letting it settle on my bed thinking it might make a good sash maybe i should start with the boots and work my way up i just want to smack him jenks said gesturing weakly he doesnt know how short life is hes throwing it away he could be so much if hed come to the dark side i said trying to lighten things up jenks was silent his wings slowly regaining their usual color not the white leather dress not the black leather pants my fingers trailed reluctantly off my usual leather id be the same person i was before in iti had to be different tomorrow i felt different my clothes should reflect that i wanted something that said power and everything i had said power and sex maybe newt had the right idea with her martialarts outfits and androgynous hairstyles i wasnt going to shave my head but something more masculine might get the demons to stop looking at me like i was nothing but a pair of x chromosomes why dont you ask him to come back to the church i said as i lingered over an offwhite linen leisure suit of my moms from the s the entire era a bastion of postturn fashion freakout it had bellbottoms but it was also form fitting and flowing the vest showing off my curves without screaming sex in sudden decision i pulled it into the light for good what draping it across the bed i kicked off my boots to try it on if hes through with nick ask jax to come back maybe hes afraid you dont love him dont love him jenkss eyes were wide and his mouth gaped there was a pop of air from the back of the church both familiar and surprising and i froze jenks and i looking at each other al i wondered and then my heart pounded at newts voice screaming latin newt oh god theyd come for me chapter twentyfour i lurched out of my room almost tripping on rex streaking into the front sanctuary a ribbon of caramel with a frightened sparkling of black pixy dust from one of jenkss kids over her ivy screamed from the kitchen and i bolted jenks was a zizzing light before me and gripping the edge of the frame i slid into the kitchen the cloying scent of burnt amber was so thick i could almost see it newt no i exclaimed and she looked at me her black eyes lost in madness she had pinned ivy to the floor the butt of her staff at her throat ivy was wideeyed the blackness of her pupils deep with forever terrified she held the end of the staff unable to shift it jenks darted down with his sword and i cried out a warning when newt gestured at him jenks was flung backward his swearing cutting off when he hit the fridge and slid down stop i cried as i tapped the line and newt took a magichazed hand from her staff it gave ivy a chance and she spun out from under the stick going for her katana grimacing newt turned back to her swinging the stick to strike her across the temple it met ivys head with a dull thwap and she collapsed oh god ivy invader belle shouted from the floor and newt shifted the aim of the black ball of death in her hand from me to the fairy the demons white robes furling elegantly newt stop i shouted diving in front of belle to intercept it i threw up a protection circle as i lunged but newts magic tore right through hitting me in the chest as i took the fall narrowly missing squishing the small woman id been trying to protect i clenched into a ball a spasm ripping through me as everything cramped my feet scrabbled against the floor as i was racked with a curse that felt like it was ripping my spine apart newt hauled me up pinning me to the farm table dont hurt newt i gasped as belle trilled like an amazon warrior belle stop newts black eyes stared into mine wild and alive her color was high accenting her new spiky red hair cut short just at her ears her fingers were clenched in my hair as she forced my head back and her staff was across my neck pressing me into the table clearly something had snapped in her had she remembered something or forgot belle no i cried out as the fairy poised at the top of the hanging rack gathered herself to jump on newt immolerate newt snarled without even looking back a wave of force pushed from her and i squinted as the air was pressed from my lungs belle was gone and i panicked i couldnt move my legs and they felt like they were on fire i have to kill you now the crazed demon said and i choked as she pressed into my throat and i was doing so well if i dont theyll believe that im responsible for all of this fine great but dont hurt my friends i gasped my hands trying to shove her off me please the muscles of her jaw smoothed and her shoulders eased dont hurt your friends please i wheezed my grasping fingers brushing the tips of her hair if it had been an inch longer i could have pulled her off balance my friends belle shes the fairyshes a great warrior she protects the pixy children who live here jenks needs to be alive to help ivy ivy is trying to live with her guilt please dont ruin her shes so beautiful inside the fervor of her eyes diminishing newt eased up clearly confused and i took a grateful gasp of air and help bis i said my hands dropping to her staff trying to push just an inch more of space between us and failing my arms too felt like they were on fire if you have to kill me will you help bis will you do that for me he deserves better than to be with kusox the rest of his life hes just a baby bis she was confused and i forged ahead and take al his chrysalis my eyes darted to the window i couldnt see it the angle was wrong its right there on the sill i said wishing she would turn to look he thinks he cant love anymore but i know he can tell him he was right he used to have wings they were like stretched moonlight tell him im sorry newt took a step back her grip falling from me you know what we looked like slowly i sat up against the table and rubbed my throat ivy was still out so was jenks belle was standing guard over him fierce and determined i didnt know where nick was i didnt care i saw the pools of shallow water the moss green branches overhead i said voice ragged the fog that muffled and soothed the sun newt dropped back another step her hands loose on her ebony staff confusion in her eyes i coughed sending ribbons of fire to flare and die in my limbs the everafter was a paradise what happened we killed it i looked up to see newt lost in a memory both the elves and us in our war she said her grip going white on her staff together we killed the everafter they could flee we were left to wallow in our shared war waste we make it worse with every curse but we have no choice to survive we must set things even more out of balance somehow i wasnt surprised that the elfdemon war was to blame im sorry newts focus sharpened and her long face grew tight again i didnt want to kill you they made me do it im not dead quite yet still holding my throat i slid to the edge of the table and cautiously slipped off pinpricks of fire like the stars of returning circulation burst against my skin and vanished newt shifted her staff and i eyed her sourly clearly she was having a bad newt day since when does anyone make you do anything i crouched to feel for a pulse at ivys wrist and newts face was ugly when i turned back they think im plotting with you she said angrily because i petitioned for time for you because my rooms are no longer shrinking al has been imprisoned but i was told to kill you if i do theyll not only let me live another day but they might listen to me al was in jail crap on toast it was down to quen and me kusox is at fault newt admitted bitterly its easier to blame you killing him is impossible killing you is merely hard that was kind of nice killing me being hard not easy jenks was sitting up and holding his head wings askew belle crouched beside him whispering in his ear as her eyes never left newt if you kill me i said cautiously moving to sit in my chair youll all only live another week tops i gestured helplessly the reason your rooms arent shrinking is because i fixed your line thats why it is the only one that sounds right anymore if i had bis i could fix them all can you get him back for me now newt backed up confusion in her stance and apparently not knowing what to do if i didnt attack her no you make it sound easy not killing you easy i pushed out ivys chair for newt with my foot and she stared at it in distrust it is easy what ive had to do to save you dumbasses is hard first i had to figure out a way to fix the line and when i do you let kusox take bis from me i somehow find a way to prove kusox broke it and then they convince you to kill me before my deadline and now i not only have to prove kusox broke my line but then survive doing so without al without anyone kusox wants you all dead my god why do you keep believing him newt glanced at ivy then back to me we made him he owes us his life hes going to bring the demons back to the sun with the demon children he has stolen you owe us nothing why would you help us i honestly dont know an elbow on the table i felt my neck kusox is a liar and a psychotic genius ive had a very bad week newt a very bad week and to top it off i dont have anything in my closet that is suitable to wear while saving the world are you sure head tilted i met her eyes god i was tired youve seen it not much has changed since then newts black eyes narrowed no i mean are you sure that she hesitated glancing at ivy are you sure you can prove kusox is betraying us not you a rueful chuckle slipped from me it must have surprised her because she backed up almost to the door her staff held defensively before her given half a chance i said can you just hold off until tomorrow to kill me by sunset tomorrow i can prove all this was kusoxs fault or he will have killed me himself if were both around come sunup you can kill who you want and we can all get on with our lives newt shook her head mistrustfully ivy was starting to come around and jenks made a slow wobbly flight to her hopefully to tell her to pretend to still be out were losing too much space it has to be now my toes were the only part of me still tingling and i looked at them when did i get a hole in my sock you cant give me one lousy day slowly hardly moving ivy sat up against the wall holding her head i made the finger motion for her to not move and jenks whispered it since she couldnt focus yet newt drew herself up her black eyes flicking over ivy not afraid but assessing the leak is too wide ive run out of room you and al and i myself now are so far in debt that theres nothing left ive got a bushel basket full of truth i said as i shifted in my chair to face her square on i know what you looked like i saw the eden your war destroyed kusox knows only what youve shown him and im sorry newt but youve shown him only the present not your past you really want him in charge of your future she hesitated fingers clenching on the staff i know youre afraid i said and she barked in laughter afraid of you not of me i said youre afraid of the endless days continuing with no change youre tired you think kusox is how you can let go and still continue on but look at him hes not you he doesnt have your soul thats why he keeps trying to eat them she was listening and i sat up trying to look like i knew what i was talking about look at how hes getting past the elven curse hes stealing babies hes stealing the wisdom to keep them alive i broke the curse you put on the elves and i can damn well break the curse that keeps you stuck in the hell you both made of your paradise i can free you newt you can finish free of the everafter as you began it newt swallowed hard a tear slipped from her and she wiped it away shocked behind her pixies were plastered against the window watching we had wings i smiled you flew between the clouds and the moon her eyes came to me its not a dream no this this nothing that you live in my hand lifted and fell this is the nightmare you made for yourself let me wake you up her lungs heaved as she took a deep breath she looked scared wild she might do anything strike me she said softly her stick held tight in her grasp from the floor by the fridge jenks rose up wings clattering whoa whoa whoa he said newt took a firm stance and pointed the butt of her staff at ivy as the woman got to her feet listing but ready to attack easy i shouted standing up and holding out a hand everyone just take it easy newt grimaced and then as if having a sudden thought she set the end of her stick on the floor and calmed wait she said and ivy hesitated ready to jump at her lets find something from your closet for you to wear then you can strike me totally confused i blinked why smiling to scare the bejeebers out of me she came forward watching me but keeping that staff of hers between her and ivy and jenks i need a reason for you to be alive come sunup ill tell them you hit me jenks darted into the back room his swearing dropping like golden apples nick was gone apparently but i could do nothing as newt looped an arm in mine and a pulse of magic from her lifted through my hair shattering the sanctity of the church damn it shed done it again i can give you until sunrise then you will be summoned and you will die newt added making me feel all warm and cozy tonight jenks yelped as he flew back in an angry red dust showing his path what happened to her four days then he turned to me his dust almost catching fire rache we got a problem nick ran off newt hesitated at the threshold of the hallway cautiously testing the sanctity with the butt of her staff that little worm of a man she said he owes me a familiar maybe two i dont remember she gestured and nick popped into existence on the table beside me i spun as trents books hit the floor and then ivy was on him her eyes dark as she pulled him off and slammed him up against the wall dazed nick struggled to focus then breathe when she gave a little squeeze clearly enjoying herself newt still had her arm in mine as she half turned to watch her hair was now my length and i started youre ivy the crazy demon said and nick coughed violently as ivys grip went slack in surprise i think i liked you jenks and i exchanged a panicked look and i turned newt back to the hallway and away from ivy ah let me show you what ive got picked out i said almost pulling her into the hall behind us i heard nick hit the floor with a pained grunt looking over my shoulder at the stove clock my gut clenched call quen about the new deadline pick out my clothes with newt keep ivy from killing nick was i forgetting anything you have until sunrise the demon said looking at the pixies hovering at the top of the hall in the sanctuary as she led me to my closet not because i particularly like you you understand i simply cant do all that you charge me with youre going to have to do that yourself chapter twentyfive theresss a car at the curb belle said as she appeared at my open bedroom door and a jolt went through me quen finally tell ivy to stay put ill get it i said when six enthusiastic pixies darted into my room with the same message all of them chattering loud enough to give me a headache ivy i shouted before she could move ill get it you watch nick i touched the rings in my pocket for reassurance as i shooed everyone out of my room and shut the door behind me pace fast i headed for the sanctuary ivy was where id left her on the couch stretched out and dangerously languorous and i gave nick a disparaging glance as i passed dont let him move whatever happens okay i asked jenks and he left my shoulder to stand on the coffee table beside jax the smaller tattered pixy shied at the soft clatter of his dad landing and i hoped that the two of them would start to talk again stomach churning i went to the door promising myself that if i lived through this i was finally going to get a light in the foyer its quen one of jenkss kids said in excitement as i undid the bolt to the front door and peeked out into the lamplit dark relief filled me as i pushed the heavy oak door open wider in invitation quen was getting out of the black beamer parked at the curb and my face warmed as i remembered him charging me with trents safety and here i was the one asking him to help me at midnight on a weekday to save the world a day ahead of schedule his hair slicked back quen was wearing all black again and softsoled shoes my eyes fell as i remembered the first time i had seen him hed looked like a gardener perhaps that was what hed truly like to be how are the girls i asked and he brought his gaze back from where hed been saying a soft hello to the pixy bucks braving the cold to escort him in the light on the sign over the door made creases in his face or maybe it was the burden of his life balancing on a fine point it was going to fall one way or the other doing well he said looking taller than usual because i was in my stocking feet ellasbeth is getting to know them a frown crossed his features theyre locked in the closet until i get back did you have fun raiding the museum today smiling i took his sunweathered hand in mine as he extended it pulling him into a hug instead my eyes teared up as i remembered ceri the scent of cinnamon and warm wine filled my senses and quen took a quick breath to catch his grief anger at nick flared and i shoved it away i appreciate your help i said thinking that he smelled different from trent dark and warm not green and warm i wondered if it was a mark of more maturity or just an individual trait are you sure you want to do this its just us no demon assist his lip twitched and quen pushed me into the church his hands heavy on my shoulders id rather it be that way the girls will not be safe until this is settled from just inside a pixy girl chanted come in come in and i stepped aside he slipped past me and i leaned into the night looking for any pixy dust before i shut the door the latch clicked shut and i turned toward the warmth and light i gasped as someone pulled on the line out back the draw so heavy that my knees almost buckled wideeyed i watched ivy spring from the couch quen no she shouted the dust from jenkss startled kids sifting down to make her glow heart pounding i lurched into the sanctuary nick was sitting in his chair hands bound before him glaring at quen ivy was between them her face pale as quen stood ready to fling a black ball of energy at nick his expression was terrifying with hatred he knew nick was to blame for ceris deathand i had let him walk in unawares shit could i be more clueless quen i said softly padding over to him i reached to touch his arm and he jerked from me the curse sparking the air between us why is this filth alive he said cords showing in his neck i put my hand on his arm again gently tugging the gargoyles found him in the garden hes my present to al when this is over you want to sign the card tinks titties i do jenks said his dust a bright silver as he hovered beside me ivy was holding her breath if quen began throwing curses kusox might drop into nick just to see what was up quen i fidgeted nervously al is not at all happy about what happened to ceri i couldnt say dead this was as close as i could get without crying until this is over i want to know where nick is tied up in my church with a vampire and pixy guarding him quens expression pulled up into a hateful mask he killed ceri kusox killed ceri i said crap for brains here lied to her knowing it would happen im not going to let him hurt anyone else by allowing him to wander the universe hes here where we can watch him with a twang on the line that made me jump quen let the curse in his hand dissipate he couldnt wander the universe if he was dead either he muttered you ask a lot rachel i gave nick a nasty lookthe smug son of a bitch pissed me off i know im sorry quen wasnt done yet though and jenkss wings clattered when the man took several steps closer to the thief if you move i will send fire through your spine and explode your brain from the inside eyeing him darkly nick opened his mouth and i gasped as quen lashed out impossibly fast ivy jumped but hed only slapped him and nicks head was lolling as he struggled to focus up in the rafters the pixies shouted their approval can i speak to you in private for a moment quen said dismissing nick nick was still trying to focus and i turned to quen i see your magic is back within normal parameters i said as we headed to the kitchen jenks and jax were inches away from each other neither one was dusting heavily in distress this was good right quens pace was slow as we entered the hallway have you eaten yet he asked surprising me hesitating at the top of the hall he turned halfway around is anyone hungry we have time to eat before we go i want to talk to everyone and it might as well be over food he wants to eat pizza maybe quen said squinting at nick the pixies in the rafters shouted their agreement but ivys expression said what i was thinking pizza sounded awful and my stomach was already churning sure okay i said when she shrugged maybe quen wanted a last supper kind of a thing quens lips twitched as he glanced at nick and then away great can someone else order it i want to see what rachel is wearing tonight he took my elbow trying to guide me back into motion you picked out something nice right i shivered at how similar his and trents speech cadences were i felt like i was being pushed along and i didnt like it yes newt helped me newt he said clearly thinking i was joking and my feet slipped as i stopped to look behind me ivy already had the phone and pixies were shouting out toppings jax seemed better looking at his dad with something other than fear and shame nick was sullen as he sulked in the chair holding a tissue to his lip he wouldnt try to go back to kusox until the last moment show me what youre wearing quen said jerking me into my room hey i exclaimed as quen shut the door behind him arms over his chest he exhaled in relief i see the appeal of living with pixies he said softly but do they ever stop talking only when they sleep eyeing him i cocked my hip what do you want that you cant ask in front of everyone he compressed his lips and came forward a step can i see the rings suddenly recognizing the pizza as the distraction he had meant it to be i nodded of course quen would want to see them and i reached into my pocket little pings of energy jolting my burned fingertips they clinked as they hit his outstretched palm and his lips parted as he brought them close nudging them apart with a careful finger theyre nothing like wedding rings i said as we looked at them in his creased and calloused palm al recognized them he almost destroyed them before i reinvoked them al helped you he was close enough for the scent of warm spice rising up between us to remind me of trent his fingers twitched as if to keep them for himself and i stiffened sort of and when this is over we are going to destroy them i said suddenly nervous i took a breath to tell him i had made a bargain with his goddess then didnt trent probably had an arsenal of defunct magic that should stay that way besides it sounded so lame it had all been in my mind hadnt it al had once said demons could do elf magic but didnt because it was considered beneath them frowning quen held up the smallest ring i cant believe you managed this he said quietly and i was suddenly glad i hadnt told him how id done it they were evil in a way id never considered and i was going to destroy them right after i took care of kusox tonight you need to leave so i can change i said as i tugged them out of his grip and set both rings on my dresser next to my perfumes quen walked to my dresser turning his back on me but not leaving his neck was stiff and his arms were crossed over his chest i took a breath to tell him to get out then decided against it he probably had something else to say he didnt want the pixies knowing outside were the low rumbles of gargoyles and not knowing how good their hearing was i jerked out the pencil that had been propping the window up it closed with a snap quen jumped but didnt turn you do know that we likely arent going to come back i said satisfied that he wouldnt turn around one elf and a badly trained demon wont be enough i have a duty he said and i frowned sure make me responsible for ray losing her father as well as her mother i said as i got my boots out of the closet and let them clunk to the floor god it still hurt it would for a long time and my motions to change my clothes grew rough quen didnt move and i thought of als opinion that trent would have a better chance of success than quen getting to him might be a problem quen took up the rings his silence making me uneasy if we fail do you think trent can kill him he asked as he fingered them and i kicked my jeans off feeling vulnerable no i held up my moms linen bellbottoms to me its not so much that i doubt his abilities but he is kusoxs familiar hes going to be as effective as spit you cant kill a demon ask newt or ceri or pierce i can hide your presence from the demons for a short time quen said his back to me perhaps long enough for the everafter to collapse teeth clenched i balanced on one foot then the other as i put my pants on they were lined in silk and they felt surprisingly nice im a demon i said softly if they want me they summon me im theirs the band of silver you cut off he started no i zipped up my pants swishing back and forth to watch the way they moved thanks for coming out here on such short notice apparently ive bankrupted both al and newt kusox has petitioned that al be confined which just leaves us unless you want to take the time to break him out of jail quen took a breath and i made a noise when he threatened to turn around they cant summon you if you wear charmed silver you could put it on until the everafter goes and the demons are gone he said his neck stiff and then what i said bad tempered is he trying to talk me out of this or see how deep my resolve goes grabbing the hem of my shirt i pulled it up and over my head it was cold in just my chemise and i tossed the tee to the floor it never occurred to you that i dont want the demons to die out maybe i like them huh besides kusox is using my line to kill them i said as i shoved my arms into my top im partially responsible you can stay here and watch nick if you want someone needs to there was a knock at the door and i buttoned the vest around me pizza will be here in ten ivy said through the door and then her steps retreated ten minutesa lingering benefit of having been piscarys scion that and ivy tipped very well distracted i finished the buttons you can turn around now i said sitting on my bed to put on my boots quen turned rings clinking meditatively in his hands as his eyes traveled over me taking in my choice of clothes i couldnt tell what he was thinking it had taken me three days in a car to learn trents tells quen was a lot harder what about nick he asked his voice flat as the rings shifted from hand to hand i stood there feeling my toes sink into my boots shrugging i took the rings from him and put them in the single vest pocket everything he hears or sees is going right into kusoxs head im counting on it which is one of the reasons were going to do it tonight what happens after tomorrow ill deal with tomorrow turning to the mirror i stood beside him gazing at our reflection and evaluating my new look i touched my hair deciding the braid was holding up well enough so we good just one thing i turned to him and he tossed his head to the front of the church when the bell gonged dont eat the pizza i froze as he reached for the doorknob taking a breath i jumped into motion confused dont eat the pizza quen i jerked him to a halt in the hallway i could hear the pixies in the sanctuary jenks berating nick why not posture furtive he winced didnt your father ever tell you not to eat with the elves sure because i stopped my eyes narrowed as quens smile shifted and became not nice at all because you might forget your life as you drink and make merry i said not liking this it was a forget spell temporary but effective and ivy and jenks would be pissed quen im not going to lie to them even to save their lives without another word he strode into the brightly lit sanctuary stupidass elves i followed my stomach churning this wasnt right and i felt torn as i stood at the top of the hall and looked over the sanctuary with ivys piano my desk kistens pool table and the cluster of furniture quen was already there among them looking as if nothing was amiss and he wasnt about to charm them all into forgetfulness nick was still sitting in his chair watching ivy at the front door taking the pizza and paying the man pixies were everywhere the colored silk and bright voices filling the air jax was sitting on the coffee table with belle but it looked as if she was talking not guarding him there was a cheer when the church door shut out the cold and ivy came back to drop the pizza on the coffee table right in front of nick dont eat the pizza panicked i met ivys eyes and she hesitated eyebrows high nick gagged and the pixies descended working together to get the box open before diving in to snitch the steaming pineapple i felt alone and apart in the hallway unable to shake the feeling that it was just another thursday night pizza movie and shocking the token human by eating tomatoes slice of pizza in hand ivy eased closer the diverse but weirdly complementary scents of vampire and pizza flowing over me remember this she said smiling sadly as she looked at the chaos i couldnt take my eyes from her pizza torn because it wont ever come again i finished guilt tugging at me i was not going to lie to her dont eat the pizza she hesitated jenks was watching us and i made a small finger motion as he oversaw his kids fighting over the crust to get the one with the most sauce wings humming his dust shifted to a brilliant yellow what does everyone want to drink i said softly turning on a heel to vanish into the kitchen quens eyes bore into my back he couldnt have possibly heard me warn ivy but he wasnt oblivious to her alertness either my heart pounded i didnt want my friends dead but i wouldnt lie to them ivy would follow we could talk in the kitchen the truth was going to hurt but a lie would be worse ivy can i speak to you and jenks for a moment quen said and my pace faltered maybe not theyre helping me with the drinks i shouted quen watch nick will you my heart thudded as i walked from the noisy throng but the kitchen was welcomingly cool and i put a hand to my face not sure what i was going to say as they followed me in clearly curious frustrated i turned my back on the small window over the sink okay what the hell is wrong with the turnblasted pizza jenks said an unsure green dust sifting from him like an underwater sunbeam im starving here i thought about what quen said and then how they trusted me not just to have their back but to not stab them in it either quen i started then threw my hands up my heart thudding he charmed it i dont want you coming with quen and me tonight either of you okay oh but elf boy out there is good enough huh jenks said his voice virulent he was dusting a silver green id never seen before and i came forward pleading with my eyes jenks we both know its too cold for you ivy as much as i want you there she shook her head feeling her throat as if remembering how easily newt had pinned her im not any help am i it really wasnt a question and i felt awful you are i pleaded just just not tonight she finished its okay she said around a sigh her gaze distant as if looking at the future i couldnt tell if she saw me there or not its not okay i said softly it stinks jenks was dusting a sour green in the corner as far from me as he could get he looked capable and ready but i knew he would freeze tonight and so did he this isnt what i wanted i whispered and his dust flashed silver even as he refused to look at me but this is where you are ivy said and my shoulders eased go with quen ill watch nick all of us will she said her voice hard with warning and jenks clattered his wings at her hell be here when you get back dead or alive i was smiling though something was dying in me you guys are too good to me only because you made me so ivy said her eyes glinting with unshed tears the weirdest feeling of anticipation filled me seeing them both there in my kitchen willing to let me go knowing that i could do this and trusting me oh my god i said eyes swimming you are going to make me cry i sniffed then moved about the kitchen gathering everything up that i wanted to takemagnetic chalk pain charmsit wasnt much and i stifled a swift pang of worry i snatched my cell phone at the last moment tucking it in a back pocket after making sure it was on vibrate ivy quen shouted from the living room get back out here and watch nick or im going to kill him myself i smiled giving ivy a hug as jenks hovered over both of us when i get back we are all going to go out and do some serious vigilante work ivy quen bellowed im counting to three he couldnt leave nick and he didnt want to trust himself to bring him back to the kitchen thanks for everything i said and ivy touched my arm before she turned and left the room my smile slowly faded as i looked at jenks who was dripping an angry dust it still felt like goodbye but that was okay now see you at sunrise he said then turned almost flying into quen the elf irate stomping into the kitchen the two of us alone quen stared at me and i shrugged im not going to lie to them i said and his eyes narrowed theyll follow us he started and i shook my head not looking down the hallway to the bright sanctuary as i patted my pocket to be sure i had the rings and went into the back living room for my coat hesitating until i remembered i had left it on the porch to air out no they wont i said over my shoulder feeling almost relaxed ivy and jenks would wait for me i wasnt losing them at all youre just mad that you dont have an excuse to do your charm a little yes he complained as he followed me out did something happen to the sanctity of your church again my eye twitched newt broke it so she could look in my closet again oh the night air was almost a slap as i opened the door the soft breathing of the wind taking me by surprise my coat was frigid as i jammed my arms into the sleeves and quen watched as i shoved everything but my chalk into a pocket no splat gun snapping the chalk in two i wedged a piece into each boot he can burst the charms in the hopper and put me out in three seconds i said having downed lee that way oncebefore we had come to an understanding its your elven charms that are going to hold him sweetheart you up to it sweetheart he muttered and i turned to the graveyard with its glowing gargoyle eyes feeling good for some reason i started down the stairs boots clumping until i realized he wasnt following me i frowned when he took a small hourglassshaped charm from his pocket and hung it on the nail the christmas wreath had rested on it was the first level of protection every home be it inderland or human had but we didnt have one up right now hey i exclaimed when he pulled the pin from the intricately detailed charm made to look like a wineglass pouring into another and a shimmering wave of gold and black rose great leathery wings opened in the graveyard and i shivered thinking that it was like the demons of hell had come to life and were here to drag me to eternal torture for betraying my friends you didnt lie to them quen said as i fumed im not going to risk nick escaping my protest faded and i almost fell off the step trying to see up to the top of the churchwide spell how long i said my face cold and he took my arm and turned me around sunup now im doing this to save trent youre doing this to save the world yes sunup if i didnt have this done by then it wouldnt matter nervous i stuck out my hand wishing i had my other coat this one completely ruined the sophisticated air id been going for but it was hard to sling spells when your muscles were stiff with cold deal we shook and then together we went down the stairs to go around the front for his car a hulking shape waited just inside the gate and i gasped almost running into a gargoyle etude i said flushing it was obvious we had spelled the church and you wonder why i refused to rest on your church the gargoyle said his voice incredibly low but holding a hint of amusement ah i stammered we ah need to get to loveland castle i said looking behind him at the rows of red and yellow eyes are we too heavy for you by chance etude grinned and i shivered at the long black canines no i dont think you are chapter twentysix if a horse could jump and never land it might come close to the feeling of flying atop a gargoyle my knees hitched over the base of etudes wings and i crouched low the wind beating at me so hard my eyes were mere slits glory sang through me the chill air streaming through my hair in a rushing sensation of silk it almost felt as if i had wings myself reading the air currents and leaning with etude to take advantage of the rising air above massive parking lots and the ribbon of the expressway we now flew over my stomach lurched as etude beat his wings in three quick successive beats and my legs tightened around him making him flick his ears back to ensure i was still seated firmly wed had some trouble gaining altitude without the usual drop from a church tower that gargoyles were used to but etude had managed closing my eyes i leaned forward until i was almost lying atop him the wind tearing over my back and my head surprisingly close to his ears etude banked suddenly and my arms sprang around his thick neck his entire body shook with laughter but i didnt care this was beyond description to fly between the dark earth and the black sky when the waning moon rose was surely the pinnacle of existence the power the strength the unsurpassed beauty if riding a horse was freedom this was heaven on earth if i survive this im going to mend belles wings i thought exhaling as etude shifted and we again came in line with the gargoyle who was carrying quen to have had this and lose it would break me fairies were made of sterner stuff than i still holding that thought in my mind i rested my head against etudes warm neck quen looked tense his brow furrowed as he sat almost upright against the wind atop the equally large gargoyle who had agreed to take him he was riding him like a horse probably with a much better seat than i had but creating far more drag quen smiled grimly as i caught his eye etudes ear flicked back changing the air currents racing over me and my grip loosened when the gargoyle leveled his flight i looked down to the ribbon of lights on the expressway traffic was heavy this time of night do you always follow the expressways i called out to etude his tufted ears turning to catch my words no he swiveled his head without changing his flight one red eye finding me his deep words seeming to reach me despite the wind ripping past us we fly as the arrow but im not sure where loveland castle is normally id follow the resonance of the line there but its so discordant right now its hard to locate i had one of the kids at the basilica look up directions online for me sorry i said then grimaced thinking i needed to stop saying that a lumpy shape loomed out of the thin moonlight and dark trees a ribbon of light trailing beside it where the river was there i said pointing and etude nodded his ears going flat to his skull when he shifted smoothly to put it directly ahead the second gargoyle grimaced looking pained as his wing beats became short and choppy i couldnt feel the line yet but clearly they could sorry i thought then quashed it the riverdamp air was cool and we lost altitude when we left the warm ribbon of the expressway we circled in the faint starlight the castle was dark and empty and the memory of burning into reality here burst against my thoughts with a hint of easily mastered panic id been trying to keep al from abducting a coven member that hadnt turned out so well either circle once quen shouted letting go of the gargoyles shoulder long enough to make a circular motion with his finger ill see if theres any magic down there apart from the line guilt hit me square on and i looked down with my second sight sure quen had a stake in this but he also had a little girl and a dead love to revenge i added resolving to let it go it would be my strength and his skill that would win or lose it my skin prickled at a wave of wild magic and etude shuddered his skin rippling to make me clutch at him were clear quen shouted over the wind theres no one down there the gargoyles shifted their wings simultaneously their quick descent making my eyes widen my arms went around etudes neck and i tried to make his center of gravity as near to normal as possible his balance shifted and i gasped as his wings made several strong back beats and he landed quen touched the ground an instant later we were right on the gravelly garden path or at least i was quen was about three feet up past the retaining wall on the upper garden level that line is ungodly awful etude said as i slid off his back my knees rubbery the air felt very still after the chill wind of flight and i followed etudes pained gaze to my line that purple sludge was still there almost glowing in the dark thank you for getting us here i said wiggling my toes to make sure i hadnt lost my magnetic chalk quens gargoyle looking beaten was shifting awkwardly from foot to foot his ears pinned back and his tail wrapped around his feet etude was handling it better but clearly was still uncomfortable im going to fix the lines as soon as i can i said and etudes ears pricked an odd rumbling snuffling coming from him i hoped it was laughter my knees were still shaking and i carefully worked the cramps out go i said smiling at him both of you and tell those back at the church they might want to leave im going to dump all the imbalance there in a few minutes etude leaned toward his friend low elephant rumbles coming from them then the gargoyle who had brought quen nodded and with a powerful thrust of his back legs he pushed off and found the air under his wings etude though remained im staying he said his red eyes narrowing as he looked at the line i want to help my son wincing he turned to me i might wait at the castle though until needed burn my scrollwork that line is awful i gave his thick huge hand a squeeze of thanks my guilt over having lost bis grew but etude only smiled a blacktoothed grin at me haunches bunching as he made the short flight to land atop the highest point his wings curving in around him until he looked like a natural part of the roof that is until his eyes caught the faint starlight and glowed a savage blood red wild wisps of hair had escaped my braid and i smoothed them as quen jumped to my level his shoes scuffing the gravel my knees were still shaky but i didnt think it was because of the flight here anymore elven magic was our best bet to keep kusox off us i felt like a battery and i didnt like it ready i said as i brought out the rings its making my wisdom teeth vibrate quen said as he eyed the line his wince hard to see in the shadowlight but he turned to me when the rings clinked and suddenly the confidence id felt in the church vanished it was more than the fear of kusox it was the fear of letting quen use me like a familiar perhaps he said slowly seeing my reluctance and i took a fast breath shoving the smaller worn and dented ring on my finger i felt nothing from it and breath held i extended the ring to him i trusted quen if he betrayed me al would kill him thank you quen for standing with me i said and then sucked in my breath as he put the ring on his finger and everything changed oh god i whimpered knees giving way and quen reached for me i jerked out of his reach stumbling several steps away as i found my balance by myself his hand touched my shoulder and i lashed out driving him away just give me a second i shouted panicked but determined to make this work my breathing came in short pants as i heard him back up and only then could i straighten out of my crouch just give me a second i said again still not able to look at him he was there in my thoughts and not in a good way i could sense nothing of his emotions just a theoretical fingertip on my chi ready to rip what he wanted from it and i couldnt stop him it wasnt like als rings at all where both parties had equal access these were slavers and i swallowed hard trying to get used to it the ring around my finger glinted al had endured this for how long slowly i straightened are you okay my stomach hurt nodding i looked up to the dark skies lets do it trent was right about you quen said clearly uncomfortable as our strengths became one and our will his alone you are strong swell eyes down i wavered my heart seeming to stutter wanting to see the line better i opened my second sight quens aura shimmered becoming oppressively clear that is incredible quen said as he reached for the retaining wall a haunted look in his eyes i wasnt feeling so good though and either seeing my fear in my face or reading it in his mind quen pushed from the wall are you sure youre okay he asked his hand gripping my arms to steady me in the dark it was getting easier to tolerate his touch and i nodded head still down yes i said spinning the ring on my finger to try to make it feel right i cant feel the line is there any way you can ease up on your grip ah sorry hows that he said and i blinked as suddenly the discordant jangle of a hundred imbalances in the line hit me thats better i said wincing now i could really see the purple line was extruding a bonechilling cold even as the event horizon pulled in energy the atoms and molecules screaming as they were ripped apart even the purple of kusoxs aura shredded to a pale red under its influence turning i looked up at the castle ready i shouted and got a raised wingtip and a rumble in return i think thats a yes i muttered placing my feet and facing the line squarely if this doesnt get kusoxs attention i dont know what will i winced one eye screwed shut as i pulled the line into my awareness fully and blocked everything else out the multitude of the imbalances screamed at me and i tried to gather them up but they slipped through my thoughts like butterflies its not working i said eyes opening up to find quen hovering close and worried ah it might be because of the rings he said were linked and im not doing anything i know the general idea but oh feeling foolish i faced him then awkwardly reached out and took his hand his fingers in mine felt funny but as i held on a warm feeling suffused me as his awareness surrounded mine he didnt mean to be domineering but he hadnt had much practice sharing his breath quickened as he tapped into the line and together we hesitated taking in the discordant jangle bubble the line i thought getting no response then becoming concerned when i wasnt able to do it myself either he had a wall up or the rings only worked one way quen can you lighten up im having a hard time holding on to anything i said spinning the ring on my finger there was a little notch in the metal if i hooked my thumbnail in it just right i could spin it almost entirely around my finger and catch it again horrified i stopped somehow knowing that i wasnt the first to spin it like that around and around his fingers spasmed in mine my apologies try again as fast as that a sensation of the line spiraled through me heady and strong i snatched at it pulling it to me the howling of the imbalance scraped across my nerves and realizing just how much quen had been shielding me from it i gritted my teeth and sifted through the noise to find a bright gold thread in my minds eye a tinge of smut making it almost bearable this was my original imbalance and gathering everything up but that i tuned my aura surrounding it to the imbalance in newts line in my garden sweet mother of god quen exclaimed as the ache in the line and in my head evaporated i jumped startled as the bubble of imbalance suddenly vanished i felt a pull and i dug my awareness into the present to keep us from sliding to join it there was a sliding ping and then nothing the event horizon was gone we did it i exclaimed the pure tone of my line singing through me like icing i was almost dancing quen we did it i shouted again and quen let go of my hand beaming before us the purple sludge was gone from the line it was humming in tune with realityapart from the original imbalance that is the wind from etudes wings sent my hair flying as he landed behind us on the upraised half of the garden the imbalance is at the small line in the churchyard he said his deep voice rumbling and his ears slanted parallel with the ground to look like a peeved horse i can feel it there but only because i know where to look my elation vanished we had done it but it was only half over and the gargoyles were suffering they were suffering as i reveled in our accomplishments kusox is going to be pissed thats not the half of it kusoxs voice said and i spun behind me etude began to hiss sounding like a train making long powerful huffs quen stiffened stepping before me congratulations the demon drawled taking in my pale clothes and quens black attire now youre dead down i cried pulling on the clean purity of the line before me kusoxs black spell raced toward us shedding silver sparkles the line in my mental grip slipped through my fingers like silk and i scrambled for it my mouth gaping i could do nothing what in hell quens circle saved us and both of us fell to our knees as kusoxs spell imploded on its surface lighting the area in a flash of lightning the line i thought unable to find it in my lightstunned vision and then my panic turned to anger it was quen quit hogging the line i shouted ignoring quens offered hand as he tried to help me up etude had jumped between us and kusox stalking back and forth with his wings half open he looked far more menacing than when bis did it kusox hesitated his features pressed as he reassessed everything while i got to my feet quen stood staunchly beside me tall and unbowed and smelling of crushed grass and wine an unbound gargoyle kusox said the disgust in his voice obvious as he watched etude what do you hope to accomplish there you kidnapped his son i said then elbowed quen in the ribs the line had gone slippery let go of the line damn it i muttered then i filled my chi when he did we need to work on this sharing thing i said and he grimaced i dared a look at the line humming clean behind kusox your sludge is out of the line i said boldly it was your aura signature on the curse that broke it give me bis and trent and i might not press charges kusox smiled and i couldnt help my shiver in a moment he said smile fading as etude paced between us it looks clean and i dont sense any trickery what have you done rachel you cant have fixed it you moved it but where curious i stiffened as he looked to the sky then took one sharply angled step sideways into my line like it was a river you lose i shouted adrenaline pouring into me and quen caught my shoulder to keep me from striding forward im calling dali your ass is mine and you will admit you broke it i dont think so kusox was in the line tasting it almost making sure it was truly clean it was i could guarantee it your aura signature is at the bottom of that sludge line i asserted and kusox laughed perhaps but i dont see a sludge line thats because i got rid of it i shouted and then i fell back my folly falling on me id moved all the imbalance yes and his curse with it until i got all the imbalances where they belonged no one would be able to see his curse damn it couldnt i catch a single turnblessed break tell me how you did it kusox said seeming to be genuinely curious you couldnt have destroyed it you put it somewhere holding it in your chi perhaps is that why you stole a pair of elven rings he simpered at quen needed some help holding that much slop my head hurt and i lifted my chin i didnt think he knew which rings we had or he would be more aggressive that i hadnt proved he was responsible for the event horizon was infuriating but if we couldnt prove we were stronger than him it wouldnt matter cowards why am i helping them i wonder kusox said standing in my line and soaking it in bathing in energy can you defend yourself while hiding all that imbalance etudes ears pricked in alarm and i stiffened imagining a circle around quen and me kusox shifted and my eyes widened i reached for the ley line shouting rhombus only to fall to a knee fumbling for the line running through my fingers like sand quen pushed out and i ducked as the sparkles of his thrown energy lit the dark i could feel the line flowing through me running into him i was adding to quens defense but i might as well have been a cat with the help i was being etude roared his hands grasping as he lunged at kusox no i cried out but kusox shouted a satisfiedsounding word and etude was flung back flipping head over tail headed for us rachel quen cried jerking me out of the way as etude crashed into the retaining wall rocks and dirt sifted down over him i shook off quens hand and ran to him brushing the dirt from his huge pushedin face the gargoyle was breathing but out cold quen i stammered looking up at him his lips were pressed together hard but his anger wasnt at me as he helped me up i didnt think it was directed at kusox either who was advancing slowly we were up shit creek and i didnt even see the if that got us there the rings were not working well quen was way outclassed youre not holding the imbalance kusox said curious now it was the only thing keeping him from hammering us into the ground who is is it newt i am wearing a slave ring echoed in my head and i looked at my hand in horror what have i done to myself no not newt kusox mocked misunderstanding the look of terror i knew i was now wearing youre all alone at last rachel it took me longer than i thought to get you isolated everyone likes you i am wearing a slave ring kusox threw something at us and quen knocked it away i hid behind him unable to think to comprehend i had to get this thing off shes not alone quen said and kusox laughed you kusox stopped eight feet back not trusting my fear i think you dont count he said lightly looking at his nails theyre letting us fight it out even if they do like her best isnt that nice they want the strongest parent possible for the next generation he smoothed his clothes in satisfaction that would be me letting us fight it out yeah that sounded about right we were making enough noise in the ley lines to pique the interest of the most sedentary demon and the chicken squirts hadnt shown up yet that didnt bother me as much as the fact that i couldnt get the ring off my pinkie scared i leaned to quens ear i want the ring off i know you cant tap a line worth the salt in your veins im sorry he said and then i cowered as i felt a huge tug on me and quens bubble flashed into existence glittering a fabulous green before it faded if we take them off now we will die the only reason my circle is holding him is because its made with both our strengths crap on toast he was right and i stood beside him not knowing what i could do to make this better i knew the demons were watching why didnt they help us youre insane i shouted knowing they were listening besides etude was stirring and i didnt want him taken out before he recovered my state of mind is not the issue here kusox shouted his face red even in the faint light it is about strength its about adaptability and resources and all you are is psychotic you cant fix psychotic i yelled back as etude staggered to his feet a low rumble of his anger flowing about me as his wings opened and funneled the sound forward his growl resonated through me and i swallowed hard with a crack of stone etude pulled a chunk of wall away and threw it over our heads kusox swore deflecting it to thud into the thick grass quen take my ring off i exclaimed tugging at quens coat as i felt a huge pull through me it was quen prepping a spell and i let it flow knowing i could do nothing wearing this stupid band of silver looking magnificent quen threw a ball of blackhazed energy at kusox the harried demon deflected it within a breath of contact and it went whizzing into the river lighting the bottom of the trees in an eerie glow etude was tossing great clods of earth at kusox darting from the ground to the air to make a difficult target quen i shouted as the man ran for kusox his fist swollen with a green haze no i shouted as etude and quen descended upon kusox together etudes rock fell harmlessly to the side as kusox sidestepped it but quens blow landed the mans fist plowing into kusoxs face to make the demon scream and fall back teeth clenched i lunged forward to pull quen away before kusox could retaliate fire licked the soles of my feet as we ran and we were both picked up and flung into the grass the distance muting kusoxs last curse my face planted into the clover and i sat up fast spitting dirt nearby etude was shaking his head a tear in one wing bleeding slowly beside me quen slowly sat up his hand touching his lip damn quen licked his bleeding lip almost smiling as he looked back at kusox lost under a thick black sheet of everafter think he gave up no hes turning into a bird to eat us i shoved my hand into quens face take the ring off take it off now quens face was guilty i cant he said flatly as he got up the hell you cant i tugged him around to look at me i cant tap a line worth crap you admitted it yourself and i cant get the ring off oh god had al been right i told you the only reason we are doing so well is because of your strength and my skill if i take it off your strength wont keep us alive maybe you didnt notice i said pointing to the cocoon kusox was in but were not doing so hot right now quens jaw clenched the misshapen form inside was growing larger and like watching a chick develop i saw kusoxs legs thin and lengthen his arms grow into wings his head mutate until a wicked long beak formed etude go i shouted waving him off as kusox punched through the shell of everafter screaming a harsh ugly call that echoed against the trees hes going to eat you i exclaimed heartsick when the gargoyle beat heavily into the air his silhouette a darker blackness against the night sky kusox was already his size and still growing my god trent was right quen said in awe and i rounded on him yeah hes a big badass stork that eats people quen we have a problem awestruck quen watched kusox flap his wings and croak daring etude to attack we can circle him nows our chance circle him it wont stand i started and quens attention came back to me it will if we work together i could not believe this we tried that i said hunching when the breeze from kusoxs wings flattened my hair i want the ring off and i want it off now i reached for his hand to take his ring and use it to take mine off and quen jerked away from me shocked i stared three feet between us no not quen above us etude and kusox met in a clash of talons and wings jerking i watched as etude tried to bite the back of kusoxs neck and they fell wings beating madly descending slowly they crashed into the trees at the far end of the clearing they were down my heart was pounding as i looked at quen hand extended give me your ring taking my shoulders he spun me around to the fight we can do this distrust blossomed in me do this and i give you your freedom id seen that in the history books before kusox screamed his black shadow rising up from the trees etude was bellowing from the woods so he was still alive kusox was coming right for us his wings making the air shake and yet quen still stood a green haze about his closed fist get down i shouted ducking to crouch next to the retaining wall as kusox swooped over us his huge claws reaching the memory of seeing pixies slip down his throat rose up and i cowered the wall pressing into me fire lanced my shoulder and i screamed immuluate quen shouted and i choked as the line raced through me making the new rip in my shoulder burn like lava and then kusox was gone swinging around for another strike hand clasped to my shoulder i stood watching his dark shape against the sky he was playing with us rachel are you okay i looked at quen sourly as his enthusiasm paled it was all i could do to not yell at him that no i was not okay fine i said pushing at the edges of the cut and seeing very little blood maybe youre right quen said as we watched kusox turn and come back like a deadly pendulum and then he brightened the line he said suddenly you can jump them at least to the one in the garden you can jump us both my eyebrows rose you want me to jump a line carrying you thats what got us into this in the first place down quen said his hand on my shoulder and we flattened as kusox buzzed us again i think he was enjoying himself but he wheeled sharply landing twenty feet away wings outstretched and bill snapping loudly you can do it quen said if were sharing mental space you can carry me you know the signature you just dumped the imbalance there even if kusox follows us the gargoyles will help perhaps long enough for me to sit on him and make him take the slaver ring off beyond him kusox snapped his beak and strode forward i noddedburning to death in the lines was better than being eaten keep him off us i said as he took my hands and nodded and try not to hog the line i shouted feeling it strengthen around me kusox hesitated head cocked as i tapped the line and my hair started to float letting out a murderous caw he began to run guessing our intent now quen shouted and i bubbled us shifting the hue and sound of it to that of the line ten feet away i knew it by heart now and it was easy i heard kusox scream in defeat as the beauty of the line took us and the swirling warmth of the line washed the ugliness of the grove away everything went silver in my mind quen snapped a bubble around his thoughts making me wonder how often hed traveled the lines before home i thought recalling the harsh jangle of the chaos id made of the line in the garden it was a mass of orange blue black and red and though i could see it in my mind i couldnt shift the resonance home i thought again starting to panic the damn slavery ring was interfering quen help me tune the bubble to match my aura i cried out but he couldnt hear me and i couldnt leave him there quen i tried again and a coolwarm thought slid into mine with the bright sparkle of butterfly wings got you came biss cheerful thought and with a shimmer quens and my auras flashed to a strident purple i was real stumbling i sucked in a huge gulp of air shocked when my boots skittered across electriclightlit tile not the starlit red slab of cement i was aiming for i looked up hearing a groan as quen hit the floor behind me a second later my face became cold and trent turned his rolling chair making a clicking sound as he cocked his head at my battledirty clothes and tangled hair this isnt my garden i whispered and trents smile chilled me to my core chapter twentyseven trent stood a hard eagerness obvious on his blondstubbled tiredlooking face fear slid through me and i hid my hand with the ring behind me quen could give him the master ring and with it me trent would be the most powerful elf in generations he could save his people why would he ever take it off i didnt expect you until tomorrow trent said as he swooped to us his lab coat billowing behind him the deadline was moved quen said sahan you were right this isnt working obviously if it was you wouldnt be here he was reaching for me and i pulled away standing before he could help me i got you bis almost sang and my heart sank we had left etude alone with that monster i snagged you right out of the line he crowed his wings spread and his red eyes sparkling in the fluorescent light im goood im goood im so bad im goood he sang doing one of jenkss hip wiggles his tail curved over his head and wings spread wide i had just left etude there and i fought with the desire to go back beyond the thick plate glass the babies slept the light dim and making the glass somewhat reflective trent was gesturing sharply as he and quen talked in hushed whispers and i didnt like the chagrined expression that quen was now wearing al was right i was a fool my hands were shaking and i leaned against a counter wondering if i was going to throw up kusox would figure out where wed gone eventually the slaver glinted on my finger and i wanted it off thanks bis i said when the adolescent gargoyle finished his welldeserved happy dance and dropped to the counter his claws scraping his smile was wide and i didnt know how i was going to tell him about his dad taking a breath i whispered your dad is a wonder biss ears pricked and the hair on the end of his tail stood straight up you saw him i nodded he came to the church then helped keep kusox off us at the castle we left him there but kusox was after us not him i think hell be okay god please let him be okay a baby was crying and i turned to the nursery windows the woman was furtively weaving her way to the cradleas if shed be punished bis start jumping the babies and women out of here i was down to salvage but i knew getting their children back would mean the end of a nightmare for a handful of families at least until their children started doing demon magic hosts to kusoxs favorites bis took to the air in little hops you bet where do you want them trents place i was going to say the church but if bis knew the line in trents office my office trent exclaimed and i pushed myself up from the counter angry his hands were in the pockets of his lab coat quens were behind his back i didnt know who had the ring and suddenly it was really important the churchs garden is full of pained gargoyles right now i said as bis crawled on the ceiling into the nursery oh god what if kusox was there now looking for us i want the ring off and i want it off now neither one of them said anything and i stiffened did you hear me yes of course trent said but neither one of them was moving can it wait until we get out of here apparently you and quen working together is the only way you survived this long it would be foolish to halve our strength until we are sure we can afford it survived i blurted thats the word for it this isnt working we need to go trent jerked into motion rolling his chair across the lab to a bank of cabinets maybe i should just cut my finger off i didnt really need ten fingers did i trent got along okay with less than that im not leaving until the infants are gone trent said rummaging in a drawer and until they are the rings stay on his gaze went to the blood seeping from the scratch kusox had given me and i tugged the torn fabric to cover it i glared at quen feeling betrayed soon as theyre out of here the ring comes off but neither one of them said anything and i headed for trent hands clenched and then it comes off i said again i am not going to be your battery to try to kill kusox understand yes of course glancing at bis trent stood his hands full of bandages and ointment hed taken from the drawer sit youre injured my arm is fine i said glancing behind me to see only seven then six babies left trent had dropped his head and then it hit me i wasnt the only slave here how much can you do i asked trent and his lips twitched i mean are you like his slave slave or do you still have free will trent glanced at quen ah as long as kusox isnt paying me any attention i have my will and when he makes one mistake hes going to die he was looking at my hand and suddenly my warning flags tripped ashen i hid my hands and looked between quen and trent there hadnt been enough time in that hushed conversation for quen to bring trent all the way up to speed you knew i reinvoked the slavers i said and trent seemed to freeze how did you have quen pull riffletics rings to force me to reinvoke these slave rings so you could use me to kill kusox quens eye twitched and trent reached for me no well fight maybe he said his eyes pleading youve got it backward but theyre the only way to even hope to make a strong enough bond between demon and elf i was afraid if i told you you would have said no i put this on because i trusted you and you forced this decision on me i jerked away from quen my hand was in a fist slaver gold glinting between my knuckles you tricky little bastards what have you done i thought glaring at quen then shifted my eyes to the glass behind him it was shining with a red rosy glow suddenly the room flashed white a muffled explosion making the glass tremble i gasped falling to my knees when it cracked trent went for the floor as quen spun a boom of sound shook the air and the glass shattered inward quen was flung back arms flailing as he hit the tile a second before the safety glass pattered down on him crouched and head covered i was struck by shards babies were crying at least three maybe more where are you taking them you little swamp rat kusox shouted and i felt a tug as bis popped another baby to safety kusox didnt know quen and i were here and my heart pounded shit who had the ring trent or quen kusox owned trent would he own me by default too quen shifted and glass slid from him the faint tinkling went unnoticed as kusox shouted at bis thumps and pops were coming in through the broken window and i peeked over the shattered edge of the window frame bis was swooping madly his face alight and his sparse hair bristled he was enjoying himself but i was scared to death for him hey i shouted standing up and kusox spun the demon actually looking surprised for oneblessedmoment black teeth showing in a grin bis used the distraction to pop another baby to safety kusox glanced at the gargoyle then back to me looking grim he walked toward us snatching a wailing infant from his crib by his leg his blue blanket falling to the floor i dont know if you are incredibly stupid or incredibly clever he said carelessly dangling the screaming baby upside down are you seeking a way to implicate me in your foolhardy attempt to destroy the everafter or just really really stupid id go for incredibly clever i said then yanked on the line as his free hand clenched turning a violent black before he threw a curse at me now trent shouted and i felt a twin tug on the line as both quen and trent threw up a bubble kusoxs energy tore through both of them bouncing off my smaller bubble black and gold shimmered like oil as kusoxs magic slammed into mine i gasped when my hold on the line faltered then held firm kusoxs magic hung stuck as it tried to burn through and i panicked not knowing what to do it was bettermy hold on the line was firm i didnt think anyone was wearing the ring i could do this i could fight back eram pere i shouted exploding my bubble out it took kusoxs magic with it slamming it into the ceiling to rain down like evil pixy dust trent tripped on something and went down hand reaching for a counter bis i shouted as the gargoyle darted to the last screaming infant as kusox ducked we have to go trent pulled himself up tall and proud digitorum percussion he intoned the heavy black in his hand growing darker his golden aura racing over it to make it glow my eyes widened as he pulled back aiming for kusox i could feel him pull on the line he was so desperate but he was aiming for kusox my god the baby trent no i cried and i lunged for him quens foot tripped me and i plowed into trent grabbing him about the knees instead of his middle where id intended we went down my teeth clenching as we hit the floor trent cried out in anger as his magic went wild slipping from his hand to roll into a bank of machines i ducked as it hit sparks flying as machinery suddenly vanished replaced by the smell of ozone and twisted metal shouting quen launched himself at kusox the two of them went down in a tangle of arms and billowing fabric twin bursts of auratinted magic flared and then quen was flung back sliding to a halt against the machines his expression showing his pain and one hand clenched into a fist against his chest what are you doing trent shouted at me pushing me off him as he stood and i backed up onto my knees before spinning to face kusox you might hurt the baby i yelled back at him hunched and ready for the next attack that child is already dead trent shouted furious put the baby down i exclaimed at kusox moving to stand between him and everyone behind me i didnt know how i was going to stop him but i was having a much easier time now that i was a slave with no master can i trust him asked a small voice inside me and i ached at the coming betrayal this child kusox said swinging the screaming baby like pendulum tossing him into the air to land in his arms behind him bis tensed too far away to snatch him to safety his eyes went behind me dolore adficere kusox whispered his fingers moving i tensed but all kusox did was smile as the child in his arms wailed even louder hardly able to breathe fire suddenly erupted against my back thoughtstealing pain radiating out from my spine i couldnt breathe and i collapsed to the floor my fingers scrabbling behind me to find what it was the heat spread to my hands and i cried out pulling them to my front to see that they were covered in a burning goldenhued auraburning me from the outside in kusoxs curse had come from trent valeo i gasped to counter it flooding my mind with a numbing cold sucking in the air as i heard kusox laugh and the baby scream his shoes were crunching on glass and fear gave me the strength to force my head up seeing him past my strands of hair heart pounding i scuttled backward quen was struggling to stop trent trent had hit me he had cursed me but by his frustrated pained expression he hadnt done it by choice my god kusox was nuts he was laughing knowing full well id rip his head off if i could but maybe he knew id never get even half a chance this is not me trent shouted his face creased and sweat darkening his hair as he shoved quen off him its not me he said again grunting with the effort to keep his hand from rising his eyes widened in a sudden fear flee rachel sahan quen cried out ducking behind a bubble when trent threw another spell it was aimed at me and i threw up a circle but my reaction was too slow and it tore through it the spell hitting me square on before my barrier could fully form pain crawled over me like ants skittering from my chest and working its way through me and i screamed if it reached my mind i was dead valeo i sobbed again curled on the floor within my bubble shaking as the pinpricks faded and died interesting kusox said that baby still wailing in his arms as he sat on the broken window frame and crossed his ankles to watch do that one again i want to know if she can do it any faster damn it all to hell i shouted at trent as i looked up seeing kusoxs frown he was not entirely pleased that i could counter that one you do that again and ill smack you i said to trent as i trembled with adrenaline i cant help it he rasped through gritted teeth and then he dropped to one knee groaning as he fought whatever kusox was making him do next yeah well sorry then i said gathering my will alta quies simillima mort i shouted flinging half of the curse at trent holding the rest in my palm burning the curse tore through my bubble absorbing it and pulling it over and around me like a dirty shirt it smacked into trent and the man went down his neck nothing but cords of muscle he gave one spasm then lay still his chest rising and falling peacefully you struck him quen said clearly shocked he hit me first i said then flicked the rest of the charm at kusox the demon deflected it with a hasty pop i knew it wouldnt land but at least he had stopped laughing trent lay unconscious it wouldnt last long and i got up hurting tired and pissed flee trent had said it sounded like a good idea if bis could snatch us from a ley line then he could by god jump us out as he had the babies rachel bis said looking scared as he landed beside me on the rolling chair hes got the only baby left ill get him i said as i stood up and tugged my shirt straight get quen and trent out of here catch me when i jump if trent wasnt here then he couldnt try to kill kusox using me to do it no quen said arm up to fend bis off and then they were gone i took a deep breath glad quen was safe if bis didnt come back for trent or me then id die happy ray would not grow up without her father give me that baby i said shaking as i listed to one side and kusox took his pinkie from the now quiet child charmed to sleep with a curse one step closer and i squeeze he said smiling down at the sleeping infant i froze as trent stirred behind him you want me not him kusox raised an eyebrow offering to take his place but i already have you come sunup i will be pleading to the collective to spare your life and they will give you to me because otherwise ill kill them all and they know it not unless i kill you first maybe trent had the right idea after all bis popped into existence right on top of trent and i jerked you will regret this little rat kusox shouted and i flung up a bubble around them as bis popped trent out kusoxs magic winged into the nursery quiet and empty enough kusox shouted throwing the baby from him as if the infant were trash no i shoved myself into motion arms outstretched as the baby screamed in fear i hit the floor front first eyes closed from the impact and stretching forward my hands were empty an awful thump echoed through me and i curled up in heartache i had jumped too short i had missed knowing what id find i opened my eyes tears blinding me as i gathered up the silent limp baby and stood my knees shaking in anger you will behave rachel or you learn obedience from the back of my hand kusox seethed the baby was dead and i held him rocking him and aching inside now youve done it i said voice low and threatening trent had been right the baby had been dead the moment nick had stolen him you will account for yourself i intoned shaking as i felt a tweak on my thoughts who will force me you kusox snarled his hand reaching for me hazed with power dripping to hiss on the floor the lines echoed in my head as bis landed on my shoulder and i gasped when their jagged existence flooded my mind no kusox screamed but it was too late and i sobbed as the line took me the harsh caw of the demon replaced with the howling discord of the broken lines i deserved the ragged edges cutting at my soul it was only because of the baby that i bubbled my thoughts against their burning haze as i wept chapter twentyeight rachel i thought it odd that a kid who had skin as hard as stone had thoughts as soft as silk and they slid into mine without resistance depressed i gathered my awareness not wanting bis to know how broken i felt listening to the line screaming around us with a curious detachment rachel can you bubble this resonance for me he said meekly and i let him further into my mind aching as the line seemed to burn and shift to a harsh orangegreen glitter with sparkles if we can set this song in the line were going to then it wont hurt so bad bis was in pain and that galvanized me sealing my heartache behind a thick wall i sent my thoughts deeper into the chaos of the everafter finding the resonance he colored for me and bubbling it shift us to this bis prompted showing me a shimmery gray and green mentally rocking myself i did a ping of rightness went through me it was as if a tiny wail softly subsided finding peace in the storm streaming around me hesitating in my misery i caught back a sob remembering the baby in my arms bis biss emotion next to mine was clearer and he sighed thank you it will be easier to jump now he hesitated then added sorry about the headache headache i questioned him then suddenly found myself struggling for air wed been in the line too long and i clawed for a way out there was a pop and a push and i stumbled taking a huge gasp of air as i found myself in reality the screaming of the line replaced by the crying of a handful of angry babies sure enough my head was throbbing and i looked down at the little boy in my arms my hope crushed when i found him silent and pale he was so perfect but no longer really here i looked up feeling nauseated as i tried to take in more air than i possibly could we were in trents office and i stumbled out of the line staggering to fall into one of the chairs before the desk from behind his desk trent watched me as he dodged the cotton ball of antiseptic quen was trying to dab on a scrape across trents forehead an office girl i didnt recognize went from baby to baby assessing and giving instructions to a few people clearly office personnel drafted into nursemaid duty one by one the babies were being taken out thank you bis i said when he hopped to perch on the back of the chair behind me your dad will be so proud of you so thin a line between alive and not how could i have just left etude there the wood creaked as bis shifted his grip im sorry he said meaning the baby still in my arms and i closed my eyes feeling the tears begin to slip down it was quen who came forward kneeling beside me as he took in the little boys silence and pallor rachel i blinked fast eyes opening at his light touch on my arm he threw him to the ground i said the room suddenly silent as the last of the babies were taken out and the door shut i tried to get there but i was too far away and i couldnt say the rest my head pounding as i held someone elses child and grieved rocking back and forth quens touch on my shoulder was light almost not there give him to me why i raged suddenly and his expression shifted to one of pity let me take him he said reaching carefully to make sure his head wouldnt loll give him to me please rachel crying i let quen take him moving painfully he got to his feet and carefully passed the baby to another secretary someone handed me a box of tissues and i snatched it feeling like a wimp i should be stronger i didnt know that little boy but he had been important and now he was gonesomeones child who had been lost found and lost again quen stood beside me as i sat in that chair and cried as the room slowly became quiet i know youre hurting but thank you for bringing trent home wiping my eyes i looked up sealing the pain away for later if i survived this i couldnt tell what trent was thinking that i should be stronger maybe i hated it when he was right how long until he finds us i asked bis and he shrugged wingtips touching above his head soon quen glanced at trent as if he needed his permission bis fixed the line and when kusox finishes his tantrum and realizes it he will come investigate sorry bis grumbled and i reached to touch his foot in reassurance getting a flash of the jangle of lines the line hurt and now it doesnt bis tells me that his family kept kusox from damaging the church but the spell i put on it is gone quen added and nick ivy and jenks are fine i shrugged not caringabout nick not ivy and jenks the fact that the gargoyles had fought to protect those i loved was more than i could ever repay we should leave trent said standing up behind his desk and taking his lab coat off where to sahan quen said and i did nothing staring at nothing as trent began to pace behind him his fish swam in a smaller tank and i watched them listlessly i wasnt sure who had the master ring but i knew they wouldnt volunteer to take mine off until they felt safe and every time i asked and they said no i felt another part of me die there was no such thing as safe when kusox was dead when the demons were gone when the vampire threat was nulled not you just bis and i need to leave i said and trent spun on a heel to give me an incredulous look now i said lurching to my feet and sourly waving off quen when he tried to steady me his finger was bare if bis and i can fix another line it will give kusox somewhere else to look im coming with you trent was at his desk his motions quick as he jotted notes no youre not if i wasnt so angry about being tricked into reinvoking the slavers i would have laughed at the stupidity of the situation couldnt you be wrong at least once al youll curse me every time kusox shows up i cant stay here trent flexed his arm as if it was in pain as he paused in his writing besides it wasnt me who threw the curse at you it was kusox i sniffed pushing the edges of my torn shirt together well it was me who threw that curse at you do it again and ill knock you flat on your ass so hard you wont get up for a weekring or no ring trent jerked his eyes meeting mine from under his bangs about that oh god here it came the excuse for me to keep it on just for a little bit longer there was a soft knock and quen sprang forward to take the cart of water bottles an aide came in with we should keep him with us quen said as he took it and all but pushed the man back out otherwise kusox will keep using him against us i was suddenly a hundred times more thirsty keeping trent with bis and me would work as long as we stayed a step ahead of him but why risk it i dont remember including you on this private excursion quen i said as i strode to the cart and took a bottle damn elves thought they ruled the world i trusted you i thought angry as i cracked the seal on one of the waters downing half of it in one go it was perfectly chilled just enough to be cold but not enough to shock me slipping down smooth as if it were from the fountain of life wiping my mouth i looked at the label kalamack springs figures i trusted you i accused pointing with the halfempty bottle and guilt poured off quen adding to my anger i trusted both of you i shouted and trent came out from behind his desk you will not be mad at quen he said calmly jerking to a halt when i pointed at him to keep his distance this isnt his fault i told him to remove the riffletic rings so you would go for the slavers instead son of a bitch i whispered feeling the ring heavy on my finger this just keeps getting better and better it was the only way youd reinvoke them he said loudly rachel its my only chance of getting out from under kusoxs boot what so you can kill him i yelled and bis dug his claws deeper into the back of the chair clearly upset no his face scrunched up in embarrassment and he glanced from quen to me rachel the slavers work both ways confused i set the water bottle down excuse me quen cleared his throat his voice cutting off as trent raised his hand shut up quen he muttered shocking me i should have listened to my gut and included her in my decision from the first we tried it your way and it failed miserably she isnt a tool if she was it would have worked wwhat i stammered as he dug in his pocket and my pulse hammered as he jiggled what had to be the master ring im sorry rachel he said as he took my wrist lifting my hand to slide the master ring over the slaver i should have trusted you damn right you my voice cut off as the rings touched a wash of heat flooded through me and bis opened his wings and made an odd burble of sound clearly happy still holding my hand trent shifted his grip to become more gentle less possessive i looked at my hand seeing two rings on my finger i was hardly breathing when trent easily slid both the rings off id rather be your slave than kusoxs trent said and i wavered where i stood as he put both rings in my hand and curled my fingers over them shocked i looked up at him seeing in his downcast expression his regret his embarrassment and his anger at himself my distrust wavered threatening to break apart like fog under the heat of truth i needed to listen with my heart not my hurt feelings sahan quen pleaded and trent frowned as he turned away bis though beamed the tip of his tail quivering i was wrong trent said and a flash of righteous hurt lit through me damn right you were wrong i should have told you the rings felt warm in my hand and i clenched my fist tighter i know trent looked up leaning slightly to keep his weight off his one foot he looked tired fatigued and the barest hint of relief colored his eyes if i had a plan that included slavers i should have told you so you could have made a more informed decision as to which rings you were going to reinvoke there was a lump in my throat and i swallowed hard he was becoming what his people needed and i wasnt part of thatexcept perhaps at the fringes where a demon always was and i prompted voice shaking and im sorry he said the tiniest hint of pleading hidden behind his calm voice ringing through me ill do better next time next time he reached across the small space between us and as quen quietly voiced his protest with a dramatic sigh trent turned my fist over and opened it up his touch was warm on my wrist and then my palm as he nudged the smaller slave ring from the other and slipped it over his pinkie trent no i said reaching out but he hid his hand behind his back his eyes daring me to try to take it what are you doing determination tightened the corners of his mouth and he stood poised as if surprised that nothing had changed but then it wouldnt until someone claimed the master ring quens head was down and i wondered if this was trents perverted way of saying he was sorry that if i could take being a slave he could too we need to try it again trent said and i closed my hand when he reached for the master ring im not putting that thing on i said face hot as i backed away even if it is the dominant one its foul it needs to be destroyed i couldnt agree with you more trents confidence was a thin shadow he was scared i could see it and still he came forward and pulled my arm out from behind me but if you dominate me with the old very wild magic that you rekindled kusox cant force me to be his familiar quen dropped into a chair his head in his hands hesitating i squinted at trent gauging his resolve in the slant of his eyes my fingers twitched and i let him open my palm really i think so that was my first idea quen wanted to try it the other way first it was the only way he would arrange for riffletics rings to be pulled that was a bad idea that and not including you in myourdecision i shivered as he touched my shoulder his other hand still cradling mine with the ring was he serious or just trying to make me not so mad at him you are not a tool rachel ive never thought of you that way i broke eye contact staring at the ring instead you should have told me i said only realizing now that id forgiven him already i was so stupid but he was right al had said trent was the better match with trents help i could do this we could do this his hand fell from me and trent took the suit jacket that quen stoically handed him yes i know he said as he let it drop and took up the lab coat instead i felt bis move before he shifted a wing and i stood waiting when he made the short hop to me landing upon my shoulder his tail curving across my back and up under my arm it was a far more secure position than around my neck and i let the awful horror of the lines race through me there was a hint of purity in them and it gave me hope where to trent asked and i slipped the master ring onto my finger trents knees buckled and both quen and i reached for him my god trent gasped as he caught himself against the desk a hand to his forehead sorry i whispered trying to be as innocuous and undemanding as i could biss tail tightened and i wondered if some of it might be the lines though hed felt them through bis before eyes watering trent gestured for quen to back off the lines are indescribably awful trent managed pulling himself to his full height looking shaken but undeterred thats why the gargoyles are upset i said as i linked my arm in his and he started if you dont like it you can bubble your thoughts you think its bad now you should have heard it before bis fixed your line can we go bis almost whined the sooner we fix another the better ill feel i took a deep breath and nodded my farewell to quen the sun would be up far too soon i had to finish it by then then by all means lets go and we were gone chapter twentynine swirling howling colors of noise beat at me as i floundered in a wide river of energy it was so thick i could hardly think fatigue pulled at me it was getting harder to keep myself intact bis i thought searching for something familiar and his presence joined mine a solid soothing gray trent i thought and bis brought to me his emotions of determination surprise and awe of the strength we were surrounded by he was with us but quiet trying to take it in find this biss thoughts were laced with exhaustion and i fastened on his low impressions of green gold and brown swirling with a harsh slash of red and black i fumbled through the jumbled imbalances picking threads and bundling them until i matched what bis was showing me which was complex with incredibly high and low sensations i vaguely felt the drive to breathe felt the pain of oxygen starvation creeping up on me making my thoughts slow got it i thought panicking when i found bis struggling this would be a lot easier if we didnt have to do this on the run bis where does it go i thought as i bubbled the imbalance where does it go his thoughts whispered in mine singing a color i felt i should recognize i tuned the bubble holding the imbalance to it and with a ping of sensation i felt trent notice it was gone a pure note joined the howling energy ringing in the sound of hope wrenching us together i shifted the circle surrounding us to the taint of the imbalance id just replaced feeling reality swirl and coalesce the imbalance made each ley line uniquethe key flaw that made traveling them possible i gasped as my airstarved lungs became real and expanded pulling in the acidic taste of burnt amber facefirst i plowed into the red dirt my eyes squinted shut and my elbows taking most of the impact there was a pained grunt and sliding of rock and i guessed trent had made it the wind was gritty and the sky was dark sitting up i rubbed my chin and spit the dirt out bis i croaked realizing we were in the everafter shouldnt this be getting easier bis was a hunched shadow next to me i thought the everafter might hide us a little longer he said his red eyes on the sky the moon half full and waning just rising over the broken horizon he will find us soon theres not as much to damage here if he does what he meant was fewer people as potential hostages and i rose extending a hand to help trent up he shook his head and refused head bowed as he sat on the ruined earth and tried to catch his breath bis was getting the job done but he clearly lacked finesse rubbing my scraped elbow i looked out over a huge dropoff turning i saw a large valley filled with slumps of rock the edges had a red sheen from the moon which showed their outlines facing the east i made a slow circuit recognizing where we were when i saw the shallow depressions and the broken bridge across it eden park i asked bis whose line is this bis shifted his clawed feet nervously jumping onto a rock that was probably mirrored in reality by the statue of romulus and remus and the wolf the only demon who isnt gunning for us he said als my feet shifted in the dirt and i looked down thinking there should be something to differentiate this from everything else we were standing on the very spot where id made my pact with al to be his student if i could have trent as my familiar and there trent was coughing at my feet wearing a ring that made him my slave slaves could be freed though as if sensing my emotions of regret and inevitability trent wiped the grit from his eyes im sorry he said as he stood gracefully the red rock staining his lab coat like blood for what head down i dragged my foot around us in a circle rude but effectivemy thoughts waiting for the twinge that would mean we were found the sacrifices i asked of you surprised i looked him up and down im not the one wearing the slave ring besides id be content if i could get an apology for you slamming my head into a tombstone and choking me half to death i said twisting the master ring on my finger either he knew me better than i thought or he was getting far more through the rings than id gotten from quen his half smile made something in me twist then i apologize and i accept i said tucking a rank strand of hair back it never happened thank you for saving the babies that was important to me his expression went blank silent trent put his hands on his hips and scanned the brightening skies squinting he isnt telling me something my nose wrinkled at the stench and gritty wind remembering when wed walked from the church to the basilica in the everafter there were no surface demons here now and i wondered where they were its awful i said softly it used to be woods springs and fog all of it the entire everafter trents attention fell to me how do you know i shrugged i eavesdropped on one of als dreams i think i know what they used to look like too my head turned they were the slaves of elves once werent they and they rebelled got the best of you his expression went empty rumor has it and you tried to destroy them trent took a slow breath i could feel bis paying attention i wouldnt argue with that and now youre helping me save them nodding he smiled with half his mouth again my goal was to save you but yes i suppose im saving them as well bis jerked an instant later i felt it too someone was coming with three wing flaps bis was on my shoulder the healed line singing i pulled heavily on als line and it hummed through me drowning out the damage we had yet to repair in other lines trents head came up in shock feeling it as well okay time to see if these rings were worth lying to me about i said putting my back to trents and readying myself time to see if youre as good as i think you are trent whispered and i blinked as he raised a circle with the line i had drawn in the dirt the energy didnt exactly flow through me but i felt it as keenly as if it had in my mind whispers of spells id never heard of breathed and glowed with the sound of distant music my lips parted in awe trents magic and if i was seeing his internal spell book he was probably seeing mine along with his wisdom came trents desire for kusoxs end his anger and hatred flooded me almost sending me down trent was driven and through the rings i saw the depths of depravity that kusox subjected him to what he had casually threatened his child with and the extent trent would go to in order to stop him his emotions joined mine kusox becoming ugly and sordid in our shared view as our comparisons made a more perfect picture of his broken lacking soul my eyes welled and bis touched my cheek in concern trent turned to me shock in his eyes it was as if id never truly seen him and it shook me to my core i blinked fast wanting to touch him but afraid with a pop of air kusox was abruptly standing between us and the rising moon snarling he took two running steps throwing a black ball of hate like a pitcher i stiffened still lost in trents mind kusox hardly seemed to matter compared to the depth of connection the rings could foster id felt nothing like this when quen had worn them trent looked to kusox at the last moment i pulled deeply on the line trent and i were connected to feeling our circle strengthen our shared emotion about kusoxneither entirely his entirely mine or entirely realechoed through us as we stood unbowed as kusoxs magic sped forward shedding silver sparkles like pixy dust the very air hissing from the assault it hit our barrier with a shower of energy lighting the inside of our circle with a black haze biss tail tightened and i heard in trents and my mind the drums of his wild magic they blended with the humming purity of als lineand grew strong there was no hesitation in trents abilities as there had been between quen and me and a small part of me wondered why no monologue i taunted as kusox took in his lack of result i like that im going to eat you from the inside out rachel mariana morgan kusox intoned his hunched form circling us like a big black cat his words iced through me and trent shuddered rachel bis warbled and i turned to follow kusox backing up a step at trents clenched jaw and pained expression kusox was trying to use him fight it i said grabbing his upper arms trent you can say no no he cant kusox mocked flinging his coat out of his way as he stalked closer breathing on our bubble to make the black run to him dolore adficere do it slave trent shuddered under my grip the music in his mind faltered the rushing sound of the line in mine grew loud as biss tail tightened i am yours trent gasped through clenched teeth and my hand sprang from him thinking i was betrayed trent fell to a knee looking up at me pleading i am yours claim me rachel damn your morals and claim me breath held i spun to look at kusox my hand falling to touch trents shoulder mine i shouted feeling biss weight light on my shoulder and the slave rings burn between us i fastened on the wild music remembering the rings creation the ugly promise of domination they held and i claimed it black filth roared in as the rings found their purpose and came truly alivesmut for this ancient magic of stream and wood song and deviltry hes mine i shouted again and trents head snapped up his eyes wild as my will dominated him fear slid through me but the music had grown stronger not less and trent panted blood leaking from his nose i didnt know if i had him or not youre bleeding i said wiping it away with my scarf his eyes met mine at the soft touch and a chime seemed to shake the ley line realigning the universe he was mine no kusox raged hammering on our bubble trent was mine and scared out of my socks i extended a hand to help him rise i was responsible for him and i didnt want to be was this what trent felt for his people he was stronger than i you can back off now he panted and i hastily lifted my domination from his thoughts until trent sighed in relief thank you sorry you will not take him from me kusox raged i will eat all that you hold dear i will swallow the sun i will burn the moon making a pair of horns with his pinkie and thumb trent showed kusox the back of his hand kusoxs eyes widened at the ancient elven insult with a cry of outrage he slammed his foot into our circle bouncing back and screaming when it repelled him with a burst of ozonetainted energy mine he screamed like child in a tantrum not anymore i whispered wondering if we should jump out we were kind of stuck in this circle the halfmoon was rising if i remembered right it would be almost straight overhead at sunrise we had hours to finish this or newt would kill me herself perhaps we should circle him trent suggested and i wiped my palms on my pants good idea i said wanting to leave our circle as much as id want to jump into a bath of ice pound him into the earth its elven charms he doesnt know after you trent looked at me and it was all i could do but not laugh for crying he had the drive i had the strength and neither of us had the skill what in hell had al been talking about ill go bis said and i reached out after him cursing my hesitation bis no i shouted his tail a whisper across my neck and then he was through our bubble darting madly to evade kusoxs thrown charms hey i cried and trent dove through the bubble as well rolling to a stop behind a slump of rock i was surprised that the circle around me hadnt fallen perhaps the slave rings enabled us to share the same energy fields my head snapped up as wild magic coursed through me and trent threw a charm adsimulo calefacio i shouted sending my own curse hot on the heels of trents bis flipped in midair to avoid kusoxs strike his wings gray in the moonlight trents spell hit the demons raised shield and the hazy black shattered with the sound of glass unhurt kusox turned his eyes widening as my incoming curse hit him square in the chest yes trent exclaimed elated as kusox was thrown back an ugly gold and black crawling over him making his back arch but i wasnt so confident and i pulled heavily on the line stockpiling energy until my head hurt and biss hair stood on end as he landed on a crag of stone again trent shouted his face grim and together we struck kusox jerked a haze covering him for an instant as he jumped out of the way and our combined curses hit the empty ground and exploded light seeming to splinter and fly i ducked throwing myself behind a rock as our curse flew like shrapnel fire burned in my mind and i rose up horrified trent had taken refuge under a bubble and since our broken curse held his aura the energy tore right through it he was down his lab coat filthy with rock the gritty wind shifting his hair about his closed eyes but he breathed rachel there bis shouted pointing and i spun my breath catching as i saw kusox leaning against a boulder the size of a small car the demon smiled hurt but alive this is only making your sunrise harder love he said and i ran to trent i could feel bis following above i slid to a stop my mind delving deep into trents running the counter curses before the damage could seep in any further trent came to with a snort jolted to full awareness by my stinging mental slap the rings made it possible perhaps i shouldnt have done that trent said and i helped him up again dragging him back into our uninvoked circle you cant kill me therefore i win kusoxs words echoed over the dead earth between us chilling me light glowed from the crater that trents and my magic had made and in the slashes of angry light kusox smiled shadows making him harsh you cant kill me even with your elf slave he said the rock sliding from under his feet as he stood the collective wont help you and youaredead bis landed upon trent and the lines echoed in my mind ill jump you out the kid said but both of us shook our heads it ended here it ended now daliiii kusox screamed at the rising moon newt show yourselves you cowards his head dropping he looked at me with savage eyes from under his hanging hair clearly shaken from the curse that had landed on him i will talk to you you poltroons stand up i said poking trent in the ribs to make him jump fix your hair will you you look a mess look whos talking trent said even as he ran a hand through his hair to arrange it his missing fingers obvious we both stiffened as the energy in the lines shifted nearly where the sun would rise in a scant four hours a round squat demon misted into existence tired and slackfaced is it done dali said facing kusox and taking in his ragged appearance fix the damned line before theres nothing left and were all he hesitated breathing the air as if he could smell me or maybe he was smelling trent he reeked of cinnamon and wine almost covering up the stench of burnt amber shes alive he exclaimed spinning to us his expression shocked youre alive im alive i said breathing hard for the moment for the moment kusox muttered echoing my thought frowning as newt misted into existence beside dali wearing exactly the same thing i was al slumped at her feet and my heart leaped until i saw the chains about his wrists and the downcast slouch to his shoulders of course shes alive newt said and als head snapped up his fervent eyes finding mine and tension pulling him straight shes als wonder child the demon finished lightly smacking al to make him glower at the assbackward praise al i breathed elated and trent stared at me in my mind trents hatred for the demon rose up anger for his missing fingers his fear for having been helpless it joined my memories of als awkwardly given kindnesses when none was expected and then my pity for the loss of his wife his life his love being forced to live in a hole in the ground an understanding found a respect granted unasked vulnerable and fragile al trent said and i blinked not comfortable having shared that with him ii i stammered then shut my mouth unable to explain al was cruel vindictive angry elegant powerful he gave me strength he gave me wisdom not only about magic but about myself he was a lot like trent only harsher around the edges sensing my emotions trent turned away head down and grimy hair shifting in the gritty wind i will never understand you how can you forgive so easily yeah well thats whats going to save both our asses i said hoping it was a prophecy not a prayer take her kusox shouted finish her heart pounding i shifted my feet to find solid earth beneath the scree my will strengthened our circle and i felt trent do the same wild magic seeping up from the earth to send darts of gold through the black smut crawling over the barrier whats the matter kusox i mocked when dali and newt exchanged worried glances since when do you need anyones help i though this was between you and me how come you called them cant do it yourself you are hiding behind a stinking elf he snarled gesturing wildly he smells quite nice i shouted back making bis giggle and its not hiding its using my resources to the fullest you can use nick if you want kusoxs eye twitched next to me trent lifted his chin i stand with rachel to fix the everafter he said quietly making a sharp contrast to kusoxs loudmouthed bullying i stand to save the demons what do you stand for kusox shakuru trent held up his mutilated hand his ring glinting newt leaned to see and al winced dragged behind her as she came forward a step al where did you get a working set of slavers she asked and then she blinked in what had to be shock theyre using them backward is that even possible al slowly got to his feet saying apparently and i didnt give them to her she made them herself no wonder she was able to strike me down newt said smugly but i didnt think anyone believed her kusox limped forward youre not going to help me finish her shes using an elf so dali said gesturing this is your issue your word against hers if you cant best her then maybe she is right and you arewrong she ran away kusox said gesturing and i stiffened as i felt another demon show up he was on the outskirts listening it proves shes at fault id take her down now but shes grown inventive i think you mean powerful newt said slyly jerking al closer to make his chains clink dali crossed his arms looking more confident as several more demons misted in beside the first why should i help you she fixed my line my rooms wont be shrinking when the sun comes up but she was the one who broke them kusox glanced nervously at the accumulating demons between us and the waning moon did she dalis head tilted and the demons popping in one by one discussed breath held i did a mental count dalis line was the one running through trents compound i looked at trent seeing his pale face as he figured it out as well on my shoulder bis squirmed hed chosen what lines we jumped to with precisionmine newts dalis and als you are blind fools kusox paced in the fading light from trents and my last joined magic if she doesnt die before the sun rises and the energy tide shifts you will lose too much and the everafter will fall regardless of whose lines get fixed then kill her and lets get on with it newt said making al scowl at her pleasant smile i tried already and she hit me hey would any of you mind if i go take care of a few things and get back to you in about an hour i said loudly then ducked when kusox sent a token shot of energy at us it hit the barrier and was absorbed cleanly making the surrounding demons buzz with interest trent leaned close whispering i think its funny how they keep trying to kill you when all you want to do is save them happens to me all the time i said wryly and he chuckled me too a feeling of shared kinship darted through me lighting both our thoughts and bis seemed to warm i need your help kusox growled pacing forward i cant best her when shes with an elf the sun will be up soon and by then it will be too late the demons behind dali didnt like that but newt was undeterred perhaps rachel can we had to get this done and get it done now trent had the drive to kill kusox i had the power but neither of us had the skill to best a demon taught the arts of war blinking i brought my head up finding al waiting a devious smile on his face his bound hands held out to me al did my eyes went to his hands and his gloves misted out of existence to show his wedding rings perhaps the three of us could actually do something we need al i whispered as kusox paced up and down raging at us dont be foolish we cant even get to him trent muttered back they arent going to help him i said looking to the east and fidgeting they wont help us we need to forcibly take him trent frowned as kusox grandstanded claiming another twelve hours of negative energy pressure would put the mass of the everafter under a viable threshold we need al i said again and this time trent turned to me his eyes flicking up to biss as the gargoyle bobbed his head we cant overpower kusox without the knowledge al has we need him an ugly expression came over trent and i got into his face mad get over it trent i hissed taking his arm you used me and now im calling it in what kind of world do you want your children to grow up in one where they fear demons or one where they understand them trent jerked away angry and unwilling behind him i could see al waiting i am yours trent said sullenly and i swear i saw als lips move in tandem his expression elated lets get him bis shouted and i staggered as he sprang from me our circle bobbling for a moment as he punched through spinning madly to avoid kusoxs sudden curses bis i cried feeling the broken glory of the lines vanish then i bolted to al while kusox was staring at the sky i knew trent would get my back and i felt him gather a spell flinging it madly in the hopes of scoring on the distracted demon a thunderous boom behind me sent me stumbling and i crashed into newt we went down me on top of her sorry i cheerfully cried as i grabbed my fist and swung my elbow into the side of her head it met with a thump and my arm went numb breath hissing i got off her scrambling to find al and drag him away id broken three boards with that move before and newt was downfor a moment at least oh youre going to pay for that itchy witch al said beaming at me and i sketched a fast circle around us catching quick glimpses of exploding fireballs and demons in white robes scrambling to find cover hey if im going to get blamed for hitting her im going to hit her i said are you okay can you tap the lines in my mind elven spells were unwinding wild magic singing through me it was as if i was in two places at once and the adrenaline pounded through me my head was high and i breathed deep when trent spelled he sang circle circle al shouted and i ducked deflecting a black ball of something not until trent gets here i said seeing bis swooping around to drop another rock on kusox i fumbled at als bindings they were simple cords but my fingers hummed when i touched them clearly they were spelled hes wearing the slaver yes al said grabbing my hands and yanking me out of the path of another spell hell get through your energies resonate as one my fingers on the knot hesitated ivy could i save ivy with this look out al shouted shoving me backward and i fell my breath knocked out of me al was standing over me shouting to the skies and fingers scrabbling i reached out for the circle id scraped in the dirt still not having breathed rhombus i thought getting a slip of air in and al jumped back narrowly avoiding getting left outside dizzy i looked up newt was laughing so hard she couldnt breathe blood leaking from her ear as she sat on the ground and scooted backward to sit against a large rock see she crowed pointing i told you she hit me shaky i sat up moving a stone out from under my backside dali too was watching standing in the middle of everything with his hands on his hips and a frown on his face as if nothing could touch him trent was ducking behind rocks as kusox pulverized them each jump moving him closer trents charms were circling in my head filling me with the need to do something wild and demanding drawing on me as needed to supplement his strength the demons werent helping they werent hindering either only the strongest could ensure the demons continued existence i wanted it to be me trent i shouted and he sprang for us kusox took aim then flinched when bis dropped a rock on him snarling the demon shifted his attention to bis no i shouted helpless bis spun headed for the shelter of my bubble under him trent pounded over the rocks kusox snarled eyes on the sky as he wound up fixed on bis he didnt see dali stick his foot out and the demon faceplanted into the dusty stones okay maybe they had a favorite here after all oh sorry dali said getting between us and kusox to help the demon up brushing him off and getting in his line of sight until bis backwinged into the bubble landing on my shoulder his red eyes wide in excitement trent was a moment behind slipping through the protection bubble and sliding to a sudden awkward halt inches from alfar too close al smiled down at him with his thick blocky teeth and trent smiled right back more than a hint of deviltry in his green green eyes trent was humming and my thoughts hummed with him i was alive with him and it was glorious indescribable trents eyes met mine and we both flushed behind him a rock exploded as kusoxs discarded magic rolled into a rock the watching demons complained loudly and i felt a dozen protection circles go up yes yes slave rings have a silver lining al grumped holding his bound hands out if you two are done mooning over each other i could use some assistance i started and bis giggled from my shoulder they are charmed al said loftily as trent touched them and a strand of wild magic spun through my mind the curse holding al quavered resisted and finally fell when i gave trents magic a push marrrrvelous al drawled a dangerous light entering his eyes as he turned to the east to kusox his thick hands clenched and my skin prickled at the energy he drew in from his line atop the valley overlooking the dead city you work well together good to know do we jump bis asked riding the high of the innocent i looked over the flat plain below us seeing the world spread out dim and red under the rising moon it felt right that here at the top of the world it would end we fight i said and al chuckled low and long kusox was pacing his form low and hunched as he watched us in our bubble wear my ring al said his glove gone as he held out one of his wedding bands i didnt think hed ever wear them again trent reached for it and al closed his fist rachel is the fulcrum upon which all things will shift tonight you trent are bound to her she and i are bound together only rachel can focus both our strengths an elfs drive for justice a demons lifetime of skills and rachels strength i swallowed hard flinching at a spark of energy cascading over our bubble al and i wearing his wedding rings now that i knew what they really were it held an entirely different feeling im okay with that trent said and a slow smile curved over als face al looked at trent for a moment as he remembered something then his eyes rose to mine i never thought id work with an elfagain he said and he slipped his ring on my finger i wavered as his energy mixed with mine bis hissing as the strength of both men seeped deep reading their own surprise as they found common ground within me can i survive this i said meaning to be flippant but finding i really wanted to know i was humming overly full and both of them demanding i do something it was too much i looked past our bubble to see newt standing next to dali watching without a hint of emotion showing prince of the elves eh al said as his heavy hand took my elbow and shifted me to look east yup trent said and i shivered as his music fell through my mind i knew what to do with it i had only to speak and you are the world breaker al said to bis and the gargoyles grip on me tightened no he exclaimed delighted really and im your sword i added i had once been trents sword too when he was on his elf quest you still are trent whispered reading my mind through the bond of the rings i sighed and what am i to you al my maid he said brightly shall we do this i let the bubble fall we would meet the next day free or dead kusox snarled at us and i thought he looked like a dog the moon is rising rachel face me and die quite right al said make war when the moon rises make love when it sets he winked at me and i gathered the line to me kusox you slimy little worm now you will see what a demon is by the goddess trent cried as my knees collapsed and i fell the serpent of black magic unwinding from my head the power of the demon bands was twofold not just each of us having our strength combined but instinctively knowing what the other was doing it was beautiful it made us deadly it was an ancient war machine the rings were made for this and now we had access to the weapons vault chapter thirty up stand up trent muttered his tight grip on my arm pulling me upright dazed i felt trent steady me as al metaphorically cleared his throat opening up his arsenal of black charms stored in the collective more than five thousand years ago during the bloody war between his people and trents ugly black monstrosities rose and fell in my mind charms to mutilate break and destroy by playing upon the base desires guilt and fears of another it was numbing and i felt the alien desire to crush rise up in me als presence was smothering i leaned on trent and opened my mind to him with a whimper we both fell as als bearing sucked in trent stand up al demanded and we did overshadowed and panting it was getting easier to bear we have a worm to crush al cried out his eyes alight with the promise of vengeance im okay i said softly then lifted my chin accepting who i was and the history of those who came before me i may not have written these hideous expressions of hate but i understood them even as i shuddered at their monstrosity kusox didnt have a clue or a prayer kusox shakuru al shouted his voice echoing back from the broken earth come forth and die i took a deep breath as the painful unharmonious jangle of lines merged into the collective i felt trents awe and with the imaginary sound of sliding bolts and echoing thumps an ugly curse grew as if rising from the depths als chanting pulled it into being and i felt my face go ashen it would do unspeakable damage destroying kusox from his mind out burning with endless fire and crushing his soul to nothing that such things were possible seemed the worst kind of punishment terga et pectora telis transfigitur al proclaimed pushing out with both hands trent jerked and the energy of the spell pulled through me burning my brain the curse sped to kusox unseen with a faint distortion as if the very air was recoiling from it trent touched my arm and i followed his gaze to the black haze coming at us incoming i cried and al shoved me from him i fell on trent the ground slamming into us a shimmer of a protection circle rose up pulled into being by one or all of us als charm nicked the edge of kusoxs own circle making an earnumbing scream as it ricocheted to pinwheel erratically into a tall tower of rock i propped myself up on an elbow jaw dropping when the mountain took the hit and collapsed inward sucking into a loud bang that echoed to the black horizon im not taking the smut for that trent whispered inches away as the demons watching applauded we got up shaken as we looked across the space to see that kusox was staggering but upright grim faced and determined you dont really think water made the grand canyon did you al smirked his circle fell as he flicked a ball of energy at kusox the demons watching grudgingly applauded when kusox just as easily absorbed it throwing stones at each other is getting us nowhere trent said his expression more annoyed than anything else as he tugged his lab coat straight and apparently the everafter has an expiration date i prompted looking at the east al sighed dramatically you have a better idea he said slipping into our bubble to sidestep kusoxs next attack it hit with a muffled thump to make the earth tremble and our circle quivered trent frowned i do listen he said and my eyes opened as wild magic blossomed in my thoughts with the memory of drums and wildly dancing lithesome shapes i felt trents magic spill into me it tingled to my fingers and al gasped my hands clenched so i wouldnt move as the foreign memory of an intoxicated swaying to a greater will filled me it was magic from the elven war magic that demons had never been able to best i felt als stark terror melt into understanding but trent was lost to it pulling everything to him shaping it with no thought other than to build i could feel the power growing with the strength of the sun the certainty of the tides a winglidded eye opened purple and stark it found me and i shook bind it al whispered rachel bind it its wild magic i cant but i could the wild magic had acknowledged me i owed it and it would see me through so i could pay my debt with the energy of the lines i wove a resonance about trents charm binding it in a form that would find the one it was intended for and no other now i whispered feeling it grow now i shouted severing trent from the magic and shoving it at al ex cathedra al shouted to give our curse strength and kusox cried out as it blew through his circle unimpeded kusox fell to the earth the elven curse crawling over him like a thousand green snakes eating his aura his magic in my mind i heard a chiming laugh bind him trent called out springing forward through our joined auras as if he had done this a thousand times before and perhaps in his mind he had he has no magic but he can still run i ran for the unmoving slump of fabric not wanting kusox to turn into a bird and eat us but i slid to a stop when al popped into existence right over him expression harsh he put a foot on kusoxs neck and leaned over him trent was beside me i could feel the auras of the surrounding demons hear their harsh cries for revenge taste their desire on the gritty wind my heart pounded and i watched as als face twisted and he bore down choking kusox with his foot elven magic had downed him and i felt a growing fear in the demons even as they urged kusoxs end appalled i watched as kusox pushed at als foot pounding at his leg his face becoming red as he arched his back and struggled you were a mistake al exclaimed and newts androgynous form shoved another aside so she could see dali was beside her and they served as stonefaced witnesses as they killed one of their own you were a mistake al said again as kusox struggled his fingers clawing als leg until they bled trial kusox rasped his eyes fastening on dalis i fixed my horrified gaze on dali seeing the demon clench his teeth could he claim that trial i have a right he choked out hardly audible over the surrounding din dali grimaced and bent his head toward newts i think he said trial als teeth showed and he bore down harder someone jostled me forward and trent pulled me back before i fell i did kusox got out i have a right for a trial by demon he dies trent shouted his desire flowing through me by way of the slavers now i looked to the east frightened when the angry mob of demons at my back began to subside into frustrated mutterings we dont have time for a trial but al was moving his foot al you want them to put him in jail i shouted and his eyes met mine shocking me with their hatred it would have been better if trents spell would have killed kusox directly but elves apparently liked their prisoners alive no al backed up a step kusox lying between him and newt and dali i want to fucking kill him slow had been my intent but fast would have been acceptable kusox was smiling wickedly as he sat up scooting backward into the surrounding demons when al made motions to kick him im a demon he said his voice smoothing out as found his aplomb i have a right to a trial let go of me newt cried wiggling in dalis grip let go i will kill him myself if you are all too afraid and then you can put me on trial she shouted be still newt dali exclaimed but the haze in her eyes scared me even as i wanted to see an end to kusox ah i have an idea trent said softly his voice both musical and hard that is if you are willing to listen to an elf the one whose magic caught him i turned to trent wanting to protest that it had taken all three of us to catch him but i held my tongue when i saw the harsh light in his eyes the chilling bonehard expression of dealing out a harsh death id seen it once aimed at me and id almost died newt jerked from dali breathless as she faced us kusox slowly getting up between us ill hear the elf she said bitterly an elf a demon from the back called we should kill him too there was a muttering agreement and i stiffened trents chin lifted the wind shifted his stringy hair in the moonlight and trent said if he was a thief in my house his actions stealing the space i claim the air i breathe i would do a trial by hunt a chill lifted through me trent wouldnt meet my eyes as he stared at dali al was shifting foot to foot and a murmur of discontent was rising around us like a hot wind you would hunt him down a demon at the front of the circle said as an animal as your ilk did before we beat you off it was true then the demons had been the slaves of elves before the tables had been turned my new alliance between the elves and demons was falling apart before it could even form and my heart pounded on my shoulder bis tightened his grip promising a quick escape but i didnt want to escape i wanted justice i wanted the hunt i think its a good idea i said my palms going sweaty as the memory of hate swirling in the demons landed on me as they hunted us someone cried out and al winced like animals i stiffened when someone pushed me and i stepped into kusoxs space yes yes i said again louder and they quieted like animals and you proved them wrong they shut up and i turned to look at them finding all eyes on me you are demons i said forcefully not animals and the elves stand at the brink of extinction from the force of your correction is it not enough trent stood unrepentant in his lab coat he could have been in a tshirt and flipflops and he still would have looked nobleproud determined harsh and taking the blame of an entire people that came before him let me go kusox said his voice oily im a demon i deserve a trial not by some perverted elf tradition but by my peers i looked at him as a scuffling arose from the unsure demons ringing him then i walked over to stand before him my hands on my hips but youre not a demon kusox i said smiling beatifically a sense of satisfaction grew within me every demon here every demon still alive has been a slave has been hunted even me and you have not you have never felt the anger of being made powerless controlled bought and sold i stood speaking now to those around me you have not i said softly you have not felt the unfair lash been pissed upon by those who call you animal underling an object al was thinking they all were and my stomach quivered i think you need to be a demon before you can claim the right to a trial as one i finished and kusox scoffed you want us to let him go someone shouted he nearly destroyed the everafter i held up a hand you all nearly destroyed the everafter by your cowardice i can fix the lines with bis youve seen it ask your gargoyles theyve taught him the resonance of your lines the proper resonance not this jagged purity i can have them whole by sunup and i say yes let him go but as you once were not as you are now the soft hum of decisionsyetunmade started and turning back to kusox i reached out in my mind for trent and al this was going to take all my finesse and i didnt have a clue how to do it it would take wild magic to fix it to him and ancient demon wisdom to find it you want to do what to him i heard an echo in my mind the shock of understanding tagging the masculine emotion as als like this i said eyes closing as a shimmer of my aura fell over kusox tainted red from the everafter kusox stiffened and as the memory of wild magic spun around and around in my head with the sound of fluttering wings i showed al a vision that he had shown me a figure somewhat small black as midnight long fingers and toes leathery wings stretched like moonbeams he would have an angular face and wide black eyes like newt and al now had there would be long eyelashes a small mouth and whiskers like a cat al wove the charms at my direction his shock and amazement making his attention skip and jump in mine my god whispered a voice and i opened my eyes as the last of the charm melted away to leave kusox blinking up at us with large black eyes looking exactly like id seen al in his dream of blue butterflies i had wings someone breathed i remember they shone in the sun and how cool they felt in the sand black nails another said i remember the taste of clouds came a voice from the back soft and full of wonder stardust in my ears what have you done kusox said putting a hand to his throat when it came out in a mild soft hiss what have you done to me my head was down as i tried to separate myself from the spell curse whatever trents original curse denying kusox magic still held true and he was helpless he was a demon the original form before mothers changed their children to make them strongerinto tools of war images of man so well suited for it rachel trent said jerking me from my thoughts i saw it in a dream of als i said looking up to see the wonder and awe in the faces around me did i get it right trent shook his head in confusion gazing at kusox as he tried to move almost falling until he used his wing as support i have no idea let me go kusox cried his wings opening in alarm and they all shifted back stepping on toes and shoving those behind them until we stood in a wide space open to the night sky ringed by silent demons newt was crying silent tears trapped in a memory let him go i said and all eyes came back to me as kusox felt his face in panic and tried to find his balance i say he has no right to claim demon law because he isnt one we hunt if he runs far and fast enough he can live with the memory of being hunted of being a demon he will deserve to live but if he is caught i hesitated seeing understanding trickle through them reigniting their bloodlust if hes caught then kill him like the animal he is i am not an animal kusox cried out his voice high as the demons cheered their approval yes you are dear boy newt said her cheeks wet as she came forward to help him find his balance i say that the elf ah that trenton has an excellent idea let kusox go kusox tensed to jump up and away and he was mobbed beaten down i backed up into trent and he held me in front of him his grip warm and his breath coming over my shoulder as they dragged kusox up and spread his wings wide so he couldnt move say you we hunt dali shouted and i winced at their shouts fisted hands in the air kusox struggled blood running in little rivulets from where they gripped too hard you cant do this to me he rasped his black eyes wide in fear i am a god newt came forward but we can love she said giving him a small kiss on his furry face fly fast no he shouted his word whistling in fear and they let him go i ducked as he was away his wings beating the ground as he surged into the air sounding like a dove he whistled into the night sky my heart thudded as i watched him go his gray shadow quickly going faint hes getting away someone shouted and bis flapped his wings for their attention i can find him the little gargoyle said as he took to the air and i was proud of him for having lost his fear al sidled up to me leaning to mutter i hope you know what youre doing hes going to be the devil to catch again kusoxs shadow dwindled and vanished into moonlight clusters of demons were watching as well discussing the best way to followgiving him a generous head start but clearly eager to be away he was impossible to catch before only because you didnt stand up to him i said softly my gaze lingering upon bis sporting in the air over them spiraling in his joy of flight the gargoyles at my other side trent was frowning still watching the sky we need mounts for a hunt im not going to run after him i turned to al seeing he had the same idea i had winged mounts the demon said and i nodded as he took a huge breath and shouted treeeeblllle trent drew back in awe as als gargoyle popped into existence right before us looking as large as etude but thinner she lashed her blacktipped tail and winked at bis wheeling above her ill thank you for getting your demon to fix his holyasss line she said brightly to bis her ears flat to her skull and making al scowl how about the rest of them it still sounds like hell out there working on it bis said breathlessly as he landed on my shoulder and i sealed my thoughts off so i wouldnt have to deal with the screaming line just yet demons had noticed and like a fantasy flick gone wild dragonlike shapes were popping in everywhere enthusiastic gargoyles eager for a chance to pay back some of the misery they had endured for the last week i backed up into trent as al swung atop treble the gargoyle shivering as she rose easily up into the air before dropping back down wings were unfolding everywhere yellow and red eyes swirling with an eagerness to be away shouts echoed and i paled kusox didnt have a chance go go newt cried atop a grayfaced wrinkled gargoyle and the behemoth rose up on two legs wings stretching to show a patchwork of scars his expression savage he gnashed his black teeth and vaulted into the night others followed and i hid my face as the dust flew the noise peaked and dwindled and i looked up as they rose in a great spiral cutting between me and the stars they will find him trent said and i turned my scuff sounding loud in the sudden hush behind him al waited with treble hungry to be gone trents face held resolute emptiness he had wanted to go needed to see an end needed to be a part of it and he had been excluded we needed one more mount bis i said and the little gargoyles eyes blinked ill get my dad he said and vanished before i could tell him his father was likely lying broken next to the loveland ley line my shoulders sagged with guilt and i thought of ivy and jenks why did i always leave such a huge amount of collateral damage maybe i should have taken the shame of simply killing kusox in his sleep having second thoughts itchy witch al said as treble dug her claws into the earth to leave great gouging divots i took a breath to answer my head jerking up along with als as a great shape sprang into existence above us in the empty night sky etude i cried out and he waved great gaping holes in his wings looking painful as he spiraled down bis darting energetically around him mother pus bucket hes a big one al said making treble blush a deep black youre alive i cried out elated as he landed bis alighted on his dads shoulder looking proud my dad fought kusox he crowed theyre singing about him already etude snuck a glance at treble his gaze lingering on al perched on her back im glad youre alive as well he said a heavy hand touching my shoulder to make me feel small my boy is safe if you ever need anything she needs a mount al said interrupting him we are hunting the breaker of the lines interested etude stiffened his eyes flicking to the sky is that what i hear yes id gladly take a pound of flesh for the pain weve endured rachel dont mind my wings i can still fly we can be on them in moments they are blazing a trail even humans can see and tremble at trents jaw clenched and he looked at the sky not me i said looking at trent take him shocked trent turned me i shrugged ignoring als heavy sigh to get on with it this is your kind of thing i said remembering the baying of dogs and the fear maybe i was with my kin after all ive got stuff to do lines to fix etude nodded looking disappointed as trent seemed to grow three inches taller eagerly accepting etudes helping hand to sit astride him then unexpectedly he leaned back down and extended a hand for me this is your kind of thing too he said his eyes glowing with his need to ride to chase to hunt you can fix the lines later no i said then slapped at trebles hands as she grabbed me about the waist and plopped me behind trent hey wait i shouted then screamed as etude jumped into the air his wings beating fiercely my arms flashed around trent and i could have smacked him for his laugh a wash of everafter coated us an echo of a healing spell ringing in my head as al mended etudes wings etude rumbled his thanks then stole trebles wind earning a screech and a mock dive from her they went this way rachel bis said his words ripped away with the black gritty wind beating against me my hands were about trents waist the warmth of his body blocking most of the wind as i peered around him looking for a red smear of magic i could smell the ringing of an iron bell and the warm scent of cinnamon all washing over me in a cascading sensation of heat with a tweak on my awareness treble winked out of existence diving into a line on the wing my breath caught and feeling bis enfold us the force of the wind vanished replaced with the howling energy of a line and then reality was back and we were diving into cincinnati lights of buses and cars flashed as the chill air of the coming dawn pulled through my hair exalting in it i spread my arms and held on with my legs to let the air brush the stink of burnt amber from me i felt als sudden emotion flair feeling it echoed in trent he stiffened before me and i looked first at al and treble flying close by and then to the city we were approaching cincinnati was beautiful with lights green with spring the sounds from her muted as the dawn approached and nightwalkers looked to the sky and stared at the weaving magic of red racing through the city buildings we had found them and treble cried out the warbling call for battle was answered and i shivered remembering hearing the dogs bay for me still distant but closing a red ribbon of magic iced the pack of demons on their winged mounts chasing a fleeting shadow of gray running for his life darting between buildings rising and falling wildly he flew the demons tight behind glorying in the chase look i called as the glowing hunt flowed through the center of the city and kusox vanished into a ley line but instead of following as they had through als line the demons rose up in a huge arc like leaves in the wind coming up against a wall scattering into chaos they dont know where he went bis shouted his red eyes catching the streetlight as he swooped at my elbow follow me he dove toward the ground and i shrieked as etude followed al tight behind we slammed into the ley line vanishing into chaos bis found me throwing a resonance into my thoughts through the rings al watched and trent marveled as i wove a circle around it capturing the imbalance and tuning it to the universitys ley line we burst into existence in the everafter a stream of howling demons following us as we fought for altitude dodging broken shells of buildings kusox was just ahead and the demons surged after him screaming their vengeance red magic streaming behind them it was truly the wild hunt and i would be lying if i said it didnt scare the crap out of me on kusox fled and on we followed hounding him following him through line after line as he tried to shake us like a fox traveling down a river we sped through reality causing fear and awe among those who saw us a red smear of magic howling against the stars rising in the heat from the buildings and dropping over the cool woods over the everafter we tore sending up gouts of red dust as we followed dead rivers and empty lakes scoured by the gritty wind we followed until bis grew exhausted from mending the lines and rode in his fathers arms and i slumped behind trent weary and heartsick this was not me i didnt thirst for vengeance even vengeance justly earned i did not demand blood for blood i did this to live without fear i wanted an end to it still each line we mended gave the gargoyles strength until they were reaching for kusoxs wings the purity of the lines a harsh contrast to the demons base desire for death then etudes weight shifted and i realized we were landing what i said pulling my head up from trents back where id been hiding wishing it was over hes gone to ground trent shouted pointing and i looked at the dusty red earth brightening in the coming sunrise demons were sliding from the backs of their gargoyles clustered about a small pile of rock slowly etude spiraled down the noise of the earth strengthened and my stomach twisted this was the end etude found a place his wings closing the instant his feet lightly touched the ground trent slid from him easily and i slowly followed my hand on trents shoulder i stumbled after him pushing through the demons and gargoyles to find kusoxs hole well never get him out of there i said looking at the brightening sky already the black of the hazy sky was turning to a faint pink and the gritty wind was picking up i didnt know where we wereall places were the same in the everafter or maybe we will i said again as i realized the gargoyles though weary from flight were tearing great gaping holes in the earth like organized terriers they dug great chunks of dirt tossing them to the side as if they were pillows to shatter into smaller chunks i blanched at trents anticipation he stood waiting elated and riding the high of the chase and looking forward to the grisly end he felt my eyes on him and he looked up it was a good hunt he said and the demons who heard him agreed their gaze holding a new respect a call went up and the stones quit falling upward from the hole a muffled boom shifted the earth and a handful of demons dropped into the craggy entrance i leaned forward trent beside me something oily slid through my thoughts and i shuddered al was the only one not looking down into the hole he was looking at me and i quailed we have him came up a call and those of us at the edge backed up we have him and his familiar too nick i shivered my arms going around me as the demons crawled up from the hole their gargoyles leading the way to help them two sodden thumps hit the dirt and the watching demons went quiet only one of the captives breathed nick i said and the mans eyes found mine widening rachel he said then fell back when someone shoved him down he hit the dead body of kusox and recoiled horrified as he tried to move away from the alienlooking shape kusoxs wings were broken in several places and his head was tilted at a sickening angle his neck snapped through he was dead but i felt nothing numb we found them grappling a demon i didnt recognize said i dont know if we killed kusox or his familiar my eyes widened and my knees wobbled as i realized what had happened was that kusox dead before me or nickkusox changing their forms in order to survive rachel its me he said rising up only to get shoved down again tell them its me i never meant to hurt you please the demon holding a staff to his chest shrugged well the demon asked me you know him best is it kusox or his familiar i edged past trent feeling every stone under my foot every gust of gritty wind in my snarled hair weary i came to a halt before the downed figure seeing the emotion behind his eyes the wrinkles just starting at the corners the stubble glinting red in the rising sun it looked the same as when i had left nick at midnight reaching out i touched his face rubbing a bit of blood off his cheek feeling it between my fingers remembering nicks smile that turned into betrayal not once twice but three times was this nick or kusox rachel he whispered begging tell them its me my heart beat and my lungs emptied ceri was gone pierce but what hurt the most was that two girls would grow up not knowing ceris proud strength how her compassion blended with a brutal justice and that she had loved them with the depth of her soul rachel he screamed terror making his face lined you told me that you would keep me safe i leaned in smelling the fear in his sweat under the stink of burnt amber you left the church i breathed and he jerked away from me trents light touch on my elbow shocked through me and i spun its nick he said to me his desperate expression the last thing id ever expected i know its nick i screamed in my thoughts but i didnt want it to be if i said it was kusox they would rip him apart i wanted him dead i wanted him gone how could i let him feel the sun and joy when he was why ceri and pierce were dead trent stepped forward the demons silently watching you know its him he should be dead i shouted and he nodded his eyes closing in a strengthgathering blink he is slime hes everything i despise hes hurt you hes hurt me and he has lied to me too many times he doesnt deserve to walk away from this nick pulled himself together shaking as he looked up at me whispering please trent shoved a toe at him to be quiet then took my hands to draw my attention to himself instead on our fingers the slavers glinted blood red in the coming sunrise youre right he said and nick whimpered but let him live not for him for me for you i jerked out of his grip falling back into al his thick hand fell on my shoulder and i pulled myself straight jaw clenching trent followed me nick cowered behind him the torn remains of kusox steaming beside him in the cold wind for me he said but his voice was too soft for it to be him wanting to take his revenge on nick alone i want he said then hesitated taking a breath of air and lifting his chin i want one pure thing in my life he said loudly his voice ringing in the redtinted air i want one thing i can point to and say that is good and its a part of me my heart thudded and my eyes teared up he thought i was good i couldnt speak as trent took my hands and pulled me a step from al and i shivered as the demons touch fell away i want he said softly you to keep what you can of the person you want to be dont sacrifice it for this lip curling he gave nick a sidelong dismissive glance dont let your desire for revenge give him the power to make you what you dont want to be its hard i said and the demons around me began to shuffle eager to be gone but he smiled and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear of course it is if it was easy everyone would do it newt pushed the dead carcass of kusox into the hole with her foot and nick scrabbled away from the edge well it hurt to say it but i took a breath and looked straight up trents fingers were clasped in mine its nick i said then danced back when nick cried out reaching for me as one the demons groaned als shoulders slumped and then his eyes narrowed i say we still kill him he muttered reaching and newt slammed her staff down between them i claim him she shouted swinging her staff in a wide circle and they fell back used to her outbursts trent pulled me out of the way and i watched newt almost crouch over nick her robes covering his feet hes mine hes mine by rights his actions cost me a familiar and i claim him no nick cried out his hand reaching for me rachel please her head tilted newt waited one eye almost slitted shut as she looked at me i nodded and the demon laughed hauling him up and giving him a shake go wait for me she intoned and he stared panting in fear she gave him a shove and he stumbled vanishing as she flung him to her rooms i thought of him landing in the mockery of my kitchen and a tiny part of me felt the first hints of justice i jumped when als hand landed on my shoulder again he will be dead in a week the demon murmured his ashscented breath tickling my ear but i knew nick he was too ugly to die the sound of newts staff scraping on the stones was loud as she came forward to us demons were vanishing with their gargoyles in pairs and groups and the bite of windblown rock blew about my feet rising i closed my eyes when it reached my face and my hair began to stream behind me i didnt know what was going to happen tomorrow maybe i could take a day off it was an excellent hunt trent said and my eyes flew open to see him extending his hand to dali i am trenton aloysius kalamack i am not my ancestor dali looked at it then trent no you are not he said his hand unmoving but you come from the same place trents hand slowly dropped and he inclined his head in understanding perhaps later dali backed up a step his eyes touching mine and als i need to think on this a coating of everafter shimmered over him leaving the clear air of morning empty of him newt sighed and so it circles she said her black eyes coming to meet mine as the sun spilled over the rim of the everafter turning me a blood red it looks as if i wont be killing you this morning rachel you have been given a reprieve nodding i pulled the slaver ring off my finger and handed it to trent the two demons winced as trent removed his slave ring silent as he handed them back to me they were mine again and i could destroy them i was alive but what color was my soul chapter thirtyone there was no moon as i followed trent down the soft sawdust path of his private gardens it was silent but for the sighing of the wind in the tender new leaves and i could smell the cedar the path was made from small ferns laced the path tiny because theyd been above the earth for only a few weeks but i knew that by the end of the summer theyd be nearly as high as my knees i appreciate you coming out trent said a few steps ahead of me looking comfortable in his black pants and gray shirt his tie loose about his neck and no coat on against the slight chill i have a clear schedule but showing up at your church after midnight isnt prudent i thought of the news vans and nodded its not like i have anything on my plate i said staring up at the dark branches as my steps slowed no it had been very quiet the last week most days it was just jenks and me knocking about in the churchivy was spending a lot of time with nina trying to bring her back from the brink id gotten a lot done in the garden but i was bored to tears when trent had asked me to come over when id called to tell him i had the curse to mend his hand ready id jumped at the chance but i was more than a little curious as to why we hadnt done it in his office or private apartments maybe he wanted to make smores i could smell a wood fire somewhere business still slow he asked holding a dogwood branch heavy with last nights rain out of the way nonexistent but al is keeping me busy i had to force myself to move forward to duck under the branch and i didnt know why it wasnt trent he had been professional if somewhat quiet when hed met me at the kitchen entrance at the underground garage id never even seen the upstairs apartments having gone immediately to trents secondary office on the ground floor and out into the gardens from there it was nearing midnight and the public offices were deserted water spotted my shoulder when trent let the branch go a flower drifted down and i kept it feeling as if it had been a gift trent led the way the lamp in his hand swung sending beams of light into the wet leaves i shivered then stopped dead in my tracks when the path forked to the right was a narrow nothing to the left wellmanicured sawdust trent continued on down the right path and i wavered feeling the need to keep moving trent i said actually two steps down the wrong path confusion and nausea rose up and i stopped unable to go back what in hell oh sorry motions sharp trent came back and took my hand pulling me back to the smaller path theres a ward his fingers in mine were warm and my head came up the nausea vanished and i took a deep breath to keep people out i guessed feeling funny as he led me up the narrow crooked path as if i were a reluctant child my breath came in a quick heave and panic took me almost laughing trent gave a quick yank jerking me forward another step i stumbled gasping as a wave of energy passed over my aura wild magic sang in my veins setting my heart to thumping and then i was through halting i turned to look over my shoulder the main house was surprisingly close jenks and i had probably been within a stones throw of the ward when we had burgled trents office and wed never known the ward only hits you when you try to force your way in trent said otherwise youd never notice it at all breathless i pulled my hand from his you made it i said and he turned away my mother did his pace slower trent wove a path through the tall bushes i could see a little roof up ahead but little else she made the ward the spelling hut and pretty much everything in it the path opened up and i stopped beside him as he lifted the lantern high there in the soft glow of a candle was a small house made of stone and shingled with cedar moss grew on the roof and the door was painted red it felt abandoned but the glow of firelight flickered on the inside of the windows and smoke drifted up from the chimney clearly hed been out here earlier tonight i found it shortly after she died he said a faint smile quirking his lips made it into my own place to avoid jonathan its only been recently that ive been using it to spell in its remarkably secure i thought you might like to see it he lowered the lamp and i followed him to the wide slate stone that served as a threshold there was no lock and trent simply pushed the door open come on in he said as he went in before me and set the lamp on the small table beside the door his back was to me as i hiked my shoulder bag up and sent my gaze over everything to find it neat and tidy it was one room the walls covered in shelves holding ley line equipment books and pictures in frames two comfortable chairs were pulled up before the small fire on a kneehigh hearth and another beside one of the small windows a cot was half hidden behind a tapestry hanging from the ceiling all in all it was a nice getaway having none of the gadgetry id come to associate with trent but all his gardener earthiness that showed itself only in his orchid gardens ive not been here in weeks he said as i relaxed in the smokescented warmth except for earlier tonight of course its been quiet since quen took the girls and ellasbeth home my head came up i cant believe you let her have them i said feeling his depression even if it is short term you love those girls ellasbeth is such a ah i caught my words as trent took my coat and hung it on a hook behind the door bitch he said shocking me it was either that or invite her to stay here and im not ready for that his finger twitched and i bit back my advice to tell her to take a hike i knew he was going to marry her at some point everyone wanted it expected it theyll be back in april and quen is with them in the meantime were doing monthly exchanges until they get older and then we can start stretching it out he was trying to hide his distress but i could see right through it as he went to the fading fire and crouched before it for now i get them half the time ellasbeth the other his motions stirring the coals slowed i never knew what silence was before i go to the office come back to an empty apartment go back to the office or the stables he looked up i hope you dont mind but i dont feel so alone out here fewer reminders i nodded understanding it still hurt that ceri was gone i could only imagine how quiet his apartments were with no one there but the many reminders of her and the girls the warmth of the place was seeping into me and i came forward liking the old wooden planks and the dusty red woven rug sorry trent set the poker back and dropped a small birch log on the coals the bark flared and was gone quen will see theyre safe and that ellasbeth doesnt warp them too badly ive got my spells to work on until then and business of course hands in his pockets he looked over the small hut and i could see the long days stretching before him that the girls were gone wasnt exactly what i had been sorry about i scuffed the last of the dirt from my feet not knowing what to do trent made a neutral smile and excused himself to go to the small counter set under a dark window there was a teapot that made me think of ceri and i wasnt surprised when trents reaching hands hesitated shoulders stiffening he drew it closer and took the lid off and looked inside you want some coffee he said as i faced the fire to give him some privacy ive got some decent instant only if you want some i went to the shelves drawn by a tiny birch bark canoe that i recognized from camp a trophy with a horse on it was tucked behind it and a handdrawn picture of a flower behind that memories there was a halfburned birthday candle a bluejay feather and a dusty stalk of wheat tucked into a widemouthed handmade pot again from camp i frowned feeling as if i recognized it would my fingerprint match the one in the glaze i wondered afraid to bring it closer and see uncomfortable i sent my fingers to trace the spines of the books a combination of classic literature and world history the room smelled like magic the cedar mixing with the scent of cinnamon and ozone my aura tingled and i slipped into my second sight long enough to see that the tail end of the line that stretched from his public office to his private one nicked the edge of the little hut there was a circle there made of something that glittered black beside it was what i had to call a shrine curious i went to investigate smiling when i saw a blackandwhite photo of his mother tucked beside a lit candle and a small fingerbowl of fragrant ash on sudden impulse i set the flower i had found beside the candle my fingers brushed the candle as i pulled back and my head jerked up at the wash of warm sparkles that numbed it faint in my thoughts wild magic burbled and laughed and i curled my fingers under shes beautiful i said looking at the photo with my hands behind my back you can pick it up the soft sounds of his making coffee were pleasant in the extreme i tentatively reached for it finding the ornate silver frame surprisingly heavy it wasnt sparking wild magic so i took it to the fire to see it better dropping my bag on the floor and sitting on the edge of the seat to tilt the photo to the light trents mother was smiling squinting at the wind that had taken a wayward strand of her long hair behind her was a mountain i didnt recognize beside her looking just as wild and free was ellasbeths mother there were flowers in their hair and deviltry in their eyes id guess it was taken before they had come to cincinnati i wondered whod snapped the picture i found my lips curving up to smile back at them you have her face i said softly then flushed trent noisily put the lid on the teapot bringing it to the fire he set it on the hearth there was a kettle in his other hand moisture beading up on it as he set it on a hook and shoved it over the flames its going to take a while there is no electricity out here im in no hurry no electricity meant no way in or out when a circle was set this was more than a getaway it was a spelling fortress i suddenly realized trents eyes were on the photo and i stretched to set it back on the small table beside the candle do you bring people here often trent sat gingerly down in the other chair his eyes roved over the room trying to see it as i might be not often no not ever maybe by the looks of it and i waited for more grimacing when it became obvious there wasnt any ah so are you ready for the curse i said and his breathing hesitated a bare instant if you are he was annoyingly shortanswered tonight his mood closed and somewhat stiff but seeing as i was going to curse him i didnt blame himeven if the curse was going to fix his hand id stirred it myself under als eye and id admit that i was more than a little nervous trent slid back into the chair as i lifted my bag onto my lap and dug inside for my scrying mirror my fingertips tingled as i found it cramping up as i brought it out and set it on my knees i had prepped the curse over the course of the week storing it in als private space in the collective all i would have to do was tap a line find the collective and say the magic words to access it if this doesnt work i started and trent waved me to silence rachel you turned winona back into a human guise you can repair my fingers i wasnt so confident and i settled back then scooted forward the scrying mirror making my knees ache with the magic taking notice of where i was like a slime mold after the sun it stretched and dove for the tiny sliver of line that ran not five feet away it shouldnt hurt i added feeling my fingers slip as i started to sweat if it does just say the words of invocation again and it will reverse as long as it hasnt sealed yet okay he nodded and his jaw tightened i took a breath exhaling i gently reached for a line my fingers jerking on the glass as it spilled into me with an icy suddenness the lines had been painfully sharp since id dove through all of them almost as if their clarity had improved a hundredfold the glass hummed with a myriad of conversations whispers on the edge of my awareness drops and swells of power as demons went about their daily grind of fighting boredom the collective felt warm peaceful for once and i felt my eyes slip shut as the heat of the fire mixed with the blanket of spent adrenaline still holding the collective in a muzzy contentment oh if only it could last leaving the puddled warmth behind i willed a small part of my thoughts into als storeroom shocked when my muscles seemed to lose their focus a heavy lassitude filled me and i wondered if al was asleep id never encountered this when storing or accessing spells in als private space before the way the collective was set up was that private curses were stored in private spaces and public curses were stored where everyone could access them be they the stuff to get rid of warts or entire species use a public curse and you took on the smut for its creationplus whatever smut the maker tacked on to it it was how some demons tried to get rid of their smut a dubious attempt at best here i said brusquely feeling dizzy as i held out my hand across the space between us i didnt want to risk making a charm tailored to you specifically in case the identifying factor could be used against you so i need to touch you to focus the curse does it have to be my right hand he asked and i blinked trying to focus on him i felt half drunkwithout the mild euphoria it can be your foot for all that it matters i said and he scooted forward slipping his left hand into mine it was cold and i gripped it tighter non sum qualis eram i said to access the proper curse one hand in his the other on the mirror i stiffened as the energy spilled up through me shaking off the smut of the curses around it and shining with a dull gleam in my mind i pay the cost for this i thought wondering how i got to this point willingly taking the smut for a curse to help trent warm and chattering through my synapses like water around rocks the curse sped from my mind to my chi pulling energy along behind it until it dove through my hand and into trent his hand spasmed clenching hard enough on mine to hurt its done i said and he let go holding his right hand up to the flickering firelight my shoulders eased as i saw five fingers there five perfect fingers exhaling i flopped back into my chair relieved id used a modified healing curse to set his body back to the dna sample stored in the collective a memento of his time as a familiar it would have all the tweaking that his father had done not only preserving his life but extending it as well as fixing his hand i thought pleased that i could do this one thing it was good to be whole and unscarred and then i looked up at him and paled oh no the pleasure in trents expression hesitated as he saw my face what my mouth opened as i stared at his ears but i didnt quite know how to tell him and my face warmed his ears were pointed just like lucys and rays shit i thought that his dad had fixed them by tinkering with his dna not cropping them like a doberman um i started then jumped when the silver bell hanging suspended above the fireplace made a single beautiful peal of sound trent looked up startled and then we both flung ourselves backward from the heavy burst of burntambertainted air that exploded on the hearth i gasped as al popped into the room shrinking backward i pulled my legs up onto the chair trent had stood shoving his chair back nearly three feet as the demon in his crushed green velvet coat all but rolled into the fire arms and legs askew al i shouted when he came to a grunting halt then i cried al in a panic youre on fire his sleeve flaming he sat up blinking from behind his bluetinted glasses sitting halfway off his face oh look at that he slurred as he set a black bottle down to pat at his arm i am on fire get him out of here rachel trent said in a bad temper as he stood to the side his expression lost in the shadows this is intolerable i winced glancing at al when he began to giggle at the flames he was making dance on his fingertips im sorry i said as i unfolded myself from the chair really meaning it theres no reason for him to show up i turned to al al you need to leave now but the damage had already been done and it wasnt like i had a say in the matter dont want to go the demon slurred as he took a swig from the bottle and scooted to lean against the rock next to the firebox his knees pulled up and his head thrown back i heard you tap a line and i came for a visit its so quiet theres no one about no parties no one to flay to torture he blinked as if seeing the ceiling for the first time where am i i glanced at trent now moving quietly through the room gathering things up and shoving them into drawers the candle at the shrine was out oh my god i said peering closer at al youre drunk trent shoved a tiny window open in anger and al raised his bottle in salute no im not he protested then wait i am yes i am drunk you have no idea how hard it was to get to this marrrvelous state of disconnection wavering he looked past me to an open cupboard oh look theres more as i watched helplessly al staggered upright stumbling to a rack holding six bottles of white wine i hadnt noticed before at a loss i turned back to trent immediately seeing his ears this is elf wine al announced loudly and trent frowned oh rachel this stuff is toxic knock you on your ass where are we somewhere you shouldnt be i said frustrated trent had opened up to me showed me something important and fragile to him and i go and bring al into it that it was an accident didnt mean anything my gut hurt and seeing my scrying mirror i scooped it up and held it up to trent so he could see himself trent frowned at his redtinted reflection then his eyes went wide and he grabbed the mirror from me holding it closer tilting his head to see in the corner al began to laugh uproariously the bottle of elf wine lighter than when he had taken it she gave you your ears back little elf he said and i cringed the night had started out so nice too im sorry i said miserable i thought that your ears were changed at the cellular level genetically stunted i didnt know they had been surgically altered pointy ears pointyeared devil al said as trent held the mirror with one hand and felt his ear with the other this is good he added squinting at the bottle ha its your label i couldnt tell what trent was thinking and i cringed when he finally met my eyes i can change them back no this is fine he took a last look then handed the mirror to me um i like it he was lying and i hunched miserably into myself from the corner al said want me to cut them for you no trent exclaimed then shifted on his feet nervously this is good he said as if trying to convince himself ray and lucy have natural ears its fitting that i do too you sure he looked a little ill but he was smiling yes im sure thank you one foot cocked behind the other al leaned heavily on the counter and belched at least your hair will stop falling into your eyes with those huge wings of yours i stiffened they are not huge i said crossly trent dont listen to him theyre just right seriously i can fix them i said reaching to touch them trents hand on my wrist stopped me i like them he said and i froze letting go he retreated to his chair sitting down and unlacing his dress shoe what are you doing now al questioned listing heavily as he tucked another one of those bottles under his arm and staggered for the cot half hidden behind a curtain seeing if your circumcision is gone it is my expression went blank and trent hesitated a silk sock in his hand as he felt the underside of his big toe he looked at me and i put a hand to my mouth face flaming oh my god trent im sorry crap on toast could i screw this up any more um trent said clearly at a loss call me tomorrow al said seriously pointing at him with a bottle as he reclined on the cot ive got a curse that will take care of that ah i had a scar on my big toe trent said his thoughts clearly scattered it rubbed sometimes he put his sock back on the firelight making the creases in his forehead obvious unless you like the snake in a turtleneck look al said and i hung my head and massaged my temples ceri did but she was earthy in her desires delightful little animal she was al went suddenly still his breath rattling as if he was in pain ceri suddenly i understood that was why he was drunk but it didnt excuse als presence im so sorry i whispered mortified i didnt think she called it my purse of delight al was saying to the ceiling flopped back on the cot until only his legs showed beyond the curtain one foot on the cot the other draped down onto the floor a little sob came from him i should have freed her i should have freed her trent had turned away his steps long as he strode to the wine rack rachel have you tried my family label he asked almost frantic as he searched for a corkscrew its fairly palatable for having been grown at this latitude my father shoved a few more genes into a species or two for better sugar production hands shaking he poured white wine into a glass downing it in one go if i didnt know him better i would say he was babbling this was going really well and i glumly sat back down on the raised hearth my elbows on my knees and my head in my hands the kettle had begun to steam and i pushed it off the fire i didnt feel like coffee and by the looks of it neither did trent from behind the curtain al was either singing or crying i couldnt tell asking him to jump out probably wasnt a good idea the clink of glasses brought my head up and i wasnt surprised when trent gingerly sat next to me setting the glasses on the hearth between us and filling them both he misses ceri i said softly to which trent nodded his own eyes filled with a private heartache miss that little bitch al said the curtain fluttering as he tried to get up arm waving he managed it his eyes haunted his next words were lost when he saw the twin glasses one of which trent was handing to me his heartache deepened and he held his bottle high yes a toast to ceri his bottle sloshed as he shook it you were a most exceptional familiar his arm dropped and for a moment there was silence i should have freed you ceridwen perhaps you would have sung to me again if i had i thought of als blue butterflies and i set my drink down untasted the last thing i needed was to add a headache to this im sorry al i said my eyes welling up she was a familiar nothing more he slurred swinging the bottle why should i care but it was clear he did miss her ha he cried that elf woman was useless hardly able to warm my coffee in the morning pierce did a better job of keeping to my schedule i wouldnt take her back even if i could get that damned resurrection curse to work his head drooped and i hoped he would pass out soon she was forever waking me up in the morning crashing the cupboard doors the bitch beside me trent seemed to start she did that to me as well every time i tried to sleep in on the weekends then shed smile at me as if she didnt know shed woken me crashing about al said gesturing with the bottle making more noise than a box of squirrels she did it on purpose i tell you on purpose trent shook his head as we watched al begin to become unconscious the woman could stomp like an elephant trent said softly leaning to whisper in my ear and make me shiver quen threatened to smack her yes thrash her al said slumping back against the wall but she always had my coffee and toast to distract me his expression became serious you cannot thrash the person who makes you coffee its a rule somewhere blinking al slumped against the wall his hair pushing up behind him it was a sad day when she stopped singing you cant keep a caged bird no matter how beautiful she is maybe if i had freed her but she would have left me this is hell you know my rooms are so quiet i shifted on the raised hearth to build the fire up i had a feeling we might be here for a while and this was the only light source besides trents lantern in the window trent took a sip of his wine a brief flash of worry crossing him mine too trent barely breathed his sadness obvious al jerked forward in a sudden movement and trent started that is intolerable al said his feet flat on the floor and gesturing with his bottle before taking another gulp you must put yourself into the collective immediately so that we may converse poker in hand i half turned shocked trent too looked uneasy ah no no thank you head violently shaking back and forth al scooted forward on the cot nonsense we already have the wine rachel fetch my yew stylus it will take a moment my head came up at the slippery pull on the ley line and al frowned as things started popping into reality and falling to the floor i need to tell you the circumcision curse if nothing else he slurred blinking at the small vial of camphor that appeared in his fingers al i jumped at the dull crack of an empty scrying mirror hitting the ground inches from my foot then ducked when the demon threw a bag of sand from him in disgust al i shouted knock it off he doesnt want to be in the collective im flattered trent said with a false calm the fire flicking eerily behind him but i dont think the rest will appreciate it would you like another bottle of wine i wondered if he was trying to get him drunk enough to pass out until the sun rose seeing as al showed no sign of leaving sure enough his mouth on the bottle al nodded you helped kill kusox he said when he came up for air you dont think they remember that you can handle being in the collective he reached eagerly for the bottle trent was extending im not worried about handling it i think they wouldnt approve trent said fiddlesticks al said then cleared his throat adaperire he intoned carefully and i checked to see that my zipper was up when the cork flew out of the bottle he might be drunk but he still had control and it was right where it belonged elves used to be part of the collective al said as he winced at the first harsh swallow just because there havent been any for the last five thousand years doesnt mean it cant be done you can access the old curses then protect yourself youre going to need it the old ways are ending embrace the new elves and demons living together he blinked oh god were all going to die standing beside the cot trent took the empty bottle from al no thank you but no here al reached out for the cracked scrying mirror and i handed it to him wishing he would go to sleep draw the figures elf man draw it pick a name we can use your marvelous wine ceri be useful and go fetch some salt my heart clenched but kneeling beside the fire as i was i didnt question why hed called me that go to sleep al i said my own sorrow rising you want to be prince of the elves or not al said wavering where he sat royalty always conversed with demons before they were wed its tradition its how i tricked ceri into loving me youre not married are you on the side perhaps in montana trent grimaced i need to think up a good name i promise when i get a good name that no one can think of i will why dont you rest for a minute al delicately belched and sighing heavily he leaned back into the shadows until his black eyes glowed from the dark capital idea good idea clever clever elf we will wait you pick out a name then call me the fire snapped and then from the cot came a long rattling snore trent cautiously tried to take the bottle from al giving up when it began to glow leaving it in als grip he turned to me and shrugged i think hes out i am so sorry embarrassed i got up from the fire and began to collect the stuff that al had popped in from his kitchen i had no idea hed feel the curse much less come and see what i was doing trent handed me the bag of sand he probably has never dealt with grief he said and i set it with the rest too much of it rather he was married once only the demons who knew how to love survived the making of the everafter shocked trent looked from me to al and back again i didnt know that a long snore came from behind the curtain and a soft mumble trent sat down in his chair clearly reluctant to leave al here alone do you think he can resurrect ceri ive tried my chest hurt and i sat in the chair next to him where we could both watch the fire and al both no ive tried several times too pierce as well theyve moved on im happy for them but it hurts i hadnt been able to summon my father or kisten either trent was rubbing his new pinkie with his thumb in introspection quen will be hurting for a long time thats why i insisted he go with the girls and as a buffer for ellasbeth hearing more in that statement than he was saying i turned to him how about you me he looked at the bottle in als grip then topped off his glass with the bottle on the hearth between us im not the one ceri loved he said but i could hear his regret i waved off his offer to refill my untouched glass and when i remained silent he added i liked her but i didnt love her she was too proud to love me distant and you need someone more earthy i said only half kidding al snorted there was a clunk and the wine bottle rolled out from behind the curtain it sloshed to a halt at trents foot and he reached for it a little spontaneity would be nice he said touching my foot by accident when he set als bottle next to ours i already miss her and her elegant demands and flashing indignity you couldnt tell the woman no not that al mumbled in his sleep hes going to need that later im angry at her unnecessary death it hurts seeing quen grieve and know its partially my fault trent added his jaw tight and his gaze unfocused the scent of cinnamon was rising mixing with the scent of burnt amber and woodsmoke it almost made the burnt amber smell nice im sorry for this trent said softly im sorry for everything this wasnt like trent at all but i wasnt surprised to see it i was upset about ceri and pierce but i hadnt been planning on a life with either of them as trent had with ceriin some disjointed separate fashion alone he had always planned on being alone but never this apart even with ellasbeth he would be alone i felt bad for him it wasnt fair none of it it wasnt your fault i said shifting to look at him there wasnt much space between us but it seemed uncrossable maybe someday ill believe you he said his brow furrowed in the firelight rachel i asked you here tonight for more than getting my fingers back panic slid through me what he grimaced clearly annoyed that al was snoring in the corner we couldve done this anywhere but i wanted you to see me to see this he said gesturing at the room i wanted you to know where i came from what i am under the choices i make my heart pounded what did you do i asked terrified almost exhaling he looked at his watch the crystal catching the light to make time vanish then he scared me even more when he drank his glass dry and filled it again i made a big mistake by not telling you why i thought the slavers were the better choice i know i interrupted and his brow furrowed by the goddess will you shut up he said and from behind the curtain al mumbled something a little rocking horse with wings popped into existence crashing into the ceiling before falling to the floor to quiver and go still listen to me he said and i swallowed my words the rosewood babies are going to start dying next week he said and my breath caught if nothing changes by this time next month you and lee will again be the only survivors of the rosewood syndrome but you fixed them i said appalled yes and no trent said after he topped his glass off again i had to fix their genome to ensure kusox would hold to his end of the bargain and not harm lucy but i worked in a small error that wouldnt express itself until it was replicated sufficiently i couldnt risk that he would get his way if he killed me horrified i stared at him he met my gaze levelly you killed them the babies i whispered and he shook his head not yet what do you mean not yet feeling betrayed i stood trent they are all someones child i exclaimed and al snorted in his sleep mumbling trent looked up agitated i mean not yet rachel the world isnt ready for them i cocked my hip the fire warm behind me when is the world ever ready for change trent when setting his glass down trent eyed me bitter resignation behind his frustration what will happen if they live hapa knows they exist the only reason you survived was because you can defend yourself you want me to give the children to the demons to raise he stood and i dropped back as he began to pace or perhaps you want me to hide them and their families i could do it but you know the demons will find them and one by one a demon wanting to see the sun and escape the everafter will either steal them outright or take over their bodies eyes flashing he pointed at me his hand wrapped around a wineglass i will not allow a parent to love a child who is murdering his pets and performing ghastly magic not wanting to believe that their child died five years ago and they are raising a fivethousandyearold sadistic demon until their childs neural pathways are developed enough to work the lines they are not meant to be frustrated he turned to the window taking an angry drink the firelight flickering on him from the cot not a sound escaped but i didnt care if al was listening but they are here i said softly grasping his arm so he would look at me trent they are trent shook his head even as he met my eyes i thought you might say that if it was up to me id choose the hard path with the easy ending not the easy path with the hard end i drew back what do you mean its not up to you taking a last drink trent set his empty glass on the windowsill exhaling he scrubbed his face with a hand hesitating to look at his five perfect fingers what would you choose the fervent emotion in his gaze as his eyes met mine scared me me i want you to decide he said looking a little unsteady not because it impacts your species but because i want you there with me my heart pounded i didnt know what he meant he wanted me there with him stumbling slightly he went to sit on the raised hearth snagging a new bottle on the way if you make the decision you have to be there to help me with the fallout he said working the corkscrew with a professional flair either they die naturally or i continue the cure and the twentyyear battle to hide them until they can defend themselves the cork came out with a pop and he looked at his glass halfway across the room on the sill shocked i stared at him he wanted me to decide he wanted me to make a decision that he would have to live by giving up he drank right from the bottle i dont want to be alone anymore rachel he said and if you make the choice you have to help me see it through i want them to live i said softly and he slumped his disgust obvious when his bottle clinked against the floor what you asked my opinion and thats it youre not going back now that it wasnt anything you wanted to hear no trent eyed me sourly it would be easier the other way smirking i crossed the room and sat down beside him taking the bottle he handed me i poured a swallow in my glass if it was easy everyone would do it he finished clinking his bottle to my glass and downing a swig what about ellasbeth i said my expansive mood hesitating trent didnt look at me what about her i thought of the distasteful woman on a plane to the west coast right now but shed be back worming her way into elven politics arent you supposed to be getting married to her drawing away he looked sideways at me the fire was warm on our backs and his focus was starting to go distant this is a business arrangement nothing more well thats what i thought i said quickly and from behind the curtain al started to snore but she doesnt like me so i thought about that for a moment you are drunk i said as he tried to get the bottle to balance on the rim of its base his eyes came to mine i am not he said and i caught it as it began to tip but i will be before the night ends i took another sip actually tasting it this time id have a migraine in about an hour but i didnt care you know the last time we shared a bottle you wiped the top off trent said red pop i guessed smiling at a memory and he nodded you remember are the rings gone i swung the bottle between my knees and my gaze slid to al snoring behind the curtain al and i destroyed them i said melted them so they couldnt be reinvoked you have a problem with that trent shook his head and reached for the bottle no it was nice being able to reach your thoughts though you have nice thoughts a smile curved my lips up and i leaned away so i could see him better you are drunk i am not drunk he shifted closer and i didnt mind im bored out of my mind i took another sip this is good i said and he acknowledged it gracefully i know what you mean about the quiet i went on jenkss kids are scattering hell be down to six kids by fall ivy is spending most of her time with nina im starting to think about finding a new apartment somewhere with jenks really i shrugged and passed the bottle to him i dont know i like it at the church but things have changed if i wasnt there ivy might ask nina to move in one vampire in the church is okay two is asking for trouble even for a demon trent set the bottle aside almost out of his reach you dont think you could handle it thinking about what cormel had said i shrugged oh sure but people talk they do dont they trent said around a sigh and my thoughts turned to ellasbeth seriously he could do better than that nick was too scruffy for you even when he wasnt a demon toady he said then surprising me marshal didnt have enough chutzpah to keep up with the elegance youre capable of pierce was a firstgeneration model in a sixg worldnovel but really how far would you get before the software crashed the system kisten trents fingers shifted in agitation kisten was an interesting choice the reminder of pierce hurt but it felt good to think of him and smile youre critiquing my exboyfriends he made a small noise of agreement i like people most of the time i can figure them out you dont make any sense what are you looking for rachel drawing my knees up i rocked back and forth before the fire i dont know someone smart powerful who doesnt take crap from anyone who are you looking for trent raised a hand in protest scooting an inch or two from me no no no im not going to play this game hey you started it give just pretend were in camp someone funny capable sexy to balance out his strict life i didnt bring looks into it how like a man trent chuckled this is my list not yours someone who wont see lovers in the shadows when im late for an appointment someone who can break a schedule and a nail and not worry about it but still look good in a dress and not be late for everything i looked across the room seeing nothing i want someone who will let me do my job without talking me out of it maybe give me a gun for my birthday once in a while someone not afraid of the money the press trent said someone who wont get caught in the trap that money makes someone who can do his own magic so he could survive the mess of my life i finished getting depressed you live in a church i live in a prison trent became silent it would never work between us i said thinking we had strayed onto dangerous ground from the cot al snorted in his sleep mumbled about pie and went silent youre great to work with rachel but we have nothing in common reassured i let go of my knees and stretched them out palms on the warm hearth beside me thats what im saying you live in a big house i live in a church and yet i am sitting in his little playhouse drinking wine we dont know any of the same people i reached across him for the wine stretching as i thought of the mayor the demons rynn cormel we dont go in the same circles at all i said as i leaned back and took a swallow but i had fit in at the casino boat and his parties people would talk he said softly and i set the empty bottle down the firelight had turned his hair as red as mine which is a shame i like working closely with you god why is it so hard to tell you that i compliment people all the time on their work ethics rachel i like working with you youre fast and inventive and not always looking for direction this was going somewhere i wasnt sure i liked trent i started glancing at the curtain when al choked on his own spit and then began to snore again no let me finish he said a hand going firmly down on the stone between us do you know how tiring it gets mr kalamack should we do this or that have you weighed all the factors mr kalamack even quen hesitates and it drives me batty sorry you on the other hand just go and do what you think needs to be done if i cant keep up you dont care i like that im glad youre going to help me with the rosewood demons yeah i said wondering if he had any more of that wine stashed somewhere thats what you say now but wait until they start playing with the ley lines my god you have beautiful hair in the firelight he said softly and i blinked its like your thoughts all cinnamon and wild untamed ive always liked your hair i froze when he reached out and touched it my breath slipping from me when his fingers grazed my neck slowly i reached up and took his hand bringing it down okay we need to get you inside mr kalamack i said thinking that he had had way too much to be comfortable saying what he was doing what he was come on stand up ill stay here with al so he doesnt steal the picture of your mom i stood still holding his hand and gently pulling him up with me a part of me wanted this but the smarter wiser part knew it was a mistake i am not drunk trent said firmly standing before me without a waver to his stance i dont need to be drunk to say you have nice hair a flutter lifted through me and i shoved it away and i do not want to go back to my apartments he said i want to go for coffee al isnt going to wake up his eyes were on mine and my heart pounded when he let them drop to my lips i am not drunk i wouldnt care if you were trents arms were around me and they felt right no i want you to know that i do not need to be drunk to kiss you um i started heart pounding more when he leaned in slowly hesitantly stopping just shy of my lips all i had to do was lift my chin breath held i did with a gentle pressure our lips met his hands slipped more firmly about me and i held myself back not afraid but wanting to feel everything slowly as i leaned in tasting the wine on him feeling the warmth of his body pressing into mine breathing in our scents that were mingling and changing with the warmth my hands rose to find his hair and i relaxed into him as the silky strands brushed through my fingers i wanted more and i leaned into him as our lips moved against each other i pushed him off balance and he took a step back our lips parting even as he pulled me to him closer yet as i stumbled forward into him the rush of the kiss pounded through me and i stared at him breathless seeing in his eyes that he was not drunk he was stonecold sober and it scared me why did you do that i whispered he half smiled and tucked a strand of hair behind my ear i dont know he said his grip on me becoming more sure but im going to do it again oh god yes i thought and then he pulled me into him the tingle of the nearby line danced at the edge of my awareness and as his hands hinted at rising up to find my breasts i loosened my hold on the energy in my chi to send a dart of energy balancing between us hinting at more trents lips on mine hesitated then became more demanding passion ran through me heart pounding i jerked as his back found the wall it was intoxicating and realizing i wanted to reach behind his waistband i stopped breathless i backed up from him the warmth from his lips slowly cooled my lungs heaved and i stared at him not as shocked as i thought i would be this isnt going to work i said scared youre going to get married to ellasbeth and be what everyone needs you to be he reached out and slowly pulled me to him tense i stood as he ran a hand through my hair my eyes closing i tilted my head to feel his fingers on my face reaching up i took his hand in mine leaving a kiss in his palm as i curved his fingers around it and lowered his hand between us yes i know he said coming closer until our hands pressed between both of us and i trembled as he kissed my cheek my passion pulled to the breaking point i opened my eyes as i felt him draw away i wanted this but i knew better you want to go for a coffee he said shocking me themenwhodontbelong might be there or a demon catching a cup of caffeine i hear they will give a lot for a good cup of joe al isnt going to wake up until long after sunrise slowly my pounding heart began to ease or maybe we can just talk trent smiled we can try he said taking up the lantern and opening the door cool night air spilled in but it did nothing to dampen the memory of his hands on me touching my skin bringing tingles to
