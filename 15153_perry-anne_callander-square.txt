anne perry callander square one the autumn air hung mild and faintly misty and the grass in callander square was dappled yellow with fallen leaves in the late afternoon sun in the small garden in the center of the square two men stood with spades looking down into a shallow hole the taller of them bent down and put his hands into the damp soil searching gingerly he brought up the article he sought a small bloody bone the other breathed out noisily what dyer reckon it is then too big to be a bird pet the first replied someone buried a dog or the like the shorter man shook his head they didnt oughter do that he looked disparagingly at the pale georgian facades rearing up in severe elegance beyond the lacy birch leaves and the limes they got gardens for that sort of thing they oughter have more respect it musta bin a small dog the taller man turned the bone over in his hand maybe a cat a cat go on gentlemen dont ave cats and ladies dont go digging in gardens wouldnt know a spade if it up an bit em must a bin a servant cook most like still didnt oughter do it he shook his head to emphasize his point like animals i do a pet what as done er service in the ouse oughter be buried proper not where peoples going to go and dig er up again unknowing like they mightnt a thought we was going to dig ere its years since we put anything new in this bit wouldnta done now except we got this bush give us well wed better put it somewhere else a bit over to the left praps leave the poor little thing in peace it aint right to disturb the dead even animals dare say someone cared for it kept someones kitchen clean o mice cant put it to the left yer gawp well kill the forsythia you watch yer tongue put it to the right then cant that rhodething grows like a house it does got to put it ere then put the cat under the rhodething dig it up proper and ill do the burying right he put his spade where he judged it would bring the body up in one piece and set his weight on it the earth came up easily soft with loam and leaf mold and fell away the two men stared oh gawd almighty the spade fell from his hands oh gawd save us whatwhatis it its not a cat ii think its a baby oh holy mother what do we do wed better get the police yeah he let the spade down slowly very gently as if somehow even now it mattered you going the other stared at him no no ill stay ere you go and get a constable and urry itll be dark soon yeah yeah he was galvanized into action desperately relieved to have something to do above all something that would take him away from the hole in the ground and the bloody little mess on the spade the constable was young and still new to his beat the great fashionable squares overawed him with their beautiful carriages their matched pairs of liveried footmen and armies of servants he found himself tonguetied when he was required to speak to them the magisterial butlers the irascible cooks the handsome parlormaids the bootboys the scullery maids and the tweenies were much more his class when he saw the hole in the ground and the gardeners discovery he knew it was totally beyond him and with horror and relief told them to wait where they were move nothing and ran as fast as his legs would carry him to the police station to hand the whole thing over to his inspector he burst into the office abandoning his manners in the excitement mr pitt sir mr pitt theres been a dreadful thing sir a terrible thing pitt was standing by the window a big man with long curved nose and humorous mouth he was plain to a degree and quite incredibly untidy but there was intelligence and wit in his face he raised his eyebrows at the constables precipitate entrance and when he spoke his voice was beautiful what sort of dreadful thing mcbeath the constable gasped he could not utter a coordinated sentence for his lack of breath a bodysir in callander square pitiful sirit is they just found it nowthe gardenersdug it up in the middle planting a tree or something pitts face puckered in surprise callander square are you sure you havent got lost again have you yes sir no sir right in the middle callander square sir im positive youd better come and see buried pitt frowned what sort of body a baby sir mcbeath closed his eyes and suddenly he looked quite ill a very small baby sir like newborn i think reminds me of my kid sister when she was born pitt breathed out very slowly a sort of private sigh sergeant batey he said loudly the door opened and a uniformed man looked in yes sir get an ambulance and doctor stillwell and come to callander square someone been attacked sir his face brightened robbed no probably only a domestic tragedy a domestic tragedy mcbeaths voice rose in outrage its murder batey stared at him probably not pitt said calmly probably some wretched servant girl seduced kept it to herself and gave birth alone and the child died shed bury it and tell no one nurse her grief to herself so she wouldnt be put out on the streets with no job and no character to get another god knows how many times it happens mcbeath looked pale and pinched do you think so sir i dont know pitt answered him going toward the door but it wouldnt be the first time nor the last wed better go and see it took pitt the last half hour of daylight to look at the little body poke round in the crumbly soil to see if there were anything else to help identify it and find the second misshapen cold little body he sent the doctor and the ambulance away with them both and a shaking whitefaced mcbeath home to his rooms then batey and his men to post guard in the gardens there was nothing else he could do that night until the doctor had given him some information how old the babies had been how long ago they had died as near as could be estimated and if possible what had been wrong with the second deeper buried one to cause that misshapen skull it was too much to hope they could tell now from what they had died he arrived at his own home in the dark and the fine clinging dampness of fog the yellow gaslights were welcoming promising warmth not only to the body but to the mind and the raw vulnerable feelings he stepped inside with an acute sense of pleasure that nearly two years of marriage had not mellowed in the spring of he had been called to the horrifying case of the cater street hangman the mass murderer of young women who garroted them and left their swollenfaced bodies in the dark streets in that dreadful circumstance he had met charlotte ellison of course at that time she had treated him with the dignified coolness any such wellbred young woman would use toward a policeman who was rather lower in the social scale than a moderately good butler but charlotte was a girl of terrifying honesty not only toward others causing a social chaos but toward herself also she had acknowledged her love for him and found the courage to defy convention and accept him in marriage they were poor startlingly so compared with the considerable comfort of her fathers home but with ingenuity and her usual forthrightness she had dispensed with most of the small status symbols without which her erstwhile friends would have considered themselves bereft occasionally when his feelings were raw on the matter she joked that the relief from pretense was a pleasure to her and perhaps it was at least half true now she came from the small drawing room with its sparse wellpolished furniture and autumn flowers in a glass vase her dress was one she had brought with her wine colored a little out of fashion now but her face glowed and the lamplight picked out all the warm mahogany tones in her hair he felt a quick surge of joy almost of excitement as he saw her and reached out immediately to touch her to kiss her after a moment she pulled back looking at him what is it she asked with a lift of anxiety in her voice in the quick enveloping warmth of meeting he had forgotten callander square now the memory returned he would not tell her heaven knew after cater street there was little of horror that she could not cope with but there was no need to distress her with this she was quick to sympathythe little bodies whether crime or simple tragedy would stir her imagination to all the pain the isolation and fear whatever lonely terrible thoughts had possessed the mother what is it she repeated he put his arm round her and turned her back to the drawing room or perhaps parlor would have been a less pretentious name for it in so small a house a case he replied in callander square it will probably prove to be very little but tedious in the proof what have we for dinner ive been outside and im hungry she did not press him again and he spent a slow sweet evening by the fire watching her face as she bent in concentration over her sewing a piece of linen worn beyond its strength over the years there would be much patching and making do many meals without meat and when the children came handmedown clothes but it all seemed only a comfortable labor now he found himself smiling in the morning it was different he left early when the october mist still clung round the damp leaves and there was no wind he went to the police station first to see if doctor stillwell had anything to tell him stillwells dour face was even longer than usual he looked at pitt sourly bringing with his presence an immediate reminder of death and human mutability pitt felt the warmth slip away the comfort he had woken with well he asked grimly first one quite normal as far as i can tell stillwell said quietly which isnt very far been dead about six months i should judge poor little thing cant tell you whether it was born dead or died within a day or two nothing in the stomach he sighed cant even tell you if it died naturally or was killed suffocation would be easy leave no marks it was a girl by the way pitt took a deep breath what about the other the one lower down been dead a lot longer nearer two years from what i can tell again thats pretty much of a guess and again i dont know whether it was born dead or died within a few days but it was abnormal i can tell you beyond doubt i could see that myself what caused it dont know congenital not an injury in birth would there be something in the parents history not necessarily we dont know what causes these things children like that can be born to anyone even in the best families its just that they more often manage to keep it quiet pitt thought for a few moments could that be what it was a matter of social embarrassment what about the top one he looked up at stillwell was that one deformed as well anything wrong with its brain stillwell shook his head not that i could see but of course if it were going to become mentally defective there would be no way of telling at that age it was no more than a few days old at the most it could even have been born dead he frowned although i dont think so there wasnt anything i could see to cause death heart lungs and intestines seemed quite normal but of course it was to some extent decomposed i really dont know pitt youll just have to make your own inquiries and see what you can find out thank you there was nothing else to say pitt collected batey and in silence they set out in the misty morning the treelined streets smelling of rotting leaves and damp stone callander square was deserted the sightseers such a discovery might have provoked elsewhere were abashed to invade its elegant pavements there was no sign of life in the great houses except the whisk of a broom on an area step and the hollow sound of a footman stamping his boots it was too early for errand boys the cooks and parlormaids would barely have finished serving breakfast to the later risers pitt went to the nearest house up the steps and knocked discreetly at the door then stepped back several minutes later it was opened by a wellbuilt darkly handsome footman he looked at pitt with heavylidded supercilious eyes years of training had taught him to sum up a man even before he opened his mouth he knew instantly that pitt was a little better than a tradesman but far from being a man of birth let alone a gentleman yes sir he inquired with a faint lift of his voice inspector pitt police pitt met his eye levelly i would like to speak to the mistress of the house the footmans face was impassive i am not aware that we have suffered any burglaries perhaps you have come to the wrong house this is the residence of general balantyne and lady augusta balantyne indeed i did not know that but it is the situation of the house that makes it of concern to me may i come in the footman hesitated pitt stood his ground ill see if lady augusta will see you the footman conceded reluctantly you had better come in you can wait in the morning room i shall discover if her ladyship has finished her breakfast it was a long irritating half hour before the morning room door opened and lady augusta balantyne came in she was a handsome woman with bone china elegance of feature and dressed in expensive and classic taste she looked at pitt without curiosity max says that you wish to see me mrer pitt yes maam if you please what about pray pitt looked at her she was not a woman with whom to prevaricate he plunged straight in yesterday evening two bodies were dug up in the gardens in the middle of the square lady augustas eyebrows rose in disbelief in callander square dont be ridiculous bodies of what mrer pitt he repeated babies maam the bodies of two newborn babies were found buried in the gardens one was about six months ago the other nearer to two years oh dear she was visibly distressed how very tragic i suppose some maidservantto the best of my knowledge it is no one in my household but of course i shall make inquiries if you wish i would prefer to do it myself maam with your permission he tried to make it affirmative as though he were assuring her agreement rather than asking her permission naturally i shall be calling at all the houses in the square of course my offer was merely a matter of courtesy if you discover anything that involves my household naturally you will inform me again it was a statement and not a question authority sat on her easily long a familiar garment and she had no need to display it he smiled acknowledgment but he did not commit himself in words she reached for the bell and rang it the butler appeared hackett mr pitt is from the police there have been two babies found in the gardens he will be questioning the servants in all the houses will you please find him a quiet room where he can speak to any of the staff he wishes and see that they make themselves available yes my lady hackett looked at pitt with distaste but obeyed precisely thank you lady augusta pitt inclined his head and followed the butler to a small room at the back which he supposed to be the housekeepers sitting room he obtained a complete list of the female staff and the essentials of information about each one he did no more than speak to them this time everyone showed shock dismay pity and everyone equally denied all knowledge it was exactly what he had expected he was in the hall looking for either the butler or one of the footmen to say he was finished for the time being when he saw another young woman coming out of one of the doorways there was no possibility she was a servant far more suggestive of her position than her silk gown or her beautifully dressed and coiffed hair was the hint of swagger in her walk the half smile on her fulllipped little mouth the sureness the suppressed excitement in her dark fringed eyes goodness she said with mock surprise who are you she raked him up and down with an amused blue glance you cant be calling on one of the maids at this hour have you come to see father are you an old batman or something only charlotte had ever shaken pitts composure and that was because he loved her he looked back at this girl steadily no maam i am from the police i have been speaking to some of your servants from the police her voice rose in delight how perfectly shocking whatever for information he smiled very slightly that is always what the police speak to people for i have a suspicion you are laughing at me her eyes were bright mr inspector pitt inspector pitt she repeated i am christina balantyne but i suppose you knew that what are you asking questions about has there been a crime pitt was saved from having to compose an answer at once civil and uncommunicative by the breakfast room door opening and a man coming out whom pitt assumed to be general balantyne he was tall nearly as tall as pitt himself but tighter knit of stiffer bearing his face was smoothboned lean and aquiline it was a striking head too arrogant to be handsome too strong of jaw and teeth christina he said sharply she turned yes papa the policemans business with the servants can hardly be of interest to you have you no letters to write or sewing to do the question was academic it was a dismissal she accepted it with a straight back and stiff lip pitt hid a smile and bowed his head fractionally thank you sir he said to the general after she had gone i was unsure how to answer her without distressing her with unpleasant facts it was something less than the truth but it served well for the moment the general grunted have you finished yes sir i was looking for the butler to say so discover anything the general looked at him with quick intelligent eyes not yet but i have only just begun who lives next door he gestured toward the south side of the square reggie southeron next to us the general replied then young bolsover at the end on this side garson campbell on the other leatitia doran opposite southeron opposite us on the far side is vacant at the moment has been for a couple of years sir robert carlton on the far side and an elderly fellow called housmann a complete recluse has no women in the house hates them all male staff thank you sir most helpful ill try mr southeron next balantyne took a sharp breath then let it out pitt waited but he did not add anything the southeron house was busierhe heard the light laughter of children even before he had reached for the bellpull it was opened by one of the handsomest parlormaids he had ever seen yes sir she said with perfect formality good morning i am inspector pitt from the police may i speak to either mr or mrs southeron she stepped back if you would like to come in sir ill inquire if they will see you he followed her into the hall beautifully furnished but less spartan than the balantynes there were baubles on the hangings richly upholstered chairs and even a doll sitting carelessly on a small side table he watched the straight back of the parlormaid and the becoming little twitch of her skirt as she walked he smiled to himself then hoped with a sudden acute stab of pity that she was not the one that it was not the result of her seduction her brief yielding to passion buried out there under the trees she showed him into the morning room and left him he heard a scampering of feet on the stairsa tweeny maid or a child of the house there was probably little difference in age some girls began their life in service at no more than eleven or twelve the door burst open and a thin blueeyed little face looked in her total composure proclaimed her immediately as a daughter of the house her hair was tied up in ringlets and her skin was scrubbed clean good morning pitt said solemnly good morning she replied letting the door swing open a little farther her eyes still fixed on his face you have a very elegant house he said to her with courtesy as if she had been an adult and the house hers are you the mistress she giggled then straightened her face with quick recollection of her position no im chastity southeron i live here since my mama and papa died papa was uncle reggies brother who are you my name is thomas pitt im an inspector of police she let out her breath in a long sigh has somebody stolen something not as far as i know have you lost something no but you can question me she came into the room i might be able to tell you something it was an offer he smiled im sure you could tell me a great deal that is interesting but i dont know what questions to ask yet oh she made as if to sit down but the door opened again and reginald southeron came in he was a wide man fleshyfaced and comfortable chastity he said with goodhumored exasperation jemima will be looking for you you should be at your lessons go upstairs this moment jemima is my governess chastity explained to pitt i have to do lessons are you coming back chastity southeron repeated she dropped a tiny curtsey to pitt and fled upstairs southerons attitude stiffened slightly but the good humor did not leave him mary ann says you are from the police he sounded faintly disbelieving is that so yes sir again there was no point in circumlocution and pitt explained his visit as simply as he could oh dear reggie southeron sat down quickly his rather florid face paling what ana he changed his mind and began again what a shocking affair he said with more composure how very distressing i assure you i know nothing that could be of help to you naturally pitt agreed hypocritically he looked at the mans wide mouth sensuous jowls and soft wellmanicured hands no doubt he knew nothing of the bodies in the square but if he knew nothing of their conception it might be more by good fortune than intent but i would like your permission to interview your staff he asked my staff the momentary discomposure returned belowstairs gossip is invaluable pitt said easily even those who are in no way involved may know something a word here or there of course yes yes i suppose so well if you must but i should be obliged if you would not upset them more than is absolutely necessary so difficult to get good staff these days im sure you understandnonoof course notyou wouldnt he was oblivious of patronage very well i suppose it is unavoidable ill get my butler to see to it he hauled himself to his feet and went out without saying anything further pitt spoke to all the staff one by one informed the butler and took his leave it had occupied the best part of the morning and it was already time for lunch in the afternoon he returned to the square it was two oclock when he knocked at the third door which according to general balantyne should be that of dr and mrs frederick bolsover during lunch he had seen stillwell again and asked him if he knew of bolsover professionally hardly in my category stillwell had pulled a face probably makes more in a month than i do in a year must do to live in callander square society doctor comforting a lot of hypochondriac ladies who have nothing more interesting to do than contemplate their health nice practice if you have the patience and the manners and from what i hear bolsover has good family good start all the right connections good doctor pitt had asked no idea stillwells eyebrows had gone up does it matter not in the least i should think the bolsovers door was opened by a somewhat surprised parlormaid small and pert but in her own way almost as attractive as the last one of course parlormaids were chosen for their looks this one regarded pitt with some dismay he was not the sort of person admitted to the front door and this was not the time of day for callers he was at least an hour to an hour and a half early and it was usually ladies who called for the afternoon social ritual yes sir she said after a moment good afternoon may i speak with mrs bolsover if she is at home my name is pitt i am from the police the police if i may he moved to step inside and she retreated nervously mrs bolsover is expecting callers the maid said quickly i dont think its important pitt insisted please ask her the girl hesitated he knew she was concerned in case he was still there when the lady callers arrived thus embarrassing her mistress after all respectable people did not have the police in the house at all let alone at the front door the sooner you ask her the more quickly i shall be able to finish my business pitt pointed out persuasively she saw his argument and scurried off to comply anything to get him off the doorstep sophie bolsover was a pretty woman not unlike her own parlormaid had the girl been dieted a little dressed in silk and her hair curled and coiffed good afternoon she said quickly polly says you are from the police yes maam he respected her social embarrassment and explained his business as rapidly as possible then asked her permission to speak to her servants as he had done in the other houses it was granted hastily and he was almost physically bundled into the housekeepers parlor to conduct his inquiries safely out of sight he began with the parlormaid polly to leave her free for her afternoon duties as soon as the first caller should arrive he learned nothing but names and faces he would store them all in his mind consider them rule out the impossibilities perhaps the sheer tension the presence of the police in the house would frighten someone into indiscretions mistakes or perhaps they would never find out what sordid affair or private tragedy of love and deceit lay behind the small deaths the campbells and the dorans were as general balantyne had said not in residence at the moment he passed the vacant house ascertained that the reclusive housmann did indeed employ only menservants and it was after four oclock when he knocked at the last doorthat of sir robert and lady carlton it was opened by a startled parlormaid yes sir inspector pitt from the police he knew he was intruding as it was the most inconvenient of all times to call the time when the rigid etiquette of the social hierarchy was observed to the letter the intricacies of rank whether one called to visit or merely left a card whether calls were acknowledged returned who spoke to whom and on what terms to have the police at such a time was unforgettable he endeavored to make his presence as inoffensive as possible they could not have been taken by surprise backdoor gossip would long ago have reached them carrying his purpose whom he had seen what had been asked probably even a minute description of him and an acute assessment of his precise social status the parlormaid took a deep breath you had better come in she stepped back surveying him with anxiety and disapproval as if he might have brought crime in with him like a disease come through to the back well find a place for you the mistress cant see you of course she has callers lady townshend she added with pride pitt was ignorant of lady townshends importance but he endeavored to look suitably impressed the parlormaid saw his expression and was mollified ill get mr johnson she added hes the butler thank you pitt sat down where she pointed and she swept out at home charlotte pitt had attended to the ordering of her house which took her no more than an hour then had immediately dispatched her single housemaid to purchase a daily newspaper so that she might discover what it was that pitt would not tell her previous to her marriage she had been forbidden by her father to read such things like most other men of breeding he believed them vulgar and totally unsuitable for women after all they carried little else but crime and scandal and such political notions as were undesirable for the consideration of women as well of course as intellectually beyond them charlotte had had to indulge her interest by bribery of the butler or with the connivance of her brotherinlaw dominic corde she smiled now to think how she had loved dominic in those days when sarah was still alive the smile vanished sarahs death still hurt and the passion for dominic had long ago cooled to friendship she had been shocked and dismayed to discover she was in love with this awkward and impertinent policeman who had told her so disturbingly of a world she had never previously acknowledged a world of petty crime and desperate grinding poverty her own blind comfort had become offensive to her her judgments had changed of course her parents had been shaken when she had informed them she intended to marry a policeman but they had accepted it with as good a grace as possible after all she was something of a liability on the marriage market with her unacceptable frankness she was handsome enough in fact pitt thought her beautiful but she had not sufficient money to overcome her waywardness and her undisciplined tongue devastating disadvantages in the eyes of any gentleman of her own station her grandmother had given up all hope and was dismally convinced poor charlotte was destined to become an old maid and there was the compensation of emily having married a lord and with the social stigma of a murder in the house the ellisons were no longer a family with whom one chose willingly to contract an alliance pitt was a great deal firmer with charlotte than she had expected indeed in spite of his being deeply and unashamedly in love with her he was quite as insufferably bossy as all the other men she knew she was amazed to begin with and even fought him a little but in her heart she was quite glad of it she had barely dared to admit it to herself but she had been a little afraid that because of his devotion to her and their previous relative social positions he might have let her ride over him bend his will to hers she was secretly delighted to discover he had no intention of doing anything of the kind of course she had cried and made an exhibition of both temper and hurt in their first quarrel but she had gone to sleep with singing happiness inside her when he had come to her gently taking her in his arms but utterly and finally refusing to allow her her own way but he had never objected to her reading the newspapers and as soon as the maid returned with the copy of todays she scrambled through it fingers flying to find some reference to a crime in callander square she did not find it the first time and had to search more diligently before she discovered a small piece barely two inches long stating simply that two bodies of babies had been found in the gardens and a domestic tragedy among the maidservants was suspected she knew immediately why pitt had concealed it from her she herself was newly expecting their first child the thought of some servant girl alone desperate not to lose her livelihood deserted by a loverthe whole thing was appalling she felt cold at the imagining of it yet when she put the paper down she was already determined not to drive it from her mind perhaps she would be able to help the girl if she were thrown out it was a possibility not herself of course she had no position to offer but emily emily was richand she had a deep suspicion she was also just a little bored it was two years since her marriage also and she had by now met all george ashworths friends of any importance she had been seen well dressed in all the fashionable places perhaps this would arouse her charlotte decided on the spot this afternoon she would call upon emily early so as not to collide with her more socially elite callers and before emily herself might be out duly at two oclock she presented herself at the front door of emilys london house in tavistock square the parlormaid knew her and admitted her without asking explanation she was shown into the withdrawing room where there was a fire lit already and barely a moment later emily herself came in she was already dressed for her afternoon visiting she looked magnificent in pale apple green silk with dark brown velvet ribbons it must have cost more than charlotte would have spent on clothes in half a year her face was alight with pleasure she kissed her sister delicately but with genuine warmth goodness if youre going to take up calling charlotte i shall have to teach you what time to begin it is not done to arrive before three at the very very earliest ladies of rank of course later still i havent come calling charlotte said quickly i wouldnt think of it i came to ask your help if you can give it and of course you are interested emilys honeycolored eyebrows rose but her eyes were bright in what not a charity please charlotte knew her sister too well to have come on such an errand of course not she said sharply a crime charlotte not to commit goose to help when it is solved even emilys new sophistication could not hide her excitement cant we solve it cant we help if we its not a nice crime emily not a robbery or something clean charlotte said hastily well what is it emily did not look disconcerted charlotte had forgotten how composed she was how easily she adapted to the unpleasantnesses of life indeed from the day she had decided she would marry lord george ashworth she had accepted frankly that he had faults and that she might never eradicate more than a few of them but she made her decision and settled for the bargain as it was she had never complained although in truth charlotte did not know if she had any cause goodness charlotte emily prodded is it so dreadful you cannot put tongue to it i never before knew you at a loss for words no no it is merely very sad two babies bodies were dug up in the garden in the center of callander square surprisingly emily was shaken babies yes but who would want to kill a baby its insane a servant girl who was unmarried of course emily frowned and you want to find out who it was why i dont want to find out who it was charlotte said impatiently but if they were born dead as seems well possible perhaps you might be able to find her another position if she were dismissed emily stared at her thoughts flashing in her face almost as transparently as they crossed her mind charlotte waited i know someone who lives in callander square she said at last at least george doesbrandy balantyne his father is a general or something im sure they live in callander square he has a sister christina i shall have george introduce us it can be arranged with a little thought then i shall call on her her voice began to rise with excitement there was a faint color in her cheeks and a set of determination about her head we shall discover the real truth i can learn things the police never could because i move in the right circles they will speak to me and you can speak to the servants oh the higherup ones of coursecook and governess and the like you wont tell them you are a policemans wife naturally we shall begin immediately as soon as george returns home i shall speak to him and he will arrange it emily what i thought you wanted my help we cannot possibly know what is best to do if we do not know the truth it is always best to know the truth whether you then decide to dismiss it or to conceal it or even to forget about it entirely but if we do not know the truth to begin with we can make the most unfortunate mistakes charlotte looked at emilys dancing eyes and every shred of common sense in her told her to refuse instantly we shall have to be very discreet common sense suffered a quick defeat of course emily was withering my dear charlotte i could not possibly have survived in society for two whole years if i had not learned to say everything but what i actually mean i am the soul of discretion we shall begin right away go home and discover whatever you can i dont imagine you can be discreet you never could but at least dont volunteer our plans mr pitt may not approve that was an understatement of magnificence nevertheless charlotte stood up with every intention of obeying a tingle of fear inside her and a thin quiver of emilys excitement two the following day pitt went back to callander square hoping to interview the servants in the last two houses but it was not until the early afternoon that they returned from their long weekends in the country consequently it was nearly three oclock when he was shown by the campbells butler into the back parlor and one by one saw the rest of the servants of course they were expecting his questionsthe news must have been virtually waiting for them on the doorstep in the shape of scullery maid tweeny or bootboy bursting with the events and their own rich interpretations of them pitt learned nothing new and he was ready to leave when he met the mistress of the house the honorable garson campbell was a younger son of a family of wealth and position and he had maintained a lifestyle appropriate to it mariah campbell was a pleasant looking woman in her late thirties with broad goodhumored face and fine hazel eyes she had been busy unpacking and organizing her family which she explained hastily comprised a son albert and two daughters victoria and mary she showed considerable distress on hearing of the purpose of his questions apparently the gossip had not reached her and she begged that he would be discreet enough that the children might not come to hear of it i assure you maam i should not dream of introducing such a subject to a child he said honestly although he forbore to say that if some child should mention the matter to him he would not be averse to listening he had usually found children much less affected by death than adults and it was a rare child indeed that was not inveterately inquisitive and would have extracted from the servants every last detail that was to be had or even invented and embroidered upon thank you she said courteously children can behurt she was looking out of the window and frightened there is so much that is ugly the least we can do is protect them from it as long as we are able pitt was of a totally different opinion he believed that the longer you hid from the truth the less able you were to cope with it when it finally broke through all the barriers like a dammed river and carried away the careful structure of your life with it he opened his mouth to argue to say that a little at a time bred some tolerance to pain a balance but remembered his place policemen did not give advice in the upbringing of children to ladies who lived in callander square in fact policemen did not philosophize at all im afraid maam that they may well hear it from the servants he said gently she frowned at him i shall forewarn the servants she answered any servant who mentions such a thing will lose his or her position pitt spared a thought for the unwitting maid who in a careless garrulous moment might yield to childish insistence or even petty blackmail and thus lose home and job at one blow childhood would have given her no such protection from the unpleasant realities of life naturally pitt agreed sadly but there are other servants in the square maam and other children instead of the anger he had expected she merely looked suddenly tired of course mrpitt did you say and children will tell each other such gruesome stories still im sure you will not frighten anyone unnecessarily do you have children of your own not yet maam my wife is expecting our first he said it with a ridiculous sense of pride and waited for her approval i hope everything goes well with her there was no light in her face is there anything else i can tell you he was at a loss deflated no thank you i shall almost certainly have to return it may take us a long time to solve it if we ever do but that is all for today good afternoon mr pitt jenkins will show you to the door good afternoon maam he bowed very slightly and went out to the waiting butler and the front door into the leafy square the doran house was utterly different from the other houses in the square it was unbelievably cluttered with photographs embroidery flowers dried cased in glass pressed growing in pots and even some fresh and arranged in painted vases there were also at least three birds in cages all hung with fringes and bells the door was opened by a middleaged parlormaid this one was an exception to the generality by no twist of the imagination could she have been chosen for her looks except that when she opened her mouth her teeth were perfect and her voice was as rich and smooth as devon cream weve been expecting you she said calmly with a faint southwestern distortion of the vowels miss laetitia and miss georgiana are taking tea no doubt you will be wanting to speak to them first as a matter of course she did not seem to require an answer to that and turned away leaving him to close the door and follow her into the inner recesses laetitia and georgiana were indeed taking tea georgiana was displayed fragilely on a chaise longue bony as a halfpenny rabbit and dressed in delicious mauves and grays tea was balanced on a threetoed piecrust table at her elbow she looked at pitt without displeasure so you are the policeman what an oddlooking creature you are to be sure pray do not be vulgar with me i am extremely delicate i suffer i am sorry to hear it pitt controlled his face with an effort i hope to disturb you very little you have already disturbed me but i shall put up with it in good grace in the name of necessity i am georgiana duff this she pointed to a slightly younger betterupholstered version of herself in the other chair is my sister laetitia doran she is the one to have the misfortune or the illjudgment to own a house in such a disastrous place so you had better address your remarks to her pitt turned to laetitia indeed mrs doran my apologies again but owing to the tragic discovery in the gardens i am sure you understand it is necessary for us to question the servants especially the younger female servants in all the houses that face onto the square laetitia blinked of course georgiana said sharply is that all youve come to say to ask your permission to speak to your servants pitt replied georgiana snorted youll do it anyway i would prefer to do it with your permission maam dont keep calling me maam i dont like it and dont stand there towering over me you make me feel quite giddy sit down or i shall faint pitt sat down stifling a smile thank you have i your permission to interview your servants he looked at laetitia yes yes i suppose so she said uncomfortably please endeavor not to upset them it is so hard to replace a servant satisfactorily these days and poor georgiana must be properly looked after pitt privately thought that poor georgiana would see to it herself that come hell or high water she would be properly looked after of course he stood up again and moved to the door before georgiana had time to feel affected by his presence have you had any servants dismissed in the last half year young women who have left the house none laetitia said quickly we have been exactly as we are for years years and years you have no children maam daughters who have married and taken a ladys maid with them none at all thank you i shant need to disturb you again he went out and closed the door softly he remained in the doran house for two hours but he learned nothing there either charlotte was perfectly correct emily was beginning to find that the fashionable life lacked something a certain bite for which she was increasingly developing a taste beyond question she enjoyed her life it was the ideal mode of existence for her when she and charlotte were still at home in cater street with mama and papa when poor sarah was alive emily had known precisely what suited her she had determined from very early in their acquaintance that she would marry lord george ashworth and a very satisfactory arrangement it had proved of course george had his faults but then what man did not his overriding virtue was that he appreciated her and was constantly both generous and civil and he was undoubtedly handsome to look at and witty when he chose it would be pleasant if he would gamble a little less it was a shocking waste of money but if he flirted he was eminently discreet about it and he very seldom went out without inviting emily also and he did not nag her as to her occupations or the female society she kept and that was a considerable point in his favor emily knew any number of wives who were forever being left at home while their husbands went to places wholly unsuitable for a woman of any decency at all and yet criticized them for extravagance or for the afternoon parties they themselves put on but undeniably there was a certain lack a purposelessness to her present round since she was lady ashworth she had already done with relative ease all the social climbing she desired at least for the moment charlottes disgusting mystery might prove to be just the diversion she required and it had the additional advantage of being genuinely helpful to someone if the wretched girl were ever found and also she was very fond of her sister of course charlotte was socially impossible it would never do to introduce her to the afternoons the dinners and the balls she herself attended although on some of the more pompous occasions she had frequently found it passing through her mind to wonder what charlotte might have said had she been there this affair would also give her an opportunity for them to do something together which in itself would be pleasant when george returned in time to change for dinner she abandoned her dignity and scampered up the stairs after him he turned at the top in surprise whats the matter i want to meet christina balantyne she said immediately tonight he was incredulous a smile on his elegant mouth shes not all that amusing i assure you i dont want to be amused i want to be invited to her house or at least to be able to call without obviously seeking her acquaintance whatever for his eyebrows went up over his dark eyes is it augusta you want to meet very grand augusta her father was a duke and shes lived up to it all her life not that it is any effort i think it was not the reason but it seemed an excellent explanation to adopt yes i would please george she smiled at him frankly youll be disappointed you wont like her he looked down with a faint frown i dont care about liking her i just want to be able to call why george i dont press you about your friends at whites or boodles or wherever it is let me entertain myself by calling upon whom i please she smiled at him with a mixture of charm because she genuinely liked him and honesty because the pretense between them was wholly one of manners and there was no real deception he patted her on the cheek and kissed her it should be easy enough to look up brandy balantyne and hes an amiable fellow in fact hes the best of his family by a long way youll be disappointed in the others i warn you maybe she smiled seraphically utterly satisfied but i wish to discover for myself it was three days before emilys plans bore fruit and she was able to dress carefully in muted browns with gold trimmings and fur muff against the cold and set out to call upon christina balantyne her attire seemed to her precisely the right mixture of dignity and assurance coupled with the quality of friendliness that a lady of title could afford to extend toward someone who was very nearly of her own social rank but not quite she had also taken the trouble to ascertain that christina would be at home this afternoon and that had required some delicate detective work through her ladys maid who just happened to have scraped an acquaintance with the ladys maid of a certain susanna barclay who was in the habit of calling at callander square herself indeed there lay more in common between emily and mr pitt than pitt would have imagined emily duly bade her carriage with its footmen wait and presented herself at the door of the balantynes house at quarter to four it was opened by the parlormaid as was the custom in the afternoon emily smiled charmingly took her card from its ivory case and held it out in an elegantly gloved little hand she was proud of her hands the parlormaid took it read it without appearing to and returned the smile if your ladyship would be pleased to come in lady augusta and miss christina are receiving in the withdrawing room it was an unusually voluble greeting and could only be accounted for by the fact that emily was a viscountess and had not called before therefore her visit in person instead of merely leaving a card was something of an honor and a good parlormaid was as well versed in the niceties of social distinctions as her mistress she did not knock at the door such would have been considered vulgar but pushed it open and announced emily lady ashworth emily was agog with curiosity but naturally she concealed it with a magnificent dignity she sailed into the room looking neither to right nor left holding out her hand there was a slight flutter among the half dozen or so ladies present a natural interest quickly stifled by protocol it was not done to display such an unsophisticated emotion lady augusta remained seated how charming she said with a slight lift in her voice pray do sit down lady ashworth so gracious of you to call emily sat down arranging her skirt almost absently but precisely to its best advantage im sure we have many mutual friends emily said noncommittally it must be only chance that we have not met before indeed augusta would not commit herself either i know you are acquainted with my daughter christina it was a statement emily looked across at the pretty face of christina with its soft little chin and full lips it was an unusual face far more important than beauty it had individuality and considerable provocation a face that men would no doubt find attractive it promised both appetite and yielding but then men were incredibly foolish where women were concerned emily could see at a glance the hardness in the balance of the pert nose and the curve of the lips a taker not a giver emily judged she stored her decision and turned to the next woman to whom augusta was already directing her lady carlton augusta was saying sir robert is in the government you know the foreign office emily smiled across this woman was entirely different widemouthed less pretty warmer but now her hands were knotted in her lap and there were the finest of lines round her eyes and mouth she was older than christina perhaps even in her middle thirties and there was a nervousness a tension underlying the pleasantness she and emily exchanged inclinations of the head and a polite recognition others were introduced and conversation began first about the weather which was exceptionally gentle for late october then about fashion and thence into the truly interesting area of gossip tea was served at four oclock brought in by the parlormaid and poured by lady augusta emily contrived to engage herself with christina and euphemia carlton without difficulty the subject of the bodies in the square was introduced quite shocking euphemia shivered poor little souls a bleak look passed over her face i daresay they knew nothing about it christina answered realistically i understand they were newborn in fact they may even have been born dead they still had souls euphemia stared into the distance emily felt a quick flicker of excitement and a peculiar distress could this be it so soon so very easily was it guilt in euphemia carltons face find out more about her why should she have done such a fearful thing indeed why should any married woman of wealth and quality as soon as possible she must ask charlotte more about the babies had they been black or of some other startling appearance that would betray infidelity i assume you do not know about our little piece of horror christina was speaking again i beg your pardon emily turned an innocent face to her our horror christina repeated the bodies buried in the square only the few fragments you have mentioned emily lied without an atom of compunction pray if it does not distress you oblige me with a little information it was not of course that she imagined christina knew anything that charlotte had not already told her indeed less but she wished to see euphemias reaction to the retelling and of course christinas if it were of any note little to tell christina began instantly the gardeners were digging to plant a tree or some such and discovered these dead bodies of babies naturally they sent for the police how do you know emily inquired my dear from the servants of course where does one ever learn anything that goes on of any interest and then the oddest policeman came round really you never saw such a creature all arms and legs and hair i swear no barber ever took hand to it far less comb or scissors or perhaps the working classes dont have barbers and he was perfectly enormous emily smiled within herself at this view of pitt not wildly inaccurate she would have recognized him from it imagine my surprise christina went on when he opened his mouth and spoke most civilly to me had i not seen him i might have taken him for a gentleman surely he didnt question you emily looked suitably shocked principally to exercise some emotion strong enough to override her amusement of course not i merely chanced to see him in the hall he has been questioning all the servants all round the square i imagine it must be some unfortunate girl who cannot control herself she looked down for a moment as if an embarrassment had caught her then she raised her head and the brilliance was back in her eyes rather exciting having detectives in the place of course mother thinks it is all too macabre and will lower the tone of the neighborhood but i imagine people will understand after all everyone has servants these problems are bound to occur ours is just a little more gruesome thats all euphemia was pale and it was obvious she did not wish to continue the subject emily rescued her im sure they will she agreed lady carlton lady augusta said your husband is in the government i imagine you must have to be most careful about your servants only the most discreet euphemia smiled sir robert very seldom brings home work that is of a confidential nature but of course it is important that servants are discreet as to conversations overheard at dinner and so on how exciting emily feigned girlish delight and pursued the subject until her tea was finished and it was the appropriate time to take her leave she must make other calls or it would appear she was too eager a cultured woman of society never restricted herself to one visit she would call on at least one other and leave her card at two more she excused herself her mind whirling to find some assured way of returning to callander square if possible within the week so charming she murmured to lady augusta george has spoken so well of you it was delightful to meet you to remind her that george was a friend of brandy balantynes and that they were of the same social circle most gracious of you augusta replied absently we are having a small entertainment this friday afternoon if you have no previous engagement perhaps you would care to call in how very pleasant emily said equally nonchalantly i believe i shall she swept out with a feeling of infinite satisfaction the following afternoon she put on a plain green dress took a single unliveried footman and went straight to charlotte it was far easier than waiting for charlotte to come to her for one thing charlotte did not have the use of a carriage and had to resort to the hire of a hansom the other reason of course was that she simply could not wait she burst in upon charlotte who was busy mending linen what on earth are you doing she demanded put it down and listen to me charlotte held the linen in her hand i thought ladies did not call before three it is hardly a quarter past two she said with a smile emily snatched the linen and threw it on the sofa i have the most exciting news she said urgently i have been to the balantynes and i have made the acquaintance of christina and lady augusta and infinitely more interesting of a lady euphemia carlton who is peculiarly discomfited by talk of the babies in the square i truly believe she knows something about it she is laboring under some burden i will swear to that charlotte do you think i have solved it already charlotte looked at her seriously is lady carlton not married of course she is married emily said impatiently but perhaps she is having an affair perhaps the children the babies would have betrayed it were they of any unusual appearance such as a dark skin or red hair or the like emily drew breath and rushed on before charlotte had time to consider the question and reply her husband is in the government perhaps it is a foreign lover a greek or an indian or something maybe there are secrets involved charlotte what do you think she is very handsome you know not beautiful but warm she looks as if she might well fall in love and behave quite irresponsibly charlotte looked back at her thought deep in her face i shall have to ask but i doubt thomas will tell me oh dont be so feeble emily said exasperatedly dont tell me you cant persuade him the man is besotted on you invent some reason i need to know else why should she do it a woman does not kill her own children or even bury the stillborn without some overpowering reason of course not charlotte agreed reasonably but thomas will not imagine i ask out of idle curiosity he is not as amiable as george you know nor anything like as innocent she added emily had never thought of george ashworth as innocent but on consideration she realized what charlotte meant only perhaps it was not so much lack of guile as lack of concern he considered he knew what emily would do in any given situation and had explicit trust in her good sense pitt on the other hand had far more perception than to trust anything so erratic as charlottes good sense nevertheless you will try she persisted charlotte smiled her thoughts inward of course i have always expressed an interest in his work i shall endeavor to help him her smile broadened with a womans point of view which of course he cannot get from his policemen emily gave a sigh of relief that left charlotte laughing by the time emily arrived in callander square on friday afternoon she had heard from charlotte the rather disappointing news that there was nothing remarkable about the appearance of the second baby but a deformity of the head of the first one the one buried the deeper but her heart had lifted when charlotte pointed out that since the unfortunate bodies had been in the earth for some time it was impossible to tell if at birth they might indeed have had skin or hair of an unusual color emily had not considered the point of putrefaction and the thought of it distressed her unexpectedly of course the flesh would not remain in fact charlotte pointed out that according to pitt it was only the clay nature of the soil that had preserved them so far it was an extremely disagreeable consideration she had dismissed it from her mind when she presented herself at the balantynes door she was admitted immediately and was shown from the hall into the great reception room where a small crowd had already gathered of both men and women an enormous gleaming grand piano stood in the center its legs decently masked at a glance emily saw christina euphemia carlton lady augusta and several others she knew from her own social round she also recognized brandy balantyne tall slender dark like his mother and sister but with an easier face outward looking he turned as emily entered and his face lit in a smile lady ashworth how delightful he came forward to welcome her ushering her in do you know alan ross no alans misfortune mr ross she acknowledged him with grace he bowed a little formally he was in his thirties slight of build but with a strong delicate face of unusual intensity lady ashworth i am honored he offered no further compliment and she was rather pleased flattery could become a bore it was after all no more than a formula in the mouth of most men as automatic as good morning or goodbye they fell to discussing some innocuous subject none of them paying more than cursory attention emily let her eyes stray to euphemia carlton she was piqued to see that today the woman looked uncommonly well indeed it would hardly be an exaggeration to say she glowed could the tension and the guilt emily had seen before have been no more than an indisposition emily dismissed the thought it was too early to tell she accepted a delicate refreshment from a crispaproned maid there was a footman over by the doora handsome man in a heavylidded sensuous sort of way emily had seen the same features on dandies and spendthrifts leaving georges clubs the big winners and losers that man would have been one of them had his birth been kinder to him now he stood against the wall of a generals house dressed in livery and waiting on ladies and the few gentlemen who had nothing better to do with this particular afternoon she saw christina balantyne walk past him laughing as oblivious of his humanity as if he had been a piece of furniture a carving to hold flowers the entertainment began first a rendition of a waltz by chopin more precise than lyrical then a rather wavering contralto sang three ballades emily forced a look of rapt attention on her face and let her mind wander she had not been introduced to sophie bolsover but she had overheard her name in a neighboring conversation and knew that she also lived in callander square now emily looked sideways at her partly from interest partly because it was easier to keep her face straight when not looking directly into the contraltos earnest eyes sophie bolsover was a type she had become familiar with over the last couple of years still very young pretty enough by nature for art successfully to concentrate on her good features and mask the poor ones she was born of a good family with enough money to insure a satisfactory marriage she had never had to fear being left an old maid dependent she had not had to fight the way ahead of numerous sisters in a femaleridden house all this emily knew from the calm rather shallow assurance in her face as soon as the songs were finished and suitably applauded emily made a point of seeking her acquaintance emily was charming skilled and quite ruthless in such social arts within five minutes she was conversing with sophie about fashion mutual acquaintances and speculation as to who might marry whom emily guided the considerations toward those resident in the square beginning with a compliment toward christina so beautiful sophie agreed with a smile emily would have quarreled with the choice of words christina was fashionable appealing to men certainly but not beautiful indeed she said confidentially no doubt she will be able to take her pick of offers i thought at one time she might have married mr ross sophie inclined her head very slightly toward alan ross who was talking earnestly to euphemia carlton but of course he has never got over poor helena sophie went on emilys ear sharpened helena she inquired with a masterly attempt at indifference did some tragedy befall her she is never spoken of sophie said somewhat inconsequentially emilys interest grew even keener my dear how fascinating by whom is she never spoken of why laetitia doran of course sophie opened her eyes wide helena was laetitias only child georgiana did not live with her then naturally she cameafterward emily pieced it together yes to console her for what what why when helena ran away elopedso they say what an irresponsible and foolish thing to do and such a shame to her mother with whom did she elope why did she not marry him good gracious was he a servant or something who knows nobody ever saw him what you cannot mean it emily was incredulous was he so appalling she dared notoh my gracious he wasnt already married was he sophie paled oh dear i do hope not how perfectly dreadful no i shouldnt think so she was very beautiful helena you know she could have had her choice amongoh i dont know how many men poor mr ross was quite stricken when she went away did he know about it of course she left a letter saying she had run off and of course those of us with any sense knew perfectly well she had an admirer women know that sort of thing i remember i thought it rather romantic at the time i never dreamed it would end so awfully i dont see that it is so very dreadful emily replied with a little frown if she ran off and married him somewhere else perhaps he was someone her mother did not approve of but who loved her a trifle silly i agree especially if he did not have any money but not entirely fatal romantic loves are a little impractical when it comes to day to day living paying the cook and the dressmaker and so on but if one has good sense it can be quite bearable one of my sisters married a considerable degree beneath her and seems to be disgustingly happy on it but she is an unusual creature i will be the first to grant is she really happy sophie raised her eyebrows in interested surprise oh yes emily assured her but you and i would find it quite dreadful perhaps helena is like her but feared her mothers objections so simply took the easiest way out sophies face brightened what a delicious thought perhaps she is in italy married to a fisherman or a gondolier or something do you have many gondoliers calling in callander square emily asked politely sophie stifled a rich giggle and then looked about her in dismay at her own social gaffethe spontaneous laughter not the idiotic question how deliriously refreshing you are lady ashworth sophie said through the fingers over her mouth im sure ive never met anyone so witty emily felt a withering reply to that rise to her lips but she merely smiled poor mr ross she said noncommittally he must have been very devoted to her was it long ago oh it must be well over a year perhaps closer to two years emilys heart sank helena doran had sounded like an excellent possibility as a suspect with sophies answer she receded into profound unlikelihood she looked instinctively across the room at euphemia there was a man with her whom emily had not seen before a man of considerable distinction perhaps fiftyfive or sixty years old who is that most elegant gentleman with lady carlton she asked sophies eyes followed hers oh thats sir robert did you not know no emily shook her head slightly he must be at least twenty years older than his wifea most interesting fact i think i should be a little in awe of so grand a husband she said carefully he looks so veryimportant he is in the government is he not yes indeed you know i believe i should also how perceptive you are you put so excellently into words exactly what was in my mind had i but known it emily was hot on the scent i should not think him a great deal of fun she pursued no indeed sophie looked her up and down and moved a little closer emily knew a confidence was coming and her blood tingled with excitement she smiled encouragingly she is very sophie hesitated attractedto brandy balantyne so charming brandy i swear if i were not simply devoted to freddie i should be quite in love with him myself emily took a deep breath her heart beating in her throat you mean she said in wonder she is having an affair with brandy sophie held up her finger to her lips but her eyes were dancing and she is expecting she added about the third month three it was three days before emily could visit charlotte and report to her on the friday afternoon party and deliver her astounding news the weekend was quite out of the question not only because george had arranged for them several engagements a day at the races on saturday and then dinner with friends and on sunday a society wedding in the midafternoon and the inevitable celebration afterward but also of course because pitt would be at home having reached the rank of inspector he was not required to work at such times unless he were pursuing a most urgent case the deaths of two babies probably illegitimate and some servant girls would not fall in that category emily was in no way ashamed of what she was doing but she preferred that pitt should remain unaware of it at least for the time being however by monday morning she could contain herself no longer and took the unprecedented step of calling for her carriage at ten oclock and having herself driven directly to charlottes house charlotte was both incredulous and amused she opened the door herself in a plain stuff dress and apron emily what in goodness name are you doing here there was no need to ask if some disaster had brought her her face was glowing with excitement indeed charlotte could not remember having seen such a look of satisfaction on her face since emily had announced that she was going to marry george ashworth not that he had known it at the time of course i have the most devastating news emily said almost willing charlotte out of the way so she could enter you will hardly believe it when i tell you charlotte summed up the nature of her news immediately detecting agrees with you more than i expected she said with wide eyes perhaps you should have married thomas not i emily stared at her with withering reluctance and then dismay it was quite a moment or two before she realized charlotte was teasing her why charlotteyou she could think of no word that both described her feelings and was fit for the tongue of the lady she felt herself to be charlotte laughed come in tell me what you have detected before you burst emily had intended to drop her clues one by one to extend the story to its utmost tension but she could not bear it herself euphemia carlton is having an affair she said proudly she waited for charlottes amazement charlotte gratified her widening her eyes and letting the duster fall from her hand there emily shone with satisfaction pitt hasnt found that out has he the affair is with brandy balantyne and that isnt all she hesitated for effect charlotte sat down well she inquired emily sat beside her she is expecting the third month charlotte was genuinely impressed and she was perfectly sure pitt did not know any of this whether it was actually relevant or not how do you know she asked it seemed the oddest information to have come by on so short an acquaintance sophie bolsover told me she is a silly harmless creature and does not seem to have the least notion of its meaning or else she knows it has no meaning charlotte did not wish to burst the bubble of emilys excitement but the truth always came to her mouth as soon as it occurred to her mind and she had not yet managed much skill in controlling it besides it was kinder in this instance not to let the supposition grow without examination how could she possibly know such a thing emily demanded if euphemia is having an affair with brandy balantyne the child will be his and another thing i havent told youi saw sir robert carlton he is quite old very grand and distinguished but fearfully grim looking and his hair is fair and his eyes quite light brandy is very dark his hair is black and his eyes hazel darkcolored charlotte remained unimpressed euphemia is fair emily exploded with exasperation her hair is very handsome red gold if the childs hair is black there will be the most fearful scandal no wonder she is frightened she blinked thank goodness george is dark and i am fair whatever my child should be like it will raise no comment she said quite casually merely a thought in passing emily was practical above all things charlotte accepted it as such that really is very important she said seriously about euphemia and brandy balantyne i mean emily beamed with satisfaction she was more pragmatic and more assured than charlotte and yet there was something in charlotte perhaps an inner certainty of her own beliefs that made charlottes praise peculiarly valuable to her shall you tell mr pitt she asked i think i must is there any reason why i should not no of course not why else should i tell you my dear you know better than to imagine i should trust you with a secret charlotte was hurt and it showed in her face not that you would tell it emily said quickly but you would never lie not successfully you would betray that you knew something by your very discomfort and then have to swear silence the whole thing would be awful and grow to be far more important than the secret itself charlotte stared at her i lie very well emily added i think that makes for a good detective especially if you are not of the police and therefore cannot be direct in your interest as soon as i discover something further i shall tell you charlotte thought for a moment or two and then spoke carefully perhaps you had better see if you can find out how long this affair has been going on but emilyplease be careful do not be carried away with your successes if they discover what you are doing you may become very disliked she took a deep breath more than disliked as you say there would be a dreadful scandal sir robert is in the government if euphemia was prepared at best to bury her own dead children without christian rites or at worst actually to kill them herself to protect her reputation she will not easily let you expose her now emily had not considered any personal danger before indeed it had never entered her head that any part of the business would affect her at all now she was suddenly cold the story had suddenly become reality charlotte saw her face pale her hands clench involuntarily she smiled and put her fingers over emilys just be careful she warned detection is not just an exercise of the mind you know people are real and love and hate are dangerous when pitt returned in the evening charlotte met him almost at the door emilys news had been simmering inside her all day and with the sound of pitts step on the pavement it had finally come to the boil she caught hold of his lapels and kissed him quickly emily came this morning she said the instant she let go she has discovered something tremendous come in and i shall tell you it was almost an order and she freed herself from his grasp and swept into the parlor standing in the middle to watch his expression as she delivered the broadside he came in his extraordinary face crumpled a little in apprehension emily has found out that euphemia carlton is having an affair with young brandon balantyne she said dramatically and that she is expecting a child if she had wished to shock him she was fully satisfied his face went blank as he absorbed the information then clouded a little with doubt are you sure she is not his eyebrows arched indulging in gossip a bit of scandalizing of course she is indulging in gossip she said exasperatedly how else does one get information it is for you to determine if it is true that is why she came to me so that i could tell you it shouldnt be difficult she stopped as he was laughing at her what amuses you she demanded you do my dear where did emily come by this invaluable piece ofgossip he moved over to the fire and sat down she followed him and knelt on the floor in front of him commanding his attention from sophie bolsover who seemed to be quite unaware of its importance and that is not all apparently sir robert is much older than euphemia and very grand and grim and he has fair hair fair hair pitt repeated looking at her but his eyes were sharper now her heart bumped with excitement she knew she had woken his interest yes i take it brandon balantyne is dark very you see of course i see euphemia has the most beautiful redgold hair and very fair skin you would not know but naturally emily will have told you she smiled in great satisfaction he touched her cheek gently with his fingers finding a loose strand of her hair but his face was unusually stern charlotte you must warn emily to be careful people in society care very much about their reputations they matter to them more than we can understand they may take it very ill if emily meddles i know she assured him quickly i told her but she will try to learn how long the affair has been going on if it was already begun when the babies died no leave it for me to do you must call on her tomorrow warn her again his hand fell and he gripped her shoulder as she stiffened with quick apprehension they are not likely to think her anything more than a nosy woman he went on with nothing better to amuse herself than gossip but if robert carlton is powerful sir robert she was surprised for a moment uncomprehending of course robert my dear if he has been thrice cuckolded he will not want the world to know of it to be the subject of scandal is one thing to be laughed at quite another emily would tell you that i never thought of it suddenly she was really unhappy she could see emilys newfound glory eclipsed in a single sweeping move how idiotic they had been playing at detectives ill call on her tomorrow morning if she doesnt listen to me i shall tell george he will make her he gave her a small smile which she could not read but the information is useful she pressed harking back to her triumph oh extremely he was genuine in his appreciation it is even possible it will lead to the answer the problem now is how shall i discover the duration of this affair and if she has given birth to any other children he scowled in thought growing fiercer as the answer receded thats easy charlotte stood up as her feet were getting pins and needles speak to her ladys maid ladys maids are extremely loyal he answered as well as needing to keep their employment she is not likely to tell me her mistress is having an affair and has had two babies who have since disappeared she turned at the table wriggling her foot to wake it up of course not she agreed with disdain not on purpose find out what size dress she takes if she has lately increased her size and if she did so two years ago and six months ago find out if the seams have been let out on her bodices if i could look at them i should soon tell you pitt smiled broadly is that not detection she demanded hotly and discover if she has visited the country she frowned although since the bodies were buried in callander square that is not likely her face brightened again discover if she has been ill feeling squeamish or faint then if she has a good or bad appetite if she has overeaten and put on weight you are answered especially if she has had fancies for certain foods she does not normally care for look to the clothes yourself and dont ask the ladys maid about the appetite and the fainting or she will know well enough what you are thinking ask the kitchen maid about the food and a parlormaid or someone about her health he was still smiling she looked at him then began to doubt herself the advice had seemed excellent to her as she gave it is that not the right way she blinked most professional he agreed it makes me wonder how we have managed to solve crimes at all without women on the force i think you are laughing at me most certainly but i still think the advice is excellent and i shall take it oh good she relaxed and gave him a dazzling smile i should like to think i was helping he burst out in spontaneous laughter the following morning charlotte did as she had been bidden and called upon emily she warned her very solemnly about the vengeance she might bring upon herself and even upon george if she stirred up gossip however unwittingly about euphemia carlton emily heard her out with a calm obedient expression and duly swore to abandon the matter and do no more than pursue her normal social round charlotte thanked her and left with an unreasonable feeling that she had somehow failed for one thing it had been far too easy she had seen no fear in emilys eyes to account for such sudden capitulation but she could hardly ask for more than one promise to the same effect she went home and gave the parlor a furious spring cleaning although it was the first week in november and beginning to rain pitt returned to callander square and at quarter past ten knocked on the carltons door and asked if he might speak to the servants again he was shown into the housekeepers sitting room and the parlormaid was sent for come in pitt sat down in one of the great chairs so as not to tower over the girl sit down i hope this business has not distressed you too much she looked at him with some awe no thank you sir then she thought better of it well i mean yes it is dreadful isnt it im sure i dont know who it can be and your mistress i imagine it may have upset her also not more than what pity youd expect she replied very well she is i never seen her look so well not upset her appetite does with some people you know ladies of a delicate disposition lady carlton aint delicate sir fit as an orse she is if youll pardon the hexpression none of your fainting and vapors for herat least he raised his eyebrows in interested sympathy well she did come over a bit queer a couple of times but i reckon thats her condition if you take me o lor she put her fingers to her mouth and stared at him with round eyes you got that out o me no no he said gently besides i am concerned with the past not the future he hid his annoyance now it would not be possible to get any further information from the girl without her immediately knowing what he was seeking better speak to the others straight away before she spread the alarm even inadvertently he went upstairs to see the ladys maid past the objections of the bristling housekeeper because he wished to see the dresses himself although he had as yet no idea what excuse he might use for his interest he found the ladys maid brushing a riding habit and sponging the skirt where the autumn mud had splashed it she dropped it in some alarm when she saw him dont disturb yourself maam he said as he walked over and picked it up feeling it between his fingers appreciatively not yet passing it back to her an excellent piece of stuff he flipped it over so that the waist was in his grasp and welltailored too he felt quickly at the seams nothing he glanced at the waistband where charlotte had told him to look he found it immediately an extension to the band a piece let in he gave it back to the maid quite casually smiling at her i like to see a welldressed lady gives everyone pleasure oh this is last years she said quickly quite old in fact lady euphemia has far better than this indeed i should like to see better than this he let a note of polite disbelief fall into his voice its a very fine cloth she went over to an enormous wardrobe and threw it open there was a gleam of light on the purples and fuschias and lambent greens of silk how very beautiful he said quite genuinely he went over and touched the soft shining stuff with his fingers for a moment forgetting his purpose there was an amber gown almost corn gold where the light fell on it and deep fire russet in the shadows it must have looked magnificent on euphemia carlton but he saw it on charlotte he felt a sharp stab of pain because he could not buy such things for her he forgot the maid and callander square and his mind whirled wildly for some idea some other occupation where he might be able to earn that sort of money lovely things arent they there was a note of wistfulness in the womans voice too he was jerked back to reality he looked at her pinched figure in its dark stuff dress and white apron yes he agreed yes very rapidly he searched for the waist seams the sides where letting out would be done i expect they take a lot of looking after he found nothing yet you must be very skilled with a needle she smiled at the compliment not many men as thinks of that yes i does a lot of work but she looks a rare sight when i send er out of ere if i say that as shouldnt ive never sent er out less than perfect pitt seized his chance and looked openly at the minute stitching the waist had definitely been let out a couple of inches or more youre quite an artist he said and meant at least part of it what must it be like for a woman to put all her labor and her love into making another woman beautiful then to sit at home and watch her leave for parties and balls to dance all night and be admired while she stayed upstairs waiting to receive the clothes back again press them mend them for the next time you have every right to be proud he said he let the silk fall and closed the wardrobe doors she blushed with pleasure thank you im sure she stammered he must ask her something lest she think afterward and become suspicious his mind searched for some likely question does your mistress ever give away any of her old clothes to deserving servant girls or the like he knew the answerno mistress wishes to see a servant wearing the style and quality of garment she herself wore no matter how old or how deserving the girl oh no sir lady euphemia sends them all to the country to some cousin or other who dont know whats fashionable and whats not and very glad of them she is i see thank you he smiled reassuringly at her and took his departure to the kitchen neither the cook nor the kitchen maids yielded anything conclusive but it seemed euphemia had indulged in sudden bouts of eating every so often put on weight and then dieted again they attributed it to a healthy appetite a love of sweet things and then a reemergence of vanity and the dictates of fashion there was nothing to prove them either right or wrong he thanked them and left the house filling in time through the afternoon until he could call on sir robert carlton and lady euphemia herself and expect to find them at home he returned a little after six he knew it was inconvenient but there is no convenient time for the sort of question to which he sought an answer the footman received him coolly and showed him into the library it was several minutes before the door opened and sir robert carlton came in closing it gently behind him he was a little above average height slender stiff his face was as charlotte had said extremely distinguished but the mildness of his expression robbed it of arrogance i understand you wish to see me he said quietly his voice was clear and precise and contained a slight lift of surprise yes sir pitt replied if you please i apologize for calling at this hour but i wished to be sure of finding you in carlton waited politely and he continued im afraid i have reason to believe that the mother of the babies found in the square may be a member of your household he stopped ready for outrage denials instead there was only a tightening of the skin across carltons high cheeks as if he anticipated pain pitt wondered quickly if either he already knew or at least suspected his wife was it possible he had even personally accepted it long since fought his private battle im sorry carlton said quietly poor woman pitt stared at him carlton turned his face to look at pitt there was anxiety and compassion in his eyes it was something he did not understand but struggling to imagine and for which he was deeply sorry pitt felt a surge of anger against euphemia and against young brandon balantyne whom he had not yet met carlton was speaking again have you any idea who it is mr pitt or what will happen to her that rather depends on the circumstances sir robert if the children were born dead there may be no criminal prosecution but she will lose her character and unless she is extremely fortunate her position and be without reference to obtain another and if they were not born dead then there will be a charge of murder i see i suppose that is inevitable and the wretched woman will be hanged pitt realized too late that he should not have committed himself he should have left it in doubt perhaps in that single carelessness he had forfeited carltons help that is only an opinion he tried to withdraw there may be some mitigating circumstances of course he could think of many for himself but none that would appeal to the lords justices you said someone in the house carlton continued as if he had not spoken i take it you do not as yet know whom no sir i thought perhaps lady carlton knowing the servants better might be able to assist me i suppose it is necessary to bring her into this i regret so very well carlton reached for the bell cord and pulled it when the footman appeared he gave instructions that euphemia should be asked to come they waited in silence until she arrived she closed the door behind her and turned to them her face was smooth and utterly guileless even when she saw pitt if she had any guilt then she was either one of those rare creatures who genuinely see no interest but their own or was the most accomplished actress my dear inspector pitt believes that the mother of these unfortunate children may be someone in our house carlton said courteously i regret it is necessary that you should endeavor to assist him her face paled a little oh dear im so sorry of course it can really make no difference but i hate to think of it being someone i know are you sure inspector she turned to look at him she was a most attractive woman there was a warmth about her more appealing than beauty no maam but i have cause to believe it for what reason she asked pitt took a deep breath and plunged in it would seem that someone in this house is having an affair a love affair he watched her face for a moment she remained perfectly serene merely interested then there was a slight tightening of the hands on the plumcolored silk of her dress a faint color spread up her throat pitt glanced across at carlton but he appeared detached unobservant indeed she said after the slightest hesitation he went on there is a strong possibility that as a result of the attachment she may have become with child the color deepened painfully in her face she turned away so that the shadow fell across her i see carlton still seemed unaware of anything but the concern of a mistress for her maids perhaps you had better make inquiries my dear is that what you wish inspector if lady carlton feels she might discover something pitt looked at her deliberately choosing his words so that she should understand his meaning in spite of his apparent casualness euphemia kept her face from the light what is it that you wish to know mr pitt how long theattachmenthas existed he said quietly she took a deep breath it may not be she struggled for precisely the right expression and failed of the nature or thethe emotions that you suppose the emotions are not our concern my dear carlton said quietly and the nature of it can hardly be in question since there have been two dead children found in the square she swiveled round to stare at them horror in her face eyes wide you cannot supposei meanyou cannot leap to judge that because someone ishas an attachment that they are responsible for thosedeaths there may be any number of people in the square who have some relationship or other some there is a world of difference between a mild flirtation and an affair that produces two children euphemia carlton still did not lose his courtesy his air of judiciousness almost indifference we are not speaking of a mere admiration of course not she said sharply then as his high face smoothed a little in surprise she regained control of herself with an effort pitt standing beside her saw the muscles in her throat contract the material of her dress strain as she held her breath in he wondered if carlton were as oblivious of her turmoil as he appeared they seemed an illmatched couple in more than years was she a young woman trapped by ambitious or impecunious parents in a marriage of conveniencetheir convenience it flickered to his mind to wonder what charlotte would have thought even what she might have done had it been she he determined to meet young brandon balantyne as soon as possible i will discover what i can mr pitt euphemia looked directly at him meeting his eyes with a direct golden amber glaze but if anyone in my house has an attachment of such a standing i know nothing of it thank you maam he said softly he knew what she was trying to say that she had understood him and that she was denying the length of her own involvement but he could not afford to believe her unsubstantiated he excused himself and left with the same feeling of sadness he had felt innumerable times before when he first glimpsed the truth of a tragedy that had turned into a crime emily had no intention whatsoever of obeying charlottes instructions except insofar as she would exercise a little more caution than she had hitherto she would no longer directly question anyone although in truth sophie bolsover had hardly required it instead she would cultivate friendships and with such an end in view she again called at callander square this time specifically to see christina she had acquired a piece of information regarding a dressmaker which she knew would be of interest to christina and took the liberty of calling in the morning when she would not run into the social ritual of the afternoon the door was answered by the footman max good morning lady ashworth he said showing only the slightest surprise his dark eyes flickered down her habit appreciatively then up again to her face she stared back at him coldly good morning is miss balantyne at home yes my lady if you care to come in i will tell her you are here he backed away pulling the door wider she followed him into the hall and then into the morning room where there was already a fire burning can i bring you anything maam he asked no thank you she replied deliberately not looking at him he smiled very slightly inclined his head and left her alone she had been waiting about ten minutes and was beginning to become a little impatient when finally christina came in emily turned to greet her and was surprised to see her looking quite casual almost disheveled her hair was less than perfectly done there were dark wisps lopsidedly on her neck and she looked unbecomingly pale my dear have i caught you at an inconvenient time emily had nearly asked if she were unwell then realized that to suggest someone looked ill was less than flattering and she did not wish to jeopardize christinas somewhat tenuous friendship so soon i confess christina put her hand on the back of the chair and held it firmly i do not feel in the best of health this morning most unusual for me pray sit down emily went toward her taking her hand i do most sincerely hope it is but a passing indisposition a slight chill perhaps after all the change in the weather can so easily cause such things she was doubtful in her mind as she said it christina was an extremely healthy girl and she showed none of the signs of a chill no rasping in the throat no running nose or feverishness christina slid into the chair she looked uncommonly pale and there were the faintest of beads of perspiration on her skin perhaps a little tisane emily suggested ill call the footman christina protested and shook her head but emily had already rung the bell she stood by it and when max appeared she spoke over christinas head to him miss balantyne is feeling a little unwell will you please have cook brew her a tisane and send it up the mans heavy eyes looked across at christina and emily caught the glance he looked away quickly and retreated to obey i am sorry to have found you so emily said with the best mixture of cheerfulness and sympathy she could manage i only came to tell you the name of the dressmaker you were inquiring for i managed to persuade her to consider us both although she is in the most absolute demand she has such skill in cutting she can make even the ugliest creatures look graceful she smiled at christinas white face and meticulous at finishing off no threads or halfstitched buttons and she is so clever at designing she can hide a few extra inches so ones own mother would not know one had put on weight christina blushed suddenly and deeply what on earth are you suggesting i am not putting on weight she crossed her hands over her stomach emilys mind raced youre lucky she said lightly i fear i always do in the winter it was a complete fabrication it happens without fail she went on it must be all the hot puddings and things and i have a dreadful weakness for chocolate sauce if you will excuse me christina climbed to her feet still clutching her hands in front of herself i think i had better go upstairs the mention of food has made me feel quite sick i would be obliged if you would not tell max drink the tisane yourself if you wish oh my dear emily caught hold of her im so sorry let me help you you are in no condition to be by yourself i shall assist you at least to your rooms and your maid can wait upon you shall i have someone call for the doctor no christina was fierce her eyes blazing i am perfectly well it is nothing of any import perhaps something i have eaten does not entirely agree with me pray do not mention the matter i would take it as a true sign of your friendship if you were to treat the whole incident in complete confidence she put out a cold little hand and grabbed emily hard of course emily reassured her i shall not mention it one does not wish ones indispositions discussed about the place the matter is quite private thank you now you must come upstairs emily guided her across the hall and up the wide staircase till they met her ladys maid on the upstairs landing who took charge of christina emily had come down again and reached as far as the hall when she was nearly brushed aside by a tall man broadshouldered and widechested who swept by her perkins he shouted angrily perkins damn it emily stood stock still he swung round and saw her he opened his mouth as if to shout again then realized she was not the errant perkins his face was striking with a great deal of bone now he colored faintly at having made an exhibition of himself he raised his head still higher good morning maam may i be of some assistance for whom were you looking general balantyne she asked with magnificent composure at your service he said stiffly his temper barely beneath the surface emily smiled with devastating charm emily ashworth she extended her hand i came to see miss balantyne but she is a trifle indisposed this morning so i shall take my leave have you lost a butler i believe i saw him depart in that direction she pointed vaguely behind her it was an invention but she wished to appear helpful and if possible even to engage him in some slight conversation no housemaid damn woman always moving my papers actually i cant remember if her name is perkins or not but augusta always calls downstairs housemaids perkins whatever they call themselves papers the beginning of an utterly brilliant idea was forming in emilys mind are you engaged upon writing something a family history maam the balantynes have fought in all the great battles of the nation from the last two hundred years or so emily breathed out trying with all her considerable acting skill to invest her bearing with interest actually warfare bored her to tears but she must make some intelligent remark how very important she replied the history of our men of war is the history of our race she was proud of that it was an excellent observation he looked at her narrowly you are the first woman i have met to consider it so from my sister she said quickly my sister has always had an interest in such things i learned from her of its great importance one does not realizebut i keep you from your work if i cannot help i must at least not hinder you should have someone to assist you keep your papers in order someone who understands such things to dust and care for your study and perhaps take notes should you not or maybe you have if i had maam i should not now be searching for some housemaid to see what she has done with them do you think such a person might be of service to you she put her utmost effort into appearing quite casual to find a woman who had any sense of military history would not only be extremely fortunate maam but even more would it be unlikely my sister is most competent sir she assured him and as i have said has a longstanding interest in things of a military nature my father naturally did not approve so she has not been able to indulge it as her nature inclined however i am sure there would be no disapproval if she were to spend a little time being of assistance to someone such as yourself of course she had no intention of telling him charlotte was married to a policeman he stared at her a lesser woman than emily might well have quailed before him indeed well if it meets with your fathers approval i daresay it might prove of assistance to me i pray you raise the matter to him and see if she is agreeable if she is she may call upon me and we shall arrange some terms satisfactory to us both i am obliged to youmiss he had forgotten her name ashworth emily smiled again lady ashworth lady ashworth he bowed very slightly good day to you maam emily dropped a tiny curtsey and hurried out in an ecstasy of delight she climbed straight into the carriage and commanded the driver to take her post haste to charlottes house it mattered not a pin what time of the morning it was she must deliver herself of her plans and fully instruct charlotte in her future part in them she had totally forgotten charlottes warning to her and her promise i have been to callander square this morning she said the instant charlotte opened the door she swept past her and into the parlor swinging round to face her sister i have learned the most incredible things for a start christina balantyne is indisposed nausea at this time in the morning and she nearly bit my head off when i suggested she might put on weight she begged me to say nothing of it to anyone implored me what do you think of it charlotte true or not whatever the fact i can see well enough what it is she fears it can be only one thing and she would not permit me to call a doctor charlotte was pale she stood just inside the door her eyes wide emily you promised emily had no idea what she meant you promised charlotte said fiercely what do you imagine the balantynes will do if they discover you know such a thing from what you said of lady augusta she will hardly sit by and allow you to ruin christina have you no sense at all i shall tell george myself and perhaps he will be able to prevent you from being so idiotic emily waved her aside oh for goodness sake charlotte do you imagine i dont know how to conduct myself socially i have climbed far higher than you ever will mostly of course because you wont exert yourself but do you imagine that because you wont keep your opinions to yourself that i cannot if i wish i can lie so that mr pitt would not know it and certainly not augusta balantyne i have no intention of ruining either myself or george now please pay attention to what i have been telling you about christina i have no idea who the man may be but while i was there an opportunity arose and i had the most brilliant idea naturally i seized upon it immediately general balantyne is writing a military history of his family of which he seems to be extraordinarily proud he needs some help to keep himself organized take notes and so forth she stopped for a moment to draw breath her eyes on charlotte for the first time she actually considered the possibility that charlotte might refuse well charlotte said with a slight frown i cannot see what general balantynes military memoirs have to do with christinas fears why they are the perfect answer emily banged her hand on her skirt in frustration at charlottes obtuseness i have volunteered that you will go and help him with his papers you are the ideal person you even like military mattersyou can remember who fought whom in which battles while most of us cannot even recall why and certainly dont care you must go and charlottes face had fallen in incredulity emily you must have lost your senses i cannot possibly go andand work for general balantyne it would be preposterous but even as she was saying it her voice was slowing down the outrage slipping out of it emily knew that in spite of her words she had not at all dismissed the idea in fact she was in framing its very ridiculousness to herself turning over in her mind the faint possibility of accepting it thomas would never permit it charlotte said carefully why not it would beunseemly why you do not need to take any payment for it if it is beneath his dignity for you to do so all he needs to know is that you are helping a friend and at the same time pursuing your own interest and who knows what you may discover you will actually be in the house day by day charlotte opened her mouth to protest again but her eyes were looking beyond emily into the distance of her imagination and there was a deep light in them emily knew she had won and there was no time for decorating the victory i shall call for you tomorrow morning at half past nine wear your best dark dress that wine one it is new enough and the color becomes you i am not going in order to engage his attentions emily charlotte made a last automatic protest dont be obtuse charlotte every woman if she succeeds at anything does so by engaging some mans attentions anyway whatever your purpose is it can hardly hurt emily you are a thoroughly conniving creature so are you you are just afraid to admit it to yourself she stood up i must go i have other calls to make please be ready at half past nine in the morning tell pitt what you please she blinked by the way naturally i did not tell general balantyne you were married to a policeman much less the officer investigating the affair in the gardens i said you were my sister so you had better be miss ellison again she swept out before charlotte could register any protest although in fact charlotte was too entertained with the idea to seek objections and was already busy considering the most judicious explanation to offer pitt and how best she might satisfy general balantyne as to her competence the following morning as charlotte was surveying herself in the mirror adjusting her dress for the tenth time and making sure yet again that her hair was both tidy and at the same time shown to its best advantage augusta balantyne was staring across the breakfast table at her husband do i understand you correctly brandon that you have engaged some young woman of indeterminate background and restricted means to come into this house and assist you in these family memoirs you are her voice froze occupied with no you do not understand me augusta he replied over his cup lady ashworth whom i gather to be a friend of yours recommended her sister to me as a woman of intelligence and propriety who would be willing to put my papers in order and take some notes as i may dictate them you will not be required to entertain her socially though why the matter should concern you i dont know she could not possibly be either plainer or more foolish than some of the women you have in here sometimes brandon i think you say such things entirely to provoke me one cannot order ones acquaintance on the basis of good looks or unfortunately of intelligence i think they would be criteria quite as satisfactory as either birth or money he opined dont be naive she snapped you know perfectly well what is of value in society and what is not i hope you do not intend this young woman to eat in the dining room he raised his eyebrows in surprise i had not considered her eating at all but now that you mention it perhaps cook had better prepare her something and she can eat in the library as the governess used to the governess ate in the schoolroom the difference is academic he stood up have max show her into the library when she comes you know i dislike that man a spell in the army would do him good he is an excellent footman and a spell in the army would ruin him please do not meddle with the governing of the household servants that is what we employ masters for besides you know nothing about it he gave her a sour look and went out of the door shutting it sharply behind him augusta made it her business to be in the hallway at ten oclock when charlotte arrived promptly she saw max open the door and watched with interest and an odd mixture of superiority and reluctant approval as charlotte was shown in she had expected a dowdy dress and a pinched submissive face instead she saw rich winecolored skirts a little outdated in fashion but still flattering and a face anything but submissive indeed it was one of the most flagrant and willful faces she had ever seen yet having at the same time a surprising gentleness in the mouth and the soft curve of cheek and throat definitely not a woman she wished in her house not a woman she could like or understand not a woman who would be easily governed by the rules of society by which augusta had lived all her life had fought and won all her many intricate battles she sailed forward in her most frigid manner good morning misser she raised her brows in inquiry charlotte met her eyes squarely miss ellison lady augusta she lied without a thought indeed dislike hardened in her she smiled barely i believe my husband is expecting you she glanced at max who obediently went to the library door and opened it i understand you have come to be of some clerical assistance to him best to let her know immediately her standing in the house miss ellison maxs heavylidded eyes followed charlotte in lingering on her shoulders and her waist the door closed behind her and charlotte stood still waiting for the general to look up she was no longer trembling inside lady augustas patronage had turned her fear into anger general balantyne sat behind an enormous desk she saw the handsome head the lean bones of the face her interest was immediate in her imagination she saw the long battle line of history stretch out behind him crimea waterloo corunna plassey malplaquet he looked up the bland courtesy washed out of his face and he stared at her she stared back how do you do miss how do you do general balantyne my sister lady ashworth considered i might be of some service to you i hope that may be so yes he stood up blinking still staring at her frowning a little she said you had some interest in military affairs i am setting in some order the history of my family which has served with distinction in every great battle since the time of the duke of marlborough thoughts as to how she should answer flashed through charlottes mind you must be very proud she said honestly it is a good thing you should record it accurately for people to know especially those in the future when the men who can remember our great battles are gone he said nothing but his shoulders straightened as he considered her and there was a very small smile at the edges of his mouth in the rest of the house the usual business of the morning was conducting itself housemaids and upstairs maids and ladies maids were all furiously occupied augusta was supervising because she was expecting guests of great social importance for dinner and also because she had nothing else to do at half past ten she could not find the tweeny the wretched girl had left a distinct rime of dust on the frames of the pictures on the landingit showed gray on augustas fingerand the child was nowhere to be seen augusta had long known the favorite bolt hole of idle servants between the stillroom and the butlers pantry and she now repaired to it with some determination if the girl was loitering among the footmen or bootboys she would give her a criticism that would not lightly be forgotten at the stillroom door she stopped conscious that there was someone in the small room beyond there was a whispered voice she could not hear the words nor even if they were spoken by a man or a woman then the rusle ofsurely not silkon a maid she pushed the door open soundlessly and saw blacksuited arms cradling a taffeta bodice and over the slender shoulder the sloeeyed sensuous face of max his lips on the white neck she knew the neck knew the elegant coils of dark hair it was christina please dear heaven they had neither of them seen her she could not look anyone in the face at this moment her heart rose cold in her chest beating painfully she backed away from the door her daughter giggling in the arms of a footman horror froze her normally agile brain icy paralyzing minutes passed before she could even begin to think what to do about such a monstrous thing how to nullify it obliterate it from existence it would take work skill but it must be done otherwise christina would be ruined what man of birth in his right mind would marry her after this if it were known four reggie southeron sat in the library in his house and stared out at the leafless trees in callander square the gray november sky scudded past above them and the first heavy gusts of rain clattered on the glass he had a schooner of brandy on the small table beside him and the decanter winked comfortably in the firelight under any other circumstances he would have been entirely happy but this miserable business in the gardens was causing him a nagging anxiety of course he had no idea who might be responsibleany one of a score there was little else of entertainment in a servants life and everyone knew that most of the girls especially those who came up from the country to improve themselves were not averse to a little fun at least everyone who kept an establishment of any standard but it was possible that someone like the police who were after all no better than tradesmen or servants themselves held quite a different view some police the local ones in the country for example knew how to be discreet but it was a different case with the london men who were used to dealing with the criminal classes in general and in all probability had no concept of social rank or refinement and it was this that was worrying reggie like most men in his opinion he availed himself of the odd pleasure with a handsome parlormaid after all what healthy man woken in his bed in the morning by a young clearskinned wellrounded wench bending over him would not be tempted and if she was willing as they invariably were why resist his wife adelina was well enough and she had borne him three children although unfortunately the boy had died but she had taken no enjoyment in it she suffered his advances with fortitude and did what she had been taught was her duty parlormaids enjoyed it laughed responded in a fashion that would have been unthinkable in a woman of quality naturally one did not marry parlormaids everyone knew of such arrangements but one conducted oneself discreetly one did not wish to be the subject of gossip nor to embarrass ones wife what was presumed and what was actually known were two entirely different things but as he had already realized the police might fail to understand how these things were conducted to the satisfaction of all concerned it would be very difficult if this pitt fellow were to discover reggies present taste for the parlormaid mary ann he might misconstrue it entirely the girl was uncommonly handsome quite the best looking reggie could recall and she had been in service in callander square for three years great heavens it wasnt possible that sheactually reggie broke out in a cold sweat in spite of the fire he took a rapid swig at the brandy and poured himself another for pitys sake calm down man remember the trim waist the saucy bottom she had not been with child in this house surely he could not be so unobservant as not to have noticed she was a big girl would she have changed shape so obviously he had to admit he had been very spasmodic in his attentions sometimes he had been away for weeks at a timebut this was ridiculous someone would have noticed he was worrying for nothing it was only a matter of making sure that the police did not leap to any foolish and entirely unwarranted conclusions how intelligent was this chap pitt was he a man of the world some of the working classes could be appallingly narrowminded quite distressingly vulgar in their speech and eating not to mention dress but positive prudes when it came to personal liberty it could be very trying having to deal with them pity the man in this case could not have been a gentleman who would have understood indeed would not even have needed an explanation better to forestall the whole business by seeing the others in the square who might be affected and come to some understanding between them they ought to be able to keep this police fellow out of harms way discreetly he had made up his mind to this and was feeling considerably easier when there was a knock on the door he was surprised servants did not usually knock if they had something to do they simply came in and did it come in he answered swiveling to face the entrance the door opened and the governess jemima stood there reggie sat up with a smile handsome girl jemima though a bit on the thin side he liked a rounder bosom plumper shoulders but there was a definite charm about her a spirit in the way she held her head a delicacy of bone he had frequently been on the point of putting his arm round her in response to the inviting femininity of her slender back but she had always moved away or someone else had appeared now she stood in front of him looking levelly at him yes jemima he said cheerfully mrs southeron said i should speak to you concerning miss faiths music sir miss faith wishes to learn the violin instead of the piano well let her by all means you are competent in the violin arent you why on earth did adelina send him such trivial matters yes mr southeron but since miss chastity already plays the violin that will give us two violins and a cello there is very little music written for such a trio oh yes i see well perhaps chastity would like to learn the piano no she wouldnt jemima smiled she had a charming smile it went all the way to her eyes she would have made a good parlormaid had she been a little sturdier send her to me ill change her mind reggie leaned farther back in his chair and slid his feet toward the fire yes sir jemima turned and walked to the door she had a nice walk straightbacked head high she was one of those country girls with a swinging step she made him think of open skies and clean windy shores things he liked to contemplate from a winter armchair or see in a good painting she was a pleasing creature jemima it was quite five minutes before chastity arrived come in reggie smiled and sat up a little she obeyed solemnfaced her hair tied back making her eyes look unusually wide sit down reggie offered pointing to the chair opposite him instead of perching on the edge like the other children she snuggled far back in the deep corner like a cat with her feet tucked under her she still managed to look prim she waited for him to speak would you like to learn to play the piano chastity he asked no thank you uncle reggie playing the piano is a most useful art you can sing at the same time you cannot sing at the same time as playing the violin he pointed out she lifted her chin very slightly and stared back at him i cannot sing anyway she said with blank honesty no matter what i played she hesitated looking at him with thought faith can she sings very well the argument defeated him and he could see from the look in her bright frank eyes that she knew it why doesnt faith play the cello she pressed home her advantage then patience could learn the piano she can sing too he looked at her with a jaundiced eye and if i tell you to play the piano i shall be no good at it she said decidedly and then we shall have no trio and that would be a shame he narrowed his eyes and poured himself another brandy admiring the rich color of it shining like smoky topaz in the firelight that would be a pity chastity was still regarding him with measured consideration because aunt adelina likes us to play for her guests sometimes at her afternoon parties he gave up he was about to try another tack to wit bribery when the footman opened the door and announced inspector pitt reggie swore under his breath he had not yet considered his defense chastity snuggled still farther into the recesses of the chair he looked at her you may go chastity we will discuss the matter another time but thats the policeman with the untidy hair uncle reggie and i like him what he was startled i like him maynt i stay and talk to him i might be able to tell him something no you may not there is absolutely nothing you could possibly know that would be of any use to him now go upstairs and have your tea it must be tea time its getting dark she climbed out of the chair reluctantly and meandered to the door where pitt was standing holding it open for her she stopped craning her head to look up at him good afternoon miss southeron he said solemnly she dropped a small curtsey and the corner of her mouth flickered reluctantly into a smile good afternoon sir she seemed disposed to linger and reggie spoke to her sharply with a look of hurt dignity she swept out which was an accomplishment since she was wearing a short skirt and pinafore pitt closed the door i apologize reggie said affably the child is a menace he looked at pitts face and his quaint rather untidy attire he made an instant decision to assume an air of frankness and try to enlist the man as an ally or at least a confidant children so easily misunderstand he went on with a smile as indeed do a lot of people still i expect as a man of experience youve seen a lot of life and you know truth from error when you see it have a glass of brandy pity to use the best brandy on a policeman who probably would not know it from the stuff they sold at alehouses but it might be a good investment in the long event pitt hesitated made a rapid decision and accepted sit down reggie offered expansively wretched business dont envy you must be damned hard to sift the truth from all the inventions pitt smiled slowly taking the brandy from him maids bound to spin a few stories reggie continued natural thing read too many penny novels too much imagination never realize the damage it can do pitt raised his eyebrows inquiringly and sipped at the brandy reggie decided to press home the point while the fellow seemed so agreeable better to set him straight in advance of any gossip he might hear belowstairs where he would undoubtedly go in time easy to understand he elaborated in an attempt at jocularity without obvious condescension poor creatures havent a lot of excitement i suppose a man of intelligence would be bored to death bound to embroider the truth a little eh could be mischievous pitt agreed his clear eyes smiling back at reggie nice fellow reggie thought should not be too difficult to steer him into dismissing any unpleasant tales he might hear quite he agreed i can see that you understand must have run into it before i daresay had this kind of thing happened often pitt took another sip of his brandy not quite like this not in a square of thisquality nono i suppose not thank goodness eh still i expect youve run across servant girls whove got themselves into trouble before now eh what he laughed pitt looked blandly back at him for a man with so remarkably expressive a face he now conveyed almost nothing all sorts of people with problems he agreed ah but you know what sort of trouble i mean reggie wondered for an instant if the man were foolish perhaps he had better be more explicit babies must be some servant girls who got herself with child and the fellow wouldnt marry her or perhaps she didnt even know who he was eh pitt opened his eyes a little wider any girls of that sort of character in your establishment sir good god no reggie stiffened indignantly then realized with a flash of anger that he had just defeated his own purpose i mean not that i know of of course but it only takes one mistake perhaps a girl who entertains romantic notions thinks to better herself oroh well he broke off not quite sure what to suggest next you think that such a girl might pitt chose just the right phrase put her daydreams into words and inadvertently cause mischief quite reggie pounced on it at last the fellow seemed to have grasped the point exactly you take my meaning to a nicety could be embarrassing dont you see oh very pitt agreed very difficult to disprove too he smiled guilelessly and reggie felt sharply uncomfortable there was a very ugly truth in it there must be laws against that sort ofirresponsibility he said hotly a decent person must be able to protect himself oh there are pitt affirmed smoothly slander and all that always take it to court court dont be preposterous man whoever heard of a man taking his servant girl to court because she said he slept with her youd be the laughingstock of society probably because in many cases it would be true pitt looked at the bronzecolored brandy in his glass and no one would believe you were one of the innocent nor i suppose would they greatly care reggie felt the sweat break out on his body and turn cold there must be a law a way something to prevent it its monstrous you cant ruin a man just like that he snapped his fingers furiously and the soft flesh refused to click damn he swore in frustration i agree pitt swallowed the last of his brandy and set the glass down one must be very careful indeed when one uses anothers good name the damage done can be incalculable and there can be financial redress but there is no undoing it reggie gathered control of himself at least on the surface i shall certainly dismiss without reference or character any servant i find speaking loosely or spreading malicious gossip he said with absolute decision without a character pitt repeated and there was a bitterness in his face reggie was at a loss to understand peculiar fellow bit unreliable certainly reggie agreed man or woman who behaves like that is a menace not fit to employ still suppose you know that must have run into slander before eh after all it is a crime and crime is your livelihood what pitt did not argue instead he asked permission to speak to the servants again and when it was granted took his leave it did not occur to reggie until the evening long after pitt had gone to wonder what pitt had wanted to see him for in the first place perhaps the blighter just saw the brandy and the fire and fancied a few minutes relaxation the working classes were often the same give them a chance to idle and theyd take it with both hands still couldnt blame them entirely their life was gray enough he would have done the same after dinner the thought bothered him still more what had the wretched fellow come about was it possible he had already heard some gossip got to kill this thing before it got underway that sort of accusation in the wrong quarters could make him look ridiculous a figure of jest to take a toss with ones parlormaid was perfectly accepted probably half of london did it but to have it a subject of talk was quite another thing discretion and good taste were the cornerstones of a gentlemans conduct there were certain functions which everyone knew about and no one discussed relieving ones appetites with the servants was one of them to do so was normal part of the natural man to be supposed to do so was not worthy of comment but to be known to do so from other sources than ones own innuendos was to be a figure of ribaldry and contempt it was worse than that it was bad taste better nip this thing in the bud it was a pleasant enough evening for late november he decided to walk across the corner of the square and see freddie bolsover good fellow freddie man of sense still suppose doctors usually were knew the facts of things the inner man no dressing it up what he found freddie sitting in his withdrawing room listening to sophie play the piano he stood up quickly smiling when reggie came in he was a tall slender young man with fair face good features in a wellbred way he complemented sophie nicely reggie nice to see you nothing wrong i hope you look well enough oh fine fine reggie grasped his hand for a moment then let it go evening sophie my dear he kissed her high up the arm squeezing it a little handsome piece in her own way nice hair better than adelinas although her body was a bit bony round the shoulders not enough bosom for reggies taste how about you he added as an afterthought oh very well sophie answered and freddie nodded agreement got a bit of a problem in another area old fellow reggie glanced very slightly at sophie to indicate it was a masculine affair and she should be politely dismissed freddie obliged and sophie took herself off on some madeup errand freddie sat down again extending his feet toward the fire it was a beautiful room and reggie happened to know because adelina had told him that all the furniture and draperies were new and of the latest fashion he accepted the port freddie offered him that was jolly good too damned old well freddie inquired reggie frowned trying to frame his thoughts without betraying himself too far freddie was a good chap but no point in telling him anything he did not need to know had that police fellow nosing around again he asked looking up freddies fair eyebrows rose in surprise dont really know suppose hes bound to question the servants and so forth havent seen him myself but then theres nothing i could tell him anyway dont follow the romantic affairs of the servants hall he smiled course not reggie agreed no one does but has it occurred to you the damage they could cause by a bit of mischievous gossip in the wrong place ive spoken to this police chap civil enough but not a gentleman of course bound to have working class ideas wouldnt have servants in his own house beyond a woman for the heavy stuff he stopped not sure if freddie was following him damage freddie looked puzzled you mean if they said something stupid to this fellow lied and so forth that reggie agreed oroh come on freddie most of us have pinched a few bottoms now and then kissed a goodlooking maid spot of fun what recollection flashed in freddies face oh of course youre worried about dolly that was her name wasnt it reggie felt acutely uncomfortable he had hoped freddie might have forgotten that dolly was dead and the whole thing was in the past now of course it had been very sad the poor girl should never have gone to a backstreet abortionist he would have provided for her found her some place in the country where no one would have known her a long way from callander square naturally there was no call for her to have panicked in that way it could hardly be said to be his fault still he could have wished freddie had forgotten it he had had to call freddie at the time the girl had died in reggies house and there was no time to call a regular doctor freddie had been nearest freddie had been alone with her for a while before she died he had no idea what she might have babbled to him then please heaven he had not believed any of it yes he said recalling himself freddie was still waiting for his reply yes dolly but that couldnt have anything to do with this it was over years ago poor girl shes been dead four years by now but you know servants they romanticize if that fellow gets to question them some silly girl could be indiscreet might say i had a fancy for her police could read more into it than there was oh quite freddie agreed cant expect chaps like that to understand wouldnt do any of us any good reggie went on scandal and so on give the square a bad name wed all suffer rubs off mud sticks you know oh quite freddies face clouded as he realized precisely what reggie meant and the disadvantages to all of them yes reggie wondered whether freddie had thought of the harm to his burgeoning professional career which depended so much on a reputation for uprightness and discretion would it be necessary to put it in words for him he prodded delicately trouble is everybody that matters knows everybody else damn women spend all afternoon talking yes freddies pleasant face screwed up yes better to prevent it happening in the first place little care save a lot of talk and theyll be without a position perhaps it would be a good idea to prime the butler and see that he is with any female servant questioned by this pitt fellow in the future relief flooded through reggie what a damned good idea freddie old chap thats the answer ill have a word with dobson see that none of the women is he smiled a little harassed what thanks freddie youre a decent fellow not at all freddie smiled up at him from the back of his chair have some more port reggie settled down and filled his glass the following evening he thought it would be a good idea to further consolidate the position by having a discreet word with garson campbell as well after all campbell was a man of the world man of affairs knew how to conduct things it was a bitter night sleeting hard and several times he looked out of the window at the turbulent darkness the wet thrashing leaves and pavement glistening in the gaslight then back at the fire and thought that tomorrow would do well enough then he remembered that tomorrow that wretched policeman might come sneaking round the servants halls again and goodness knows what could be said and too late to do anything about it by then with a last reluctant look at the comfort of his chair he drank two fingers of brandy collected his coat from the footman and set out it was less than two hundred yards but by the time he reached the shelter of campbells doorway he was already shivering perhaps more from the expectation in his mind of cold than from the actuality the campbells footman opened the door and reggie stepped in smartly easing his coat off his shoulders almost before the man could get to it to take it from him mr campbell in reggie asked ill inquire sir it was a stock answer of course the man would know whether campbell was in or out it was whether he wished to see reggie that he had to discover he was shown into the morning room where there were still the embers of a fire and he stood with his back to it warming his legs until the footman returned and told him campbell would see him he was received in the main withdrawing room campbell was standing by a blaze that burned halfway up the chimney he was a heavychested man with rather a long nose not illlooking but yet certainly not handsome such charm as he had lay in a dignity of bearing and a fastidiousness both of manner and of person evening reggie he said cordially must be urgent to get you away from your fireside on a night like this what is it run out of port sack a butler whod let me do that reggie replied joining him over by the fire filthy night hate winter in london cept its a damn sight worse in the country civilized men should go to france or somewhere cept the french are a lot of barbarians what dont know how to behave paris the weathers as bad as here and the south theres nothing to do ever thought of hibernating campbell raised his eyebrows sardonically reggie wondered vaguely if he were being laughed at but it did not worry him campbell had a habit of jeering slightly at most things it was part of his manner who knew why people cultivated manners for a variety of reasons and reggie was hard to offend frequently he said with a smile unfortunately things tend to need prodding and probing every so often yknow like this wretched business of the bodies in the square filthy mess quite campbell agreed but hardly our concern nothing we can do about it except be more careful about servants in the future always give the girl some sort of help i suppose if it turns out the child was born dead find her a place in the country where no one would know about it that what you want ive loads of relatives who could be prevailed upon not quite reggie sidled closer to the fire why on earth couldnt the miserable fellow offer him a drink he glanced at campbells wry face and found the blue eyes on him damn fellow knew he wanted a drink and was deliberately not offering one nasty sense of humor the honorable garson campbell oh campbell was waiting bit anxious about the police reggie avoided his stare and assumed an attitude of concentration as if he knew something campbell did not nosing around the servants halls you know dont know quite how responsible these police are ordinary sort of chap working class naturally could start a lot of silly gossip without realizing the harm it could do freddie agrees with me campbell turned his head to look at him more closely freddie saw him yesterday reggie said casually pointed out what a nuisance it could be for all of us if the square got the reputation for loose behavior immoral servants general bad taste and so on not good you know dont want to be the butt of a lot of gossip even if its all supposition campbells mouth turned down at the corners take your point he said with a slight rasp could be difficult even if people dont believe it theyll pass it on find ourselves snubbed in clubs laughed at his face darkened fiercely bloody damned nuisance some idiotic girl who his anger died out as suddenly way of the world poor little bitch still what did you come to me about except to commiserate reggie drew a deep breath commiserations not much use none at all campbell agreed better to prevent it before it happens campbells face betrayed interest for the first time what are you suggesting reggie a discreet word with the butler or housekeeper to speak to the rest of the servants see that one or the other of them is present every time this police fellow interviews any of them get them to make sure nothingfoolishis said natural enough what not to let a young servant be bullied got to protect them eh campbell smiled with harsh amusement why reggie i never suspected you of such subtletyor such common sense then youll do it my dear idiot my household is already aware that loose talk would cost them their livelihoods but i admit it would be an added protection to make sure a butler or housekeeper is present if this whatshisnamepittcomes back again personally i think theyll probably drop it after a reasonable show of trying after all to whom does it really matter if some servant girl has two children stillborn its hardly worth raising hell in an area like this hell know that hell find out nothing that matters and offend a lot of people who could make life damned difficult for him if he gives them cause dont get yourself upset reggie theyll run around to give the impression of intent then quietly let it die do you want a glass of port reggie took a moment for the idea to seep through him with its relief then he realized campbell had offered him the port at last yes he accepted graciously thank you very civil of you not at all campbell smiled to himself and walked away to the side table to fetch the decanter augusta had noticed christinas indisposition and at first she had thought nothing of it beyond a natural sympathy it was easy enough to eat or drink something which did not agree with one then on the appalling discovery of christina in the arms of the wretched footman max the incident came back to her mind with rather more anxiety when the indisposition occurred again a week later and she heard from the ladys maid that christina was to remain in her bed for the morning she felt something considerably more like alarm she did not wish general balantyne to know anything about ithe would be entirely useless if indeed there were such a crisis as her worst fears framed and if there were not there was no purpose in alarming him they were at the breakfast table when she was informed and after a moments silent panic she thanked the woman civilly and bade her return to christina and care for her then she requested the general to pass her the orange conserve to spread upon her toast pity the general said quietly passing across the jar poor girl hope its nothing serious want to send for the doctor always ask freddie to slip over if she doesnt want a fuss nothing he can do for a chill on the stomach she replied smoothly heavens above the last thing she wanted now was a doctor charming as he is he cant change the weather lots of pestilence of one sort or another in the autumn i shall have cook make her an herbal tea that will do as much good as anything no doubt it will cure itself in a day or two he looked at her with slight surprise but rather than argue continued with his deviled kidneys bacon eggs and toast when she had finished her meal so as not to appear in a hurry and give the matter undue importance she excused herself and went upstairs if there were no reason for alarm so much the better but if her worst fears were validand she remembered with a cold shiver through her flesh the familiarity of that touch in the stillroom pantry the ease with which the hands had caressed the silk bodice under the breastsand it was indeed true then she must think now what to do about it if there were any hope at all of saving the situation it lay in immediate action every additional day would make it harder and if she did not succeeda lesser woman would have flinched even from the thought but even her enemies and she had several would never have denied that augusta had couragethere lay ahead for christina little but endless unhappiness to have an illegitimate child was a sin never completely forgiven by the society in which christina moved in which she had been brought up and in which were all her friends indeed the society which would enable her to have the only life for which she was fitted it might be possible with care and money dispersed in appropriate places to create some fiction to take her away from london for the necessary period of time have the child brought up on the country estate adopted by some good serving woman it would take skill but it was not impossible it had surely been done by others christina was not the first nor would she be the last in this predicament if only that were all but there was max an ambitious and ruthless man of course she had realized from the day she had employed him that he was intent above all things on bettering himself and she had thought that that would make him an excellent footman ambitious men were good employees and so he had proved in respect of his job he was always immaculate always punctual always more than civil indeed she had received many compliments as to his quality but she blamed herself now for not realizing that his ambition would lead him to use any means that offered to advance himself even to lying with his employers daughter she did not delude herself for a moment that there was any affection involvedon either side and she should also have known her daughter better she should have seen the weakness in her and protected her from it what else were mothers for max had forged himself a weapon if he chose to use it to spread gossip gently like slow poison christina would be ruined no man of her own class would marry her no matter what her dowry there was always a surfeit of personable young women in the marriage market and christina possessed no special advantage at least none that would outweigh the reputation of a trollop to be highspirited was one thing to be a whore and to have borne a child to a footman was quite another the only world she knew or could cope with would be as closed to her as the bank of england max must be silenced not by bribery of any sort give in to him even once and they would be hostage to him for the rest of their lives it must be a counterthreat of equal magnitude not only for christinas sake but for the whole family for the general and for young brandy as well as herself if brandy should fall in love or even find agreeable some wellconnected girl what parents would allow their daughter to marry into a family whose blood bred such as christina she was on the landing with her hand raised to christinas door when the worst thought of all came to her she nearly fainted from the sheer horror of it max had been in their employ for six years she sincerely believed that if such an appalling thing had happened before she would have known itbut what if she had not and would the police believe it could they even afford to unless she was very much mistaken that young man pitt was of uncommon intelligence he would pursue the matter question christina perhaps even discover that it was max and draw from him all the sordid truth what would he believe of the bodies in the square then what did she herself believe she let her hand fall to the wood and before christina replied she pushed the door open christina was lying on the bed looking pale and peaked her features unusually sharp her dark hair spread on the pillow around her augusta felt a moments pity for her then it passed and she forced her attention to preventing the far worse pain that threatened sick she asked simply christina nodded her head augusta came in and shut the door there was no point in mincing words she sat on the end of the bed and looked at her daughter is it an illness you have caught from max she said looking at christinas eyes christina tried to look away and failed she was used to getting her own way to charming or dominating everyone but never since childhood had she succeeded with her mother whatwhat do you mean mama she said stiltedly there is no point in prevaricating christina if you are with child there is a great deal we have to do i have no wish to frighten you unnecessarily but i dont think you have realized the seriousness of our predicament if it is so christina opened her mouth and closed it again augusta waited i dont know christina said very quietly there was a shiver in her voice and she was having to struggle hard not to cry it was only pride that prevented her and the knowledge that her mother would not have cried augusta asked the question she dreaded but she would shirk nothing she needed to know is this the first time christina stared eyes enormous with indignant disbelief and then horror as she realized what augusta meant what she was thinking her face was as bleached as the sheet oh mother you cant think i wouldoh no good i did not think you would but it is not what i think that matters it is what the police think or have enough cause to consider that they raise the possibility mother i shall deal with it you will not see max again until i have secured his silence you will remain in bed you have a chill is that understood yes mama she was too shocked and too frightened to argue do you thinkthe policei mean i intend that they shall not know anything to think one way or the other and you will do exactly as i tell you to that end christina nodded silently and augusta looked at her pale face remembering how she had felt for the first few weeks when she had been with child with christina herself what a lifetime ago that seemed brandy had been a small boy still in skirts and his father had been younger his face less lean his body a few pounds slimmer but just as straight shoulders as broad and stiff how could a man change so little his voice his manners even his thoughts seemed all the same it will pass she said gently it will not be more than a few weeks then you will feel better i shall have cook make you a beef tea thank you mama christina whispered and closed her eyes augusta racked her brains and her imagination for a way to make sure of maxs silence without at the same time giving him a weapon for future use but by the following morning she had achieved no more than the elimination of all the impossibilities and was left with little else she was in an ill temper to receive him when pitt arrived at a quarter past ten when she first learned that it was max who had shown him in a moment of panic seized her then she realized that maxs ambition would never allow him to waste his valuable knowledge by giving it to pitt who would pay him nothing for it instead of first offering it to augusta who might pay him in all sorts of ways only beginning with money and progressing through advancement to heaven knew what avaricious heights she found pitt in the morning room warming his hands in front of the fire it was another bitter day a hard east wind driving needles of sleet in from the north sea and she could hardly blame any living creature for availing itself of any warmth at all yet she resented this policeman in front of her fire he did not move because he had not heard her enter good morning mr pitt she said coldly what is it this time he was startled and he took a moment to compose himself before he turned to face her good morning maam im afraid we have not yet discovered the truth regarding the bodies in the square do you seriously imagine mr pitt that you ever will she raised her eyebrows in disbelief perhaps not maam but i must try a great deal harder before i give up indeed it seems like a waste of public money to me it was perhaps a waste of human life which is infinitely more precious we also seem to have infinitely more of it she said dryly but of i presume you have to do your duty as you see it what is it you imagine i can do that will help you give me your permission to speak to your staff again maam and perhaps to miss christina balantyne she may have observed some behavior some small sign that you have been too busy to note augusta felt her stomach tighten was it conceivable he had already heard something could max have been sono surely not max was above all ambitious he wanted his advantage to use not to squander im sorry you may speak to the servants of course although i must insist that you do not distress them unnecessarily and i shall have some responsible person with you to that end but i regret my daughter is unwell and confined to her bed naturally she cannot see anyone oh dear his expressive face composed itself into lines of sympathy she had no idea whether he meant it or not i do hope it is only a passing indisposition we believe so she replied the season of the year no doubt it is inclined to affect one now which of the servants do you wish to see the female ones i presume if you please she reached for the bell i shall have the butler assist you i should prefer to speak to them alone his presence might inhibit them make them feel less free to no doubt but for their protection the butler will remain with you i will not have young girls who are my responsibility intimidated even unwittingly into saying things which they may afterward regret perhaps you do not realize how young and how ignorant some of them are most suggestible and easily led lady augusta those are the conditions on which you may speak with them mr pitt quite reasonable i believe there was no further argument he could offer without betraying foreknowledge of some particular guilt and she defied him at this point to do so maam he acquiesced with a slight smile in recognition of her superior tactics had he been a gentleman she might even have liked him for a moment she felt no such sentiment toward charlotte ellison when she arrived shortly before midday to assist the general with his papers miss ellison was a young woman she could not warm tothere was an element of emotion about her of unpredictability which was dangerous one could not plan for it because it fell within none of the rules and yet she seemed harmless enough she came and went silently and was certainly both civil and at least to all appearances wellbred enough but why should any young woman desire to help a middleaged general sort out papers pertaining to battles and regiments instead of seeking herself a husband it was a question to which at a less preoccupied time she would have sought an answer as it was she contented herself with asking brandon over luncheon what manner of creature she was and if she gave satisfaction as to her clerical ability yes he said with slight surprise she appears to be of uncommon intelligence for a woman you mean of uncommon interest in those things which interest youfor a woman augusta replied with some asperity is that not more or less what i said no it is not most women have perfectly good intelligence for the things which matter such as the conduct of ones daily life but do not desire to apply themselves to the dissection of battles that concerned other people in other countries and at other times i consider such an interest quite eccentric and most unnatural in a young woman of decent upbringing nonsense he said briskly anyone of intelligence ought to appreciate the great history of our nation we are the greatest military nation in the world we have spread our civilization to every land and clime god made we have created an empire and a peace that is the envy and the blessing of the world every woman of british blood should be proud of that proud of it of course she agreed testily reaching for the anchovy pate but not concerned with the details he took the last piece of toast and did not bother to reply it was after that conversation that augusta turned her thoughts uninterruptedly to the matter of maxs silence and at last came up with a satisfactory answer it was in the quiet hour previous to dinner that she decided to tackle the practical application of it she went to the small withdrawing room where she would be undisturbed and sent for max to attend her she felt an overwhelming almost suffocating dislike of him when he came in he looked completely bland as if he expected to discuss some small domestic affair with her she had never noticed before how insolent his eyes were how veiled she must keep the most perfect control of herself good evening max she said coolly good evening my lady there is no purpose to be served by our prevaricating i have sent for you to discuss a matter which i intend shall be dealt with if not to our mutual advantage at least not to the disadvantage of either of us whether that turns out to be so depends on you yes my lady his face betrayed nothing you have been foolish enough to engage yourself in a liaison with my daughter you will cease immediately to pay her any attentions whatsoever you will leave my employ and take up a post in scotland which i shall arrange for you and for which i will provide you with references i have no wish to work in scotland my lady he stood square in front of her his eyes burning with slow amusement probably not but that is of no concern to me i have relations in stirlingshire who will oblige me by finding you a place the alternative is prison which i believe is even colder and more barbarous than scotland prison my lady he raised surprised eyebrows to lie with a lady of quality especially if that lady is more than willing i may add may be indiscreet even socially offensive to some but it is not a crime and even if it were i doubt you would wish to charge me with it there seemed a distinct sneer on his mouth no of course not but stealing silver from ones employer is a crime she met his eyes equally unflinchingly his face froze for an instant understanding dawning in his eyes i have not stolen any silver my lady no but if silver were to be missing and it were to be found in your belongings you would find it uncommonly difficult to prove that you had not that is blackmail how perceptive of you i thought you would take the point quite easily if i were to be charged with such a thing i should naturally in my own defense give the reason for your accusation he watched her carefully waiting for the slightest sign of weakness she gave him nothing possibly she said coolly but that would be foolish because you would then find yourself charged with slander as well and who do you imagine would be believedlady augusta balantyne dealing with a dishonest servant with ideas above his station or the servant bearing a grudge for having been discovered come max you are above all not stupid he stared at her with malignant hate swelling in his sensuous face she did not look down but stared back at him with equal and undeviating steadiness five general balantyne was very satisfied with the way his memoirs were coming along the military history of his family really was remarkable and the more he put his papers in order the more outstanding he perceived it to be there was a heritage of discipline and sacrifice of which anyone might be proud but far more than that there was an urgency an excitement to it more real than the petty domesiticity and the polite fictions of his daily life in callander square the early winter rain drenched the gray cobbles outside but his imagination felt the rain of quatre bras and waterloo nearly seventy years ago where his grandfather had lost an arm and a leg struggling through the mud of belgian fields behind the iron duke scarlet coats and blues the charge of the scots grays the end of an empire and the beginning of a new age the heat from the fire in the grate scorched his legs and he felt in it the blistering sun of india thought of tippoo sultan the black hole of calcutta where his greatgrandfather had perished he knew the heat himself the spear wound on his thigh was not yet totally healed from the zulu wars only three years ago it still ached in the cold to remind him perhaps that would be his last battle as the nightmare of the crimea had been his first he was still frightened far back in the recesses of his memory by the dreadful cold and the slaughter at sebastopol the dead lying all over the place bodies wasted with cholera blown apart by shot frozen to death in grotesque positions some huddled like children asleep and the horses god knew how many horses dead poor beasts foolish that the horses should worry him so much he had been eighteen at balaclava he had come up with a message from his own commander for lord cardigan in time to see that unspeakable charge he remembered the wind in his face the smell of blood gunpowder and the tornup earth as six hundred and seventythree men and horses galloped against the entrenched guns of the entire russian position he had sat his horse beside the craggy old men bemused in the uproar angry while below them in the valley two hundred and fifty men and six hundred horses obeyed their orders and were slaughtered his father was in the eleventh hussars and was one of those who did not stagger back his uncle had been in the ninetythird highlanders and held the thin red line five hundred and fifty men between thirty thousand russians and balaclava itself like so many he had died where he stood it had been he brandon who had sat in the bitter cold of a trench to write to his mother to tell her her husband and her brother were dead he could still feel now the agony of trying to find the words then he had gone on to fight at inkerman and the fall of sebastopol it had seemed then as if the whole tide of asia were sweeping over them with the fetch of half the earth behind it surely those not yet born would hear in their hearts the guns of these battles and feel the pride and the pain the confusionsand the sweep of history could he be so inarticulate as to have lived it himself and pass on nothing of the taste in the mouth the beat of the blood the tears afterward the young woman miss ellison seemed competent and pleasant enough although perhaps pleasant was not the word she was too definite in her attitudes and opinions to be entirely agreeable to him but she was intelligent that was beyond question he was relieved of the necessity of having to explain anything more than once in fact on occasion he had found she had seized the point before he had finished with a first instruction which he had found faintly annoying and yet she meant no harm and she certainly gave herself no airs indeed she appeared to be more than happy to eat in the servants hall rather than put cook to the trouble of setting her a separate tray more than once she had actually made suggestions as to how he might proceed which he had difficulty in accepting with grace but he was obliged to admit that her ideas were quite good in fact he had not actually thought of anything better himself as he was sitting in the library now he considered what he would write next and what miss ellison might judge of it he was irritated to be interrupted by max at the door to say that mr southeron was in the morning room wishing to see him and was he at home he hesitated the last thing he wanted was to be bothered with reggie southeron right now but reggie was a neighbor and as such had to be tolerated not to do so would provoke reactions that would be endless and cause all sorts of minor discomforts max was waiting silently his immaculate figure and calm smile annoyed him as much as the request he made wish augusta would get rid of him and find someone else yes of course he said tartly and youd better bring something to drinkthe madeira not the best no sir max withdrew and a moment later reggie came in large affable clothes already settled in comfortable creases although he could not have had them on for more than a couple of hours morning brandon reggie said cheerfully eyes glancing round the room noting the fire the comfortable deep leather chairs looking for the decanter and glasses good morning reggie balantyne replied what brings you visiting on a saturday morning been meaning to see you for a while actually reggie sat down in the chair nearest the fire not had a decent opportunity before always something else going on what place like a beehive lately balantyne had not to this point been paying more than nominal attention to him but now he began to hear a note of strain in reggies voice and that in spite of his bonhomie he had come about something specific that caused him an anxiety he was needing to share max would be back with the madeira in a moment and there was no point in approaching anything serious until he had gone i gather youve been busy he said conversationally not me really reggie replied those wretched police fellows all over the damn place pitt whatshisname creeping around the servants halls upsetting everything damnation how i hate upheavals in the house servants all in a twitter great heavens man you must know how difficult it is to get decent servants and train them to the way you want them to know your own tastes and how to cater to them takes long enough and then some damned fool thing like this has to happen and before you know where you are theyre all unsettled its hard enough at any time to keep a good servant get ideas of bettering themselves fancy working for a duke or an earl or something take an idea for foreign travel think theyre badly done by if they dont get to spend the season in london summer in the country and the worst of the winter in the south of france wretched creatures take offense at the oddest things and before you know it theyre off deuce knows why half the time no loyalty but doesnt take a fool to know theyll all go if this damned fellow pitt goes on asking questions about their private lives and their morals interfering and making suggestions his voice trailed off in exasperation as he anticipated a bleak winter of training new and unsatisfactory servants cold rooms burnt meals unpressed clothes balantyne did not think the eventuality in the least likely although admittedly he did not especially value his creature comforts but he did value his peace of mind the domestic conflict such a crisis would provoke was truly appalling to contemplate he did not like reggie very much they were as different as men could be but he was sorry for the mans obvious fears unfounded though they might prove to be shouldnt worry about it he said casually max came in with the decanter and glasses set them down and departed closing the door silently reggie helped himself without being asked wouldnt you reggie demanded with a mixture of anxiety and offense not very likely balantyne declined the madeira he did not like the stuff and it was too early in the day no good servant is going to hand in notice because shes asked a few questions unless shes already got another place to go to and hes pretty civil this fellow pitt none of my household has complained for gods sake man would you know if they had reggie lost his temper at last augusta runs your house like a regiment most efficient creature ive ever met she wouldnt tell you if the whole lot were in revolt shed deal with it and youd still get your dinner in time balantyne resented the implication that he was a useless appendage to his own household but he reminded himself that the man was frightened although he had no idea why and he made an allowance for him it is not very likely anyone will give notice now he said calmly it would suggest guilt to the police and no doubt make things harder for them than remaining here and carrying on in a normal manner oddly enough even this with its impeccable logic did not noticeably soothe reggie he sat rumpled deep in the armchair and glowered at his glass bad business though he said gloomily dont suppose for a moment theyll ever find out who did it waste of time all theyll do is stir up a lot of speculation and gossip he looked up could do us a lot of harm you know brandon not good to have the police hanging around people think there must be something wrong balantyne could see his point but there was nothing they could do about it and he was inclined to think that reggie was exaggerating ill lay you odds carlton would agree reggie said quickly a lift in his voice above suspicion you know caesars wife and all that foreigners are inclined to be funny got to keep an immaculate reputation what he said was probably true balantyne frowned looking at reggie through narrowed eyes reggie had poured himself another glass and unless balantyne was mistaken it was not his second or even his third today what was he really frightened of what does he say reggie pressed havent spoken to him balantyne replied honestly might be a good idea if you did reggie tried to smile and ended with a grimace that was more like bared teeth would myself but i dont know him as well as you do influential man he might be able to make the police see sense theyll never find out who the woman was not a chance in hell probably some servant girl whos moved away by now wouldnt want to hang around would she the police will have thought of that balantyne answered we havent dismissed any servants or had them leave in the last couple of years have you suddenly recollection came to him in a blinding understanding it seemed stunningly obvious now how long ago since dolly died he said baldly the blood drained from reggies face till balantyne thought he was going to faint his skin looked sweaty gray was that your child that killed her reggie he asked reggies mouth opened like a fish and closed again silently he could not find a lie that would be of any use i thought that was more than two years ago balantyne went on it was reggie found his tongue at last his lips stiff it was four years couldnt possibly have anything to do with it but you know what people are give a dog a bad name theyll think because he foundered in the lie and took another glass of madeira there was no need to press him about the present the truth was too obvious the reason he wanted the police out of the square away from talkative servants poor fool i expect theyll give up of their own accord soon balantyne said with a pity he resented feeling but ill see what carlton feels when i get an opportunity dont suppose that pitt chap wants to spend more time than he has to up a blind alley no good for his career no reggie cheered up visibly dont suppose we need to point that out to him his words were a little blurred but speak to carlton all the same he must know people few words in the right places could get it closed a bit sooner save a lot of nasty gossip some public money too whole things a waste of time he stood up a little shakily thanks old man thought youd understand christina did not appear for luncheon and brandy was spending a week in the country with friends he found himself alone at the table with augusta christina still not better he said with a touch of anxiety why hasnt she seen a doctor get freddie to look at her if meredith cant come not necessary augusta replied reaching for cold salmon its only a chill cook prepared her a tray have some of the salmon its one brandy caught last weekend in cumberland very good dont you think he took some and tasted it excellent are you sure its nothing worse shes been in bed for a long time quite sure a spell in bed will do her no harm shes been overdoing it lately too many parties which reminds me have you remembered we are dining with the campbells this evening he had not remembered still it could have been worse garson campbell was an interesting fellow dry humor if a little cynical and mariah was a more than usually sensible woman hardly ever heard her indulge in gossip or the endless flirtations that so many women seemed to engage their emotions with was that reggie southeron here this morning augusta asked yes what did he want on a saturday morning nothing really in a bit of a lather about the police upsetting the servants with a lot of questions and insinuations upsetting the servants she said incredulously he looked at her across the salmon yes why not dont be ridiculous brandon reggie never gave a hoot about the servants his own or anybody elses what did he intend you should do about it anyway he smiled in spite of himself what makes you think he intended me to do anything about it he didnt come here to drink your madeira you always give him the worst and he knows it what did he want he suggested i should speak to robert carlton to see if he can persuade the police to let the thing lie theyll probably never discover the truth anyway all they can achieve is to waste their time and stir up a lot of gossip he could be right he is right she agreed tartly but i doubt that is why he is concerned and i would be surprised if that odd young manpitt i think his name iswill let it die until he has explored a good deal further than he has so far but you can try by all means if you wish dont let reggie make a fool of himself it will rub off on all of us apart from the embarrassment to adelina poor creature why should reggie make a fool of himself he had no intention of telling her about dolly it was not a matter for a decent woman to know of augusta sighed sometimes brandon i wonder if you affect to be obtuse merely to annoy me reggie wishes to keep the police from questioning his own servants too closely which you must know quite as well as i do i dont know what you are talking about he did not wish to have to explain to her something which would both shock and distress her she would find it sordid as indeed perhaps it was but a common human failing which women were apt since the offense was against them to view differently and without the compassion a man might feel augusta snorted and pushed away her empty plate the pudding was brought in and served when they were alone again she looked at him coolly then perhaps i had better tell you before you unwittingly say something clumsy and embarrass us all reggie sleeps with all his parlormaids so no doubt he is afraid the police will discover it and be less than discreet about it they may even think he has wandered farther afield he was stunned she was speaking about it as if it hardly mattered how on earth do you know he said hoarsely my dear brandon everybody knows one doesnt discuss it of course but one knows adelina of course she knows do you take her for a fool doesnt shemind ive no idea one doesnt ask and naturally she doesnt mention it he was stunned he could think of no reply adequate to his confusion he had always known that womens minds and emotions worked on lines not comprehensible to men but never before had it been so forcibly brought home to him augusta was still looking at him i wish there were some way it could be kept from that policeman for adelinas sake she went on but i have not so far thought of any that is why it might be a good idea for you to approach robert carlton to see if he can get the investigation shelved it can hardly serve any purpose now even in the unlikely event of their discovering which poor girl was responsible there is the small matter of justice he said indignantly his feelings stunned once again how on earth could she speak of it as if it were all irrelevant as if they had not been human babies now dead possibly murdered really brandon sometimes i despair of you she said as she passed him the caramel sauce you are the most impractical man i ever knew why are soldiers such dreamers you would think with the command of armies in their charge they would at least be practical if nothing else wouldnt you she sighed but then i suppose war is really the most idiotic of all pursuits so perhaps not he stared at her as if she were a totally alien creature as if she had changed shape from the known to the unknown in front of him naturally you dont understand war he dismissed the last subject but even if justice is too abstract a concept for you surely as a woman who has borne children herself you are moved to compassion she put down her spoon and fork and leaned a little forward the children are dead whether they were born dead or died afterward they are beyond our help now the mother will have been through deeper hell than you can imagine or probably than i can either whatever manner of woman she was she will have paid for it in grief in this life and will answer to god for it in the next what else is it you want from her her example will not prevent it happening again i assure you as long as there are both men and women in the world yes your idea of justice is far too abstract for me it is a word that sounds sonorous and pleasing to you but you have no idea what it means from day to day you have satisfied your ideals and someone else is left to live it through this thing is better buried it is a pity those men ever went to plant their tree if you can persuade robert carlton to exert a little influence and have the police leave well enough alone it will be the best days work you have done in a long time now if you intend to eat that pudding you had better do so before it gets cold or it will give you indigestion i am going upstairs to see how christina is and she stood up and walked out leaving him staring after her speechless balantyne worked on his military papers in the afternoon because they were something he was sure of perhaps in time augusta would explain herself or else the matter would fall into recess of memory and cease to be important it was early evening and already dark and turning very cold when max announced robert carlton balantyne had always liked carlton he was a man whose quiet confidence and dignity appealed to him the best type of englishman who followed the military into all the corners of the empire to govern and teach civilization where it was hitherto unknown they were two partners to the same cause and he felt they had an instinctive understanding an inbred sense of duty and justice this evening he was especially pleased to see him because the mass of papers palled on him it was more difficult without miss ellison to assist him and in truth gave him less than the usual satisfaction he stood up with a smile his hand out evening robert come in and warm yourself best fire in the house have a sherry or whisky if you like it must be about that time he glanced at the brass carriage clock on the mantelpiece how he hated the ormolu one in the withdrawing room and the fat cherubs round it it did not even keep correct time no thank you not yet balantyne looked at him in surprise then saw his face clearly for the first time there were gray lines under his eyes and a flat bare look about his whole aspect augusta would have been subtle but he was incapable of it for heavens sake man have one you look as if you need it whats the matter carlton stood by the fire unsure how to begin and balantyne realized he had embarrassed him by noticing a private distress he was not yet able to put into words he was in turn embarrassed by his own clumsiness why could he not be warmer more instinctive he knew how to act in a crisis but so often not what to say the silence hung between them growing worse it was carlton who resolved it im sorry yes i would like a whisky im a little upset this evening he stopped still looking not at balantyne but at the fire am i holding you up from changing to dine no no plenty of time going to the campbells oh yes of course so are we forgot balantyne poured two whiskys from the decanter on the sideboard and passed him one surely carlton wanted to discuss whatever it was was that not why he had come anything wrong in particular he asked had that police chap pitt round again balantyne opened his mouth to ask if the servants were upset then realized that such a domestic disturbance would hardly cause the distress he thought he saw he remained silent waiting for carlton to frame whatever it was that lay so close under the surface it was a few minutes before it came but this silence was one of patience i think they suspect euphemia carlton said at last balantyne was stunned he could think of nothing coherent to say how could they possibly suspect euphemia carlton it was preposterous he must have misunderstood especially since the more he thought about it the more he honestly believed it was most likely to be some indulgence of reggies and reggie knew it which was why he was in such a sweat he suddenly remembered that reggie had wanted him to get carlton to have the investigation suppressed it was ludicrous they cant he said flatly it doesnt make any sense at all and pitts an ordinary sort of chap but hes not a fool they wouldnt let him be an inspector if he made wild charges like that you must have misunderstood something apart from anything else euphemia could have no reason carlton still looked into the fire keeping his face away yes she has brandon she has a lover from many men that would have meant little as long as it were not publicly known but to carlton it was a sacrilege against his home his most private person balantyne understood that much although he could not feel the same inner injury to purity and pride himself if augusta had betrayed him he would have been above all surprised and yes angry too but not wounded except on the surface im sorry he said simply thank you carlton accepted it with the same politeness he might have received a compliment or a glass of wine but balantyne could see the pain in his drawn face you see carlton went on they think she might have got rid of the children in case themade herher situation obvious yes of course but surely you would have known i meana woman you live withyour wife if she had been with child i do not ask aagreat deal of euphemia carlton said awkwardly his shoulders stiff his face turned away i am considerably older than she isi do notlike to he could not find words to finish but his meaning was obvious balantyne had never been so delicate about feelings least of all augustas and suddenly he saw himself as a boor he was ashamed for himself and for carlton he was inexplicably hurt how could euphemia with a man so sensitive to her loving her so deeply have behaved like this but neither his anger nor his disgust would be of any ease to carlton now im sorry he said again do you know who no it is all verydiscreet still the police say as little as they can do you know if shecares for him no i dont you havent asked her carlton turned and sheer surprise for a moment superseded the pain in his face of course not i couldntspeakto her of it it would be he held out his hands helplessly no balantyne had no idea why he agreed he was agreeing for carlton not for himselfhe would have had a blazing row about itbut he could see that this quiet man with whom he had thought he had so much in common was utterly different im awfully sorry robert i wish i knew what to say for the first time carlton smiled very faintly thank you brandon there really isnt anything to say i dont know why i bothered you with it except that i felt like speaking to someone yes balantyne suddenly found his awkwardness again yes yes of course ier carlton drank the last of his whisky and put the glass down better get back home must be toward dinner time got to change give my regards to augusta good night and thank you good night he let out his breath again there was nothing to say he thought several times of mentioning the subject to augusta but somehow could not bring himself to do it it seemed a private matter between men for another woman to have known would have compounded the injury it was still at the back of his mind when miss ellison arrived on monday morning to continue with the papers he was surprisingly pleased to see her perhaps because she was outside the family and knew nothing of callander square or its wounds added to which she was cheerful without being in the least coquettish as he grew older he found coquettish women increasingly offensive good morning miss ellison he smiled without thinking she was a pleasing creature not conventionally beautiful and yet there was a richness about her the wealth of mahoganycolored hair the clear skin and the intelligence in her eyes for a woman she talked remarkably little nonsense funny she was probably not more than four or five years older than christina who seldom spoke of anything but gossip or fashion and who might marry whom he realized with a start that she was waiting for him to instruct her as to what he wished her to do i have a box of letters here he fished it out from my grandfather would you please sort them out those that refer to military matters from those that are purely personal certainly she took the box would you like them categorized categorized he was still not concentrating yes those from the peninsular war those written before quatre bras and after waterloo and those from the military hospital and during the hundred days do you not think they would be interesting also yes yes please that would be excellent he watched her remove them and go to sit at the far side of the room by the fire her head bent over the old paper and the faded youthful handwriting he saw in her for a moment his grandmother as she must have read those letters sitting in an england at war with the emperor a young wife with infant children he had no idea what she had looked like had she the same long curve of cheek slender throat so very feminine and the tiny wisps of hair soft on the nape of the neck he shook himself strongly the thought was ridiculous she was merely a young woman who had an interest in old letters and was competent to sort them charlotte on the other hand was quite unconscious of the general she forgot him as soon as she read the first sentence in the round faded writing her imagination took her to lands she had never seen and she tried to feel with the young soldier the emotions he described his terror of the pressed men in the ranks which he knew he must hide his friendship for the surgeon his awe at meeting the iron duke himself there was humor in them and unconscious pathos sometimes and a lot of things he did not say about cold and hunger aching legs wounds and fear long monotony and sudden confusion of action she went down to luncheon in a dream and the afternoon slipped by before she thought of time it was dark when she got home and less than a half hour later emily arrived at the door her coach horses stamping in the frost outside their breath adding to the early fog well she demanded as soon as she was through the door charlotte was still in spain and the peninsular war she stared at emily blankly emily shut the door behind her and took a deep breath what have you found out at the balantynes she said patiently you have been there i presume oh yes of course charlotte realized with a wave of guilt that she had done nothing to justify emilys trust in her over the six days she had already been in callander square many times she added i am coming to know some of the servants quite well never mind the servants emily said quickly what about christina is she with child and whether she is or not why does she think that she is who is the father and why does she not marry him instead of allowing this ridiculous situation is he already married or promised to someone else her eyes widened oh of course he is unsuitable it is a love match then her face fell again no it isnt not christina she sighed oh charlotte havent you found out anything at all her expression crumpled in disappointment till charlotte felt genuinely sorry for her and even more strongly that she had let her down i really will try tomorrow but christina has been in bed ever since i got there they say she has a chill but they havent called the doctor who are they emily asked her interest quickening again the servants of course good gracious lady augusta doesnt speak to me except to be civil and the general never talks of anything but his papers but servants are very inquisitive you know they would not do anything they would be obliged to admit to as gossip but if it can be disguised as anything else they will tell you everything they know and most of what they merely surmise well emily said eagerly what do they surmise for pitys sake tell me before i explode they think that the police will never discover the truth and will not really exert themselves greatly to try because whoever is guilty it will doubtless involve a gentleman and therefore they will not be able to prosecute anyway which i would like to think is nonsense but i fear they may speak with a bitterness of experience which gentleman emily could hardly contain herself and her words came out in exasperation between closed teeth there are as many ideas on that as there are servants to propose them charlotte replied honestly indeed there have been some most heated exchanges one of the housemaids is sure it cannot be young brandon balantyne because he has never made an advance toward her although the cook tells me he has assuredly been given the opportunity another housemaid is perfectly certain that it is him for precisely the same reason he has not made an advance toward her either therefore he must have some dreadful secret of course euphemia carlton but emilys answer lacked any satisfaction somehow i am reluctant to think that it is she perhaps because i liked her i fear i am not cut out for detection but it will soon be appropriate for me to call again without appearing to be too pushy in the acquaintance she sighed again but charlotte you really will have to do better you are not trying how can you possibly consider a war that was over in to be more interesting than a murder that is going on this very minute charlotte corrected automatically and we dont know that it is murder oh dont be so pernickety what does it matter as to the niceties it is certainly the most terrific scandal which is more than you can say for your wretched wars do pull yourself together please and apply your mind properly i will i promise i will do my very best to see christina myself and if possible at least to begin to discover why she does not marry her lover and who he is if i can thank you emily assumed an air of patient generosity as one who has decided to overlook an offense you might even get the opportunity to speak with other servants in the square of course if you do you will avail yourself of it it was on charlottes tongue to tell her younger sister not to be bossy when she took into account emilys passion for the matter and the possibility of her boredom with the pointlessness of her own social round and instead merely agreed to do her best and leave no chance unexplored when pitt arrived a moment later emily was just leaving a broad anticipatory smile on her face she looks like a cat who has spied the canary out of its cage pitt observed when the door was closed she is very well charlotte said noncommittally beyond doubt he agreed a cat in excellent health who is to be the unfortunate canary this time that is unfair she was very reluctant to let him know anything about it because as yet he knew only that she was assisting general balantyne in some clerical work in which she herself had a longstanding interest that her father had not let her indulge he had no idea that she was or planned to be concerning herself in the callander square affair still less that emily had ignored her promise to let the matter drop she was only indulging in a little speculative gossip she finished that should satisfy him as likely enough without in any way giving him to believe an untruth about whom he asked pardon come charlotte he put his hand on her shoulder and turned her to face him the warmth and the strength of him still thrilled her she raised her eyes to look at him in part quite genuinely because she loved him and wished him to know it and only in small part to distract him from his question a moment or two later he let go of her charlotte what is emily doing in callander square he repeated and even more important what are you doingapart from sorting papers for general balantyne she considered lying but as emily had said she was no good at it instead she made a strategic withdrawal emily has not been calling at callander square lately to do so too often would be obvious and so defeat the purpose she asked me if i had learned anything about christina balantyne of course i have not she is in bed with a chill and i havent even met her emily persuaded me that i should endeavor at least to find out who her lover is and why she does not marry him instead of taking to her bed charlotte he frowned and there was a mixture of amusement and apprehension in his eyes she felt totally innocent yes what makes you suppose christina has a lover oh she realized she had given herself away pitt was waiting and there was no evading him now without lying which she could not do emily found out she admitted and she told me christina is afraid she may be with child that naturally must mean that she has a lover he stared at her and she had no idea what thoughts were in his mind his eyes grew wider and his eyebrows climbed higher he had the clearest most penetrating eyes she had ever seen she felt as if the very inside of his mind reached out into her then just as suddenly his mood changed how very enterprising of emily there was a lift of admiration in his voice and she thought of amusement also that explains why lady augusta would not let me see her he went on that is a most interesting question why not simply marry albeit a little hastily the interest faded from his expression charlotte you must tell general balantyne you cannot assist him any more she was horrified oh no i cant possibly do that i am less than halfway through charlotte if they have something to hide theres no danger she said quickly i havent asked any questions i merely listen to the servants at meal times im not like emily i shall be very discreet he laughed outright my dear you are nothing like emily she is a model of discretion compared with you you are to make your apologies say you are unwell or your mother is no what can they do to me i have no social position to lose and they dont even think of me as a person they wont suspect anything ill just listen i promise another thought flashed into her mind and she played her trump card if i leave now they may indeed wonder why and take the trouble to discover who i am she knew enough not to remind him of any danger to his own career it would be the last way to deter him the best way she went on is to continue normally and then they will think nothing of it she smiled sweetly in the last moment sure of herself he hesitated weighing his decision will you give me your promise you will not ask questions he said finally she wondered whether she could keep it she plunged yes ill only listen i give you my word she reached up and kissed him but he still regarded her carefully assuring himself that she indeed intended her promise it was a promise that was increasingly difficult for charlotte to keep as the very next day presented her with boundless opportunities to ask questions discreetly and without seeming anything more than normally sympathetic and of course she had her promise to emily to keep as well the chance to do something about the latter arose at luncheon when the ladys maid was harassed beyond endurance by a multitude of tasks and charlotte offered to take up christinas tray to save the poor woman from at least one small chore oh you dont have to do that miss but the girls face brightened hopefully nonsense charlotte swooped in and took the tray from under her nose it will be no trouble and my luncheon is too hot to eat at the minute oh thank you miss dont let her ladyship catch you dont fear the bootboy said cheerfully shes at luncheon erself wont leave the table till the general as eaten is pudding ot gives im indigestion wicked it does if e eats it cold then is tempers something awful charlotte thanked him and hastened upstairs before anything could dissuade them and had to stop a tweeny on the landing to ask her where christinas bedroom was she knocked on christinas door and a moment later was inside it was not so very unlike what her own room at cater street had been a little larger a little more expensively furnished perhaps for a moment her girlhood came back to her it was a sweet memory but she was content that it was only a memory she had a happiness now quite different from anything she had dreamed of then but also it was deeper with dimensions she had not guessed she looked at christina sitting up in the bed her dark hair piled round her shoulders her pretty little face now wide with surprise what kind of happiness did she dream of and with whom a girls dreams could be so innocent and so ignorant who are you christina said a little petulantly charlotte ellison she only just remembered the ellison in time im helping general balantyne with some clerical work and as your ladys maid was trying to do three jobs at once i brought your luncheon for you i do hope you are feeling better she looked at her as she said it trying to disguise the careful assessment in her eyes as simple courtesy christina looked perfectly well to all outward appearances certainly she had a fine color her eyes were clear and there was no puffiness in her nose and cheeks such as one gets with a chill yes thank you christina replied coolly then recollected herself and her situation i feel better today but unfortunately it comes and goes i am sorry charlotte set the tray down gently i daresay it is the weather i daresay it was good of you to bring the tray up there is nothing more i need thank you you may leave charlotte felt her face tighten to be patronized had always woken her temper faster than anything else she had to make a considerable effort to control herself thank you she said stiffly i do hope you will be recovered soon it is wretched to be in bed one misses so much it is quite distressing in society how quickly one gets left behind and with the satisfaction of her parting shot she sailed out closing the door with a final click downstairs she cooled realizing emily would have charmed dissimulated controlled herself and kept a friend instead charlotte had now assuredly made an enemy but then she was perfectly sure she could never like christina so perhaps she had merely accomplished at once what she would inevitably have achieved in time in the midafternoon it was totally different she was asked as a favor because the parlormaid was a little faint if she would run an errand next door to the southerons she accepted with alacrity another excellent opportunity and no sooner was she in the southerons kitchen than she met jemima waggoner the governess she took an immediate liking to her sensing in her a frankness like her own and even perhaps feelings that propriety and her dependent situation forbade her expressing she imagined such things in the wide gray eyes and a touch of humor in the mouth would you care for tea miss ellison jemima offered it is about that time and we were preparing to have ours you would be most welcome thank you indeed it would be refreshing charlotte accepted instantly the general would have to wait no doubt he would also stop for tea if he offered her more on her return she would have to accept it even if she were virtually awash but it was unlikely he seldom thought of such things he was singleminded and too absorbed in the dust of battle to think of cups of tea a few moments later she found herself alone in the governesss room with jemima sipping tea and eating sandwiches are you really helping general balantyne with his war histories jemima asked i can never be sure if gossip is true or not no one can charlotte agreed quickly unless one had begun it oneself and even then one cannot recognize it after a week but this is perfectly true do you enjoy it jemima asked as if she expected an affirmative answer oh yes i do it is most interesting especially the old letters the letters from the soldiers are so different we can hardly imagine but the letters from wives and sweetheartshow little we have changed all the same concerns loves illnesses children a little scandal she was stretching the truth a little but she wanted to get back to callander square and she felt that jemima was not one to gossip easily i suppose scandal doesnt change jemima said thoughtfully looking down at the tea swirling gently in her cup where she had stirred it it is always speculation about someone elses follies or misdemeanors charlotte opened her mouth to press the point to say something about callander square and found she did not wish to jemima had framed her own thoughts it was all other peoples sins and misfortunes perpetuated exaggerated and relished she said as much and saw the quick sympathy in the other girls eyes and felt a warmth toward her she found herself smiling back how many children do you teach she asked instead most of the time just the three girls here but three times a week victoria and mary campbell come over do you know the campbells they live over on the other corner of the square she pulled a little face with wry humor i dont care for mr campbell very much hes very witty sometimes but there always seems to be a sort of hopelessness underneath it as if he is only pretending to be amused and he knows the whole thing is futile in the end i find it depressing and a little frightening she looked at charlotte to see if she understood cynicism frightens me too charlotte agreed one can fight against so many things but one cannot argue people into hope what about mrs campbell is she like that also oh no she is quite different quiet and competent actually she is about the best mother i have worked for she neither spoils the children nor is she indifferent or overly strict i think she is a very strong woman this last opinion was given with some thought they spoke for a few more minutes about other people in the square a little about the balantynes and charlottes work charlotte discovered that jemima had met young brandon balantyne on two or three occasions and from the very delicate color in her fair skin gathered that she found him attractive although of course she would not say so it was not for governesses to have opinions about the sons of generals and the grandsons of dukes they had finished their tea when the door burst open and quite the handsomest parlormaid charlotte had seen came in her face bright with anger her uniform disarrayed one day im going to slap him good and proper so help me i am she said furiously i shall forget myself i swear then she realized charlotte was not of the household oh im sorry miss i didnt see you there beg your pardon thats quite all right charlotte said easily she forgot her promise to pitt has someone been taking liberties liberties i should say mary ann jemima broke the slight awkwardness this is miss ellison who is helping general balantyne next door with his papers mary ann inclined her head politely as an employee charlotte did not rate a curtsey i suppose youve had your tea she said with a glance at the pot i expect theyll have some in the kitchen she went out again twitching her skirt behind her still not satisfied with its replacement perhaps it would be a good idea if she did slap him nice and hard charlotte said when the door was closed again one cannot make ones position too clear slap him jemima laughed turning down the corners of her mouth with a little gesture mr southeron is very goodnatured but he would not take kindly to a parlormaid who slapped his face mr southeron charlotte tried to hide her surprise and triumph now she had really pertinent news to tell emily and she had asked no questions at least only one and that had been accidental she could see that jemima regretted having spoken so freely i should not have said that she was a little abashed i only surmise from what i have overheard i should not leap to conclusions perhaps mary ann is exaggerating she is certainly angry about something charlotte said carefully but perhaps we should not speculate too far as to what it might be i trust you have never been she left it hanging delicately to her surprise jemima suppressed a laugh well once or twice ive thought he was about to but i moved out of the way he did look a bit annoyed but once you allow any familiarity you cannot go back you have abandoned your position so to speak she lifted her eyebrows slightly to question charlotte if she understood what she meant oh yes charlotte agreed and although she was only guessing she felt a sharp sympathy with this girl who was obliged to work and to live in other peoples houses and dare not risk offending them she remained a little longer and then excused herself and returned to general balantyne who surprised her by pacing the library floor waiting for her at first she thought he was going to berate her for her absence but his temper evaporated and he seemed content to resume work with no more than a short complaint pitt was late home that evening and charlotte had no chance to tell him what she had learned and the following morning he was out early she arrived at callander square ready for her duties again an opportunity presented itself for an errand elsewhere in the square and she seized it eagerly thus at quarter to two she found herself standing in the dorans crowded withdrawing room with a bunch of dry winter flowers in her hand facing miss georgiana georgiana was swathed in smokegray chiffon and artificial flowers she lay on the chaise longue with one arm resting on the back she was so bony and pale that but for the brilliant eyes she would have reminded charlotte of an artistic corpse laid out in shroud and flowers the lady of shallott perhaps twenty years after the thought made her want to giggle and she maintained her composure only with the greatest effort she could feel the laughter boiling up inside her her sense of the ludicrous had always been unreliable georgiana looked at her narrowly who did you say you were charlotte ellison mrs duff lady augusta wished me to bring you these i believe they are said to be excellent for the house a very delicate perfume she proffered them to the clawlike little hand winking with jewels nonsense georgiana put them to her nose they smell like dust still it was civil of augusta to send them no doubt she thinks they will suit laetitia and i daresay she is right charlotte could not help glancing at the velvet and plush roses that decorated the couch the cushions and georgiana herself georgianas diamondsharp little eyes caught her quite different she said simply i love beauty i am very sensitive i suffer you know and it helps to have flowers im sure it must charlotte could think of nothing sensible to say to such a remark she stood awkwardly in the center of the room unsure whether to remain or to excuse herself georgiana was regarding her with curiosity you dont look like a maid what did you say you were i am helping general balantyne with his war memoirs disgusting what does a young woman like you want with war memoirs money i suppose i find them very interesting charlotte did not feel obliged to prevaricate or hide her feelings i think it becomes us all to know the history of our country and the nature of the sacrifices that have been made georgianas eyes narrowed what a quaint creature you are please either take your leave or sit down you are tall and peering up at you makes my neck ache i am very delicate charlotte was tempted to stay but she was aware that the general would be waiting for her and of her duty to him both as a matter of honor and because she might lose her position and its opportunities if she were to stretch his patience too far thank you mrs duff she said demurely but i must return it has been most pleasant to meet you come again you are quite entertaining georgiana lay back the better to survey her frankly i dont know what the worlds coming to give augusta my thanks dont tell her i do not care for the flowers or that they smell like unlivedin houses of course not and charlotte left her still gazing at the door back in the library balantyne was waiting for her georgiana hold you in conversation he said looking at her with a smile the first she could remember on his face poor old creature it cant be easy living there with laetitia i sometimes think helenas leaving turned her mind a little helena charlotte could not place the name although she thought emily had mentioned it laetitias daughter balantyne explained wretched girl eloped with someone about two years ago never found out who poor laetitia was quite deranged by it never mentioned helenas name since pretends she had no children husbands been dead for years and she had no one else so georgiana came to live with her how very sad charlotte saw the waste and her imagination tried to visualize the loneliness helenas loveor temptationall the regret since she wondered if the marriage was happy has she never written to her mother since not so far as i know of course laetitia admired ross as well which made it all the harder who is ross alan ross he was in love with helena we all thought it was only a matter of time before they married shows what nonsense we talk he sat down behind the desk again and she found his eyes on her faintly disturbing he has never got over it he added she could think of no expression that was not unbearably trite we so seldom really know what another person feels she said picking up the papers again there are your uncles diaries do you wish me to number the pages that refer specifically to military matters what she repeated her question holding up the books for him to see oh yes yes please you are most helpful he hesitated miss ellison she smiled quickly and looked away im glad i assure you i find it very interesting and immediately she opened the book in her hand and bent her head to read as soon as it was five oclock she closed it and bade him good night and had max call her a hansom cab she gave the driver emilys address and went clattering through the darkness news bursting on her lips six it was by now rapidly approaching christmas there were but two weeks to go and augusta decided that the matter of christina and max must be resolved she could not expect the child to spend the holiday season in bed but before she got up max must be out of the house she had been in touch with her relations in stirlingshire and a position was arranged for him nothing now remained but for him to accept the inevitable and take his leave with a good grace augusta had already made the most discreet inquiries regarding his replacement it would be difficult to find a man as competent or even as goodlooking as satisfactory a pair for percy the other footman and footmen came in pairs but that was of secondary consideration with a view to informing him of the imminence of his departure she sent for max to wait on her in the morning room she had not yet told the general anything about it but there would be time enough for that when it was all over and since he had been agitating her to get rid of max for months now he would no doubt be perfectly satisfied max came in and closed the door silently behind him yes my lady good morning max good morning my lady i have concluded my arrangements for your new position in stirlingshire you are to go to lord and lady forteslain she is a cousin of mine and you will find the situation adequate although it may not extend your abilities as london does however that is a misfortune you will have to make the best of i have been giving the matter some consideration my lady there was a small complacent smile on his mouth augusta wondered how christina could ever have found him attractive how she could have wanted to be kissed to be touched by him the thought was repellent indeed she said coldly yes my lady i dont think i should care for stirlingshire or indeed for any other part of scotland she raised her eyebrows slightly that is unfortunate but i am not concerned with your likes and dislikes you will have to learn to make the best of it i think not my lady i should prefer to remain in london in fact callander square suits me very well i dare say but that is not possible i thought i had already made that clear to you you did state your position maam but as i said i have been giving the matter some thought and an alternative has occurred to me which i greatly prefer it will not be acceptable to me she tried to stare him out but his insolence was insurmountable i regret to be so discourteous my lady but that is of no concern to me as you pointed out so plainly last time you spoke there are some things which one is obliged to accept whether one wishes to or not there is nothing i am obliged to accept from you max i have told you what i shall do if you do not go to scotland and do it graciously that is an end to the matter if you charge me with theft my lady you will regret it his eyes did not waver she stiffened she could feel the skin tighten across the bones of her face are you threatening me max if you wish to see it that way yes my lady i am it is an idle threat there is nothing you can do i should be believed and you should not he faced her unflinchingly that depends upon what you value lady augusta certainly if i were to say that i had lain with your daughter the courts would no doubt believe you and not me if you were to swear that i was speaking only out of revenge it would be a lie he smiled very slightly a light of wry superior humor in his heavy face but i have no delusions that you would not take your oath on it even so she flushed feeling the heat in her face under the sting of his contempt because she was no better than he and she had permitted him to prove it but he went on i should not claim it was i who had lain with her i have a friend not a servant im afraid he is something of a rakea gambler who has seen better times but handsome in a vulgar way and with no lack of female friends most of them are whores of course but they find him attractive unfortunately his smile curled a little he has a disease his eyebrows rose to question if she took his precise meaning augusta shivered with revulsion i should say max continued that it was he who had seduced miss christina or to be more correct he would say so there would be no connection with my misfortune and it would be uncommon hard for you to disprove and hardly worth it i think the damage would have been done mens clubs and so forth spread the word all very discreet nothing open nothing for you to deny and if you charge me with theft i swear it will happen she was frightened really frightened there was a power in the man and a certainty of his own victory she struggled for something to say above all she would not give in and why should anyone believe that this disgusting friend of yours had ever even seen christina she said slowly or that she would speak to him let alone touch him because he will be able to describe this house in detail her bedroom even to the decorations on her bed which you know she said quickly he could have got it from some housemaid easily enough there is nothing to that she felt a quick resurgence of hope his eyes were slow moist raking her over she has a mole under her left breast he said distinctly and a scar on her buttock also the left as i remember you will say i also knew that but i doubt the housemaid does do you take my point my lady it took her the greatest effort of will she could remember not to shout at him to let go of her temper her rage and frustration and scream get out out of my sight she took a deep breath and summoned a lifetime of discipline yes i take your point she said quietly her voice very nearly steady you may go he turned then hesitated at the door you will inform your relations in stirlingshire that i shall not be coming my lady i shall now go he bowed very slightly still smiling thank you my lady as soon as the door was closed she gave way for nearly five minutes she sat and let the shudders of disgust and anger pass through her to be bested by a servant a footman with morals of the gutter she would never forget his hot familiar eyes on her to think that christina had voluntarily lain with thiscreature that she could even now be with his child it was not to be endured she must pull herself together something must be done she could not now think how to get rid of max but she must at least make absolutely sure that he never touched christina again from this hour onward christinas behavior must be perfect max would not use his trump card unless forced unless he had nothing to lose by it because he had only the one play in ruining her he would ruin himself therefore he would not press christina if she treated him with total disinterest from now on and most certainly augusta intended to see that she did she stood up and composed herself there was no further purpose in christinas remaining in bed she was perfectly recovered she might as well get up and resume her normal life in fact better that she should before there was too much speculation as to what condition kept her out of society if by some disaster she should prove to be with child augusta would have to see that she was married as soon as possible and hope that the birth could be passed off as premature fortunately christina was as dark as max so if the child were equally dark there would be no comment in fact it might be as well if christina were to be married at the earliest convenience anyway she obviously had a weakness that required a solution and there was only one satisfying one her mind began to consider possibilities as she crossed the hall and climbed the stairs it would have to be someone who could be persuaded to marry at very short notice and without causing a lot of raised eyebrows therefore he would have to be someone she knew already so a courtship could be presumed to have taken place it was hardly feasible that someone of such devastating charm as to make a whirlwind romance believable would marry other than one of his own desire and for such a man to cross christinas path in the next few weeks and fall in love with her was expecting too much of fate she enumerated the young men of suitable position in her mind and came up with lamentably few and among those most owed the balantynes nothing nor sought anything from them that would be worth marrying for without the romantic inclination most men married of their wives or their mothersinlaws choosing but preferred to think that it was of their own in this case such a feat of selfdeception might be difficult fortunately christina was engaging enough pretty spirited and of an excellent taste in fashion and she had a sense of wit and of enjoyment which was peculiarly attractive to most men by the time she had reached christinas bedroom door she had whittled the choice down to three of whom the best seemed to be alan ross of course everyone knew he had never entirely recovered from his infatuation with helena doran but that also meant he had no attachment to anyone else and therefore might be agreeable to the arrangement he could be intractable if he were pressuredhe was a man of strong willbut if approached with charm if christina exerted herself to attract him delight him woo him he might well with a tiny added pressure from the general prove amenable it was certainly worth trying there were others who could be bought with military advancement which of course could be arranged but they would be far less likely to afford christina any happiness she knocked on the door and immediately went in she was startled to find christina up and in process of dressing she opened her mouth to be angry at the disobeying of her instructions then closed it again realizing she was but spiting her own plans im glad you are feeling better she said instead christina swung round surprise in her face she really was a pretty creature cloud of dark hair white skin tilted wide blue eyes pert nose and rounded chin and her manners were delightful when she chose yes it should not prove an impossible task mama i see you have decided to get up im glad i think it is time christinas surprise at the reaction showed for an instant in her face before she masked it yes that misswhateverhernameis that papa has employed made me realize how much i am missing and people will begin to talk if i do not appear soon there is no good giving them cause before it is necessary anyhow i may well not be with child i feel perfectly well now i have not felt in the least sick or faint for days there was a slight edge of challenge to her voice there is no reason why you should augusta agreed being with child is a perfectly natural process not a disease women have been doing it since eve i may not be with child christina said firmly no and on the other hand you may it is too early to be certain if i am christina raised her head a little higher deliberately i shall go and see freddie bolsover you will not dr meredith will be perfectly adequate to attend you when the time comes i do not intend to bear maxs child mama i have been giving the matter some thought while i have been lying here i shall see freddie i have heard he can arrange such things for the first time since she had been a young woman herself augusta was quite genuinely shocked both by her daughter and by the piece of knowledge that freddie bolsover either performed abortions himself or knew who did you will do nothing of the kind she said almost softly that is a sin which i will not forgive you can cease to consider it from this moment i have no wish for any grandchild of mine to carry the blood of that unspeakable footman but you have made your bed and we must all lie in it mama i will notyou dont seem to understand i do not love max i never loved him i had not imagined you did augusta said coldly i am equally sure he did not love you either that is beside the point you will not commit murder against your unborn child if indeed it exists you will marry someone who will care for you in a suitable manner and give your child a name i will not christinas face flamed if you think i am going to beg some respectable weakling to marry me just to give my child a father you are gravely mistaken mama it would be intolerable he would make me pay for it the rest of my life he would call me aa whoreand he would hardly love the child or give it a home with anyanything worth control yourself christina i have no intention that you should do anything of the sort you will marry a man suitable to your station and he will have no idea of your condition you will say the child if indeed there is one is premature under no circumstances whatsoever will you go to freddie bolsover or anyone else christinas face was twisted with contempt and disbelief and who have you in mind mama why should anyone marry me in time to be of any use and what happens if he doesnt believe in premature babies there are several possibilities alan ross suggests himself as the best and you will marry him straight after christmas he doesnt love me either you will see that he comes to you can be charming enough if you choose for your own sake my dear you had better choose to charm alan and if im not with child christinas chin rose sharply challengingly by the time you are sure you are not it will be a little late anyway i think it would be better for you to be married she took a breath and spoke very levelly christina perhaps you do not fully appreciate your position if you bear a child without a father for it you will find that you have no place in society and dont imagine that you can overcome it others have tried of better birth and greater fortune than you and all have failed no man of your own station will marry you you will become a butt of jokes decent women will not speak to you all the places you go now will be closed to you in future i dislike having to say this to you but you must understand that it is true christina stared at her therefore my dear augusta continued you will use your considerable charm upon alan ross so that he will be happy to marry you and you will appear to be in love with him he is a good man and will treat you with gentleness if you permit it and if he doesnt wish to marry me there was the first small shrillness of panic in christinas voice and augusta felt a stab of pity for her but there was no time for indulgence now i believe that he will but if he does not then i shall find someone else there are other possibilities you have an influential father i couldnt bear him to know about it even to guess your father augusta was surprised alan ross orwhoever of course not augusta said sharply i have no intention he should now pull yourself together and make yourself your most attractive we shall hold a series of parties and no doubt you will be invited elsewhere the sooner this is accomplished the better fortunately you have known alan for a long time so there will be no comment when you announce a wedding date how will you persuade alan of the emergency dont worry about it i shall find a way in the meantime of course you will entirely ignore max apart from such civility as is customary toward a servant if he should prevail upon you for more than that you will call for assistance and accuse him of familiarity and he will be dismissed i wish you would dismiss him anyway i find the very thought of him offensive now i dare say you do i find it hard to understand how you ever found it anything else but unfortunately it is not so easy to bury our mistakes max has taken steps to see that i do not and i have not yet thought of a way round them but i shall now consider your future and behave with your utmost charm you have exercised yourself to enchant men well enough in the past do not overdo it alan like most men will wish to believe he has done the choosing and the pursuing himself allow him to persist in that belief and wear pink as often as may be it becomes you and men like it yes mama good now compose yourself and let us direct out efforts to that end yes mama the following morning augusta was late over breakfast which was most unusual for her she had slept badly the whole business with max had distressed her more than she had realized at the time perhaps her mastery of herself was not as perfect as she believed she was still at the breakfast table at half past nine when brandy came back for another cup of tea he sat down opposite her looking at her closely you look a little bashed this morning mother in fact you look the way i feel after a night at the club dont be impertinent she said but without sharpness she was extremely fond of her son indeed she might say with honesty she liked him best of all her family there was a cheerfulness about him that was gentler then christina and warmer than his father also he was one of the few people who could make her laugh even when she did not wish to now he was squinting at her thoughtfully hope you havent caught christinas chill that is hardly likely she said with a shudder i dont suppose youd take a day in bed he reached for another piece of toast and started a second breakfast that would be too much like admitting frailty but it might show sense give it a thought mother he smiled if you like ill swear blind youve gone to the races or shopping where on earth should i go to the races at this time of the year all right ill say youve gone cockfighting then he grinned theyll be more likely to believe it if you left a note saying wed both gone she replied meeting his eyes with a smile in spite of herself he shivered nonsense ive no stomach for blood sports and do you think that i have certainly youd have scared the hell out of napoleon if hed met you on a social occasion she sniffed have you just poured yourself the last of the tea wouldnt dare really mother you do look a bit dragged out take a day off its a decent day a bit cold but quite dry ill take you for a drive well get out the best horses she was tempted there was nothing she would like better than a drive away from callander square with brandy she lingered on the idea savoring it come on he urged crisp air fast horses crunch of wheels on a new road last of the beech leaves are still red on the trees she looked at his smooth oliveskinned face and saw the child in him now as twenty years ago she had seen the man in him then before she could accept the door opened and max came in inspector pitt is here again my lady from the police will you see him the crisp air the flying hooves and the laughter collapsed i suppose i have no choice she pushed her chair back and stood up if not now it will only put him off until later put him in the morning room max ill see him in a few minutes brandy was still eating is it about the wretched babies still i dont know why they persist theyll never find out whose they were poor little beggars i suppose they have to try but it must be a rotten job do you want me to see him he probably only wants permission to question the servants again no thank you but i appreciate the offer my dear i would love to come driving with you but i cannot why not hes hardly likely to run off with the silver i cannot leave him she repeated mechanically she did not want to have to tell him how well do you know alan ross brandy what his hand with the toast in it dropped in surprise how well do you know alan ross the question is simple enough hes a good fellow i suppose i know him pretty well he closed up rather after helena took off but hes beginning to come out of it now why i wish him to marry christina he stopped all pretense of eating and put the toast down your father doesnt know about it yet she went on but i have excellent reasons if you could do anything to further that end i should be very pleased now i suppose i had better see this policeman again and she left him still staring after her pitt was waiting for her by the fire licking its first flames in a still cold grate she closed the door behind her and stood with her back to it he looked up smiling did nothing discompose this wretched man perhaps he had no sense of what was proper and thus neither of what was improper he was enormous and untidy too many layers of clothes on and he greeted her with an air of easiness she did not expect even from her friends good morning lady augusta he said cheerfully i would be obliged if i could ask you a few questions me she had intended to freeze him but she was overtaken by surprise i know nothing about it i assure you he moved away from the fire to make room for her and unreasonably the courtesy irritated her perhaps because she would have preferred to find fault with him im sure you are not aware of knowing anything he replied or you would have told me but there may be things you have noticed without at the time realizing their import i doubt it but still i suppose if you must thank you it is proving extremely difficult to trace the woman in the affair im hardly surprised no his mobile face fell into a wry expression nor i we might have better success approaching it from another directionto find the man the thought flashed through her mind that there might be an opportunity to get rid of max she looked up to find his brilliant gray eyes on her face disconcertingly she was conscious above all things of his intelligence it was an unpleasant feeling to her and quite new she could not dominate him you have thought of something there was a small smile on the corners of his lips no she denied immediately then she decided to qualify it in case an idea about max came to her later i dont believe so but you are a discerning woman for a moment she was afraid he was going to flatter her and you have a young and attractive daughter there was no intent to deceive in his face which in itself was unusual society was conducted on mutually agreed deceits you must have formed opinions as to the habits the inclinations of the men in your circle he continued those who would be suitable for your daughter to associate with and those who would not above all those whose morals were not acceptable to you it was a statement she could not reasonably contradict his conclusion was inescapable of course she agreed but i would hesitate to pass to the police as suspicions such personal dislikes or misgivings as i may entertain myself they may be groundless and i might thus unwittingly cause an injustice she raised her eyebrows slightly questioning him in turn giving him back the onus the smile on his mouth flickered upward she wished he would not look at her so frankly if christina had become enamored of this man she could have understood it a great deal more easily but then he would very likely have sent her packing she pulled herself together the thought was ridiculousand offensive i will take your advice as merely that my lady he said gently sound advice as to where i might begin you will agree that i have so far been extremely discreet i have no idea that you know anything about which to be indiscreet she said levelly with a touch of chill his smile broadened into a grin which makes my point perfectly on the contrary she was terse it begs it he retreated gracefully again annoying her i think you are right still the sooner i can finish my investigations the sooner the matter can either be resolved or buried as insoluble i take your line of reasoning mr pitt what is it that you wish to know from me before he could reply the door opened and brandy came in pitt had not seen him before and she saw a momentary flash of interest cross his face my son brandon balantyne she said briefly brandy seemed equally curious to judge from his expression surely you dont suspect mother he said flippantly or are you consulting her for gossip you think that would be a good idea oh excellent she affects to be above it but in truth she knows everything brandon this is not an occasion for levity she said tartly two children are dead and someone is responsible his humor vanished instantly he looked at pitt with an unspoken apology gossip is most useful pitt covered the moment and raised a hand to dismiss it you would be surprised how often the solution to a crime lies in some small thing that has been known to the neighborhood from the beginning they have merely not mentioned it to us because they believed it such common knowledge that we must also have known it brandy relaxed he made some small remark in reply and before pitt could return the conversation to his interrupted questions christina came in augusta was annoyed she knew it was only curiosity that brought her and the fear that something was happening that she was missing being in bed had made her feel that the whole of society was passing her by now she was dressed meticulously her eyes shining she even had color on her cheeks as if she were expecting a suitor she was smiling at pittpracticing her technique really had the girl no sense good morning inspectorpitt she hesitated affecting to be unsure of his name then came forward almost as though she were going to offer him her hand then she remembered he was a policeman on a social equal with tradesmen or artisans and let it fall it was petty a little arrogant without the smile it would merely have been rude good morning miss balantyne pitt bowed very slightly im happy to see you so obviously recovered you appear in most perfect health thank you perhaps you also can help me there must be men of your acquaintance whose reputation is less than upright i imagine you know very well whom you would trust and whom you could not young women discuss among themselves such things for mutual protection he turned without warning to brandy or you mr balantyne have any of your friends become involved with a girl not suitable to marry good heavens dozens i should think brandy was surprised into complete honesty but usually one has sense enough not to do it on ones own doorstep pitt was obliged to smile quite he agreed what about your servants that footman of yours looks a lusty fellow he swiveled till his probing eyes were on christina augusta could feel the blood drain from her own face at the same time the rich color heightened in christinas the stroke had come out of nowhere and she had had no defenses ready augusta opened her mouth to intercept and saw pitts quick glance at her wide waiting and she bit her tongue her very act of speech would betray her its eagerness where she should have been indifferent hes merely a footman christina said coldly but there was a small catch in her voice as if it stuck in her throat i have never considered his private life perhaps you do not understand if you have no resident servants of your own but people of our station do not discuss things with servants they are here to work to run the house that is all that one ever speaks to them about and even so usually through the butler that is what butlers are for you had better speak to the servants themselves those sorts of girls would be a little more in his line dont you think oh without doubt pitt was unaffected by her arrogance his face was perfectly smooth his tone warm but perhaps not to his taste i have no idea what his tastes might be christina snapped it is hardly a matter that interests me pitt grunted apparently turning the consideration over in his mind he was still looking at her and she avoided his eyes how long has he been in callander square he asked about six years it was brandy who replied his face innocent augusta weighed the idea of sending him out finding some excuse to get rid of him but seeing pitts clever watchful face knew it would be a misjudgment a reinforcement of any suspicion he might be entertaining a good footman pitt inquired excellent brandy answered dont like the fellow but cant fault him believe me if i could id have thrown him out couldnt you throw him out anyway pitt assumed ignorance i suppose so brandy was still casual doesnt bother me enough really and he seems to satisfy everyone else no complaints from female staff no none at all maids willing or does he seek his pleasures elsewhere mr pitt augusta stepped in at last i do not permit fornication in my house willing or unwilling whatever appetites my footmen may have i assure you they exercise them elsewhere but pitt was watching christina merciful heaven surely he could not possibly know anything there was no waywas there if you think max may be responsible inspector she said with as much composure as she could manage and without looking at christina i would suggest that you look for the woman beyond this house perhaps if you resume your questioning in the other establishments in the square much easier to ask max brandy offered the poor girl will not be likely to admit anything certainly not now press max a bit make him squirm find out who his lady loves are augusta gasped but it was christina who broke no she gulped that would be foolish she said her tongue fumbling over the words and unfair you have no reason to suppose it has anything to do with max i wont have you upsetting our servants mother please it does seem unwarranted augusta chose her words very carefully have you any cause for your suspicions inspector because if not i must refuse you permission to harass my staff come back with proof and of course i shall give you every assistance christina took a deep breath and let it out the door opened and the general came in he stopped in surprise good morning sir pitt said courteously what are you doing here again balantyne asked found out something hes looking for the man brandy answered him thinks it could be max and he wants to speak to him good idea balantyne said decisively get it cleared up one way or the other he leaned over and before augusta could stop him he pulled the bell cord a moment later max came in he must have been standing in the hall pitts eyes met his surveyed the dark sensual face the immaculate clothes yes sir max inquired any romantic interests any woman balantyne spoke abruptly with all the tact of a heavy cavalry charge augusta winced maxs face altered only barely i beg your pardon sir arent i plain enough man have you any romantic attachments do you have any lady friends call them what you will i have no intention of marrying sir that is not what i asked damn it dont play the fool with me my most recent romantic attachment has just ended i fear max was smiling under the heavy lids and he looked almost imperceptibly at christina who was she with the greatest respect sir that can be of no interest to the police she is a woman of respectability of very good family his voice was rich with his own suppressed amusement augusta could only stand and let disaster come perhaps max himself would protect his own interest and thus protect christina it was her only hope pitt merely waited letting it play itself out in front of him watching good family the general said with incredulity yes sir who i would prefer to protect her sir there is no need for her name to be discussed in front of the police lady augusta knows if you wish to ask her he let it hang christina was whitefaced the painted color on her cheeks standing out like a clowns will that be all sir max inquired balantyne was staring at augusta augusta collected herself yes thank you max if we require anything we shall call again thank you my lady he bowed very very slightly and left closing the door silently behind him well balantyne demanded he is quite correct she replied quickly it can be of no possible interest to the police pitt spoke very courteously softly why did you not tell me that in the beginning my lady she felt the cold run through her i beg your pardon she played for time a few seconds to think of an answer why did you not tell me that when the subject was first raised lady augusta ii had temporarily forgotten it is not important who is this womanof good family lady augusta i do not feel free nor do i wish to disclose her name oh come on augusta balantyne said exasperatedly if shes not involved pitt isnt going to do anything to her youll be discreet wont you besides maxs idea of a good family and ours will be quite different things i prefer not to she could not lie and blame some totally innocent womanit would be immoral even if it were practicable pitt turned and looked at christina frozen where she stood miss balantyne he said slowly perhaps you would care to tell me she was speechless christina for the first time there was doubt in the generals voice never mind pitt said quietly i shall pursue my investigations elsewhere for a while and perhaps return here later yes by all means augusta agreed she could hear the tension slip out of her voice and try as she would she could not control her relief she understood what he meantthat he knew about christina and max and would seek other ways of discovering whether it was she who had borne the children but augusta was sure that it was not she would have known christina had neither the nerve nor the art to have concealed it from her and now that she had had time to consider it neither had she the opportunity she had not spent the appropriate times where such a thing could have been hidden she faced pitt confidently that would be by far the best thing to do pitt looked at her his curious penetrating eyes full of knowledge there was understanding between them she was not bluffing she was acknowledging the truth and he knew it excellent advice he bowed very slightly good morning lady augusta miss balantyne general mr balantyne when he was gone balantyne turned to augusta his face puckered what was all that about augusta what is the man playing at ive no idea she lied dont be ridiculous you and he understood each other even i could see that much what is going on what has it to do with max i require to know she considered for a moment she had forgotten the strength in him when he chose to interest himself she remembered how she had loved him twenty years ago he had been everything that was masculine clean powerful and a little mystical because it was unknown the years had brought familiarity knowledge that his strength was spasmodic that hers was deeper more resilient would rise to meet everything day by day the strength that endures wars not merely battles christina you may go she said quietly there is no need to worry about mr pitt at least for the time being address yourself to the problem in hand and prepare for the dinner engagement this evening brandy you may go also i should prefer to stay mother probably but you will go just the same mother brandon balantyne said sharply in silence christina and brandy left well balantyne asked augusta looked at him incredulously he still had no idea the girl in question was christina she said baldly she was having an affair with max i thought you might have perceived as much mr pitt certainly did he stared at her you must be mistaken dont be fatuous do you think i would make a mistake about such a thing her composure slipped at last she had either to lose her temper or weep dont look so alarmed i am taking care of it there was no need to tell him anything about the possible pregnancy i intend to see that she marries as soon as possible preferably alan ross does he wish to marry her not yet but he will be made to wish to that is up to us us of course us the girl cannot do it entirely by herself i shall tell you when it is time for you to approach him perhaps at christmas isnt that a little precipitate he looked at her narrowly yes but it may be advisable his face tightened i see and may i ask why max is still in the house surely she does not entertain ideas about marrying him of course not she has no interest in him beyondtheanyway it is all over i will get rid of him as soon as i think of a satisfactory method at the moment the most important thing is to maintain his silence that can best be done by suffering him to remain here at least for the present you mean until christina is married more or less augusta for the first time she looked at him no she said simply answering the question in his mind i certainly have made a grave error over max i did not judge her well not know her as i should have but she had nothing to do with the children in the garden i should have known that peculiarly she felt ashamed meeting his eyes like this it was her job to have known her daughter and to have seen that this did not happen balantyne said nothing im sorry she felt compelled to say it he put his hand on her arm and patted it then took it away as if he were not quite sure why he had done it what about the police he asked i think pitt and i understand each other she replied he is a very clever man he knows that i know it was not christina that will satisfy him at least for a considerable time although he may well believe that max might haveother she shook herself anyway mr pitt is not our problem for the immediate future we must consider christina and alan ross i dont know how you can beso he looked at her with incomprehension and something not entirely devoid of distaste surprisingly it hurt what would you have me do she said stiffly weep or faint what help would that be we must solve the problem now there will be time enough to indulge our feelings afterward when she is safely married and if ross does not wish to marry her he must be made to wish to or else we shall find someone else you can begin to think of others just in case dont you feel anything your daughter has lain with a footman in our own house what difference does it make where it happened of course i feel somethingbut i do not intend to buckle under it and let a mistake turn into a disaster now you had better go back to your papers that wretched miss whatshername will soon be here if you wish to be useful start to think who else would be suitable for christina if ross proves impossible i am going to make up my social diary for christina and before he could argue she went out there was much to be done charlotte had been shown straight into the library when she arrived and she went immediately to the letters she had been sorting the previous day she did not notice that it was a half hour before the general appeared good morning miss ellison good morning general balantyne she looked up as she spoke as courtesy required and noticed that he stood unusually stiffly as though conscious of himself and a new awkwardness she searched in her mind for some cause for it and could find nothing i apologize for having kept you waiting he said hastily i hope you were notanxious she smiled hoping to put him at ease not at all thank you i assumed you must have another call upon your attention and i continued with the letters police he sat down she felt a hypocrite knowing that it would have been pitt and balantyne had no knowledge that she was his wife she was here precisely to observe those things they would not willingly have told the police and yet she now dreaded it she liked balantyne and would have chosen to retain his regard i suppose they have to pursue it she said softly it cannot be ignored better if it could he said staring ahead of him lot of grief to everyone but of course you are quite correct the truth must be uncovered regardless of the consequences trouble isone discovers so much else still he straightened his shoulders we must work i would be obliged if you would put these in chronological order as well as you can im afraid they are not all dated perhaps your history he left it hanging not wishing to be derogatory about her knowledge oh there is an excellent book in that case about marlboroughs campaigns she replied i asked you if i might borrow it two days ago and you were kind enough to allow me to oh he looked taken aback and she realized that something had indeed upset him more deeply than she had at first understood oh he repeated foolishly i forgot of course you will know she smiled at him if you have other business to take care of i can quite well work on these by myself she offered you do not need to supervise me if it is inconvenient you are very considerate but i have nothing else that iat least not now thank you and with a faint color in his face he bent to his papers once or twice he spoke to her again but his remarks were inconsequential and she let them pass without question knowing his mind was preoccupied had he newly discovered something about christina that she feared she was with child or something deeper worse compassion forbade her from making any attempt to discover she would like to have said or done something to comfort him indeed her instinct was strong to touch him reduce some of the stiffness out of his body suffer him to relax he would be stronger for having given in to himself for a few moments but of course it would be totally improper it would produce not the comfort of one creature for another but embarrassment misunderstanding even fear there were years of icebound convention between them instead she affected not to have noticed anything unusual she could afford him at least privacy which was second best but gentler than nothing and no doubt what he believed he wished for it was not long before midday when max came in to say that garson campbell was in the morning room and wished to see general balantyne and could he show him in what max repeated the request looking at him charlotte found him one of the most offensive men she had seen there was a curve to his mouth a wetness that she found repellent as if he were forever licking his lips although in truth she had never seen him do so oh yes balantyne acquiesced send him in i wont come out or hell think ive all day to waste garson campbell came in a moment later it was the first time charlotte had seen him and she kept perfectly still in the corner the book on marlborough held up to her face hoping that they might not notice her she peered over the top of it cautiously to look campbell had a clever face long nose hard humorous mouth and quick eyes he stamped his feet slightly perhaps from the cold morning balantyne he appeared not to have seen charlotte and she remained motionless trusting that the general would have forgotten her also morning campbell still resurrecting past victories well i suppose theyre better than present apathy so long as we dont think theyll do as a substitute we can hardly learn from history if we choose not to remember it balantyne replied a little defensively my dear balantyne campbell sat down the day mankind learns to profit from the lessons of history i shall look for the second coming still its a harmless exercise and i dare say they make good reading a lot less dangerous than politics i wish a few of your military colleagues would occupy themselves as innocuously why do men presume that because they purchased a commission in the army and were fortunate enough not to get killed that they can also purchase a seat at westminster and survive the infinitely subtler wars of politics i have no idea balantyne said tersely i am hardly the person to whom you should address such a question for heavens sake it was an observation in passing i dont expect you to have an answer i dont expect answers from anyone the most i ever hope for is that here and there one may find someone who at least acknowledges the question have you had the damned police here again balantyne stiffened yes why its about time they gave up the whole things only an academic exercise anyway matter of public image they should have satisfied that by now theyll not find out who did it and if theyve any sense they can never have supposed they might they have to try its a very serious crime some wretched girl had a stillborn child or killed it straight after for gods sake balantyne people are dying all over the place have you any idea how many paupers children die in london every year these probably never knew anything about it and what sort of a life would they have had dont talk a lot of sentimental nonsense what on earth were you like on the battlefield terrified to order the charge in case someone got hurt you can hardly compare fighting a war to defend your ideals or your country with murdering babies balantynes temper was very close to the surface charlotte could see the light shine across the tight skin on his cheekbones it was a stronger face than campbells leaner cleaner of bone but there was a softer line to the closing of the lips a vulnerability she would like to have faced campbell herself driven back his clever cynicism with her own inner steel she was not afraid of him because she knew in her heart that to be without optimism that core of reasonless hope in the spirit rather than the brain was a fatal flaw the seed of death campbell sighed with obvious patience it cant be undone balantyne for heavens sake let us salvage what is left ive already put in a few words here and there to get the police to withdraw call it a good effort and finish you have friends and so has carlton see what you can do im sure carlton will poor devil has already uncovered a basket of snakes in his own house although if hes surprised hes the only one fullblooded young woman like euphemia marries a stuffy old bird like that dont know what else he expected still pity it has to become public wasnt necessary if the police had minded their damned business balantynes face was white it does not have to become public unless you choose to make it so which i imagine as a gentleman you will not he was half standing in his chair as if he would offer some physical threat campbell was more amused then frightened of course not weve all got our skeletons i never met a man yet who had not something he ought to be ashamed of and certainly a hell of a lot he wanted kept secret do sit down balantyne you look ridiculous just thought id mention it for the first time he glanced at charlotte and she dropped her eyes immediately but not before she had seen the humor in him and the appreciation what did he imagine she was here for she found the blood coming to her face as the obvious thought occurred to her she hoped the general was too innocent and too stiff to have thought of it also however when campbell was gone he turned to her his own face flushed charlotteiiapologize for campbell i can only presume he did not at first realize you were here ii assure you she forgot her own embarrassment in his of course not she smiled in truth i had not thought of it and knew it to be nothing more than a few unpleasant words pray do not think of it again he looked at her closely for a moment then relaxed gratefully thank you er thank you it was an additional week before augusta finally reached a satisfactory solution to the problem of how to get rid of max she had required help and had had to invent a satisfactory explanation for it before approaching her distant relations and offering to exchange favor for favor now it was arranged and it only remained to inform max it was one week before christmas she felt vastly better than she had in the appalling morning pitt had come christina had employed herself excellently and alan ross seemed almost resigned to his fate indeed she had seen him only this afternoon escorting christina out for a drive in his carriage she had been out in the street herself when they had left brandy had been on the pavement talking to that pretty little governess of the southerons attractive creature a little thin but with a peculiar grace and such a charming smile just the person to have charge of children she was alone in the house brandy had left for his club the general also and that young ellison woman had gone home early she rang for max he came after a few minutes yes my lady he was smug as always i have made arrangements for you to take another post max my lady he stared woodenly at her in london she continued with lord veitch i have given you an excellent reference you will be footman and valet when he travels abroad which he does frequently he is in london for the season and goes to the country for the summer and for the shooting of course he very often journeys to paris and vienna you will travel with him and he will increase your salary above that which we pay you an advance you will agree indeed my lady he bowed with a slow smile i am most grateful when do i leave immediately tomorrow morning lord veitch goes to the country for christmas and to paris for the new year thank you my lady he bowed again still smiling and withdrew she told balantyne of it that evening sitting at her dressing table her hair loose over her shoulders her maid had brushed it and been excused balantyne in dressing gown stared at her you let the bounder go to a better position and what about bertie veitch what has he done to deserve that he owes me a favor she replied augusta i warned him she said impatiently and i will pay the difference in his salary for how long and i object to rewarding thatswinefor his vile he will not profit for long brandon bertie will take him out of the country to paris and then vienna in vienna he will find some occasion against him and dismiss him for dishonesty i dare say max will not find a viennese prison to his liking balantyne stared at her his face white how could you augusta that is dishonest it is no more than he deserves she said a chill inside her as she met his eyes then looked away what would you have had me do permit him to remain here blackmailing us in this house with christina and alan ross of course not but not this what then had you thought of something he stood silent tall straight his body frozen simply staring at her she stood up and walked over to her bed her hair falling round her shoulders feeling appallingly vulnerable like a new bride in a room with a stranger seven christmas passed with all the trappings of tradition the decorations the dances the rich food and the heavy wine the flirtations the presents the bells and songs and even on occasion the prayers for that week charlotte did not go to callander square but devoted herself to her own home last year she had been too new to marriage to feel the warm easy comfort of complete friendship of belonging without anxiety or the urgency to please now she hung the parlor with lanterns and colored chains purchased a small tree and decorated it then busied herself making toffee and fudge marzipan and mints to give to carol singers and wrapping small gifts for her family on january second the matter of callander square obtruded into her life again and when pitt departed in the morning to the police station she finished a rather indifferent effort at housework and took herself back to the balantynes residence to address her attention to learning more about the rest of the square beginning with the southerons after all if reggie southeron really did pester his parlormaids perhaps not all of them had been as unwilling as mary ann professed to be indeed it was by no means certain that mary ann herself was paying more than lip service to her indignation a protest as a matter of form for her dignitys sake it would be a good idea to ascertain how long mary ann had been in callander square and something about her predecessor to this end charlotte pursued her very natural liking for jemima waggoner and accepted an invitation for luncheon the day after accordingly at noon she excused herself from the general in the library and scurried through the rain to the area entranceway of the southerons she was let in by the scullery maid with giggles and guided upstairs to the schoolroom where today jemima was eating alone since faith patience and chastity were dining at the campbells in honor of victoria campbells birthday jemima jumped up immediately her face lighting with a broad smile oh charlotte do come in im so pleased you were able to accept general balantyne did not mind no of course not as long as i am back by about two after all he will have to have luncheon himself and to tell the truth we are nearly sorted through all the papers and i think he is not entirely sure what to do next he is rather an intimidating person isnt he it was more an expression of opinion than a question while she was speaking jemima laid a small table with cloth and cutlery and almost the moment she had finished one of the maids brought in the tray cook had prepared it was a surprisingly elaborate meal for luncheon and charlotte thought seeing it that it probably reflected reggie southerons love of food and comforts charlotte admired the menu and they fell to discussing food and the general household of the southerons then when the second course was completed and the pudding brought jemima returned to the subject of the general is it confidential she asked oh i dont think so charlotte replied in fact i believe the more people who know and are interested the better he would be pleased he is very proud of his family you know and i admit so should i be if my family had distinguished itself so there has been a balantyne in almost every great battle since the time of the duke of marlborough jemima similed looking into the distance her eyes soft it is a great heritage it must be quite difficult for a man born into such a family so much to live up to i wonder if young mr balantyne will fight in such battles and become a general also well there are hardly any wars now charlotte replied but her thoughts were not on military involvements but involvements of the heart the look on jemimas face concerned her it was not like her own an impersonal interest an excitement in the power the courage and the pain of all the human beings who had lived and died in wars she rather feared it had more to do with brandy balantyne to do with a smile a slender back and dark head jemima had not yet chosen her words for reply and seemed somewhat confused i rather hope not she said looking at the spoon in her hand it is very dreadful to think of the young men who go abroad to fight in battles that have so little to do with us and then are maimed or die i wonder how little they really are to do with us charlotte said thoughtfully we live in the manner we do with wealth and safety with sea trade all over the world with markets for our goods and exotic things to buy at home just because we have an empire that covers nearly every corner of the globe and many see it as our duty she went on looking now at jemimas face to spread civilization christianity and good government to the races who do not know of such things i suppose so jemima agreed reluctantly but it seems a terrible price to pay for it so many who do not come back think of all the wives and families there is not much that can be purchased without a heavy price charlotte said thinking back on the few things she knew of real valueof compassion gratitude understanding what we do not pay for in some way unfortunately we tend not to regard in its true worth she smiled to soften the words a little jemima frowned do you not think sometimes we value a thing merely because we have paid for it she asked and perhaps paid too much and so we cling to it and go on paying charlotte thought about it for a moment she had become bound to a thing committed to it for no better reason than all that she had already sacrificed for it perhaps some of her early infatuation for dominic held some element of such a habit of emotion but was jemima thinking about the price of possessions of waror about the fear that brandy balantyne might fight somewhere and be killed she recalled other small fragments of conversation they had had gentle frequent mention of the balantynes yes she agreed bringing herself back to the moment oh yes men tend to do that with wars and politics and perhaps women do so with marriages jemima relaxed with a little rueful sigh well for women where else is there to go one cannot give up a marriage however empty it may be there is nothing to do but work at it one has no means to leave even if one possessed money beforehand when one marries it becomes the property of ones husband if one leaves one goes without anything and no one in society will help because divorce is not acceptable my elder sisterstill that is an unhappy subject and i am sure you dont wish to hear of it tell me more about the work you are doing you told me that general balantyne actually saw the charge of the light brigade himself i pray there may never be such a dreadful useless waste of lives again how can the women ever forgive for all those deaths the losses and all so unnecessary a little common sense could have common sense is excessively rare charlotte interrupted i have often seen afterward things which i would permit no one to tell me at the time she wondered if she should say something about brandy balantyne it was his relationship with euphemia carlton that concerned her of course if he could have been her lover he must be a most unprincipled man and could bring jemima nothing but pain one needed only to have been in love once to have ached in secret and unfulfilled to see it clearly in others she felt the wound now for jemima no it was better to say nothing she would have curled with mortification to have had anyone else know how she had felt in the past now of course she loved pitt and it hardly mattered but for jemima it was the present and there was no pitt so she talked instead of other things of teaching history to children and heard tales of the schoolroom some that made her laugh presently she took her leave and returned to the library resolved to deal somehow with the matter herself she worried about it all evening till pitt asked her what absorbed her so and of course she was unable to answer since she felt it was an entirely feminine confidence and he would not understand she replied that it was a friend whose romance exercised her and he seemed satisfied not to press further and indeed it was true enough much of the night she lay awake wrestling with her conscience as to whether she should interfere in the matter or leave it for fear of causing embarrassment she finally arose still unsatisfied that she was correct but having reached a decision to approach brandy balantyne in a manner which would have annoyed pitt had he known and have horrified her parents only emily might approve and even she might well consider it socially unwise her opportunity came in the afternoon brandy came in from a bitterly cold and wet day to warm himself by the library fire knowing it to be the best in the house the general was out on an errand brandy came in cheerfully rubbing his hands and shivering he really was a most charming person she would prefer to have liked him she had to keep reminding herself that he was careless of feelings indifferent to hurt or she would have warmed to him in spite of herself hello still working he smiled without a trace of condescension do you like that stuff honestly yes its extremely interesting for a moment she was beguiled and was on the verge of replying with enthusiasm about the glimpses of people coming through the letters the tendernesses the vulnerability the sudden harsh fears and griefs when she remembered that she had made up her mind to speak to him about jemima mr balantyne she said firmly he looked a little surprised yes she stood up i have a matter of some privacy to discuss with you do you mind if i close the door with me he did not yet seem embarrassed as she had feared he might and then easily refuse to listen she pushed the door and heard it catch she turned to face him she must hurry the general might return at any time it must not be left half done i have formed a considerable regard for miss waggoner she began trying to conceal her nervousness hearing her voice go dry because of my friendship for her i do not wish to see her hurt of course not he agreed what makes you think she is in danger of being hurt she always looks uncommonly well to me always charlotte said quickly well as often as i see her he frowned what is it you fear miss ellison there was no point in prevaricating and she was not good at it she wished emily were here to put it more delicately to be subtle she took a deep breath you do mr balantyne his face fell in astonishment it would be easy to believe he had no idea what she meant i do he said incredulously she breathed in and out slowly to collect herself i am aware of your relationship with lady carlton if i can prevent it i shall not let you do the same with miss waggoner and do not say you do not look on servants in such a way a man who would have an affair with his neighbors wife does not scruple about governesses she could not look at him and felt strangely empty for having said all that was inside her for gods sake donti meanplease there was such an urgency in his voice that she found herself lifting her eyes to meet his his concern looked almost genuine look he held up his hands helplessly and let them fall again as explanation eluded him you dont understand she struggled to remain cold she wished so much to relent and like him is there something more to understand than that you found her attractive and took advantage of her situation she said coolly yes theres everything to understand it is none of my business but i cannot understand it if i do not know and if you dont know i suppose you will believe the worst and spread it about there was a mounting hopelessness in his voice now and in his face of course i shall not spread it about she said crossly it was a horrible suggestion but i wish to make sure you do not hurt jemima why should i why jemima he fenced dont be naive because she finds you attractive and does not know that you are she could think of no word she wished to employ very well he turned away though i doubt you will believe me she waited looking at his dark head against the winter light of the window robert carlton is a nice old boy but pretty remote detached that is no excuse dont interrupt he said sharply above all things euphemia wants a child she is thirtysix she has not forever and if robert persists in treating her with courtesy and excessive consideration either because he is abashed by emotion or because he believes mistakenly that it is what she wishes then she will never have one she fears that he is uninterested in physical affection and would find her repellent if he knew she was so she dares not tell him we have always been friends i like her shes a generous woman with wit and kindness i saw she was getting more and more distressed about something she finally confided it to me ours was an arrangement of convenience only until she conceived a child now you can believe that or not as you choose but its the truth and whatever you think of me for euphemias sakeor for robert carltonsdont spread it around for the first time he turned and looked back at her his face perfectly serious please it was ridiculous and yet she did believe him without considering she acknowledged it i believe you butdo not speak or act without thought toward miss waggoner it can hurt very much to fall in love where you know it cannot be returned he looked at her closely his hazel eyes clouded with a sudden sensitivity to her oh not now she said quickly but in the past i have done he was my sisters husband i grew out of it i saw him differently but it hurt at the time he relaxed please dont speak of euphemia he asked again she thought of pitt the babies in the gardens i promise i shall not speak except in her interest she said solemnly he was not satisfied sensing evasion in her words what do you mean there was nothing for it but to be honest i was thinking of the police they know that euphemia is with child and that it is yours they may hold her under some suspicion for the children in the gardens also you know his face went so blank with horror it was impossible to imagine that he had thought of such an eventuality before to tell them the truth charlotte said softly might be greatly to euphemias advantage do you not think they wouldnt believe it his mouth was stiff still shocked they might howhow did they know ofof the childabout meany of it they are quite clever you know and they would be looking for such things i suppose so mother said she thought that fellow pitt was clever and shes usually right and there are not many people whose intelligence she regards well charlotte did not wish to tell him of her own relationship to pitt and she wondered if the warmth of pride that bubbled inside her now was as obvious to him as it felt to her that is all i meant she said carefully now i think it might be advisable for us to finish this discussion before the general returns do you not ohyes yes it would you wont no of course i wont i was concerned only for jemima his mouth curved upward in a slight smile you know i like jemima shes a little like you in some ways and in other ways you are a little like mother charlotte froze at the thought although doubtless he intended it as a compliment his smile broadened into a grin dont look so shocked mother has more courage than anyone else i know shed knock the stuffing out of all the old generals at fathers clubs and she was quite a beauty too only trouble was she could never flirt didnt know how had no art of deception charlotte blushed she had rather charged in and certainly she had displayed no finesse perhaps she was more like lady augusta than she would have cared to admit she looked up at brandy to say something to excuse herself make herself appear softer when the general came in his face widened in surprise when he saw brandy best fire in the house brandy said quickly you always bragged it was that does not mean i intended you to stand by it all afternoon distracting miss ellison from her work pity cant think of a pleasanter thing to do on a filthy winter afternoon do you see the gutters simply running over with water then go and change your boots i must get on with my work you would be better if you found yourself something to do cant write my memoirs yet i havent got anything to remember balantyne looked at him with slight suspicion as if he thought he might be being faintly twitted but brandys face was bland with innocence he went to the door good afternoon miss ellison thank you for permitting me to stand by your fire and he went out was he disturbing you balantyne asked a little sharply not at all charlotte replied he wasnt here long i believe i have sorted those marlborough letters would you care to look at them emily had been several times to callander square since her last visit to charlotte over the matter and had managed to form quite a friendship with christina therefore she was not surprised when christina confided in her at the end of the first week in january that she was shortly to be married to alan ross the confidence itself did not surprise emily she had spent their entire acquaintance diligently seeking precisely this but under any other circumstances the choice of bridegroom would have surprised her considerably alan ross and christina balantyne seemed to her judgment an unnatural partnering from what she had seen of ross he was a serious and rather tense man possibly even a man of deep feeling whereas christina was gay when she chose deliriously sophisticated and essentially shallow still he was of good family and adequate means and most important apparently willing to marry at short notice we are to be married at the end of the month christina said facing emily in the morning room where they sat by the fire my congratulations emily replied her mind considering the possibility that christina might know by now whether she was actually with child or not she was careful not to glance downward to a betraying waistline but she had admired her gown earlier to give herself an opportunity to look carefully then there was certainly no sign of it but it was early yet in fact charlotte was over four months and still looked quite normal of course charlotte was a bigger person than christina and all these things had to be taken into account thank you christina accepted without enthusiasm i should like you to be there if you are able of course it will be charming which church do you choose st clements it is all arranged i hope you have a good dressmaker it is so nerveracking to be let down at the last moment i can give you names if you are not already suited oh i am thank you miss harrison is most reliable im so glad emily sensed a certain restraint something beneath the surface that christina wished to say to someone and yet could not decide you will make a beautiful bride emily went on mr ross is most fortunate i hope so emily affected to be mildly surprised have you some doubt i think you will make him an excellent wife if you wish to christinas little face hardened im not sure that i do wish to im not sure that i wish to give up my freedom good gracious girl there is no need to give up your freedom or anything elseexcept money of coursebut even that can be managed properly with a little forethought christina looked up staring at her what do you mean i am marrying a man i am not in love with what greater sacrifice of freedom can there be than that it was time she was taught a little common sense my dear very few women marry men they are in love with emily said firmly and even those who do frequently find that it was a mistake the kind of man one falls in love with is usually entertaining witty and handsome but equally often he has no means to support one is highly unreliable and as like as not will in due course fall out of love with you and in again with someone else to marry one requires a man with good character common sense in business or else a private income of great proportions he must be moderately sober and not gamble to excess and be of gentle manners and acceptable appearance that sounds desperately dull christina said sourly i dont remember george ashworth being like that possibly not but then i worked a great deal harder than you were prepared to do i had not your advantages so i had to create my own but mr ross seems pleasantly spoken and courteous he has means so i hear and he is certainly well enough to look at that is all you can reasonably expect perhaps but it is not all that i want well providing you are discreet you can always fall in love afterward but in the meantime you would be well advised to make the best of this you are hardly the sort of person to be happy running off with some penniless romantic and the sooner you accept that the sooner you can begin to work on what you have and make no mistake my dear you will have to work on it work on it i dont know what you mean i have done the work we are to be married before the end of the month he could not possibly let me down now it would make his position impossible emily sighed she had not realized any girl could grow up so ignorant whatever had lady augusta been thinking of or perhaps the balantynes had enough money and social influence and christina sufficient looks that they had considered it unnecessary or it was even possible that lady augusta had given all this advice and christina was merely too arrogant to have believed it christina she said slowly if you wish to be happy you must realize that it depends upon your husband being happy and upon his being agreeable to your conducting your life in the manner that best pleases you you must teach him to want what you want and if possible even to think that it is his idea if he believes he has suggested a thing he will never refuse you even if he changes his mind you must learn to be courteous to him at all times or nearly all never to argue with him or disobey him in public and if you must do it in private then do it either with a smile or with tears dont waste your time trying to be reasonable men do not expect it and it disconcerts them always pay attention to your looks do not be extravagant beyond your means and see that your servants keep your home properly never let there be domestic upsets men do not like to have the order of things disturbed above all by quarrels in the household and if you have an admirer for heavens sake be discreet always whatever it costs you be discreet no love affair is worth sacrificing your marriage for and to be honest my dear i cannot see you loving anyone enough to lose your head over your heart for a little or your desires if you cannot contain yourself although you would be better if you could but never forget what scandal does to a woman your husband will tolerate all sorts of things if you treat him well but not scandal she looked at christinas pretty rather sulky face and one last thing she finished if he should show undue interest in another woman affect not to notice it whatever you do never make a scene men hate scenes jealousy is the most unbecoming of all behavior never lose your temper and be careful how often you weep it can become most boring and then when you need it it no longer works i am surprised your mother has not given you the same advice christina stared at her she has she has done for years i pay no attention ones mother is always giving one good advice emily waited staring back eyes unflinching it was a time for reality at last christinas eyes dropped i dont think i really want to be married she spoke quietly it sounds like very hard work do you have any choice emily was brutal christinas eyes narrowed and her face tightened what do you mean she demanded harshly emily assumed innocence that you must make up your mind she replied blandly and whatever you do you must do it well we can none of us afford to do anything else in society everyone knows what everyone else does it is talked about and never totally forgotten you will have to live with it all your life so think before you act that is all i mean christina took a deep breath and let it out slowly what a revoltingly practical creature you are i dont believe you have an ounce of romance in your soul perhaps not emily agreed but do not confuse romance with love i know how to love she stood up i fear your romance is largely an indulgence and indulgence is selfishness and has to be paid for i do not intend to pay if i do not have to but i shall remember what you say whether i follow it or not you may still attend the wedding if you wish thank you emily said dryly i should be delighted emily decided that with regard to the bodies in the square christina was no longer of interest for one thing she had not the nerve the decision to perform such an act lady augusta most certainly would have had but then she had also unless emily had wildly misjudged her enough sense never to have permitted such a thing to happen therefore it was time to turn her attention to the other houses charlotte had told her that euphemia carlton was highly unlikely although she would not say why but apparently she had satisfied pitt and although pitt was a peculiar creature emily had a great respect for him purely as a policeman of course socially he was impossible but if he was satisfied regarding euphemia then so was she so she must look further into the other households as opportunity could be made from what charlotte had learned reggie southeron seemed the most promising but it might also prove productive to cultivate sophie bolsover and to learn a little more about helena doran she had gone about the time of the death of the first child just over two years ago it was possible there was some connection was it not why had she never written who was the lover no one had even seen had he perhaps loved others alsowith different results the time that the first body had been in the ground some six months could it have been longer long enough to have been conceived before helena and her unknown lover disappeared could that even be why the child had been killeda legacy from a love affair that had ended in desertion and hate it was certainly a mystery very much worth the solving with this in mind she planned to visit charlotte two days afterward being obliged to attend to her household on the following morning a small matter of servants and be at home to callers in the afternoon one had certain social obligations to maintain however on the second morning she was free to pursue those things that were really of interest to her who on earth are you calling on at this hour george inquired still sitting at a late breakfast and flicking through the society pages of the newspaper he looked very elegant in his silk dressing coat she thought again how fortunate she was that she had been able to marry a man who could offer her all the social and financial advantages she wished and whom she could genuinely love of course he had many characteristics that when this fascinating business in callander square was over she would hope to work on but then if there were nothing to work on a marriage would quickly become intolerably boring for a woman at any rate charlotte she replied it doesnt matter what time i call on her youve become uncommonly fond of charlotte lately he said with a slight frown what are you doing emily doing she opened her eyes wide yes doing my dear you are far too pleased with yourself not to be doing something i want to know what it is she had already foreseen this occasion and had her answer prepared i am introducing charlotte to a few of my acquaintances in a range of society that she may enjoy she said easily which was true enough although not for the reason she implied charlotte had no interest in callander square except for the purpose of detection neither for that matter if she were honest had emily george squinted at her round the paper you surprise me i didnt think charlotte gave a fig for any part of society i would say dont push her into anything she does not wish just because you enjoy it only i doubt you would be able to as i remember charlotte she is very unlikely to do anything unless she wishes to herself he put the paper down but in the event she does wish to look at society why dont you ask her here well give a party and introduce her properly shes a handsome enough creature not traditional perhaps but very handsome dont be ridiculous emily said quickly it has nothing to do with her looks it is her tongue you cant take charlotte anywhere she says whatever comes to her mind ask her her opinion of anything and instead of judging what is appropriate to say she will tell you what she really thinks she would not mean to but she would ruin herself in a month not to mention us and of course pitt is not a gentleman he is far too intelligent for a start there is no reason why a gentleman should not be intelligent emily he said somewhat tartly oh of course not my dear she replied with a smile but he should have the good taste not to show it you know that it makes other people feel uncomfortable and it implies effort one should never appear to make an effort it is like enthusiasm have you noticed how ladies are never enthusiastic in public it makes one look so naive still i suppose there is nothing public to be enthusiastic about shall you be in for dinner we are engaged to dine with hetty appleby he said fixing her with a penetrating eye i presume you had forgotten that completely she admitted i must go now i have a lot to say to charlotte you could always ask her to dinner here anyway he called after her i rather like charlotte she may not be good for society but i think she might be rather good for me emily quite naturally found charlotte at home at that hour of the day and pleased at the excuse to leave her housework although her home she would be the first to admit had fallen into a rather haphazard state since her assistance to general balantyne began we can discount christina emily said immediately walking in and pulling off her gloves i have looked at her carefully and i dont believe she would have the nerve charlotte made an effort to conceal a smile and failed im so glad why you cannot possibly tell me you like her oh no i dont but i like the general and i think i like brandy too indeed emily was surprised why do you like brandy i told you about euphemia carlton i know you did where do you wish to look next i think reggie southeron he definitely pays considerable attention to his parlormaids i dont imagine it is a newly acquired habit certainly not but as well as that we should consider the mystery of helena doran why for goodness sake shes been gone for two years i know that emily said impatiently but what about her lover who was he was she the only one why not court her openly if he were a man of honor why does no one know who he was charlotte understood immediately you mean he may have courted others and the babies could have been theirs thomas said the times of death were only very approximate she wrinkled her nose a little it depends on the nature of the soil the wetness and so forth it seems horrible to think of human beings like that but i suppose we must all be buried some time we are only clay anyway after the soul has gone its foolish how much we love our bodies i can ask jemima a little about it emily knew her sister well enough to realize without effort that this last sentence referred back again to helena dorans disappearance what is she like this jemima she inquired very reliable charlotte viewed her as a witness rightly guessing that emily was not interested in her qualities of warmth or humor she wouldnt be the one i suppose emily looked at her a little sideways no charlotte said firmly at least i would say not if character is anything at all to judge by emily considered for a moment it isnt she decided still well concentrate on helena first there is a mystery there beyond question you ask jemima and for goodness sake be a bit more discreet than you usually are i shall speak to sophie bolsover again she is always only too willing to gossip a little i must think up what i know to tell her in return having stayed for a little further discussion and the quite real pleasure of visiting with her sister emily took herself home again and prepared to launch her new offensive first she would call upon sophie when she might reasonably find her alone then she would pursue the acquaintance of the last woman in the square whose establishment she believed a possible refuge for secrets mariah campbell she was very put out to discover sophie not at home and in a considerable pique left her card and gathered her wits to think of something to say to mariah campbell a fit excuse for calling unasked upon someone she had barely met any message could perfectly easily be left with servants therefore she must inquire after something what she was already at the door it would appear most odd to remain in a stationary carriage therefore she must alight and trust to her wits to think of something should mariah campbell be in and able to receive her she inquired of the parlormaid and was courteously received yes mrs campbell was in and yes mrs campbell would be happy to receive her she was shown into the small family parlor where mariah was sitting with her daughters apparently they had not yet resumed lessons after the celebration of christmas they both stood and curtseyed as emily was announced then retired obediently mariah campbell was a pleasantlooking woman not beautiful but with a distinction about her that was perhaps longer lasting than mere prettiness she was becomingly dressed but with no concession to the trimmings of fashion how very civil of you to call she said also rising to meet emily since emily was a lady of title and she was not she did not pretend any false warmth they were strangers and both knew it i hope i may offer you some refreshment tea perhaps i should be delighted emily accepted she could not possibly give her true reason for having calledcuriosity she must rapidly produce another i heard from lady anstruther she sincerely hoped there was no such person that you had stayed in scotland with the taits another invention my husband is quite set upon our going toowe have been invited you know i have heard that the house is quite impossible as cold as a tomb and with servants who can never be found when one wants them and dont speak english even then i was hoping you could tell me if that is true dear marjorie does tend to exaggerate to color a story to make it the more lively mariah looked totally foxed quite naturally she had even less idea what emily was talking about than emily herself im afraid i have no knowledge she admitted lady anstrutherdid you say must have confused me with someone else campbell is a scots name it is true but quite a common one and i have never been to scotland myself im so sorry i cannot be of any guidance to you oh never mind emily waved her hand to dismiss it before she got too bogged down and perhaps contradicted herself having forgotten what she had first said i dare say i can persuade george not to go at all he isnt really very fond of shooting anyway she had no idea whether it was even the season for shooting but then with luck mariah would not know either and of course emily continued with a sudden flash of inspiration i must be here for the wedding mariah blinked wedding christina balantyne and mr ross emily went on with enthusiasm i am so very happy that poor mr ross has entirely recovered from helena dorans leaving so suddenly it must have been a great shock for him poor creature i think it was a shock to everyone mariah answered at least a surprise i certainly had no idea did you not know at least that she had another admirer emily raised her eyebrows at the mystery to tell the truth i am too busy with my family to have been more than slightly acquainted with miss doran or indeed with most of the families in the square except for adelina southeron of course because of her children that seemed to close the subject but emily was not yet prepared to give up im sure if she puts her mind to it that christina will make him very content content mariahs voice showed her understanding and pity for such a lukewarm emotion but emily meant what she had said i think so i think that is all that another person can do for one i think happiness is something one must achieve for oneself do you not mariah looked at her carefully but before she could frame a reply the door opened and garson campbell came in emily had seen him only once before and did not care for him greatly apparently he had remembered her good afternoon lady ashworth he said he did not speak to mariah good afternoon mr campbell emily profoundly hoped mariah would not repeat to him the fiction she had invented to explain her visit i trust you are well well enough he answered how courteous of you to call we were about to have tea mariah said quietly do you care to join us i dont think so his mouth turned down slightly at the corners i doubt i would contribute to your gossip i prefer something a little more political than what emily said instantly before thinking that it might not be in her interest to irritate him i beg your pardon you prefer something more political than what mr campbell i take your point lady ashworth i have no idea what you were discussing i was presuming on past experience i never yet met a woman of good character who had any political sense only the whores seem to have that kind of acumen indeed emily raised her eyebrows as high as she could and invested her voice with a trace of humor ive never discussed politics with a whore but i do know mr balfour slightly i apologize lady ashworth he said with a dry smile were you discussing politics when i interrupted you not at all we were discussing mr ross and who might have been helena dorans mysterious admirer she watched his face men sometimes confided in each other it was conceivable he might know his skin darkened and tightened for a moment across his temples she felt a thrill of victory he knew something it is most courteous of you to offer tea she stood up but i fear i called uninvited and i would be most distressed to have put you to inconvenience it has been a great pleasure to have further made your acquaintance mrs campbell i hope we shall meet again now she wished to be out of this room away from garson campbell before he read too much of her intent he was a man with whom she did not wish to match wits mariah did not appear surprised i shall look forward to it she said reaching at the same time for the bell so generous of you to call im sorry i was unable to advise you regarding scotland oh pray dont concern yourself emily was already making for the door where she could hear the parlormaid in the hall i doubt we shall go anyway especially if this dismal weather continues it will continue lady ashworth campbell said from the center of the room it always does from january right through until march invariably i have never known it to do otherwise and the only difference you will find in scotland is that it will be worse then i shall definitely not go emily said almost backing into the maid thank you for your counsel she left him smiling a little contemptuously at her foolishness and made her escape into the street she climbed into the carriage with an air of relief even though it was cold and there was a loose spring somewhere from the feel of it at least she was spared the necessity of extricating herself from an increasingly impossible conversation what an unpleasant man if there was anything more oppressive than stupid people it was those who felt they knew everythingand disliked everything the next time she called upon sophie bolsover she found euphemia and adelina southeron there and consequently could say nothing of helena doran and hope to learn answers of value it was several tedious desperately impatient days before she felt it suitable to call again this time she was more fortunate although fortune was only partly responsible she had done a little reconnoitering beforehand and thus discovered sophie satisfactorily alone oh sophie what a pleasure to find you unengaged she breezed in immediately making no pretense i have such wonderful gossip to tell you i should have been so disappointed to have been constrained to speak of trivialities sophie brightened instantly nothing pleased her more than gossip except gossip from a lady of title come in she urged make yourself comfortable emily dear and do tell me is it about lady tidmarsh i have been simply dying to discover whether she really did stay with those fearful joneses i can hardly bear the suspense this was precisely what emily had hoped she would ask for she had taken great pains to provide the answer of course she said triumphantly but you must swear not to repeat it this added an irresistible spice sophie dissembled utterly her eyes shining with excitement she almost pulled emily physically onto the sofa by the fire curling up immediately like a little cat tell me she pleaded tell me everything emily obliged decorating it here and there with detail that might well be true enough and was certainly no more than harmless color when she had finished sophie was ecstatic it would furnish her with stories to drop hints about and retell to those she wished to impress one by one with further swearings to secrecy and of course to refuse to tell to those she wished to annoy with many hints as to how fascinating and exclusive was the information she could not possibly divulge and it would be only human to imply she knew yet more which she was bound to keep in the utmost silence she was beside herself with delight now was the perfect time to ask about helena doran sophie would tell her everything she knew or even guessed emily made no bones about her interest oh sophie breathed out happily of course then she frowned but it is all a little old now are you sure you care oh yes emily assured her i think it is fascinating who can he have been sophie screwed up her face in thought helena was very pretty you know almost a real beauty one might say such hair all the color of winter sunshine or so poor mr ross used to say he was quite dreadfully upset you know i do hope he will be happy with christina she is utterly different as different as could be to look at naturally but in her character as well what was helena like emily asked innocently oh sophie thought again quiet not terribly fashionable of course she did not need to be she was beautiful enough to get away with dressing plainly and she didnt need to be witty she played the piano very well and she used to sing also i sometimes wish i could sing can you not very well was she secretive quiet yes when i come to think of it she did not have a great many close friends she was fond of euphemia carlton what sort of men did she admire sophie contorted her face in an effort to remember men of substance not just material but men who had succeeded at something who were established in fact older men perhaps because she had had no father for years poor child she did admire general balantyne i recall such a handsome man dont you think such an air of authority about him and such dignity if i didnt love freddie i would quite care for him myself was that why she didnt marry mr ross because he was not yet of sufficient substance for her too young emily asked you know i had not thought of it but that could be the reason she admired confidence in a man although she did not care for poor reggie southeron at all but then he is so irresponsible he has not the kind ofwhat the romans used to call gravitas so freddie says so very masculine gravitas dont you agree really quite exciting so she would not have run off with a penniless romantic then or someone of unsuitable social class emily asked really the mystery was deepening this was fascinating and increasingly incomprehensible sophies eyes widened with her own surprise no no she wouldnt now that i come to think about it oh my dear do you suppose he was already married to someone else and they simply ran off oh how dreadful where do you suppose she met him emily pursued if they had met at parties and so forth people would know who he wasand nobody does oh it must have been somewhere secret sophie agreed even laetitia doesnt know who he was at least she says she doesnt and why should she lie unless of course he was somebody simply awful but i cannot see helena becoming enamored of someone awful she was far too proud and fastidious she was fastidious oh very no they must quite definitely have met somewhere secretly well it must have been close must it not emily thought aloud or else she would have had to take a carriage and then the driver at least would know and one should never trust coachmen unless one pays them oneself and even then they may always be better paid by someone else no it is good counsel never to trust servants especially men they tend to ally with other men where then sophie asked oh why of course i know at least i know precisely what i should do what what emilys composure vanished completely why the empty house of course that house on the opposite side of the square has been empty for years it belongs to an old lady who will neither sell it nor live in it i believe she prefers france or something equally odd it is quite dreadfully neglected now but it used to be most attractive and there is a summer house at the back quite the romantic spot to meet that has to be it dont you think i am most clever to have thought of it emily thought privately that she was quite foolish not to have thought of it immediately but naturally it would be unkind and impolitic to say so oh indeed she agreed enthusiastically and i am sure beyond doubt that you are right and one day i dare say we shall find out who he was perhaps if we go and look sophie suggested we may even find some small thing they may have left behind what do you think emily had already resolved to do just such a thing the moment the house was mentioned she did not wish to take sophie with her but there seemed no help for it what an excellent idea she agreed the first opportunity it is fine we will be thought most odd and attract unwelcome attention if we go in this rain tomorrow if it is dry i shall call for you and we will go together she fixed sophie with a frank eye to let her understand that if she crept in beforehand emily would confide no more gossip to her she saw from sophies expression that she grasped the message perfectly emily stood up my dear this has been the most exciting visit i have paid in months i shall look forward to our next meeting she moved to the door and sophie came with her forgetting to ring for the parlormaid in her anticipation of tomorrow emily turned at the door oh you wont mind if i bring my sister charlotte will you she is a most intelligent creature and may be of some assistance to us sophies face fell for a moment then at the mention of assistance brightened again no of course not she assured if she is your sister no doubt she is most charming emily would have quarreled with that charlotte was charming only when she meant it and she doubted sophie would bring out the best in her but that hardly mattered now she smiled devastatingly at sophie and took her leave her heart singing in triumph her prayers were answered and the following day was cold and dry she duly picked charlotte up from her house before charlotte had even finished her luncheon and proceeded at a great pace to callander square explaining her mission to charlotte on the way and the necessity for such precipitate speed she did not entirely trust sophie not to creep over on her own and thus discover whatever there might be to find before emily and charlotte got there she would not have gone in the morning because it was still rather wet and icebound but this afternoon she might well think to slip over without emily and trust to not being caught at it they arrived at callander square and alighted from the carriage bidding the coachman and footman remain where they were they announced themselves to sophie who was ready waiting with her outdoor boots on and a cloak in the footmans hands within five minutes they were at the garden entrance to the unoccupied house it took the weight of the three of them to push it open so long had it lain shut they hesitated on the step the garden inside was motionless and cold trees rimed in frost path stones overgrown with mosses and slimy there were dead leaves on the grass and rotting deep on the flower beds if there was anything alive it was asleep till spring a garden shouldnt be like this charlotte said quietly somebody must have laid it out carefully once and people walked and talked to each other here helena doran and somebody emily said practically lets go in feet soundless on the wet leaves they moved reluctantly inside charlotte pulling the door behind them to hide their presence they followed the path gingerly afraid of slipping on the greasy stones it skirted round the house and then disappeared into grass at the back the lawn was soggy and again covered with leaves halfway down there was a thatched wooden summer house roof collapsing obviously a multitude of birds had tweaked and stolen from it over the years there emily said triumphantly that is where lovers would meet and she hurried across the squelching grass toward it her skirts catching in the twigs and leaves charlotte caught up with her but sophie stepped more gingerly from stone to stone round the remnants of the path charlotte and emily rounded the corner of the summer house and peered inside it was very dilapidated thatch hanging low across the ceiling several of the seats rotted and fallen through oh dear emily said disappointedly i wonder if all this could have happened in only two years it wouldnt matter charlotte said from behind her dont forget this is january in the summer it would all look quite different the trees would have leaves on them there might be flowers and birds it would be more like a secret garden they wouldnt care if it were a little neglected a little more to the point charlotte stared round do you see anything that makes you think it might have been used she might have dropped a handkerchief or something or easily torn a little piece from a dress there are certainly enough rough pieces around they both began to look and sophie joined them after several minutes they satisfied themselves there was nothing to discover and charlotte and emily went out of the other door toward the back of the garden sophie remained behind not having searched thoroughly herself past the bushes charlotte stopped stark and emily bumped into her whats the matter with you she demanded crossly then stared over charlottes shoulder and felt all the warmth drain out of her body they were at the side of a small lawn under a great tree from one of the branches hung a garden swing and on it skeletal fingers still round the ropes were the ragwisped bones of what had once been a woman remnants of her dress hung from the seat of the swing bleached gray by seasons of rain and sun flies and small animals had eaten away her flesh and there was nothing left now but a little dried skin and pale yellow hair and the fingernails of her hands grotesquely the whalebone stays of her corsets were still whole though fallen across where her stomach would have been and on top of them released from the womb the tiny birdlike bones of an unborn child helena charlotte whispered poor helena eight reggie southeron arrived home from his afternoon of cardplaying to find adelina looking tearful and whitefaced it was annoying he himself was in excellent spirits having won a handsome sum of money shared some excellent brandy rich cigars and even richer jokes he had fully intended to keep the same roseate glow all evening and to discover adelina in such mind was distinctly dampening he tried to jolly her out of it after all women wept so easily it was probably nothing of significance dont you feel very well he said cheerfully never mind itll pass take half a glass of brandy pick you up no end ill join you to his surprise she agreed and a few minutes later they were in the withdrawing room curtains closed against the night sharing the warmth of a considerable fire suddenly adelina began weeping again dabbing a handkerchief to her eyes for goodness sake my dear he said a little sharply pull yourself together nothing is helped by sniffling she gave him a bleak look and wiped her eyes harder i can only presume that you do not know she said indignantly i do not he agreed and if it makes you as miserable as you look i do not wish to if some sort of calamity has befallen someone im sorry but since i cannot help i am happy to remain ignorant of the sordid details it is your duty to know she said accusingly he started to protest but she was not to be stemmed helena doran has been found is that cause for weeping she ran off if she now does not like her circumstance that is a pity but hardly our responsibility dead adelina let the word fall like a damnation she has been dead for two years sitting there on the swing seat in the garden of the empty house all by herself just as if she were alive she must have been murdered of course he did not wish to believe it it was horrible a rude and ugly disturbance of all that was safe and comfortable all that he liked why of course he demanded she could have died of a heart attack or a seizure or something she was with child you mean theyve done a post mortem he said in surprise and some disgust already she was barely more than a skeleton she began to weep again there were bones nellie told me who is nellie nobody came to mind the scullery maid cant you even remember your own servants names he was genuinely surprised why on earth should i i dont suppose ive ever seen her im sorry about helena but really my dear it is a most gruesome subject let us discuss something else im sure youll feel better for it he had a sudden inspiration and we dont want to upset the children they will know if you are distressed it is hardly something we would wish them to know about it was actually a ridiculous hope chastity at least would discover it in great detail in fact probably already knew but it sounded both sympathetic and wise to say so adelina looked at him dubiously but she did not argue reggie settled down to a pleasant evening by the fire a good dinner a little port and perhaps just a touch more brandy helena and her affairs were beyond help now so there was nothing to be gained for anyone by dwelling on thoroughly unpleasant subjects such as corpses in wet gardens and murders and the like however his peace was broken about nine oclock when the butler brought a new bottle of port and announced at the same time that dr bolsover had called to see him reggie sat up and opened his eyes oh well you might as well send him in he said reluctantly he was not really in the mood for conversation but freddie was an easy fellow well mannered fond of a little civilized conversation and a good port bring another glass will you i have done sir ill ask dr bolsover to join you mrs southeron is still upstairs oh good yes thank you thats all he reclined again no need to hitch himself up and be formal for freddie thank goodness freddie came in a moment later elegant in a winecolored smoking jacket that complemented his fair face evening freddie reggie said indolently help yourself to a glass of port filthy evening isnt it still fires good sit down freddie did as he was bidden and with a glass in his hand settled in the chair opposite he sipped slowly and rolled it round his mouth miserable business about poor helena doran isnt it he said looking across reggie was annoyed he did not want to discuss it miserable he agreed succinctly still all over now oh hardly freddie demurred with a smile shes dead reggie slid even deeper into the chair cant be more finished than that its the end of helena poor girl freddie agreed he held up his glass to look at the rich color against the light but only the beginning of a lot of other things such as what well how did she die for one thing freddies clear blue eyes fixed on reggie and who killed her the police are going to want to know that you know she might have died quite naturally reggie found the subject most disagreeable he wished freddie would leave it alone anyway not our business police all over the place will be our business freddie was still looking at him smiling faintly charming fellow freddie but less sensitivity than reggie would have expected rotten subject to bring up in a fellows house over a good port not mine reggie stretched his legs out fire really was excellent warmed him right through oh theyll be onto all of us asking questions again bound to dont know anything cant help not a clue who her lover was not interested in that kind of thing womens business gossip ask the women if hes any good at his job pitt if thats his name no doubt he will but hell ask us too freddie also sank a little into the deep leather nothing to tell him reggie finished the last of his port and poured some more the room seemed to glow warmer and redder nothing at all there was a moments silence suppose it wasnt you freddie said suddenly me reggie had dismissed the matter and was drifting pleasantly into other things pretty women jemima to be precise charming creature so feminine what are you talking about helenas lover of course freddie was still faintly smiling wasnt you was it old boy good god reggie jerked up a full six inches in the chair of course it wasnt just thought it might be you do have rather a taste for that sort of thing after all taste for it what in hell do you mean reggie was offended it was an illbred thing to remark taste for young women freddie did not appear in the least abashed mary ann and dolly and who knows who else mary ann is a parlormaid reggie said indignantly everyone has a fancy for parlormaids now and then if theyre honest and dolly was a long time ago i prefer not to discuss that i thought i told you as much oh im sure you do freddie agreed especially now what do you mean especially now reggie did not care for the turn the conversation was taking why now well apparently helena was pregnant too freddie was still looking directly at him and still smiling and then there are the babies in the gardens if they knew about mary ann and about poor dolly they might leap to the very nasty conclusion that they were all connected dont you think suddenly the heat of the fire scorched reggies legs and left the inside of him bitterly cold the thought was appalling terrifying his mouth was dry he stared at freddie trying to pretend he did not understand pretend to himself you do freddies smile was fixed on his face it seemed to hang in the air in front of reggie as if there were nothing else in the room you see what i mean freddie pressed the point yes reggie heard his own voice far away he cleared his throat and his voice returned louder than he intended but they wont i mean theres no reason why they should hear about any of that youre the only other person who knows about it about dolly i mean quite freddie reached for the port and poured himself more still meeting reggies eyes over the top so it all rather depends on me doesnt it well for gods sake you wont say anything will you oh no freddie sipped his port gently no i shouldnt think so for a moment he sipped again as long as i remember what ive said and dont contradict myself you wont hope not but rather important you know could do with a small reminder whatwhat do you mean freddie reminder freddie said easily something to keep my memory on the job something that was always there something big enough to be important reggie stared at him in cold fascination the glimmering of understanding was coming into his mind and it was ugly what did you have in mind freddie he asked slowly he would like to have hit him kicked him sitting so smugly there in front of the fire but he knew he could not afford to the police were too busy too watchful of anything different just now the time would come of course after all this business was finished and life went back to the way it had been before then he would be able to sort freddie out the fellow was a bounder but in the meantime what do you want freddie he asked again freddie was still smiling what a charming fellow he used to think he was that smile was so frank so quick to grace his features got this rotten bill outstanding at my tailors freddie seemed quite unabashed been there rather a long time give me a hand with it old boy as a favor feel that if i actually owned my clothes instead of that damned stitchin fellow id be enormously grateful you damn better be will i assure you think of you every time i dress how much oh hundred pounds should about do it a hundred pounds reggie was shattered he did not spend that much on clothes in a year and he would not have allowed adelina half of it damn it all he paid maids only twenty pounds a year how in gods name did you permit yourself like to dress well you know freddie stood up he was tall slim elegant indeed he did dress well far better than reggie then of course he had the figure for it but even so thanks old boy he said cheerfully shant forget it by god youd better not reggie could feel anger and panic rising in him if freddie did forget or went back on his word dont worry freddie said easily got an excellent memory when i choose doctor you know doctors never repeat what their patients tell them in confidence police cant make them perfectly safe he moved to the door gracefully ill take the hundred now tailor chap a bit impatient you know wont take any more orders till i cough up miserly wretch havent got it now reggie replied stiffly ill send the footman round to the bank in the morning give it to you by tomorrow yes dont forget reggie good memory could be vital im sure you understand reggie understood perfectly he would have a footman at the bank door the moment it opened damn freddie and the worst of it was he would have to go on being civil to the cad there was no way out of it if he cut him people would notice and he must at any cost keep freddies good will at least until the police gave up and left the square he sat down again after freddie had gone he was glad adelina had not come back into the room he wished to be alone he had had a very considerable shock and the more he thought about it the nastier it became who would have credited that freddie could behave in such a way if a chap was a bit short of ready money anyone could understand that but to resort towellit amounted to blackmail of course it would all blow over when the police either found out who the wretched girl was which was unlikely or gave up which on the face of it was probably what would happen then another very unpleasant thought came to him what did the police do if they could not solve a case did they give up or did they put it aside but always keep it at the back of their minds someone detailed to keep an ear to it the possibility was frightening what if they never gave up if they kept at it like an open wound probing it every time it threatened to close over that could be very nasty a permanently ugly rumor never either exposed and lived down nor yet laid to rest as false good god what could he do about freddie then the man if he were cad enough could keep coming back over and over again a hundred pounds here a social favor there or a spot of financial advice under the counter a gift of this or thatgod in heaven it could be never ending it was monstrous the best thing for reggie would be if this damned pitt fellow found out who it was and cleared up the whole wretched business then freddie could say what he liked it would certainly damage reggies reputation for a while and adelina would be pretty upset but then their relationship was not so very close anyway not a lot to lose compared with permanent leeching by freddie and the very fact that as a doctor and a friend he had broken such a confidence would do freddie himself a damn sight more damage who would trust the fellow after that no to tell the police under pressure was one thing there could be a good excuse for that but to spread it around merely as gossip that was unpardonable and freddie would be sure to know that no quite definitely if pitt found out who it was reggie would be safe he settled down deeper into the chair and stretched his legs out again this really was an excellent fire he rang for the footman gave him instructions about the bank and ordered more port he would not have thought the two of them could have got through a whole bottle but there it was empty so they must have still a wretched experience like this called for a little fortification natural enough thing was must see what he could do to help this police fellow to get the matter solved so everyone knew who was to blame and thus who was not and the police took themselves off back to the usual sort of crimes they were really employed to deal with he fell asleep still wondering what he could do to help pitt he woke late the following morning as was his habit rose was dressed by his valet and took a good breakfast of porridge bacon eggs deviled kidneys sausage mushrooms then several slices of toast butter and preserves then of course a fresh pot of tea he should have felt a great deal better after it but he did not in the gray pedestrian light of morning the more he thought about the likelihood of the police discovering the girl to blame the less likely he considered it to be that they would meet with any success the fellow pitt was probably bright enough he was certainly inquisitive but where could he find proof after all it was all months ago now even years could have been anybody some wretched girl even from the neighboring blocks did not have to be callander square at all now had the fools thought of that dont be an ass calm yourself reggie of course they have that is probably what they spent their time doing when they were not here and they were here quite a small part of the time considering they quite probably worked from breakfast till dinner five or six days a week yes of course they will have asked all over the place he began to feel better again and spent a pleasant enough morning going into the city wandered round the merchant bank of which he was a director had a long luncheon at his club and was home again by half past four when it became dark and began to drizzle the gas lamps in the square were partly obscured by drifting mist and the trees rattled in the rising wind a filthy night glad to have a good fire and a good table to go to he greeted the children civilly enough and of course adelina and was relaxing after dinner when there was a knock on the door come in he said with some surprise chastity came in looking very prim and clean what is it child he was a little annoyed he did not wish to talk uncle reggie miss waggoner says i must ask you if i wish to learn mathematics please may i no whatever would you require mathematics for i would like to learn for the sake of learning she replied sedately you have said to me that it is good to do so they would be of no use to you he said decisively neither is painting but you say i should learn it painting is an art that is quite different women should become proficient in some art or other give them something to do when they grow up otherwise how will you employ your time that was faultless logic she would have no answer for that he faced her with satisfaction i shall marry a policeman she said immediately and i shall be poor so i shall have to keep my own house it might be very useful to be able to do mathematics i could deduce things dont be ridiculous he snapped really the child was becoming impossible why ever should you marry a policeman because i like them i like mr pitt i should like to marry him only he is already married he was here again today he was talking to mary ann i dont think hell ever find out who killed those babies you know he says so himself it will just remain a mystery for ever and ever and ever we shall all wonder who it was and we shall think dreadful things about each other and no one will ever know when i grow to be very old about fifty i shall tell my grandchildren about it and i shall say the square is haunted by crying babies who were murdered in olden times thats now but it will be olden times by then and nobody ever knew who did it and we shall play games as to whom it might have been and stop it reggie said furiously he could not remember when he had last lost his temper but this was monstrous the child was talking nonsense absurd ridiculous and frightening nonsense she was raising visions of a neverending bondage a bloodsucking till he was empty a fear to stalk him the rest of his life stop it he shouted thats not true theyll find out who it was the police are very clever they are bound to discover and probably quite soon he could still feel his heart bumping but it was not quite so uncontrolled now chastity looked at him in surprise but without losing her beastly composure do you think so uncle reggie i dont i think it will be a terrible mystery for ever and ever and everyone will go around whispering about it can i learn mathematics please no but i want to well you cant why not she asked reasonably because i say so now go up to bed it must be your bedtime it isnt not for another hour yet do as you are told child go to bed he knew he was being completely arbitrary but then one was not required to explain to children or even to have an explanation one could do as one pleased it was good for children to learn to obey chastity retired as she was told but there was a look of disappointment in her eyes that was distinctly touched with contempt the impertinence of it stung him he sat staring at the opposite chair his thoughts going round with gathering momentum and increasing unpleasantness what if chastity were right and they never did find out who it was they would go on talking about itafter all why should they ever stop gossip was the lifeblood of womens social round what was not real or known must be invented it was appalling but it was true of course other subjects would arise other scandals no doubt but at the slightest reawakening of any suspicions this one with all its obscene speculation would be resurrected and freddie freddie would know that and thrive on it great god he could be paying him for the rest of his life being sucked of substance by a bloody leecha vampire this was terrible he found himself standing up without having been aware of rising he must do something that was beyond question but what his brain was like a cheese no sense in it he could not do it alone that much was sure he had no ideas who could help must not let adelina know she would blurt it out all over the place anyway she was one of the ones he must keep it from she would not understand about mary ann still less about dolly she would make life intolerable for him and he valued the comfort above all else the ease and graciousness of his home no ugliness or need for the labor of the outside world intruded into it and he intended to keep it that way at all costs and of course for purely practical purposes he must protect his position at the bank it was a very lucrative and pleasant situation he had influence but none of that was any use now and he could see it slipping away from him and leaving him naked to the chill of lifes harsh realitiesno succulent foods no great fires deep chairs summer afternoons with strawberries servants for everything parties whenever he wished naked like a great white animal without its fur or its shell ready to be shriveled by the first winter blast he must get help who was the most practical person he knew the most intelligent the answer was quick to come to mind without question garson campbell and there was no time to be lost anyway he could not possibly rest until he had done something about it his mind was in turmoil he rang for the footman to bring his coat it was an abysmal night and he loathed getting wet but the discomfort inside him was infinitely worse and growing more acute with each new thought that came to his mind he found campbell in and willing to see him although in view of the urgency with which he announced himself he would have been very surprised had he not well reggie whats the panic campbell said with a slightly caustic smile william seemed to think you were in something of a flap my god campbell ive discovered something appalling reggie collapsed into one of the other chairs and gazed up at campbell with thumping heart simply frightful campbell was unimpressed oh i suppose youll need a glass of port to help you recover it was an observation not a question reggie sat up in the seat im not joking campbell this is damned serious campbell swiveled round at the sideboard to face him perhaps struck by the timbre of his voice reggie could feel panic welling up inside him what if campbell would not help im being blackmailed he blurted out for money at least its only money at the moment god knows what it could grow into campbell my whole life could be ruined he could take everything like a vampire at my throat sucking out my life its obscene its frightful at last campbell was impressed his face altered and a hardness an attentiveness came into his eyes blackmailed he repeated his hand still holding the port decanter but absently forgetting what it was yes reggies voice was climbing higher and higher a hundred pounds campbell had control of himself again his mouth turned down at the corners thats a lot of money youre damned right it is campbell what am i going to do weve got to stop this sort of thing before it takes hold campbells eyebrows rose slightly why we reggie i agree blackmail is a nasty thing but why should i involve myself because its freddie you fool reggie lost his temper again he was badly frightened their whole manner of life was threatened and here was campbell standing with port in his hand and a sneer on his face as if it were merely some minor inconvenience freddie there was steel in campbells voice a quite different tone his face had stiffened even his body freddie bolsover yes damned freddie bolsover came to my house as cool as you please sat in my chair in the library and drank my port and asked me for a hundred pounds to keep quiet about my fondness for the parlormaid and you paid him campbells eyebrows rose and his eyes were full of cynical disbelief and something that looked like amusement although god knew what there was to be amused at of course i paid him reggie spat out furiously what do you think the police would make of it if they knew i had a fondness for parlormaids with those wretched bodies in the square they might even think i had something to do with helena doran and so help me god i never touched the girl little harmless fun with a few maids but never anything really wrong but cant expect those bounders to know that theyre only working class themselves campbell looked at him down his long nose yes youre in something of a spot arent you he finished pouring the port at last and handed reggie one although i shouldnt think anyone could connect you with helena he hesitated could they no then i dont know why youre so excited what can freddie say that he thinks you had a bit of a toss with your parlormaid thats hardly damning and how in hell would he know anyway does he listen to kitchen gossip you were a fool to pay reggie squirmed in his chair it was dolly and her death after the wretched abortion that he was frightened ofmary ann was neither here nor there as campbell had said he looked at campbell now standing in the middle of the room broadshouldered solidbellied a slight sneer on his face he was clever reggie knew that he had always known it it was one of those obvious things inescapable but dare he trust him he had to have help from someone freddie had to be stopped otherwise he would rob him of everything that made life of value feed off him like some disgusting animal take all his comfort and he could end up a frightened wreck drinking soda water and eating bread and mincemeat he would sooner be dead he did not know how to begin campbell was waiting staring at him his eyes still smiling its rather more than that reggie began they might think campbells mouth twisted at the corners i mean reggie tried again other maids they might damn the man why would he not understand they might think you had something to do with dollys death campbell finished for him reggie felt the ice run through him as if his valet had accidentally run him a cold bath campbell was looking at him with a cynical amusement yes that could be embarrassing he said thoughtfully freddie was the doctor called in wasnt he yes he could probably tell the police precisely what happened and i suppose he might well feel excused of his usual obligations of silence he coughed under the circumstances perhaps you were right to pay after all god damn it reggie heaved himself out of the chair onto his feet till he stood facing campbell thats no help what am i going to do campbell stuck out his lower lip keep control of yourself for a start i agree entirely old boy its bad very bad no idea freddie had it in him hes a complete outsider reggie said bitterly a bounder doubtless but that only means hes the nerve and the wit to do what many others would if they dared and had thought of it dont be such a hypocrite reggie this is hardly the time to become selfrighteous apart from being a trifle ridiculous its of no use use reggie was flabbergasted freddie was a total cad and here was campbell talking about it as if it were an everyday occurrence a problem of logistics rather than an outrage yes of course use campbell said a little tartly you do want to prevent it continuing indefinitely i take it i thought that was why you came yes of course it is but arent you shocked i meanfreddie its years since ive been shocked campbell answered holding his port glass up to the light and examining the color i am occasionally surprised usually pleasantly when i have expected the worst and it has not happened when my luck has held longer than i thought likely but most people who are honest are only so through lack of courage or lack of imagination man is basically a selfish animal watch children some time and youll see it very quickly were all much the same one hand out to grab what we can and one eye over our shoulders to see whos looking and make sure we dont have to pay for it freddies just rather better at it than i gave him credit for never mind the philosophy what in hell are we going to do about it reggie demanded we cant let him go on therell be nothing to go on to campbell pointed out when the police either find out who is responsible which i admit is unlikely or give up which i dare say they will in another few weeks that will be the end of it after all they cant waste time indefinitely on some servant girls mistakes its not as if anyone cared or as if discovering anything would make a haporth of difference to its happening over and over again into an infinite future precisely the same just keep your head ill have a word with freddie warn him of the several nasty things that could happen to his practice if he makes a habit of this for the first time reggie felt a spark of hope sane rational hope if campbell spoke to freddie he might realize he could not go on demanding money that he would make his own position impossible he would never be frightened of reggie but he might well take campbell more seriously thank you he said sincerely that will do it make all the difference hell see it will only work once yes excellent thank you again campbell pulled a face of incredulousness mixed with amusement but he said nothing reggie left with a firmness to his step he could see light ahead comfort again of course general balantyne also heard about the appalling discovery in the empty garden and he was deeply shocked by it he had not known helena well but she had been a lovely creature full of life gentle a woman with all her promise ahead of her to find her in suchthe thought of it was too dreadful to frame someone had abused and violated her and even presumably killed her no one knew a great deal yet and the police had not so far called it was to be supposed they would come today meanwhile he would work on his papers miss ellison although he thought of her as charlotte now had done all that she could for the time being and in truth he missed her the library seemed empty without her presence and he found it harder to resume his concentration as if he were awaiting something he had still not settled his mind to work when the police came it was the same fellow pitt he received him in the library good morning inspector there was no need to ask what he was here for good morning sir pitt came in gravely im afraid i cannot tell you anything of value balantyne said straight away i did not know miss doran other than to see her occasionally when she visited my wife and daughter i imagine you will wish to see them i would appreciate it if you could keep the most distressing facts to yourself my daughter is about to be married day after tomorrow to be precise dont want to spoil the he stopped it sounded callous offensively trite when another girl was lying alone a few ragcovered bones in some police mortuary obscenely eaten by small animals and maggots it made him faintly sick pitt seemed to read balantynes confused thoughts and feelings in his face of course he said without sympathy in his voice or so it seemed to balantyne and why should he have sympathy christina was alive and well on her way to marriage a life of security and comfort of social privilege and if he were honest she might well feel shock disgust at helenas death and the manner of it but he would be surprised if she thought of it long and more so if she wept any tears of pity im interested in helenas life pitt continued the cause of her death lies in that not what happened to her body afterward she was with child did you know balantyne felt an added twist of hurt for the double loss yes i heard unfortunately little remains unpassed from door to door in a square like this do you know who her lover was pitt asked baldly balantyne was repelled he winced at the vulgarity of the question helena had been a woman of quality ahe caught pitts eyes and realized he was trying to cling to a dream of unreality that was no longer viable but to think soof a woman damn pitt for his squalid truths do you pitt repeated although it was an unnecessary question balantynes sensitive revulsion had already answered it for him no of course i dont balantyne turned away it is natural that you should be distressed pitt said softly you had a high regard for her balantyne was not sure how to answer he hesitated awkwardly he had always found her fair beauty especially clean and gentle perhaps he had idealized it a little pitt was speaking again at his shoulder i believe she had a considerable admiration for you also balantyne jerked upward with surprise pitt smiled very slightly women confide in each other you know and i have been asking questions about women in this square for quite a long time now oh balantyne looked away again how well did you know her general balantyne pitts voice was quiet but it put a sudden new and dreadful thought into balantynes head he swung round feeling the blood hot in his face he stared at pitt trying to see if the suspicion was in his eyes he found only intelligent interest waiting probing not very he said clumsily i told youii knew her socially as a neighbor not more than that pitt said nothing not more than that balantyne repeated he started to say something else to clarify it so that pitt would understand then faltered and fell silent i see pitt meant no more than that he had heard him he asked a few more questions then sought permission to speak to the women he left and balantyne stood in the room feeling foolish and considerably shaken three even two months ago he had been unthinkingly sure of so many things that now lay in ugly and unfamiliar shreds around him so much of it had to do with women all the certainties that had provided so much of the security of his life not materially but emotionally lay in his beliefs about women now christina had become involved with that fearful footman and was going to marry alan ross thank god that at least had come to a tolerable conclusion although augustas part in it was something he had not yet come to terms with euphemia carlton was bearing another mans child which he felt was inexplicable she had inexcusably betrayed a good man who loved her and now poor helena doran had been beguiled and used and murdered or had she perhaps they would never know the truth of that the thought of all of it hurt him but in some ways the most disturbing of all the thing in himself he least wished to look at was the warmth with which he regarded charlotte ellison the pleasure he felt in her company the acuteness with which he could recall to his minds eye the exact curve of her throat the rich color of her hair the way she looked at him and how deeply she felt all that she did and said whether it were better said or not it was ridiculous he did not get disturbed feel hope or embarrassment least of all loneliness over a young woman one who regarded him as nothing more than an employer or perhaps a little more he believed she might have some respect for him dare he imagine affection no of course not dismiss the thought he was making an idiot of himself he picked up some paper and began furiously to read although it was fully five minutes before the words began to create pictures for him and take on a life separate from the tumult in his mind even at dinner time the conversation passed him by he would pay for the wedding naturally but he left all the arrangements both social and practical to augusta he would do as he was directed and be as charming as was required of him but the preparations were out of his grasp he did not even really hear the rather unpleasant exchange between christina and brandy about the governess next door as much of it as penetrated his mind seemed to consist of christinas disparaging her in some way and brandys defending her with a vigor that would have drawn a request for explanation from him at any other time it did trouble the back of his consciousness that perhaps brandy was developing what seemed to be a family taste for affairs with servants of course for a man it was quite different but it would show considerably more sense if he were to indulge himself a little less close to home after dinner he sent for brandy to see him in the library the butler brought the port and retired closing the door behind him port balantyne offered no thank you bit heavy brandy shook his head i understand your inclinations balantyne began natural enough just dont like port a lot brandy said easily not about the port was he deliberately being obtuse about miss whateverhernameis the governess next door charming little thing shes not a little thing brandy said with a sudden flare of anger shes a woman just like christina or your miss ellison or anyone else hardly like christina balantyne said coldly no youre right brandy snapped she doesnt sleep with the footmen balantyne raised his hand to strike him outrage knotting his body then he saw brandys calm face set hard unmoving he let his hand fall there was truth in the jibe and he did not wish to quarrel with his son they were utterly different and yet he liked brandy deeply that was unnecessarily unkind he let his voice drop i dare say you have lain where you should not at some time or other to his surprise brandy blushed deeply i apologize sir he said quietly it was a filthy thing to say its just that i have a high regard for jemima not of the sort you supposed as i suspect you have for miss ellison and i would not insult either of them by making an advance of that nature he smiled a little bleakly i daresay one would get a thick ear if one tried i certainly feel miss ellison capable of it balantyne grudged it desperately embarrassed by brandys perception his inside was in turmoil but he forced a smile in return i dare say he agreed thickly perhaps we had better discuss something else they were not long launched on something less fraught with pitfalls when the footman announced sir robert carlton and brandy with unusual tact excused himself carlton also declined port and stood a little awkwardly in the center of the floor his face showed the fine lines of emotional strain dreadful thing about the poor doran child he said jerkily poor creature poor woman an appalling thought that she was there all the time and we had no idea went about our business balantyne had not thought of it in precisely that light before and it revolted him their obliviousness the immediacy of life and death they had passed so close to and so unheeding of another creatures extremity dear god did they regularly pass each other like that instinctively he met carltons eyes there was something entirely new in them and he could not yet understand what it was about euphemia carlton said hesitantly balantyne tried to show in his face some of the gentleness he wanted to feel did feel he said nothing thinking it better merely to wait i carlton was stumbling for words i didnt understand i must have seemedvery coldto her she wanted a child ii didnt know that i wishi wish she could have felt she could tell me so it must have been my fault that she couldnt i was tooi put her on a pedestali didnt realize what acomfortless thing respect is she wanted a childthats all i see balantyne did not see at all but he felt carltons need his groping toward belief that it was understandable and that he himself understood yes i see he repeated i find it carlton swallowed i find it hard to come to terms with but in time i shall i shall consider the child to be mine balantyneyou will his skin colored deeply he could not put it into words of course balantyne said immediately to do anything else would be monstrous and quite wrong thank you carltons hand was clenched by his side and there was a nervous flick in his temple ii love her very much you know shes a very fine woman balantyne said generously and he meant it and she will love you the more for your understanding carlton looked up quickly do you think so there was a stab of hope in his voice that was painful to hear im sure balantyne said firmly now are you sure you wont have some port very good you know reggie southeron recommended it and he may know damn all else but he does know his palate carlton took a deep breath and let it out slowly thank you perhaps i will nine reggie southernon was not visited by pitt until late the following afternoon he was just settling into his deep chair to thaw out from the unpleasantness of travel the hard springs the drafts the rain down the neck when pitt was announced he seriously gave thought to the possibility of refusing to see him but perhaps it would be unwise it might make him dig the harder into matters preferably left alone and of course not to see him would be to lose an opportunity to put his own case defend himself before he was attacked damn freddie bolsover send him in he said a little irritably and youd better put away the good sherry and bring some of that other stuff silly to insult him by not offering him any at all but no need to waste the good pitt came in untidy as usual his coat flapping wet across the shoulders his face was genial goodtempered but his eyes were sharper than reggie had noticed before good evening sir he said easily odd that such a fellow should have so fine a voice such diction ideas above himself shouldnt wonder aping his betters evening reggie replied i suppose youve come about helena doran poor creature cant tell you anything dont know no of course not pitt agreed civilly im sure if you had known anything you would have told us long before we came and sought you out still he smiled suddenly with what would at another time have been charmhad he been a social equal of course still you might be able to fill in a few blanks sherry reggie offered holding up the decanter no thank you pitt declined with a small wave of his hand reggie poured himself some in considerable annoyance he had got in this wretched kitchen stuff and now the damned fellow did not want it he was obliged to stand here like a fool and drink it himself ive told you he said petulantly i dont know anything about helena doran not about her death perhaps but you must know something about her life pitt said easily maybe more than you realize i would like your opinions youre a man of the world you must have to make judgments about people as a banker reggie should not have been surprised of course the fellow would have found out what he did it was true he was a pretty good judge in the general way of things made a mistake about freddie though tell you anything i can naturally he mellowed a bit shocking thing very young you know and pretty they say pitt raised his eyebrows questioningly very in a pale sort of way a bit fair for my taste a bit fragile looking but very nice for those who like that type prefer something a bit more robust myself must not let it even cross his mind that reggie would be the one good idea to clear that up right at the outset not fond of blondes myself pitt agreed not the very fair ones always look a little cold to me maybe the fellow was not so bad human anyway quite reggie agreed nice girl always civil and conducted herself well far as i know pity great pity pitts bright eyes were still on him who did admire her do you know there must have been some who did oh of course reggie agreed good opportunity this alan ross was very much in love with her at the time but i suppose you knew that alan ross yes fellow who just married christina balantyne this morning in fact oh yes of course yes i had heard he was fond of helena doran damn sight more than fond of her crazy about her terribly upset when she ran offor i suppose i should say was murdered he looked up at pitt i suppose she was murdered oh yes im afraid there is no doubt how can you tell thought the body waswell so it was but a few rags of the clothes left and of course the bones the flesh was eaten away but the bones were all there the neck was broken must have been very powerful hands to do it so neatly reggie flinched in disgust yes nasty isnt it pitt agreed although reggie detected a tone in his voice he could not entirely place peculiar fellow still no doubt he served his purpose and with care he could serve reggies as well very cut up he was reggie went on quite unhinged the poor chap for a while not that i want to suggestof course but its a possibility pitt finished for him reggie assumed an air of reluctance have to admit it he said slowly did he ever say anything to you about another man a lover reggie screwed up his face in an effort to bring something to mind cant recall but my dear fellow you cant expect me to repeat some casual word even if i could remember it that might hang a chap he protested wont hang anybody on a few words pitt said softly smiling again and you have a moral duty after all oh quite reggie agreed this was turning out very well unfortunate about alan ross but then he might very well have killed helena in a fit of jealousy it was the most likely explanation after all pitt was waiting well reggie hesitated not through reluctance but because he had not yet thought of anything suitable to say cant bring back words of course he lifted his voice a little at the end as if to question whether pitt really wished him to continue then he hurried on in case pitt by chance should take it into his mind to stop him just the general meaning he was very much in love with her we all thought they would marry quite soon in fact of course the rest of us had no idea there was another lover i suppose ross found out no idea how never said anything to us but then he wouldnt would he make rather a fool of him what woman you loved taking some other fellow into her bed yes pitt agreed solemnly very painful a man might react on the spur of the moment quite reggie said quickly quite then pitt said after a moments thought on the other hand it could have been the lover lover reggie was taken aback why for heavens sake would think he had everything his way what he tried to smile but felt it a bit stiff on his face no reason to hurt her far as i can see she was with child pitt reminded him the lovers child so a dark thought had come into reggies mind a beginning of a very unpleasant fear would have married her if he were free to dont you suppose pitt was staring at him bright eyes wide reggies mind whirled this was stupid he had never touched the girl no need whatsoever to be nervous but there was always freddie and his damned tongue if the police ever got to know that reggie played around a little they might not understand the difference perhaps he wasnt suitable as a husband i mean he faced pitt squarely might have been a tradesman or something couldnt marry a tradesman could she no time to be worrying about pitts sensibilities now fellow would have to understand there were social distinctions must know that anyway bound to but instead of taking offense pitt merely considered the matter thoughtfully did she have a liking for tradesmen then he inquired good god reggie scrambled wildlywhat to say if he said yes others would give him the lie pitt was bound to speak to everyone in the square helena had never looked at a tradesman in her life she was a little overrefined if anything only man apart from ross that reggie had ever seen her show any admiration for was old balantyne next door liked his bit of pomp and military glamour no doubt no he said as calmly as he could no not at all yes that was the answer in fact never saw her show any interest in anyone that i can recall he weighed his words carefully except old balantyne next door finelooking chap the general natural a young girl should be impressed let him take it from there no need to point out that the general was married pitt himself had made the observation about not being free safe to leave him to infer the rest i see pitt looked down at his feet then up again quizzically no admiration for you sir me reggie looked shocked good gracious no merchant banker you know not nearly as exciting as the army no glamour in it what he forced a rather sickly smile nothing to appeal to a romantic young girl you think balantyne might have been the unknown lover oh now i didnt say that of course not you wouldnt loyalty and so forth pitt shook his head very admirable why was the damn fellow smiling inside himself and i take it she was not a type of beauty that especially appealed to you what i mean you would not have been jealous or anything of that nature god no i mean pardon certainly not too pale too bloodlesslooking for me prefer something a littleim a married no that sounded too pompous he let it die uncommonly handsome parlormaid you have pitt said conversationally couldnt help noticing bestlooking girl ive seen for a long time reggie felt his face color damn the fellows impertinence wasnt driving at something was he he looked at the man closely but there seemed to be nothing beyond innocent appreciation in his eyes yes he agreed after a moment pick them for their appearance you know whole point of a parlormaid is it pitt affected interest somebody else said you had a good eye for a parlormaid reggie froze surely freddie could not have he avoided pitts eye freddie bolsover was it dr bolsover pitt seemed not to understand what he meant yes was it dr bolsover who made the remark about meander parlormaids reggie cleared his throat you dont want to take too much notice of anything he says you know young got rather an unreliable sense of humor pitt frowned dont think i quite understand you sir makes odd jokes reggie explained says things he thinks are funny doesnt realize people who dont know him could take them seriously what sort of thing i mean what would he really mean and what would be just a joke oh reggie thought rapidly mustnt panic keep cool anything medical of course perfectly serious but might make a joke about me and parlormaids just for an example you mean he might say perhaps you had an affair with a parlormaid or something like that pitt inquired reggie could feel the blood burn in his face and he turned away that sort of thing he tried to sound casual and nearly choked sure you wont have a sherry think ill have another he suited the action to the word dangerous sense of humor pitt remarked no thank you he glanced at the sherry i would talk to him about that if i were you could be embarrassing for you just at the moment oh i will reggie said immediately yes must do that good advice surprised you havent done it already pitt went on you havent i suppose what reggie nearly dropped the decanter havent spoken to him already pitt raised his eyebrows diddid he say i had reggie realized as soon as he had said it that it was a stupid question i meaner have you well what in hell should he say damn the man what did he know if only reggie could ascertain how much he already knew then he could tailor his replies this fishing round in the darkness was frightful pitt pulled a small faceextraordinary face the fellow hadand looked at his fingernails normal enough a bit of admiration for a goodlooking maid pitt went on thoughtfully lot of men do it nothing to remark on just could be made to look a bit unfortunate right now he looked up his brilliant penetrating gaze fixed on reggie hasnt been bothering youdr bolsoverhas he reggie stared his brain seemed to melt and freeze again what should he say could he trust freddie this was an opportunity to get rid of all of it or was it just a moment what if pitt went to freddie and charged him then freddie would tell them all about dolly and that was quite different or did they already know that he had been to the bank and drawn out the hundred pounds had he spoken to the footman was that the thing careful reggie think before you speak nearly fell into a trap there good heavens no he forced a sickly smile decent chap freddie bit of a silly ass at times thats all wouldnt mean any harm glad to hear that sir pitts eyes did not move from reggies face just thought you might have had a little trouble ertrouble what made you think that must find out what he actually knew talk to all the servants pitt said lightly in the course of investigations you know reggie stared fixedly at pitts face he knew he knew about the footman and the bank if he told a lie about what he had done with the hundred pounds the damn fellow would go and check up on it and find out too easy have to invent something else well he began awkwardly brain racing who should he blame if not freddie who could not deny it who was likely wellto tell you the truth have had a bit of troublenot freddie of course freddies a gentleman governess yes thats it governess got a bit het upsingle woman no admirers stuck in a job minding children all day got a few wild ideas and put a bit of pressure on any other time id have sent her packing but right now as you say a bit embarrassing paid her dare say i shouldnt have but got to keep the peace what youre a married man expect you understand sooner pay the girl than have her spread gossip all over the place she wont do it again anyway after you clear up all this business no need eh oh no pitt pulled a small face i take it you dont want to prosecute good god no whole purpose of paying up keep it all quiet deny it all if you go to her so shall i have to after all wife and all that got to consider the children too three daughters dare say you knew actually two of my own chastitys my brothers child poor fellow was killed took her in naturally yes charming child yes yes well you understand dont you got to keep it all quiet nasty thing if it got out very fond of the governess the girls and good at her job too he said hastily very good quite well thank you sir youve been very helpful good good get it all cleared up soon i hope i hope so too good night sir and thank you good night yes yes good night charlotte was incensed when she heard about it the following day she whirled round from the sideboard where she had been standing to face pitt in his chair you mean that that dissipated bounder claimed that jemima was blackmailing him and you just stood there and let him she demanded thats dastardly i could hardly contradict him pitt pointed out reasonably it seems unlikely but not by any means impossible of course its impossible charlotte retorted jemima wouldnt dream of blackmailing anyone spoken from the heart pitt smiled at her with a mixture of affection strongly touched with amusement charlotte was not to be moved she felt convinced she was right it was just a matter of thinking of a reason for it all right then she looked back at him with determination from the head then do you really think it is worth money to try to keep it secret that he beds the parlormaid everyone knows anyway and mary ann hasnt been there all that long she let a note of real intellectual triumph creep into her voice not long enough to have been the mother of the first baby there was one before her for a short time she got married and left and another before that who died she faced pitt with a mounting bubble of excitement inside her everyone knows he behaves badly i expect even his wife knows although naturally she would pretend not to he frowned why why on earth should she pretend not to know i would have thought she would be furious and put a stop to it instantly charlotte sighed patiently really men were very unsophisticated at times i dare say she doesnt wish for his attentions all the time herself she explained and is happy enough for him to take them elsewhere but if she were forced to know about it i mean to be seen to know about it then she would have to complain be injured horrified and so on society would require it of her also she would look foolish a deceived wife a rather humiliating position but she is a deceived wife pitt pointed out except of course that she doesnt believe the lie but the offense is the same no it isnt she looked at him sideways for a minute was he affecting to be ignorant or did he really not know sometimes he teased her appallingly he waited in innocence it is not an offense she continued after a moment if she would rather he did it at least not against her the offense would be in making a fool of her in public everyone knows he does it and everyone knows she doesnt mind but if she were forced to acknowledge it then she would have either to create a scene which would make her seem ridiculous or else openly to condone it which would be immoral how abysmally cynical he observed where did you learn all that her face fell yes i know i think its rather disgusting but thats what happens ive learned a lot from emily shes very observant you know and of course she knows a lot of people of that sortsociety i mean i would never do that i should probably have a blazing row he smiled broadly i have no doubt at all that you would my dear she looked at him quickly he held his hands up in defense dont worry we cant afford a parlormaid and i swear i shall never touch mrs wickes considering mrs wickes was fourteen stone and had a moustache charlotte did not feel it a great concession how about jemima she asked he doesnt want to press charges he replied of course he doesnt she isnt guilty i rather agree with you he said thoughtfully which raises the question of why he told me about it rather a superfluous and dangerous invention dont you think i dont care jemima wouldnt blackmail him so that leaves the rather interesting question of who did charlotte caught her breath oh quite he stood up in a single movement youre not going to charge her she caught at his arm no but i do have to report it must you of course i must but it would damage her she will probably not be able to disprove it maybe not even ever he put his hand on hers for a moment before removing it gently i know that my dear it will be a great pleasure to me if i can ever prove him a liar oh she knew there was no point in arguing if anything were to be done about it quickly she would have to do it herself accordingly when he had left she abandoned her housework leaving a note on the door for mrs wickes and took herself immediately to callander square the only excuse she had was to visit general balantyne and quickly manufacture some further service something she had forgotten to tell him previously when she arrived at the door and was faced by the footman she still had not settled on anything satisfactory but fortunately he did not inquire her business and merely showed her in to the library the general was behind his desk apparently not working since there was no pen to be seen he was simply staring at a sea of papers he looked up with some eagerness when she came in charlotte my dear how very nice to see you she was a little unprepared for such warmth what an unpredictable man he was perhaps he was still feeling the glow of christinas wedding good morning general balantyne she replied with the bestjudged mixture of formality and feeling she could manage do come in he was already standing coming round the desk toward her sit down by the fire the day is extremely unpleasant but i suppose it is all we must expect in january it came to her quite naturally to decline then she remembered that she still had not thought of a reason for coming and it would at least give her time thank you yes it is very cold i think it is the wind that makes one feel it so much he was still merely looking at her it made her feel rather uncomfortable one would think all the buildings would be some kind of shelter she went on to fill the silence but they only seem to funnel it into fiercer blasts you must permit me to have my carriage take you home he said seriously and perhaps you would like something hot to drink now a dish of tea oh no no thank you she said hastily i dont wish to put you to any inconvenience i only came to quickly what on earth could she have come for becausei suddenly remembered that i hadhad left out some rather important letters left them out of the correct sequence at least i think i have did that sound feasible that was most conscientious of you he said appreciatively i havent found anything out of order perhaps if i were to check she stood up and surveyed the desk at sight of it the very idea of order became ridiculous she turned back to him helplessly ive made rather a mess he announced the obvious i really would appreciate your assistance again something in the expression in his face disturbed her a gentleness in the eyes a very direct way he had of looking at her good heavens surely he had not misunderstood her reason for calling again her excuse was thin enough in truthbut not for that reason she wanted to catch jemima and if she called directly at the southerons for no other reason she would arouse suspicion perhaps let reggie southeron know or suspect her real intentions guilty people and she was sure he was guilty were inclined to be highly suspicious conscience leaped the bounds of logic and saw accusation even where there was none let alone where it was the precise purpose inadequately disguised balantyne was waiting still watching her oh she recalled herself to the urgency of disabusing him well she glanced at the heap on the desk i should be happy to put that in some order but i cannot offer more than that im afraid she smiled trying to rob her statement of its harshness since i have no maids i have a rather pressing need to do a little housework it is really becoming imperative oh his face fell im sorry for having been so inconsiderate iof course i dont wish to take you away from he stammered a little hastily collecting himself yes i see but if you would today i should be most grateful he hesitated and she was almost sure he was wondering whether to offer her payment and how to do it tactfully she knew he was embarrassed and she felt for him she smiled easily actually i hate housework and for one day i can excuse myself to my conscience i dare say it is most unfeminine of me but i find the crimean war infinitely more interesting than the pantry she moved to the desk taking her gloves off as she went keeping her back to him to give him no opportunity to meet her eyes again but she was acutely conscious of him standing behind her she was not able to excuse herself at lunchtime and therefore found herself taking her only opportunity to slip next door a little later than she had planned however no one saw her but the scullery maid and the cooks assistant and she was at the schoolroom before they commenced their afternoon lessons jemima was standing at the window looking down to the square at the front she turned when charlotte came in oh charlotte how good to see you her face was alight with pleasure even excitement and there was a starry glaze to her eyes are you working for general balantyne again only today charlotte said soberly i really came because i wished to see you without drawing attention to myself there was no point in being evasive she must tell her the truth about reggie and before the children returned jemima seemed to sense no danger and no urgency im sure mr southeron wouldnt mind she was not looking at charlotte but a little beyond her i wish you had come for luncheon you must come tomorrow had she not been listening charlotte had said she was only here for one day but jemima had turned back to the window again charlotte crossed the room and stood beside her she looked down there was nothing there but the silent leafless square rainsodden everything in shades of gray and black even the grass seemed robbed of its green wind keened sharply through the areaways and ruffled a few last deadened leaves on the shrubs there was nothing there to so attract a young womans attention someone must have just passed that way charlotte had heard no carriage and horses hooves sounded sharply enough with the rattle of wheels on the stones someone on foot in this weather oh no not brandy balantyne jemima jemima turned her eyes still warm and happy she looked down suddenly a faint color climbing her cheek brandy balantyne charlotte asked do you not like him charlotte from something you said last time i was not sure charlotte had liked him very much but she dare not say so yet not lie and hurt pointlessly i have only met him a few times and then briefly if you remember i was not a social visitor there only someone employed to help that was cruel and she knew it but jemima must not be allowed to let dreams grow out of proportion the more vivid the dream the more painful the awakening the hurt showed immediately in jemimas face yes she said softly yes i know that and i know what you are trying to say you are quite right of course charlotte wanted to warn her about reggie southeron but that would have meant bringing up the subject of a master who slept with maids and at this very moment it would seem a crude thing to say and perhaps totally unjust it was no parallel and she did not wish jemima to think for one moment that she imagined it was she would have to leave it for another time a time less open to pain and misunderstanding all the explanations in the world would not get rid of the impression of a likeness in jemimas mind if she were to mention reggie and parlormaids and blackmail in the same breath with brandy balantyne i must return she said instead i merely wanted to see you and toto ask you to take great care of yourself sometimes people who are frightened will blame others in investigations like this i heard about poor miss doran be most guarded in what you say jemima looked a little puzzled but she agreed easily enough and five minutes later charlotte was out in the icy street again hurrying back to the library and the generals papers feeling unsatisfied with herself and doubly afraid for jemima christina was not away after her wedding for more than a week possibly because of the tragedies that had happened in the square it had been considered an unsuitable time for a holiday in celebration possibly also no one had the heart for it least of all alan ross even christina marrying days after the discovery of helenas body could hardly demand of him a honeymoon spirit emily calling upon her barely as soon as was decent thought privately that she might well consider herself fortunate not to have had the wedding itself postponed that might truly have been disastrous under the circumstances she might be in even a couple of weeks could make her a liar premature birth could be stretched only so far with a hope of being believed she called on christina with no particular purpose in mind except that she hoped to learn something further about helena doran they had been much of an age they were bound to have had a deal in common attended the same parties known the same people she doubted they would have been friends then and christina might feel a little bitter about having just married a man whom everyone knew to have loved helena at least in the past but she must know something and frequently as much truth was spoken in dislike as there ever was in friendship especially of the dead funny how death seemed to obscure all the relevant truths in a sugar coating of decency must make detection very difficult alan rosss house was in an elegant street less than half a mile from callander square it could not claim the same opulence nor the same fashionable grace but it was a substantial establishment and when emily knocked she was admitted by a smart parlormaid christina seemed quite pleased to see her although emily thought she looked a little pale honeymoons were very often something of a shock to a woman but someone who had lain quite happily with a footman should not have encountered many surprises good afternoon emily christina said a little formally how kind of you to call emily mentally crossed her fingers for lying i wished to welcome you home and to see how you were she said with a tone of concern after all fortune has treated you most unkindly i feel it was a most wretched time for that poor girl to be discovered it could hardly have been worse christina turned a very cold eye on her then it was a pity you chose that moment to go looking my dear emily endeavored to look contrite how could i have imagined what i would find i believed like everyone else that she had eloped with her lover and was happily married somewhereor married at least in truth i did not necessarily believe that it would be happy these romantic things very seldom are so you said before what on earth were you doing in that deserted garden anyway just curiosity i suppose emily said idly turning to admire the room which indeed was handsome it was a romantic place a ruined garden in the middle of winter christina invested her voice with acid disbelief it is not always the middle of winter it only happens to be so now emily said reasonably and the garden would have been far less ruined two years ago i fail to see your point christina was decidedly cold why when helena met her lover there of course emily turned back what was she like you must have known her was she very beautiful very fascinating not especially christina affected some disdain she was pretty enough in a rather anemic way and she was certainly not witty in fact i always thought her pleasant but rather dull oh dear emily allowed her face to fall although it cost some effort actually she was delighted this was christinas genuine feeling revealing as much about herself as about helena doran what a shame she continued she hardly sounds like the sort of woman to attract a romantic lover unless he were a very callow sort unless of course she had hidden depths if she had then they were very well hidden christina snapped nobody i knew ever found them emily had little compunction about being cruel not even mr ross she inquired to her considerable surprise christina colored deeply alan is quite disillusioned about her he no longer admires her disillusioned emily pressed the point well she was hardly the innocent she pretended to be christina said stingingly she met some lover in an empty garden and obviously lay with him or she would not have been with child surely that is enough to disillusion anybody then it might become you to be exceedingly discreet yourself emily observed she did not like moral hypocrisy and she did not particularly like christina christinas color deepened and she glared at emily with something akin to hatred was it conceivable that at this peculiar point she had actually learned some regard for alan ross it seemed the obvious explanation she was safely married and had thus acquired the respectability she needed if she were indeed to be pregnant although that now appeared less and less probable unlike charlotte she was still wearing gowns with small waists and her figure betrayed nothing yes perhaps she really had developed an admiration for her husband it was a bitter thing but in emilys opinion unless christina were very much to alter her character the better mr ross were to know her the less likely was he to return that feeling still that was not something emily could accomplish for her nor had she any desire to attempt it she remained a little longer speaking of helena again but learning little except that christina heartily disliked her however she could not tell whether that dislike predated christinas regard for mr ross half an hour later she took her leave her mind humming with new and interesting thoughts it was the morning after hearing from emily about this episode and more importantly about the conclusions she had drawn from it that charlotte decided she must go again to see jemima and regardless of temporary hurt must this time convey some warning to her more specific of her danger she also wished to see if she could learn something about reggie southeron that might tell her who really was blackmailing him if indeed anyone was whatever the facts for jemimas safety she must learn the reason behind the accusation to see jemima alone she must find her before classes began for the morning which might well be nine oclock therefore it was a little before quarter past eight and barely light on a leaden sleetdriven morning when she alighted from the hansom the driver had mistakenly arrived at the wrong side of the square and refused to go round it because of the danger to his horses knees on the slimy cobbles where rotting leaves had piled from the nights wind charlotte did not argue she had no wish that the animal should fall and be injured not particularly for the cabbies expense but for the creatures own sake accordingly she was left to walk and rather than risk the same difficulty herself she cut across the garden where there were no stones on which to slip and where the night frost had hardened the ground to support her weight without sinking into the mud at night she would not have gone alone as she carried a memory of cater street which would probably last as long as she lived but it would be a desperate marauder indeed to be waiting around in this icy gray morning amid the spindly black branches and the falling vegetation she moved briskly because the cold bit into her flesh and the sleet on the wind stung her unprotected skin she was watching where she put her feet in order not to miss her step and fall over some fallen branch or slip in a patch of gathered slush it was thus that she did not see the dark mound until she was almost upon it it was not quite on the path but close by the side of it as if it had been on the path and blown from it surely no branch could have that mass a feeling of disaster a foreknowledge came to her before she reached it and she stopped it was wet clothes and in among the roots of last years michaelmas daisies there was the head hair dark in the wet but it would have been fair normally and the skin was white as only the cold of death could make it she bent down but did not touch him he was half on his side one arm crumpled underneath as if his hand were reaching for the knife that was buried to its hilt in his chest she had only seen him once that she could recall but she knew beyond question that it was freddie bolsover she stood up slowly and began to walk back into the wind again to search for a constable ten pitt was called straight away since anything in callander square was considered to be part of his case before half past nine he was kneeling on the still icebound earth by the body a solitary constable stood guard over it nothing had been moved after some protest charlotte had been sent home although pitt thought it was probably the cold that prevailed over her rather than any sense of obedience there was a police doctor with him after he had stared his fill and the picture was etched on his mind together they turned freddie over to look at the wound the knife was buried right to the hilt the filigree handle holding no imprint of a hand at all pitt moved the clothes fractionally single blow he remarked very clean could be luck the doctor said over his shoulder doesnt have to be skill what about strength pitt asked strength the doctor considered for a moment he reached down and moved the knife experimentally no bones cut he observed clean between the ribs nothing but cartilage and a little muscle straight to the heart average adult could do it quite competently too high a wound for a short person blow seems to be a downward one so your murderer was at least five foot six or seven probably more pitt picked up one of freddies hands no gloves he said frowning a little he must have come out in a hurry and possibly not expected to be long coming to meet someone he knew i should think he looked at the nails and knuckles spotless he cant have made much of a struggle caught by surprise the doctor replied only knew for a second before unconsciousness overtook him surprise pitt said slowly from the front that means he knew his murderer the surprise was that he should strike dr bolsover considered him safe a friend or acquaintance the doctor added does one go out to meet a mere acquaintance in the middle of the square at night i didnt say he was killed during the night the doctor shook his head cant tell this weather body would freeze in a very short time makes time of death a bit difficult hardly risk murdering someone in the middle of the square in daylight pitt said gently too risky servants spend too much time near the windows too big a chance someone would see you walking into the middle of the gardens after dark muffled up in scarf with collar up which would be reasonable enough in this weather as soon as youre out of the arc of the gaslight youre invisible could have gone up the steps to the front door or into an areaway off to get a cabanything quite the doctor agreed a little stiffly so take it they met after dark bit of an odd thing to do wasnt it go to meet someone in the pitch dark in a frozen waste like this could fall and break your neck never mind being stabbed hardly see a foot in front of you raises a lot of questions in the mind doesnt it pitt stared down at the body again the doctor grunted must have been wishing to discuss something very urgent and very private indeed or have an intent to murder pitt said softly the doctor said nothing pitt climbed to his feet a little stiff in the bitter cold it occurs to me that i have rather a lot to ask mr reggie southeron see to having bolsover taken to the morgue will you youd better do your post mortem thoroughly in spite of the obvious i dont believe there will be anything else but its always possible the doctor gave him a sour look and stumped back toward the constable slapping his hands together to get the circulation moving again pitt did not want to give reggie any advance warning this time he went straight to the front door and when the footman answered announced that he wished to see mr southeron with all possible speed he imagined that on a bitter morning like this reggie would not have risen before nine and would certainly not have breakfasted and been ready to depart for the city before ten he was correct reggie was still at the table and about to expostulate at the footmans unseemly interruption and to tell him rather sharply that the police could wait when he glanced past the mans sober figure to see the enormous caped figure of pitt who had followed him in precisely to avoid being dismissed in such a fashion really reggie glared at him i appreciate that you have a difficult job to do but a little unpleasantness in the square does not absolve you from all need to follow the ordinary dictates of good manners i shall see you when i have finished my breakfast you may wait until then in the morning room if you wish pitt eyed the footman and found to his satisfaction that the mans fear of the police was greater than his fear of his employer he retreated like water going down a sink flowing outward with a somewhat circular motion and disappearing down the passage the matter is too urgent to admit of delay pitt said firmly dr bolsover has been murdered reggie stared at him glassily i beg your pardon dr bolsover has been murdered pitt repeated his body was found this morning at a few minutes after eight oclock good god reggie dropped his fork laden with food and it fell with a clatter upsetting his knife and sliding to the floor taking bacon and sausage with it good god he said again what a frightful thing yes pitt agreed watching him closely did he really have the wit to act so well he seemed stupefied with shock murder is always frightful he went on one way and another of course many people who are murdered rather bring it upon themselves what in blazes do you mean reggies heavy face flushed scarlet i call that damned impertinent damned bad taste poor old freddie lying dead somewhere and you stand there saying he deserved it no pitt corrected carefully you leaped to that conclusion what i said was that some people who are murdered bring it upon themselves blackmailers and so on he leaned a little forward watching reggies face minutely he saw what he was looking for the ebb of color the nervous spasm of muscles blackmailers reggie repeated hoarsely his eyes unfocused like a stuffed dolls yes pitt pulled up a chair and sat down blackmailers rather often get murdered victim sees it as his only way out blackmailers dont seem to realize when theyve reached the critical point they press too far he opened his hands wide to express an explosion an eruption reggie swallowed convulsively his eyes fixed on pitt as if mesmerized he seemed to be unable to speak pitt gambled that is what happened to dr bolsover isnt it sir drbolsover yes he was blackmailing you wasnt he nono i told you itit was jemima the governess i said that to you before so you did you said that the governess was blackmailing you over the fact that you have had a passing affair with your parlormaid i wouldnt have thought that was worth paying for sir since i knew about it the servants knew i would be surprised if the neighbors had not guessed and i imagine your wife also knows even if she prefers to pretend that she does not what the hell do you mean reggie tried to look affronted no more than i say sir that i find it hard to believe that you would submit to blackmail over something which is a subject of general knowledge even though it is not mentioned and which is a little sordid but not by any means an infrequent offense and hardly a crime ii told youof course it is not a crime but right now it could be misunderstood people could think you mean the police could think pitt raised his eyebrows sardonically a tide of color swept up reggies face as he realized his lie was ridiculous pitt could almost see his brain racing should he catch him now in panic or wait till his tongue betrayed him further er reggie tried to fill in until he invented something wellyes it does sound a bit thin pitt finished for him suppose you tell me the truth ertruth yes sir why was dr bolsover really blackmailing you i reggie seemed frozen if i have to ask others in order to find out it will be a lot more uncomfortable for you pitt pointed out if you tell me providing there is no crime involved i shall be as discreet as i can time is important we have a murderer somewhere in this square and he may not be finished yet oh god why was dr bolsover blackmailing you mr southeron reggie gasped and swallowed another affair i had his eyes were hot uncomfortable searching somewhere over pitts shoulder woman was married husband important fellow could do me a spot of damage if he found out you understand pitt looked at him for a long moment he was lying how did the governess ever come to know about it he asked what reggies head jerked up oh er you said she was blackmailing you too pitt reminded him would you like to amend that now suddenly reggies eyes cleared no no she was very greedy young woman that must be why freddie was killed yes it all fits in dont you see he sat up a little they must have quarreled over the money she wanted more than her share he refused and she killed him makes sense all fits together how did the governess come to know of this affair of yours did you have the woman here good god of course not what on earth do you think i am then how did she know sir i dont know freddie must have said something why on earth should he do that why share his spoils unnecessarily seems an unlikely thing to do how in hell should i know reggie demanded furiously perhaps he was having an affair with her and he told her in a moment of boasting or something well never know now poor swine is dead the governess isnt well you can hardly expect her to tell you the truth there was a rising note in reggies voice that sounded uncommonly like panic pitt gambled again i think it sounds more likely to me sir that this woman you had an affair with wasnt the wife of some powerful man at all but another maid reggies eyes glinted as youve just pointed out inspector it would hardly be worth anything to me to pay for silence over something as trifling as that not if thats all there was to it pitt agreed with a small smile his eyes fixed on reggies face unblinkingly but what if there were more to it a child say reggie went pasty white for a moment it occurred to pitt that he might have a fit one of your parlormaids died didnt she pitt asked slowly making each word weigh heavily reggie gagged for breath you didnt murder her did you mr southeron pitt asked god oh god no i didnt she died freddie was with her we called him in had to thats how he knew what did she die of ii dont know do i have to ask the female staff pitt said softly no there was a moments silence no reggie said more quietly she had an abortion it went wrong thats why she died i didnt know anything about it i couldnt have saved her youve got to believe that but it was your child how do i know pitt permitted his disgust to show at last you mean you were sharing her with someone else the footman perhaps or the bootboy he said harshly how dare you ill have you remember your place your place at the moment mr southeron pitt snapped back is extremely unpleasant a parlormaid carrying your child dies in your house from a badly done abortion you are being blackmailed by your doctor over the affair now your doctor is murdered outside your house what strikes you as the obvious conclusion to draw from that ii told you reggie fumbled his words and gasped the governess she was with him in it he must have been sleeping with her told her she was the one who came to me for the money she must have quarreled with hima case of thieves falling out thats the obvious answer who are you going to believe me who hasnt done anything wrong or a servant girl who lies and blackmails and finally kills her lover and accomplice i ask you pitt sighed and stood up i shant believe anyone mr southeron until i have more evidence but i shall remember what you have said every word of it thank you for your time good morning sir as soon as he had gone reggie collapsed it was appalling god alone knew where the end of it lay scandal ruin he felt ill the room swam around him and darkened into visions of penuryvague because he had never actually known itbut none the less frightful for that he was still sitting slumped over the table when adelina came in you look ill she observed have you eaten too much her cold unconcern was the last cut to a sore wounded man yes i am ill he said angrily the police have just been here freddie bolsover has been murdered he watched her face satisfied to see the shock in it murdered she sat down sharply how dreadful whatever for was he robbed ive no idea he snapped he was just murdered poor sophie adelina stared down the table past reggie into the distance shell be quite utterly lost never mind about sophie what about us he was murdered adelina dont you understand that that means someone murdered him crept out there in the dark and stuck a knife into him or hit him over the head or whatever very unpleasant she agreed people can be very wicked is that all you can say his voice was rising to a shout out of control god damn it woman that bounder from the police all but accused me of it she did not seem impressed far less frightened why should they do that you could have no reason for killing freddie he was a friend he was a blackmailer freddie nonsense who on earth would he blackmail hes a doctor you stupid woman he could blackmail any of his patients still she was not apparently moved doctors are not allowed to tell the things about their patients that are confidential if they did they would get no more patients freddie would never do that it would be foolish and dont call me stupid reggie its very rude and theres no need for rudeness im sorry freddie is dead but becoming hysterical wont help i dont understand you he was angry frightened and now utterly bewildered you were weeping all over the place about helena and here is freddie dead and you dont seem to care at all that was different helena was carrying a child her voice dropped at the memory of it that child died before it was ever born if you were a woman you would understand that i look at my own children and of course i weep children are all a woman really has she looked at him with a sudden harshness we carry them and bear them bring them into the world love them listen to them advise them and see that they are married well all you do is pay the bills and boast about them if they do something well im sorry freddie is dead but i really cant weep about it i shall be sorry for sophie of course because she has no children and how do you know freddie was a blackmailer what you said freddie was a blackmailer how do you know that oh he scrambled for an answer someone told me confidence you know cant tell you about it dont be fatuous reggie people dont tell you about things like that he must have been blackmailing you was he of course not theres nothing to blackmail me about then why do the police think you killed him it doesnt make sense i dont know he yelled i didnt damn well ask i thought it might have been about dolly he froze she looked like a stranger sitting at the head of the table monstrous and unknown inscrutable she was saying something appalling and there was no expression on her face except a mild curiosity ddolly he stuttered i could have forgiven you for sleeping with her as long as you were discreet she said looking directly at him it seemed as if it was the first time she had ever really looked at him but not for killing her child reggie never for that i didnt kill the child he was becoming hysterical he could hear it himself but could do nothing to stop it it was an abortion it went wrong i didnt do it dont lie reggie of course you did it you allowed her to seek an abortion in the back streets instead of sending her away to the country to bear the child she could have stayed there or you could have had the child adopted you didnt i shall not forgive you for that reggie not ever she stood up again and turned away i trust you did not have anything to do with freddies death it would have been extremely stupid of you stupid is that all you can say stupid do you actually imagine i could have anything to do with killing freddie no i think it would be most unlike you to have done anything so decisive but i am glad to hear you say it i hope you are telling the truth do you doubt me i dont think i care very much except for the scandal if you manage to keep the police out of it that is all i ask he stared at her helplessly suddenly he was cold as if a longworn skin had been ripped from him and left him naked he watched her go out of the room and felt like a child in the dark having told the police that jemima was the one who had blackmailed him and therefore having been unable to go back on it it seemed the obvious ideal solution to blame her for freddies murder also now he must make it stick he must behave as if he believed it to be the truth it was inconceivable that a man knowing such a thing would keep in his house tutoring his children a woman who was a blackmailer and a murderess the only possible course was to dismiss her immediately it was unfortunate of course in the circumstances there would be no one who would take her in but what else was he to do pity he had not taken the opportunity a few minutes ago of telling adelinabut the thought of adelina was highly uncomfortable at the moment better removed from mind he must find jemima and tell her she must leave he need not explain to her precisely why which would be most embarrassinghe could avoid that very well on the claim that he would not accuse her before the police did and perhaps jeopardize the justice of her cause yes that sounded excellent he even felt a flush of rectitude and rose from the table to set about it immediately charlotte heard of it at midday when jemima arrived on the doorstep whitefaced a boxchest on the pavement beside her a hansom clopping away already reaching the corner of the street she must have stood on the step for some moments afraid to knock charlotte answered the door herself since there was no one else one would hardly wish to send mrs wickes with her hands wet apron splashed hair sprouting like a bollard willow jemima she saw the chest whatever has happened come in you look frozen and starved can you lift the other end of the box with me we cant leave it there or someone may steal it obediently jemima bent and a few minutes later they were both inside and charlotte looked at her more closely what is it she said gently has mr southeron accused you of blackmailing him jemima looked up shock and a kind of relief in her face that she did not have to break the news herself you know charlotte was ashamed now for not having warned her although perhaps it would have done little good she should have thought of some way for pitt to prevent reggie giving tongue to his lies yes i meant to tell you when i came the other day she put out her hands and clasped jemimas im so sorry when i saw how you felt about brandy balantyne i couldnt speak of reggie and his maids in the same breath for fear you would think i believed you were no better jemima looked bewildered but there was no accusation in her eyes how did you know she repeated does everyone know except me she swallowed hard why charlotte why should he say such a thing certainly he lay with mary ann but everyone knew i never spoke of it least of all to himand asking for money why should he say i did because someone was blackmailing him and he did not wish to tell the truth of it charlotte replied it was easy to blame you because you are least likely to be able to defend yourself but why should anyone blackmail him over that it is rather squalid it is true and it is an abuse of mary ann and of his wife but it is not a crime it would not even be so much of a scandal not worth paying to avoid anyway i dont know charlotte admitted but come and sit down let me make you something to drink to warm you i think i have a little cocoa we must plan what to do next she busied herself quickly they were in the kitchen anyway it being the warmest room in the house charlotte could not afford to burn a fire in the parlor except in the evenings mrs wickes had finished the floor and gone upstairs to sweep so they were alone you can sleep in the nursery charlotte went on stirring the cocoa with a wooden spoon to get rid of the lumps the bed is a little small but it will do you for a while im afraid it is all we have i cant stay here jemima said quickly oh charlotte i am grateful but the police will be looking for me soon blackmail is a crime you know i cannot bring that disgrace upon you oh charlotte turned round in surprise forgetting jemima knew so little of her dont worry about that my husband is a policeman in fact he is the policeman in charge of this case he knows you did not blackmail anyone at least she corrected herself he does not believe you did dont worry he will discover the truth and dr bolsover has been murdered did you know that i found his body this morning i was on the way again to warn you about mr southeron when i nearly fell over it maybe he was the real blackmailer youthe police jemima was utterly confused but but you are not married are you not lady ashworths sister at least that is what general balantyne said i obtained your address from him this morning i had to lie i said i wished to write you a letter she winced and looked down for a moment before mr southeron should tell anyone about me and i should find no one would open their doors to me i did not know who else to turn to her eyes brimmed over and she dropped her head to hide her distress charlotte put down the cocoa and went to her putting her arms round her for a little while jemima wept silently then she pulled herself together blew her nose hard excused herself to wash her face and returned downstairs to take cocoa now ready and biscuits afterward she faced charlotte and declared herself ready for battle charlotte smiled back at her thomas will discover the truth she said firmly although she knew that that was not necessarily the case sometimes crimes remained unsolved and if possible we shall help him she went on to have it done the more quickly i think i must send a letter to emily to acquaint her with the latest events she may be able to assist us too you are marvelous jemima smiled rather weakly are you so used to murders that they do not frighten you anymore oh no the horror of cater street came back to her with all its terror and grief she felt a quick prickle of tears for sarah oh no she said quietly they frighten me very much not just murder but all the other dark things it stirs in even those who are barely involved in the first crime it seems so often one crime begets another people do such strange things to cover guilt we can become so cruel and so selfish when we are afraid murder and investigation reveal to us so many things about each other which we would rather not have known believe me i am frightened by it but i think i would prefer that it should always frighten me not to be frightened would mean that i had lost the understanding of it but it is my nature to fight and we shall discover the truth of this yet whomever it may involve when pitt arrived home late that evening he was only mildly surprised to see jemima sitting with charlotte by the fire she was both embarrassed and nervous to begin with but he went to some effort to put her at ease even though he was appallingly tired and by the time she retired she looked as if she might sleep after she had gone he told charlotte that reggie had accused her of the murder of freddie also and was relieved that charlotte did not blaze up in temper nor dissolve in tears although he had never considered the latter likely in the morning he set out again to callander square walking some part of the distance the better to enable himself to think he did not doubt for a moment that freddie bolsover had been murdered because he was a blackmailer he was inclined to think that it was not reggie southeron if only because he lacked the nerve and had seemed to be totally shocked by the news of the discovery of the body surely if he had known anything about it he would have been prepared with a more plausible story but if it was not reggie then who were the other suspects surely in callander square there were enough secrets worth paying to keep he would begin with balantyne he found him at home and quite willing to see him he was shown into the morning room and a moment later the general came in still looking grave from the news of freddies murder the day before good morning inspector have you discovered something further about poor freddie yes quite a lot sir none of it very pleasant im afraid im sure it wasnt wretched business poor fellow you said yesterday he was stabbed was there something else perhaps i didnt explain myself very well i meant that what i had discovered was about dr bolsover himself not the murder although i believe it was the cause oh balantyne frowned slightly what do you mean not something to do with the babies in the square surely always thought freddie was a pretty sober sort of chap not given to playing the fool with other women not directly to do with the babies but perhaps indirectly he was a blackmailer balantyne stared at him blackmailer he repeated foolishly whatever makes you think anythingsovile one of his victims must be lying fellow who would do something fit to be blackmailed for could well be a liar as well in fact must be or others would know about his crimes doesnt have to be a crime sir pitt said gently could be something he merely preferred kept private an indiscretion or misfortune perhaps like his daughter having an affair with a footman and being with child before she was married or he stopped it was unnecessary to go on balantynes face was scarlet pitt waited id see the fellow in hell before id pay him balantyne said very quietly believe me would you pitt asked his voice mild not a challenge but a soft probing your only daughter just before her marriage to a most suitable man are you sure would you not perhaps consider it worth a small expense to protect her balantyne stared at him his eyes wavering pitt said nothing i dont know balantyne said at last possibly youre right but it didnt happen freddie never came anywhere near me he looked down at the carpet poor sophie i suppose she had no idea often wondered how freddie managed to live so high on the hog i had some knowledge of the size of his practice never occurred to me in the wildest momentwhat a wretched business do you suppose he knew whose the babies were perhaps pitt replied but i rather doubt it if he were pressing on that one i think he might well have been killed a good deal earlier than this of course he may have known something without realizing its importance i dont know thats why i must question all the people upon whom he may have put pressure nautrally of course you must well i had no idea i would regret having to do so but if i could help you i should thank you may i speak with lady augusta please and then with young mr balantyne again balantyne flushed uncomfortably lady augusta can tell you nothing i assure you she has most certainly never done anything in her life to make blackmail possible and she is not the manner of woman to be intimidated pitt agreed with this last observation but if she had done anything then in all probability it would be the general from whom she wished to keep it secret he forbore pointing this out it would only embarrass without serving any purpose all the same sir she might be able to help me im sure she is not a woman to gossip but we are dealing with murder i need any help i may be able to obtain yesyes i suppose so very well perhaps he also knew that the request was only a formality pitt could not be refused he came with official power augusta received him in the withdrawing room still chilly with a newmade fire good morning my lady pitt began formally as the footman closed the door behind him good morning augusta replied she was a handsome woman and she looked if anything a little more relaxed than when he had seen her last what can i do for you inspector i have no idea who killed freddie bolsover or why why is not difficult pitt replied facing her squarely he was a blackmailer indeed she raised her eyebrows slightly how very unpleasant i had no idea i suppose you are quite sure quite he waited wondering what she would say next then surely his victim is the one who murdered him you cannot need me to tell you that he smiled very slightly that is to presume he had only one victim my lady why should i presume that she looked at him and the corners of her mouth curled upward very faintly quite i should have thought of that myself when you remark it it is quite obvious what is it you imagine i can tell you i assure you freddie bolsover was not blackmailing me not over miss christinas unfortunate business with the footman she barely flickered it is hardly police business i would have thought not at all its discovery was incidental but you havent answered my questiondid dr bolsover not approach you on the matter certainly not she smiled very faintly and looked at him without dislike i should not have paid him i should have found some other way of dealing with him as i did with max who did try it i have more brain and more imagination inspector than to resort to violence he grinned widely i believe it my lady i hope if you think of anything that might help me however slight you will let me know immediately for heavens sake dont deal with this yourself he has killed once maybe more than once i give you my word she said convincingly he saw brandy a little later in the same room whats happened now brandy demanded not someone else dead no and i want to see that it does not happen again i must find out who killed dr bolsover before he feels threatened again threatened brandy looked worried dr bolsover was a blackmailer mr balantyne that is almost certainly why he was killed who was he blackmailing do you know mr southeron at least goodreggie didnt kill him surely you think that unlikely wellyesi do somehow reggie just doesnt seem liketo be honest i wouldnt think he had the nerve brandy smiled apologetically nor i pitt agreed he said it was jemima waggoner who killed dr bolsover what all the color blanched from brandys face jemima thats idiotic why on earth would jemima kill anyone because she was his partner in blackmail and she became greedy over the spoils and they quarreled hes a liar this time there was no mistaking brandys emotion it was rage thats your answer reggie killed him and is lying to protect himself theres the proof of it if he said jemima blackmailed him then hes a liar his face was set angry and defensive one can lie to cover many things mr balantyne pitt said quietly not necessarily murder mr southeron panics rather easily hes a liar brandys voice was rising you cant believe shejemima he stopped suddenly struggling to control himself he swallowed and began again im sorry i feel very strongly about it im sure jemima is innocent and i shall find a way to prove it to you i shall be grateful for all help pitt smiled did dr bolsover approach you sir no whatever for money favors anything of course not i thought you might have been prepared to pay for example to protect lady carlton brandy flushed deeply how did you know about that pitt evaded an answer did he no im pretty sure he had no idea it was hardly a thing he would come in contact with i mean he might have known she was with child being a doctor and so on but nothing about me but all that is less important than seeing that jemima is cleared please inspector he hesitated please get to the bottom of that pitt smiled very gently you care about her dont you i brandy seemed lost he looked up yesii think i do eleven pitt also visited robert carlton more to inform him that freddie had been a blackmailer than with any hope that carlton might admit to having been a victim himself he made his questions discreet almost to the point of nonexistence as he felt carltons cooperation was of more value than any possible involvement he might reluctantly divulge he could think of no reason why the dorans should have attracted freddies attention the whole business of helena was laid bare for public speculation before freddie was killed so he left them to the privacy of their grief lastly he visited the campbells he knew of no reason why they should have been put under pressure either but it was always possible there was some indiscretion as yet unguessed at although of course they would hardly be likely to tell him but many small clues were to be found in the most guarded conversations frequently the very guard itself was an indication of the existence of something to hide he saw mariah first since campbell himself was busy in his study writing letters she was very calm and expressed nothing more than a deep sympathy for sophie he learned nothing from her whatsoever beyond the increasing impression that she was a strong woman who had already surmounted hardships even griefs and would bend herself willingly to assist sophie to endure the shock that was overwhelming her now and the shame which was doubtless to come he was obliged to wait some quarter of an hour before garson campbell sent for him to come to his study he found campbell standing in front of the fire feet wide apart rocking a little backward and forward he looked angry well pitt what is it he said tersely pitt decided immediately there was no point in trying to be subtle this was a clever and aggressive man who would see and avoid any attempt at verbal traps laid for him did you know dr bolsover was a blackmailer he asked campbell considered for a moment yes he said slowly pitt felt a quickening of excitement how did you know that sir campbells cold gray eyes looked at him with bitter amusement not because he was blackmailing me inspector one of his victims came to me for advice naturally i cannot tell you who pitt knew there was no purpose at all in pressing him some people he might have been able to coerce or frighten or even overcome by power of personalitybut not garson campbell can you tell me what advice you gave this person he asked instead yes campbell smiled slightly i advised them to pay for the time being it was an indiscretion not a crime the danger of its becoming public and doing any real harm would shortly pass i also promised to speak to freddie and warn him that such a trick would not work a second time and did you yes and what was dr bolsovers reaction not very reliable i would think inspector a man capable of blackmail would not jib at a little lying blackmail is a sneaking underhanded crime mr campbell a blackmailer relies on secrecy and is usually a coward he might well have been frightened by a more powerful manwhich mr southeron is not but you are campbells eyebrows went up in amusement so you knew about it of course pitt allowed himself the luxury of a little arrogance and you have not arrested poor reggie hes an awful ass panics very easily so i notice pitt agreed but also something of a coward i think and not by any means the only person in callander square who might warrant a blackmailers attentions campbells face darkened and his big body tensed it seemed for a moment as if a spasm of pain shot through him i would be very particular what you say pitt you could lay up a great deal of wrath for yourself if you make careless accusations about the people in this square we all have our foibles some of them no doubt unpleasant by your standards but we do not like them talked about all men do what they like as far as they dare we have the good fortune to dare more than most we have earned or inherited that position find out who killed the babies by all means if you must and look into who stabbed freddie bolsover but have a care for sophie and dont go stirring up a lot of scandal just to see what floats to the surface you wont enhance your career i promise you youre a damn sight more likely to finish up back on some beat down by the dockside pitt looked at his face for a moment or two he did not doubt even for an instant that he meant precisely what he said and that it was more than a warning freddie bolsover was a blackmailer sir he answered levelly and blackmail feeds on scandal i can hardly hope to discover who killed him without discovering why if he was a blackmailer he deserved to die perhaps for the happiness of those still in the square it would be better if you left it at that i have no scandal to hide as i imagine you know by now but there are a good many powerful men who have for their safety and my convenience i would advise you not to press your dirt shoveling too far we have had the police in callander square for a long time now it is bad for us its time you either came to some conclusion or gave up and left us alone has it occurred to you that your persistent poking around may have precipitated these tragedies that far from doing any good you are making worse that which was bad enough to begin with it has happened before that a murderer has committed a second crime to cover a first that cannot be a reason for leaving him free oh for gods sake man dont be so damn pious what have you got a servant girl who gets herself pregnant and kills her babiesor buries them stillborna trollop whose lover tired of her and a blackmailer you havent a devils chance of finding which servant girl it was now and who gives a damn anyway helenas lover is probably in another country by this time and since apparently nobody ever even saw him youve no better chance of hanging him than you have of swinging a noose round the moon as for freddie he amply deserved it blackmail is a crime even by your standards and whos to say it was anyone in callander square he had patients all over the place try some of them could be any of them but dont blame me if they have you thrown out for it pitt left feeling more depressed than he had felt at any time since the case began a great deal of what campbell said was true it was true that his presence may have precipitated both freddies crime and his death and he seemed no nearer a solution to any of the deaths than he had been on the very first day so it was that two days later when he was called in to his superiors and questioned rather critically about the matter that but for charlottes passionate determination he would have acceded to their pressure and admitted defeat on all but the death of freddie bolsover we appreciate that youve done the best you can pitt sir george smithers said irritably but you just havent got anywhere have you were no nearer a conclusion now than we ever were it was a pretty long shot in the first place and we need you for more important things colonel anstruther added rather more civilly cant waste a good man on a hopeless case what about dr bolsover pitt asked bitingly is he to be marked unsolved as well dont you think its a trifle soon the public might think we werent trying he was too angry to care if his tone offended them there is no need to be sarcastic pitt smithers said coldly of course we must make some endeavor with regard to bolsover although it does look rather as if the bounder got no more than he deserved know reggie southeron myself harmless chap a bit fond of his pleasures but no real spite in him pitt snorted at his private thought somebody stuck a knife into bolsover he pointed out good heavens man you dont imagine it was reggie do you no sir george i dont which is why i need to know who else bolsover was blackmailing i think thats a dangerous line of inquiry smithers shook his head disapprovingly cause a lot oferembarrassment better leave it alone and concentrate on the facts get the doctor to tell you things about the body lie of the land find witnesses and that sort of thing get at the truth that way i dont think it can be done sir pitt replied meeting the mans eyes smithers colored angrily at the insolence not of the words but of the stare then youll have to admit defeat wont you but give it a try weve got to make some appearance of doing our best even if were not pitts temper gave way be careful pitt anstruther warned quietly youre sailing perilously close to the wind lot of important people in callander square theyve taken about as much as theyre going to of police noising around in their private lives i take it theyve complained pitt asked yes who several of them naturally i cannot tell you precisely who might prejudice you against them quite unfairly now be a good chap go and look at the facts again you never know if you ask all the servants you may be able to find one who saw something at least know who was in and who was out alibis and all that pitt acquiesced because there was nothing else he could do he left feeling angry and close to defeat had it not been for the sure knowledge that charlotte would warm him strengthen him and fight to the last ditch for him he might well have considered obeying the order in spirit as well as to the letter balantyne knew nothing of the pressure that had been put upon pitt because he was the only man in the square who had not been party to instigating it when reggie came to see him bubbling over with good cheer after his recent reprieve he had no idea what it was that excited him damn good thing what reggie gulped a glass of sherry to which he had helped himself be able to get back to normal soon and about time all that wretched business behind us hardly balantyne said a little stiffly he found reggies joviality distasteful there is still the matter of four murders apart from anything else four murders reggie paled noticeably but it was not the murders that upset him it was the anything else namely the change in adelina the emotional comfort of his home had vanished he was living with a stange woman he discovered he did not know at all but who knew him painfully well and had done so for a long time it was a very unpleasant feeling indeed had you forgotten balantyne asked coolly no no i just hardly thought of the babies as murders probably born dead what and who knows what happened with helena cant tell now poor creature could have fallen on something by accident and really old fellow you know freddie was no loss bounder was a blackmailer no far the best thing if the police ask a few questions see if the servants saw anything and then if they didnt mess off and catch pickpockets or something anyhow take themselves away from here i hardly think theyll do that murder is a great deal more important than picking pockets balantyne said tartly well im not going to help them any more reggie poured himself another sherry from the decanter if the fellow comes again i shall refuse to see him he can talk to the servants if he wants to dont like to seem uncooperative but im not seeing him again myself told him all i know thats an end to it he swallowed the half glassful and breathed out with a sigh finish balantyne stared at him surely you dont imagine one of the servants killed freddie he said with acid disbelief my dear fellow i really dont care any more sooner the police give up and clear out the better they wont give up theyll stay here until they find out who it was the hell they will been speaking to a few people at the club and what not that pitt fellow will be put back on the beat if he doesnt draw his horns in a bit just stirring up a whole lot of scandal takes pleasure in discomfiting his betters thats all all these working class chaps are the same give them a little power and they run amok no dont worry old boy hell be off soon enough just poke around a bit make it look as if hes trying then after a decent period take himself off and look for thieves again balantyne was furious a blind incensed outrage boiled up inside him this was a mockery of the principles he had believed in all his life honor dignity justice for the living and the dead the civilized order he had fought for and his peers had died for in the crimea in india africa and god knew where else get out of my house reggie he said levelly and please do not return you are no longer welcome here and as far as the police are concerned i shall move everything i have speak to every man in power to see that they ask every question investigate every clue until they find out the uttermost truth about everything that has happened in callander square and i dont give a damn whom it hurts do you understand me reggie stared at him blinking the sherry glass in his hand yyoure drunk he stammered although he knew it was not true youre insane have you any idea what harm it could do his voice ended in a squeak please leave reggie it would make you look ridiculous to have to be thrown out reggies face darkened to crimson and he hurled the glass into the fire splintering it into incandescent pieces he turned on his heel and marched out slamming the door behind him so hard the pictures teetered on the shelf and a small ornament fell over balantyne stood alone for several minutes his mind absorbing what he had done finally he rang the bell and when the butler appeared asked to have the footman fetch his coat as he was going out to see sir robert carlton carlton was at home and balantyne found him in the withdrawing room by the fire opposite euphemia he had never seen her look so happy there seemed to be a warmth about her as if she were somehow in the sunlight balantyne wished he had come for any other reason but the outrage was still hot inside him good evening carlton evening euphemia youre looking uncommonly well good evening brandon there was a slight lift of question in her voice im sorry euphemia i need to speak to robert urgently will you be so generous as to excuse us euphemia stood up a little puzzled and obligingly left the room carlton frowned annoyance flickering across his face what is it balantyne it had better be important or i will find it hard to excuse your manners you were something less than courteous to my wife balantyne was in no mood for trivialities did you use your influence to stop the police from investigating any further into the murders in this square he demanded carlton faced him squarely his face quite unperturbed by guilt or reserve yes i did i think they have done enough harm already and no good can come of continuing to probe into our private lives and our tragedies and mistakes they have had more than enough time to discover who gave birth to those unfortunate children and what happened to them there is no reasonable chance that after all this time they will discover who helena dorans lover was or find him if they did as for freddie bolsover he may or may not have been a blackmailer but on the other hand he could perfectly well have been killed by a passing robber better for sophie if we suppose that and leave it alone balderdash balantyne shouted you know damned well he was killed by someone in this square because he pushed too hard with his blackmail and this time he caught not some lascivious ass who played around with a maid but a murderer carltons face tightened do you really believe that yes and if youre honest so do you i know youre afraid for euphemia im afraid too but im a damn sight more afraid of what ill turn into if i try to cover this up freddie was a blackmailer carlton said less certainly let the wretch lie in peace for sophies sake if nothing else stop deceiving yourself robert whatever he was his murder cannot be disregarded swept away because it is ugly and its investigation is inconvenient to us what the hell do you believe in man have you nothing left but comfort carltons head came up sharply his eyes blazing but he had no defense he opened his mouth to speak but words evaded him balantyne did not flinch and eventually it was carlton who looked down ill speak to the home secretary tomorrow he said quietly good i dont know what good it will do campbell and reggie are pulling pretty hard for it to be closed reggie is afraid for himself of course but i think campbell is sorry for sophie pretty frightful for her poor girl mariahs been taking care of her very capable woman mariah always seems to know what to do in a crisis but nothing could protect sophie from the disgrace if this is made public im glad there is someone who can keep their head balantyne could not resist a last cruelly honest jibe his anger was still too hot i am sorry for sophie but the truth cannot be changed give my apologies to euphemia he said and then turned and left when he had spoken to brandy and augusta told them his feelings he would be drained of anger then he could come back perhaps tomorrow and make his peace with carlton in the future when he was needed he would help sophie when he reached his own hallway he was surprised by the footman telling him miss ellison had called to see him he was annoyed disconcerted he was far from at his best and he did not wish her to see him in these circumstances the footman was staring at him and his brain could manufacture no excuse she was waiting for him in the study she turned as he came in and at sight of her face he remembered how much she pleased him how clear and gentle were the lines of her face passion without guile there was nothing sophisticated in her and it was both restful and exciting to him charlotte my dear he went over toward her holding out his hands meaning to take hers but she held back what is it she had changed and he was afraid of it he did not want anything in her to be different general balantyne she said a little formally there was color in her cheeks and she looked uncomfortable but she did not avoid his eyes she took a deep breath i am afraid i have lied to you emily ashworth is my sister but i am not unmarried as i allowed you to believe ellison was my maiden name i am charlotte pitt at first the name meant nothing to him he could see no reason for the deception had she imagined he would not employ her if she were married inspector pitt is my husband she said simply i came here because i wanted to find out about the babies and if they were stillborn to offer some support to the mother now i want to help jemima mr southeron has charged that she blackmailed him and then killed dr bolsover in a quarrel over the money if thomas is called off the case and no one ever discovers who did kill dr bolsover she will have that hanging over her all her life you are married to pitt he frowned the policeman yes im sorry for having deceived you i never imagined at the time that it could matter but please think whatever you like of me but dont let them prevent thomas from finding out the truth at least about dr bolsover it is wrong to accuse someone and then leave it unproved if jemima had been his social equal he would not have dared he only said it because he knew she could neither defend herself nor attack him in return he felt an illusion slip away from him and a new value take its place the dream had been fragile and foolish he had not named it even to himself now the thing in its place was a warm gentle pain the kind that becomes a familiar companion in time part of ones growing he sighed very slowly i have already been to see sir robert carlton that is where i was when you came he will speak to the home secretary tomorrow the smile started in her eyes and her mouth till it seemed to fill all of her even to the way she stood very straight but with a grace an ease to the line of her body i am glad she said quietly i apologize for not having known that you would she gathered her cloak a little closer round her and moved past him he let her go he was too full to speak the compliment the trust burned inside him more fiercely than in any sweet moment of youth he stood alone for a long time in the room before he finally sent for brandy when brandy came in he was ready for him i have been this evening to see robert carlton he began straight away i persuaded him to speak to the home secretary to permit the police to continue to investigate the murders in the square however long it may be or however painful before they discover the truth since freddie bolsover was a blackmailer it is highly likely that was the motive for his death the police will naturally have to pursue thatno dont interrupt me brandon i am telling you because they will doubtless come to this house again they are already aware of christinas folly with max if there is anything you have done that would make you vulnerable to pressure i advise you to tell me now and then the police if it has nothing to do with freddie i daresay they will be discreet about it they already know brandy replied soberly it seems they are extremely thorough in everything except the actual murders but thank you for the warning he looked away im glad you did that reggie accused jemima of having blackmailed him and then of having killed freddie over the money i intend to see him in hell for that how do you know balantyne demanded brandy looked back at him inspector pitt told me im sorry about that father then sensing balantynes embarrassment he spoke quite casually do you want to see mother youd better warn her as well she does rather tend to take things into her own hands balantyne winced at the memory of max he did not really want to see augusta tonight there was a lot he wished to say to her but not yet presently perhaps when he better understood himself no thank you he replied you can tell her if you dont mind i dont think it will be necessary to warn her but it would be a courtesy brandy hesitated a moment then smiled right he turned and went to the door thank you for not exploding over jemima i mean to marry her if shell have me i dare say mother wont be pleased but shell accommodate it in time if you do i didnt say but brandy was gone and there was nothing for balantyne to do but stare at the door after him perhaps it was not such a monstrous thought it was not as if she were a servant indeed she was not so very unlike charlottebut that was another dream he would prefer not to contemplate tonight it was after lunch the next day when he saw alan ross at his club quite naturally since alan was both friend and soninlaw he went over to speak to him afternoon alan how are you christina well good afternoon sir yes in fine health thank you and you excellent what a stilted conversation why could he not say what he meant had he not learned that much at least from charlotte no thats not true you heard about freddie bolsover ross frowned yes somebody spoke of blackmail is that true yes im afraid so theres been a concerted effort round the square to stop the police from investigating it any further for fear of digging up a lot of scandal i presume although of course those are not the motives given i suppose everyone has something they would prefer not known something sordid or foolish or just acutely private ross made a small face of agreement then he looked up as if he had thought of something to say balantyne waited but apparently the words eluded him they spoke of trivialities for a little while then balantyne drew them back to callander square feeling ross still wished to speak to him again ross hesitated is there something you know that i dont balantyne asked quietly commanding rosss attention with his eyes no ross shook his head a tiny rueful smile at the corner of his mouth it is something we both know but i imagine you are not aware of it balantyne was puzzled but he had as yet no sense of misgiving then if i already know why are you having such difficulty finding the words for it he asked and why the need to speak of it at all for the first time ross really met his eyes without veil or deception because you may otherwise go to some lengths to keep it from me balantyne stared christina ross replied i am perfectly aware of her liaison with max and the reason for her somewhat precipitate pursuit of me no theres no need to look like that i knew at the time i dont mind i loved helena and i shall never love anyone else i have a high regard for you and it may surprise you for lady augusta also i was quite willing to be of use to christina i shall never love her but i shall be a good husband to her and i intend to see that she is a good wife to me as good as our feelings or lack of them will permit there is still an honorable way to behave love or not he looked down for a moment then up again what i am trying to say is that there is no need to fear my hearing of the affair and treating christina any differently the smile warmed his eyes also i am very fond of brandy although he has tended to avoid me since my engagement i think perhaps his conscience is affecting him he was not born for deceit and it sits ill with him balantyne would have defended himself against the implication of his own deceit but it was true and he had no defense and also there was no criticism in rosss face he had a sudden feeling that ross was a better man than christina deserved a man he both liked and respected himself thank you he said warmly you could well have let me stew in fear even betray myself and have been justified it is a great kindness that you do not i hope in time you will learn to forgive us not only in charity but in understanding although i have no right to ask i might well have done the same ross brushed it away might yet if i have children join me in a glass of claret thank you balantyne accepted with real pleasure and a sense of ease inside himself yes i will when pitt was called again to colonel anstruthers presence he was surprised and relieved to be told that there had been a change of directive from the home office and he was to proceed with his inquiries into all the matters to do with callander square he was surprised because he had not expected a change of heart not knowing charlotte had visited general balantyne nor expecting there to have been any results had he been fully conversant with it and relieved because he had had every intention of pursuing it to the last clue whatever anyone said although of course it would have had to be done in roundabout fashion and largely in his own time both of which would have been awkward he did not wish to run the risk of serious demotion for disobedience and he would very much rather have spent such free time as he had at home with charlotte particularly now when she had but four months to go till the birth of their first child therefore it was with a feeling almost of excitement that he ran down the steps and hailed a cab to take him post haste back to callander square sitting jolting over the rough paving he gave his mind to going over yet again all that he knew he had no doubt in his own mind that freddie bolsover had been killed because of his blackmailing whether or not he had ever actually used the information that had brought about his death the mere knowledge of it had been fatal to him the danger of his using it too great for someone to permit it had been a daring and urgent murder the murderer had considered his position in imminent peril what could freddie have known some affair some illegitimate child hardly with all the other scandals in callander square that barely seemed a matter over which to risk murder had he known who was the mother or more likely the father of the babies buried in the gardens certainly not from the beginning or he would either have used the information sooner or been killed sooner unless of course he had only just discovered it or there was another possibilitythat the murderer had only just discovered that freddie knew freddie had either never intended to use the information knowing it was too dangerous or else not understood its meaning yes that made sense the murderer had killed him so precipitately before he could learn the value of what he knew he had arrived at callander square and was standing huddled in his coat collar up watching the cab clop away into the mist before he realized the last possibilitythat it was the knowledge that freddie had blackmailed reggie southeron that had woken the murderer to his own danger that was the most promising it gave a precise point at which he could start he crossed the square over the muddy gardens past where the babies had been found and where freddie bolsover had lain his feet rang hollowly on the road again the pavement and up the steps to reggie southerons house since it was a cold and thoroughly unpleasant day reggie had not troubled to go to the bank however he sent a message that he would not see the police any further nor permit the rest of his household to do so pitt replied to the footman that he had authorization from the home office and if mr southeron made it necessary for him to return with a warrant then he would do so but in view of the fact that nobody else in the square had yet behaved in such a waytrue so far as it went he had called on no one elseit might prove more embarrassing for mr southeron than for him ten minutes later reggie appeared redfaced and extremely angry who in hell do you think you are quoting the home secretary at me he demanded slamming the door behind him good morning sir pitt answered courteously there is only one thing i would appreciate knowing and that is who else did you confide in about dr bolsovers attempts to blackmail you no one hardly the sort of thing you go telling your friends reggie said sharply idiotic question thats odd mr campbell told me you mentioned it to him and asked his advice pitt raised his eyebrows damned fool reggie swore well daresay i did must have if he says so who else it is rather important sir why why in hell should it matter now you seem to have forgotten mr southeron that there is a murderer still in callander square he has killed once maybe more he may kill again if he feels threatened does that not frighten you at all it could be the next friend you speak to as you walk to your own door the next muffled figure to bid you good night then stick a knife into you dr bolsover was stabbed in the front by someone he knew and trusted not twenty yards from his own house does that not disturb you it would me all right reggies voice rose sharply all right i didnt speak to anyone but campbell carlton is as stuffy as hell and balantyne is hardly any better theres no man in the doran house and housman the old buzzard at the other end never speaks to anybody campbells a pretty useful fellow and not too selfrighteous or scared of his own shadow to do anything i told him and he stopped it too indeed pitt invested it with more meaning than reggie understood thank you sir that may be most helpful im damned if i can see how if it does turn out so you will know eventually and if not it hardly matters pitt replied thank you sir good morning morning reggie answered with a frown silly ass he muttered to himself footman will show you out pitt still did not know what he was looking for but at long last he thought he at least knew where to look he knocked at the campbells door and asked permission to speak to mr campbell he was admitted and shown into the morning room where mariah was writing letters good morning maam he said hiding his surprise good morning mr pitt my husband is engaged at the moment but he should be able to see you in a short while if you do not mind waiting not at all thank you would you care for some refreshment no thank you please do not let me disturb you did you come to see my husband about the murder of dr bolsover in part her face was very pale perhaps she was not well this morning or was the strain of comforting sophie beginning to tell on her why should my husband know anything about it she asked there was nothing to be gained by avoiding the truth she might even inadvertently help him possibly she had learned something from sophie without knowing its meaning he was the only person in whom mr southeron confided that dr bolsover was blackmailing him he replied reggie told garson she said slowly she looked very white pitt was afraid she might faint was she indeed ill or did she know something of her husband that he had not even guessed at the answer came instantly helena an older man successful sure of himself with dignity power not free to marry herwas he the lover his mind raced over a whole new spectrum of possibilities but why murder was she about to betray him charge him openly with being the father of her child had he panicked and killed her in that deserted garden mariah was watching him her face was quite still eyes clear she looked like a woman facing execution but a woman not afraid of death yes he replied to her question that seemed hours ago i see she stood up and gathered her skirts thank you for telling me mr pitt i have something to do upstairs will you excuse me my husband will be with you shortly and without waiting for his reply she walked slowly out of the room back very straight head high it was another ten minutes before garson campbell came in pitt had supposed him to be only in another room of the house but he stamped his feet when he walked as if he had been out in the cold yet he did not rub his hands well what is it pitt he asked looking him up and down with distaste i dont know anything more about freddie bolsover that i did before he stood in front of the fire feet spread wide apart rocking a little backward and forward something stirred at the back of pitts mind a man he had seen a long time ago and in some different place a man who walked stamping his feet even in the summer a sick man the picture of the little bodies in the gardens came back the swollen head of the deeper one he remembered helenas child in a shattering instant the answer was there in his brain as clear and simple as a childs picture dr bolsover knew you had syphilis didnt he he said simply when reggie southeron told you freddie had blackmailed him you realized it was only a matter of time before freddie also realized the value of what he knew and tried to blackmail you you killed him before he could do that just as you killed helena before her child could be born deformed like the ones in the square or else she discovered your disease and you could not trust her to keep silent not that it matters which it was now for an instant indecision wavered in campbells eyes then he saw the certainty of knowledge in pitt and his face distorted with rage you bloody smiling hypocrite he said in a quiet bitter voice ive been tainted crippled in mind with this disease since i was thirty years old fifteen years ive been carrying the beginning of death in me and theres no quick end i shall rot from the inside slowly the pains will get worse and worse till im paralyzed a filthy vegetable being wheeled round in a chair for people to whisper and snigger at and you stand there moralizing as if you would be any different yes youre right are you satisfied even my own wife looks at me as if i were a leper she hasnt touched me in over a year helena was a whore when she found out about the disease she became hysterical and i killed her freddie was a sniveling little blackmailer of course i killed him it was only a matter of time till he came to me his hand was behind him and before pitt realized what he was doing he swung round with the paper knife from the desk where mariah had been writing the blade swinging in an arc and missing pitts chest only when he himself lunged forward slipped on the edge of the carpet and fell heavily hitting campbell and sending them both crashing into the fireplace pitt scrambled to his feet ready to strike againbut campbell lay motionless at first pitt suspected a trick until he saw campbells head against the fender and the small patch of blood he went to the door and shouted for the footman his voice sounding loud and stupidly hysterical go out and get a police constable he said as soon as the man appeared and a doctor quickly the man gaped at him without moving get on with it pitt yelled at him the man shot out of the door without even bothering with a coat pitt went back into the morning room and yanked the bell cord out of its socket he knew there would be a fearful jangling downstairs but he did not care with the length of cord he bound campbells wrists as tightly as he could then left him lying on his back still apparently unconscious but breathing heavily he considered finding mariah but decided it would be kinder to have campbell removed first especially should he choose to make a scene it would be distressing enough for her without her being obliged to witness his actual arrest he sat down out of reach of campbells legs in case he recovered and decided to fight again and waited it was some ten minutes before the constable arrived panting wet from the fine rain red in the face he stared at pitt then at campbell still on the floor but regaining consciousness now doctors coming sir he said with some bewilderment whats appened mr campbell is under arrest pitt replied he looked across at the footman who was still standing beyond the constable in the open doorway call a hansom and tell the valet to pack some things for mr campbell when the doctor comes show him in here he turned back to the constable mr campbell is charged with murder and hes dangerous if you have handcuffs put them on him before you remove my cords when the doctor has seen him put him in the cab and take him to the station he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his identification showing it to him ill be along as soon as ive seen mrs campbell do you understand the constable jerked to attention yes sir is e the one wot done the orrible murders o them babies sir i dont know i dont think so but he killed dr bolsover and miss doran be careful of him yes sir i will that he glanced down at campbell with a mixture of awe and disgust pitt went to the door and was across the hall and halfway up the stairs when the doctor arrived he waited on the landing for five minutes more till he saw the party go out campbell still dizzy stumbling between the constable and the cabbie then he continued on upward to find mariah the second floor was tidy and silent he could not even see a maid they must all be in the kitchen or at some outside task mrs campbell he said clearly there was no answer he raised his voice and called again still no reply he knocked on the first door and tried it the room was empty he continued until he came to what was apparently a womans dressing room mariah campbell was sitting in an easy chair facing away from him at first he thought she had fallen asleep until he walked round and saw her face it was bleached of all color and there was a grayness to the eyelids and lips on the dressing table there was a small bottle labeled for laudanum empty and another clear glass vial that also held nothing now beside them was a piece of paper he picked it up it was addressed to him inspector pitt i imagine you know the truth by now the sins of the fathers were visited upon the children but they were my children too and i could not let them live rotted by disease filthy as he was better to die while they were still innocent and knew nothing of it neither pain please ask adelina southeron to look after my children that yet live she is a good woman and will have pity on them may god find mercy for me and peace mariah livingstone campbell pitt looked down at her and felt overwhelming pity and gratitude that she had spared him from having to face her to be the instrument to begin the long course of public justice against her because he loved charlotte so deeply he felt some gentleness toward all women and was unutterably glad that his own life was not scorched and marred by such tragedy he thought of charlottes face full of hope for her new child and prayed that it would be whole perhaps even that it would be a girl another stubborn compassionate willful creature like charlotte herself he smiled at the thought and yet in front of this dead woman he also felt like weeping more than anything else he desperately wanted to go home
