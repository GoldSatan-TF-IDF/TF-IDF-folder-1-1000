full black brad thor chapter swedish countryside near uppsala friday his timing had been perfect swerving back into the lane at the last possible second he watched in his rearview mirror as the white skoda behind him careened off the road and slammed into a large tree applying his brakes he pulled off the road and stepped out of his vehicle the air smelled of spruce and spilled gasoline the woman from the passenger side joined him they had to move fast half their work had already been done for them the terrorist in the skodas passenger seat had not been wearing his seat belt he was already dead the driver was trying to unbuckle himself when scot harvath arrived at his window he was cursing at him in arabic from inside harvath removed a spark plug often referred to as a ghetto glassbreaker from his pocket and used it to smash the window grasping the terrorists head harvath gave a sharp twist and broke his neck gently he guided the dead drivers chin down to his chest the final passenger was a young muslim man seated in the back of the car who was screaming as riley turner opened his door she could see he had wet himself painting his chest with the integrated laser sight of her taser she pulled the trigger the compressed nitrogen propulsion system ejected two barbed probes and embedded them in the young mans flesh the insulated wires leading back to the weapon delivered a crackling pulse of electricity that incapacitated his neuromuscular capability yanking open the opposite door harvath carefully avoided the probes as he pulled the man from the vehicle and laid him on the ground once the mans hands were flexcuffd behind his back harvath removed a roll of duct tape and slapped a piece over his mouth producing a pair of pliers he yanked out the probes the man winced and emitted a cry of pain from behind his gag as he did harvath looked up and saw a familiar pearlgray opel minivan approaching the van pulled parallel with the crash scene and slowed to a stop the sliding door opened and a man in his midtwenties holding a shopping bag stepped out into a puddle of radiator fluid and broken glass the young operatives name was sean chase and while he wasnt a perfect match he was the best they had chase was the product of an american father and an egyptian mother his features were such that arabs saw him as arab and westerners often took him for one of their own the question was would the members of the uppsala cell accept him he was intended to be harvaths ultimate listening device and was going to switch places with the young muslim from the backseat of the skoda mansoor aleem mansoor and the uppsala cell were the only link the united states had to a string of terrorist attacks that had targeted americans in europe and the united states and as bloody as those attacks had been they were supposedly nothing compared to what intelligence reported the plotters were about to unleash subbing chase for mansoor was the most crucial and the most dangerous part of the assignment according to their limited intelligence only two uppsala cell members had ever met mansoor before and actually knew what he looked like the men were friends of his uncle a terrorist commander by the name of aazim aleem the men had been dispatched to arlanda airport in stockholm to collect mansoor and return him to the cells safe house two hours north thanks to harvath they were now both dead the team had had the men under surveillance since they had arrived at the airport the driver had made only one phone call after they had picked up mansoor and left the airport harvath felt confident the call had been to the cell in uppsala confirming the pickup harvath now pulled the young muslim to his feet and pushed him up against the van drawing his glock pistol he placed it under the mans chin and pulled the tape from over his mouth you saw what i did to your friends mansoor aleem was trembling slowly he nodded while his uncle was a very very bad guy as were the two dead men slumped in the skoda mansoor was on the cyber side of the jihad and hadnt experienced violence or dead bodies firsthand that didnt mean he wasnt just as guilty as jihadis who pulled triggers planted bombs or blew themselves up he was guilty as hell he was also a potential treasure trove of information having run a lot of his uncles cyber operations harvath had no doubt the united states would be able to extract a ton from him but first he wanted to be as sure as he could be that he wasnt sending chase into a trap we know all about the uppsala cell said harvath we want you to take us to them mansoor stammered trying to find his words i i cant what do you mean you cant harvath demanded i dont know them harvath jabbed the muzzle of his weapon further up into the soft tissue under the mans chin mansoors eyes began to water dont bullshit me mansoor we know everything youre up to but i dont know anything he said emphatically honestly i was just supposed to get on the plane thats all thats why they picked me up at the airport i dont know where they were taking me harvath studied the mans face he was looking for microexpressions tells people often radiate when lying or under stress from an act they are about to commit as far as harvath could surmise the man wasnt lying i want a list of all the cell members right now i dont know who youre talking about harvath pushed the gun up harder causing mansoor more pain i only knew the two men in the car he said as his eyes drifted toward the wreck youre lying to me said harvath im not lying to you describe the other cell members to me their ages backgrounds i want all of it i dont know mansoor insisted you keep asking me questions i cant answer the only two people i know in this entire country are dead you killed them with so little time that was as good as harvath was going to get patting mansoor down he located his wallet and tossed it to chase he then went through his pockets and removed everything else chase already had a uk passport with his picture issued in mansoors name he also had a driving permit atm card two credit cards and a host of other pocket litter that would make him even more believable chase fished through the handful of items harvath had taken from his prisoner and pocketed a boarding pass a london tube card and mansoors house keys opening the skodas trunk the young operator sifted through mansoors suitcase and quickly studied the contents as he replaced the clothing with his own knowing everything the cyberjihadist had packed would give him more insight into the identity he was about to assume when he was done he zipped up the case removed it from the trunk and closed the lid looking at riley turner he said lets get this over with turner approached and unrolled a small surgical kit she was in her midthirties tall fit and very attractive her reddishbrown hair was pulled back in a ponytail she had blue eyes and a wide full mouth removing a syringe she began to prep an anesthetic chase shook his head i appreciate the thought but ill pass on the botox its your call she replied gesturing for him to sit down on the backseat this is going to hurt though the young intelligence operative winked at her i can take it she swept back his dark hair and abraded his forehead with a piece of sandpaper to his credit he sat there stoically but that was the easy part next turner removed her scalpel placing it at his hairline she dug in and cut a short craggy line chase sucked air through his clenched teeth as the blood began to flow down his forehead and into his eyes turner handed him a handkerchief god that hurts he said i warned you having secured mansoor in the van harvath now rejoined them bending down he gathered up a handful of broken glass and handed it to turner who sprinkled pieces into chases hair as well as the folds of his clothing harvath searched the dead men and recovered their cell phones after cloning their sim cards he reassembled the drivers phone and tossed it to chase saying showtime chapter mustafa karami had not been expecting another call especially one from waqar waqar was supposed to be driving nafees was to send a text message when they got close to uppsala something must have gone wrong karami answered his phone with trepidation please you must help me said a distraught voice who is this mansoor why are you calling from this number theres been an accident i dont know what to do karami was a thin middleaged man with a wispy gray beard he had been extremely sick as a child growing up in yemen and had almost died the sickness had affected his physical development he appeared frail and much older than he actually was despite his physical limitations his mind was incredibly sharp he was well suited to the role he had been assigned nothing escaped his flinty gaze or his keen intellect having been brutally tortured as a young man by the yemeni government he had learned the hard way to place operational security above all else he didnt like speaking on cell phones where are your traveling companions i think theyre both dead dead karami demanded a car swerved and we hit a tree what kind of car i dont know who cares what kind of car waqar and nafees are dead the young man was borderline hysterical karami tried to calm him down are you injured he asked calmly no i mean i dont know i hit my head theres some blood karami needed to bring him in is the vehicle operable no replied the young man were there any witnesses have the police been called i dont know where are you i dont know that either what am i supposed to do are you going to come get me or not karami forgave the boy his insolence he was scared and very likely in shock tell me what you see around you so i can discern where you are chase rattled off a few of the landmarks nearby okay karami replied as he removed a map from his desk thats good i believe i know where you are i will send two of the brothers to pick you up theres a village less than three kilometers up the road as you enter it youll see a grocery market on your left beyond that is a soccer pitch wait there and the brothers will come for you praise be to allah said chase karami gave him a list of things he wanted him to do and then ended the call turning to two of his men karami relayed what had happened and dispatched them to pick up the young computer wizard when the men had gone karami turned to his most devoted acolyte sabah sabah was a large battlehardened palestinian in his previous life before becoming a mujahideen he had been a corrupt police officer in the west bank town of ramallah i want you to find this accident sabah and i want you to make sure that it was in fact an accident do you understand sabah nodded good karami said in response whatever you learn you tell no one but me understood once again sabah nodded we cannot afford accidents not with everything that has happened we can only trust each other no one else with a wave of his hand karami ordered him out go he was paranoid but he had cause so many of their plans had been undone that mustafa karami was suspicious of everything and everyone he hoped that sabah would be able to get to the bottom of it it was a small country road after all and not very often traveled karami had selected the route himself if the accident scene was undisturbed sabah would be able to ascertain what had happened if the police or bystanders were already there there would be nothing he could do if that was the case karami would have to conduct his own investigation it would begin with mansoor aleem himself until he was satisfied he could not risk trusting even the nephew of a great man like aazim aleem anyone could be corrupted anyone could be gotten to fulfilling their final obligation was all that mattered now karami had sworn an oath he would stick to that oath and he would not allow anything or anyone to get in his way he was reflecting on whether it was a good idea to bring mansoor to the actual safe house or find somewhere else for him to remain temporarily when the skype icon on his laptop bounced he had been sent a message from the man whom he servedthe sheikh from qatar everything is in place asked the sheikh everything is in place typed karami stay ready replied the sheikh god willing you will be called to move soon and with that the sheikh was gone karami refocused his mind on mansoor for the time being he would have to be kept elsewhere away from the safe house and the rest of the cell there was too much at stake the man who called himself sheikh from qatar closed his laptop with his liverspotted hands and looked out the window of his cavernous apartment he had quite literally a thirtymilliondollar view of the manhattan skyline it was stunning even at this predawn hour he had always made it a policy to be up before the markets despite his advancing age he found he needed less sleep not more as he privately swilled astronomically expensive vitamin cocktails and fed on exotic hormone and stem cell injections he publicly told people hed had abundant reserves of energy ever since he was a boy and credited genetics and his impeccable constitution as the source of his vigor such was the janusfaced character of james standing even his name was a lie born lev bronstein to romanian jewish parents he was sent from europe to live with relatives in argentina at the outset of world war ii his parents remained behind tending their business and hoping things would get better they never made it out of the death camps at thirteen he ran away from his argentinean relatives renounced his judaism and changed his name to jose belmontean amalgamation of the names of two worldfamous spanish bullfighters at the timejose gomez ortega and juan belmonte garcia the newly minted belmonte found his way to buenos aires where he took a job as a bellboy in a highend hotel thanks to his drive and proficiency for languages he started filling in on the switchboard at night eventually moving into the position fulltime it was at this point that he began to build his fortune belmonte nee bronstein listened in on all of the hotels telephone conversations especially those of its wealthy guests at fifteen he entered the stock market by eighteen he was perfecting his english and at twenty he had changed his name yet again and moved to america standing had been the name of a handsome american guest with a gorgeous buxom blond american wife who visited the hotel in buenos aires every winter to belmonte they looked like movie stars and represented everything he felt the world owed him using the first name of one of his favorite american writers james fenimore cooper he adopted the standing name as his surname and james standing was born he emigrated to america where he parlayed his substantial savings and penchant for trading on insider information into one of the greatest financial empires the world had ever seen now from his gilded perch overlooking the capital of world finance he read all of the papers every morning before most of the city was even awake regardless of his morning ritual he would have been up early today anyway in fact he hadnt been able to sleep very well he was waiting for an important phone call someone to put it in vulgar street terminology had fucked with the wrong guy that wrong guy being james standing and the someone who had fucked with the wrong guy was about to be taught a very painful and very permanent lesson in fact it would be the ultimate lesson and would stand as a subtle reminder to the rest of his enemies that there were certain people who were not to be crossed not that standing would take credit for what was going to happen that would be incredibly foolish better to simply let people assume the mystery of whether hed been involved or not would only add to the aura of his considerable power though hed gotten to where he was by breaking all of the rules he still needed to appear to be playing by themat least for a little while longer soon though like an old hotel on the las vegas strip america was going to be brought down in a controlled demolition and when that happened the rules would no longer apply to james standing chapter coldwater canyon los angeles california t he red porsche gt pulled to the top of the cobblestone driveway and stopped are you going to be okay the man in the passenger seat said nothing in the middle of the motor court a verdigris poseidon watched over a group of nymphs carrying golden seashells as water tumbled from one shell to another the sound cascaded through the cars open windows the two men sat in silence for several moments the night air was heavy damp from the marine layer moving in from the coast the estates wrinkled oaks and towering pines swayed like sleeping horses in a neatly manicured pasture behind a long row of brushed aluminum garage doors were several million dollars worth of highend luxury automobiles in the glassandsteel house next to it were other expensive toys and priceless pieces of art behind the home was a handlaid mosaic swimming pool a threehole golf course and exotic gardens that would have rivaled anything in ancient babylon to most outside observers the man in the passenger seat had it all and then some larry salomon a handsome fiftytwoyearold movie producer was the man with the midas touch or so said those with short memories who seemed not to recall or not to care about how hard he had worked to get to where he was even the politicians salomon had hosted at his home for fundraisers back before he stopped doing fundraisers loved to smile and tell him how easy he had it hollywood they would say is a petting zoo compared to the jungles of dc none of them knew what they were talking about hollywood was a lot like a charles dickens novel it could be the best of places it could be the worst of places machiavelli dante shakespeare all would have felt at home here tinseltown was a bustling contradiction it was a modernday zanzibar a slave market where souls were bartered sold and stolen seemingly on the hour every hour it was also a place of incredible genius and beauty where dreams still came true hollywood was where some of mans most endearing and compelling stories were told and retold it was home to a globespanning industry that could frighten and terrify but more important could uplift and inspire hollywood was a place where one creative mind could join with others to craft something with the ability to affect the lives of millions upon millions of people it was a place for most people where magic was still alive unfortunately and despite his success larry salomon was no longer one of those people in his mind magic was for the woefully naive happily ever after existed only in fairy tales and of course their modernday equivalent the movies it was smoke and mirrors and salomon knew it all too well larry repeated the man who had driven the movie producer home i want to make sure youre going to be okay i miss her said salomon luke ralston put his porsche in neutral and pulled up the parking brake he had worked on salomons past six films and the two men had developed a very deep bond with his tall fit frame rugged features whitened teeth and expensive haircut ralston looked like he could have been one of the producers top actors if you overlooked the limp that plagued him from time to time but ralston wasnt an actor he was what was known in hollywood parlance as a technical consultant a former delta force operative ralston used his extensive military experience to make sure salomons actors and actresses looked like they knew what they were doing in their action scenes especially when those scenes had to do with firearms handtohand combat evasive driving or any number of other tactical situations its supposed to get easier salomon continued staring into space thats what everybody tells you they tell you to stay strong but it doesnt get easier a mist had begun to build on the windshield the temperature was dropping ralston pondered raising the cars windows but decided not to it would have broken the mood and sent the two men in their separate directions too early salomon still needed to talk so ralston would sit and listen for as long as it took a pronounced silence grew between them the only sound came from the throb of the gts engine and the water cascading in the fountain eventually salomon spoke i think ill go inside do you want me to come in for a while the older man shook his head he unlatched his seat belt and searched for the door handle ralston put a hand on his friends arm skip the nightcap larry okay the movie producer had already consumed enough alcohol whatever you say the man replied waving him off the guesthouse is free if you want it the younger man looked at his watch they had left salomons car at the restaurant when it became apparent he wasnt in a condition to drive ive got an early morning run with friends said ralston ill call you when im done and well work out getting your car back the producer grasped the handle and opened the door dont bother ill figure it out he said as he climbed out of the car there was an edge to salomons voice he was making the alcoholinduced transition from maudlin to angry ralston shook his head he shouldnt have let his friend consume so much booze but at the end of the day thats what sorrows were meant to be drowned in are you sure youre going to be okay he asked as the producer shut the car door and began to walk away salomon didnt bother to turn he just waved over his shoulder and mounted the steps to the entrance of his home ralston knew him well enough to know that hed probably go inside and keep drinking there was little he could do about it try to get some sleep he recommended as the producer reached the top of the stairs and opened his etched glass front door ralston waited and watched until his friend was safely inside before putting his porsche in gear and pulling out of the motor court on his way down the winding drive he wondered if he should turn back of all the nights of the year this was the roughest for salomon had she not been murdered three years ago it would have been his daughter rachaels twentyfirst birthday within a year of rachaels murder larrys marriage had fallen apart losing a child was a pain no parent should ever have to bear having been abandoned by his spouse in the process was almost too much when his wife left him and moved back east larry never fully recovered though actresses some very well known threw themselves at him he hadnt been with another woman since he had no desire the only thing that had kept him going was his work what if this time he does something stupid ralston wondered alcohol and depression were a very bad combination the thought plagued him all the way down to the gate and probably would have bothered him all the way home had something else not captured his attention tire tracks how could there be tire marks on top of his ralston slowed down to study the tracks they were different than those of his porsche and appeared to have veered off to the left taking the service drive that led to the rear of the property salomon was one of the few wealthy hollywood people he knew who didnt maintain aroundtheclock domestic staff and while it was well after midnight and therefore technically morning it was still too early for landscapers or any of salomons other help to have arrived someone had to have come in through the gate behind them ralston decided to take a look backing up he killed his lights and turned onto the service drive in a town like la where you are what you drive the red had suited him perfectly because of the distinct engine whine though this was the first time ralston ever wished he was driving a whisperquiet prius the service road was far less dramatic than the estates main drive instead of a lushly landscaped serpentine approach it was a boring blacktopped lane with two switchbacks abutted by cinderblock retaining walls after the second switchback the service road opened up onto a darkened view of the far side of salomons house and the silhouettes of outbuildings that supported the estate ralston brought his porsche to a stop using the parking brake so as not to illuminate his tail lights and watched a ford econoline van was in the process of turning around so that it was facing back down the service road in the direction from which it had come its driver killed the headlamps but left the marker lights illuminated ralston waited but nothing happened no one got out no one got in he couldnt help but wonder if he was looking at some sort of getaway vehicle was larry salomons home being burgled it didnt take him long to get tired of waiting removing his cell phone he decided to call salomon to see if maybe there was some other explanation he depressed the speed dial key for salomons cell phone but the call failed to connect scrolling through his address book he tried the number again but the call still didnt go through looking at his signal strength he saw he wasnt getting any bars at all he couldnt remember ever having trouble getting reception up here before that was all it took hed been taught not to believe in coincidences releasing the parking brake he put his car in gear and as he did a very bad feeling began to overtake him chapter it was at times like these that luke ralston wanted to throttle the state of california for not being more cooperative when it came to the carrying of firearms here it was the middle of the night a strange van had followed his car onto a private gated estate and he was unarmed while the van and its driver might have had a completely legitimate reason for being there he doubted it and he would have very much appreciated having a weapon right now knowing that if the van and its driver were up to no good they would very likely be armed ralston proceeded accordingly speed surprise and overwhelming violence of action had been drilled into the very fiber of his dna in his military career while he couldnt preemptively attack the van and its driver he could take immediate control of the situation by using both speed and surprise increasing his speed he turned on his headlights engaged the high beams and raced toward the van at that moment the driver leaped from the van with what appeared to be a shotgun ralston pinned the accelerator to the floor the weapon exploded with a roar and a round slammed into the front of ralstons porsche the shooter had been aiming at the headlights big mistake ralston continued to pick up speed aiming right for the driver as the man pumped his weapon to chamber another round ralston killed his lightsplunging the mans dilated eyes into darkness all the shooter could do was aim for the sound of the car that was barreling down on him which is exactly what happened whether the driver of the van was just that good or just that lucky ralston had no idea but his second shot exploded with another booming roar and tore a hole right through the windshield buckshot would have deflected off the glass whoever was shooting at him must have been using slugs ralston didnt need to look over to know that the seat next to him was shredded a few more inches to the left and he would have been shredded as well with the s engine screaming ralston readied himself for what was about to happen flipping his lights and high beams back on he once again flooded the shooters eyes with light there was the roar of the shotgun once more but it was the last thing the man did before the right front quarter of ralstons car struck the mans lower body rather than being thrown clear the large man was pulled halfway beneath the car ralston fought to maintain control as if guided by some unseen force that wanted to raise the car and snatch the body from underneath the suspension the porsches right side tilted up and ralston thought for sure the car was going to flip but just as it had begun to rise it slammed back down ralston maintained a death grip on the porsches steering wheel as he tried to regain control it wasnt until the car spun through the wet grass and slammed into the side of one of the outbuildings that the horror finally came to a stop but as that horror ended a new one began unbuckling his seat belt ralston struggled to get out of the car it was a mess adrenaline and fear coursed through his body what sounded like a muffled gunshot from inside the house suddenly refocused his mind on the threat that still remained it was pointless to waste time searching for the drivers shotgun without a flashlight the chances of rapidly locating it were slim to none the odds were the same for finding a secondary weapon somewhere in the van ralston took off in a sprint he had to get up to the house and save salomon whoever was inside had undoubtedly heard the noise of the melee out on the service road whether any neighbors in this remote part of the canyon had heard the shotgun blasts and had called the police didnt matter by the time they arrived whatever was happening here would be over if salomon was still alive inside his attackers were going to be doubly determined to complete their objective and to get the hell out that meant ralston had to move fast often highend home invasions were inside jobs where the perpetrators had firsthand knowledge of the layout of the home they were able to move quickly knowing where everything and everyone would be the one thing these home invaders wouldnt be prepared for was ralston and ralston knew the layout of the salomon home well based on where the van had turned around it was obvious that whoever was inside had been dropped off at or near the homes service entrance add one more point to the inside job column approaching the door he saw that it had been propped open it seemed that not only was this the way in but it was also going to be the way out the good thing about the door having been propped open was that the alarm which salomon never bothered to arm would have already sounded its quick threebell chime no one heard ralston as he slipped inside the house near the service entrance was a utility room the size of a small family apartment here all of the homes mechanics were housed including eight panels of circuit breakers ralston cut the power plunging the house into darkness once his eyes adjusted he went for a weapon he could have used a golf club but he preferred something he was more proficient with in the kitchen he found exactly what he wanted it was the perfect toolnot too long not too short and incredibly sharp he pulled the seveninch fillet knife from the knife block and moved on coming around the corner of the large island in the kitchen he found what he assumed to be the victim of the muted shot he had heard from outside he was relieved to see that it wasnt salomon in his midtwenties in jeans a tshirt and a pair of chuck taylors he looked like a college kid ralston had never seen him before who the hell was he he wondered a friend a visiting relative an employee the boy had been shot through the bridge of his nose right between his eyes he was lying in a puddle of milk commingling with his own blood an upturned bowl of cereal lay nearby ralston reached down to doublecheck him he had no pulse but was still warm moving quickly he crossed the kitchen and moved into the darkened dining room from what he could tell nothing was out of place salomons expensive pieces of art still hung on the walls and his box of antique silverware was still proudly displayed on the sideboard that fact coupled with the professionalism with which the boy in the kitchen had been dispatched was making this look less and less like a home invasion and more and more like some sort of hit the thought was just solidifying in his mind when ralston heard someone step on the warped floorboard that salomon had never bothered to get fixed chapter ralstons breathing all but stopped making sure he didnt bang into any of the diningroom furniture and give himself away he slipped across the room as fast as he could to the open double doors on the other side pressing himself against the wall he gripped the knife tighter and waited he didnt have to wait long from out in the hallway he could hear a mans voice he was whispering and in some sort of a foreign language it sounded to ralston like eastern european maybe russian but he couldnt be sure when the man repeated himself ralston realized he was speaking over a radio was he trying to raise the driver outside or were there more men inside the house either way it wasnt good ralston needed to get to salomon he could hear the mans footfalls upon the wood floor of the hallway growing closer ralston had two choices he could face the man headon or he could wait until the man had passed and take him from behind shots had been fired and at least one person inside the house had already been killed ralston was literally bringing a knife to a gunfight so he slipped off his shoes and settled on the latter course of action three seconds later the man moved past the dining room doors he was hugejust as the man outside had beensixfootthree at least and well over pounds he had wide shoulders draped in what even the homes semidarkness couldnt hide was a very cheap suit his feet were shod in the long boxtoed dress shoes so popular with europeans in one hand he carried a radio and in the other a suppressed pistol his hair was crewcut short and the back of his head looked just like a russians from the base of his neck to the crown of his head it was flat as a board it was a cultural attribute that most russian men tightly swaddled and picked up seldom by their mothers shared as the russian passed ralston slipped into the hallway behind him the intruder had no idea he was there until it was too late in one fluid motion ralston grabbed across the mans forehead yanked his head to the left and with his right hand plunged the filleting knife into the anterior triangle between the top of the clavicle and the side of the neck it severed the mans internal jugular vein and carotid artery he then swept the blade across severing the trachea all that could be heard was a hiss like air being let out of a tire ralston put all of his weight on the man to prevent him from using his last seconds of life to fight back and rode him down to the floor convinced he was no longer a threat he dragged him off to the side next to a cupboard and left him there to bleed out it was a black art the taking of life and one that luke ralston was all too well versed in dropping the knife he picked up the intruders suppressed walther p and did a press check satisfied that a round was chambered and the weapon was hot he turned the volume down on the radio tucked it into his back pocket and went off in search of salomon the problem though was twofold were there any more intruders in the house and where should he begin looking for salomon he decided to start with the producers office to get there he had to pass through the entry hall with its wide double staircase there was nothing for cover and ralston used the darkness and shadows as best he could the living room with its floortoceiling glass windows and ambient moonlight spilling from outside was even worse but he made it through both without incident the entrance to larry salomons office was down a short hall just past the living room the hairs on the back of ralstons neck were standing on end before he even got to the door with the weapon up and at the ready he buttonhooked into the room and tried to take it all in everything was different the office looked as if it had been turned into some sort of war room whiteboards and bulletin boards were leaning against the walls and a large rolling chalkboard was off to one side salomons imposing glassandsteel desk now sat cheekbyjowl with two additional smaller desks which were topped with highend apple computer systems and what ralston recognized as editing equipment there were stacks of cardboard filing boxes filled with reams and reams of papers and documents there were more pillars of books some stacked three feet high and surrounded by yellow postit notes on a pair of matching drafting tables and then there was another body the man appeared to be in his midforties doughy with saltandpepper hair and a matching beard he wore jeans loafers and an oxford cloth shirt he had been shot in the back of the head executionstyle ralston rolled him over to see who he was as with the body in the kitchen he didnt recognize the man exiting the office he went down the hall to the back stairs if salomon had retained any of the emergency response advice he had dispensed to him dozens of times perhaps he would have headed straight upstairs if so maybe it had bought him some time especially if hed heard the shots and had been able to figure out what was going on reaching the top of the stairs ralston crouched down and stole a quick peek around the doorframe the hallway was empty stepping into the hall he moved as quickly as he could toward salomons bedroom he stopped only for open doors and even then it was for just long enough to make sure there were no threats on the other side he was fifteen feet away from the master bedroom when a figure stepped into the hall and fired the bullet came so close to the side of ralstons head that it actually set his right ear ringing on instinct having fired hundreds of thousands of rounds during his spec ops career he depressed the trigger of his own weapon twice in quick succession and dropped the shooter onto the carpeted floor of the hallway ralston advanced on the man and kicked the suppressed pistol away before checking to see if he was still alive one round had entered just below his nose the other had entered through his throat he was big and dressed in a cheap suit just like his partner downstairs the back of his head was flat as well what the hell was going on who were these people why were there russians in the house ralstons questions were interrupted by the sound of a sharp crack from inside salomons bedroom it wasnt the crack of a pistol it was the crack of molding as drywall was being ripped away it told him two things salomon was still alive but he had only seconds left to live chapter larry salomon had expected that a savvy intruder would probably cut his telephone hard line that was why he always kept a charged cell phone in his panic room a fixed external antenna had been installed to guarantee reception but suddenly it wasnt working either he was panicked no matter how many times he dialed he couldnt get through hed been around enough weapons even if only on movie sets where blanks were being fired to know what real gunshots sounded like suppressed gunshots contrary to what many people thought were still audible there was no such thing as completely silenced gunfire having changed out of his evening attire salomon had been on his way out of his bedroom and back downstairs for one final drink when hed heard the first shot hed stood paralyzed wondering what hed actually heard then the second shot came thats when he knew he had turned and fled back to the master bedroom he didnt dare waste even a fraction of a second looking over his shoulder to see if he was being followed he didnt need to his animal instinct for survival told him that he most definitely had someone pursuing him he also knew that the two gunshots meant his houseguests were dead charging into his walkin closet cum panic room he slammed the heavy metal door shut threw the bolts home and hit the panic button for the alarm system he expected the highpitched piercing shriek of the alarm to kick in instantly it didnt and his fear mounted on a small monitor mounted inside the closet he watched via the hidden bedroom camera as a large man with a gun rushed into the room just behind him he pressed the panic button again and when the alarm failed to engage he attempted to call the police only to discover that neither his landline nor his cell phone were working he then watched as the intruder attempted to kick in the closet door again and again he kicked but the steelreinforced door held finally the man turned and walked out of view had he given up salomons question was answered when the man passed back under the camera a moment later with a fireplace tool and disappeared from view once again the producer strained to see what the man was up to but the monitor provided only a very limited field of view the security system like the panic room had come with the house and had been installed by the previous owner salomon had never really thought about it much it was only now that he realized that a panandtilt camera would have been infinitely more useful than a static fixed lens it was at that moment that all the power went out with the phone line cut and his cell phone signal having somehow been jammed salomon wasnt surprised when the emergency generator failed to kick in whoever had cut the power knew what he was doing he was now effectively blind he wasnt however deaf and his heart soon choked his throat when he figured out where the intruder was and what he was doing with the fireplace poker the first thud had been somewhat displaced but salomon locked on to the second swing of the poker like a sonar operator the sounds had come from the far end of the closet on the other side was the master bath using the poker the intruder was clawing his way through the drywall and into what really wasnt a true panic room but rather just a closet with a very heavy door it was a poorly thought out feature that provided a false sense of security and would only slow but not stop a determined attacker it dawned on salomon how much trouble he was in he was trapped though he couldnt see the intruder he could hear huge pieces of drywall being ripped away on the bathroom side of the wall any moment now he feared the attacker was going to burst through into the closet salomon had one ace up his sleeve and he reached for it the mossberg tactical shotgun had been a gift a friend moving to new york city had been afraid to take it with him for fear of running afoul of antigun laws with its pistol grip short barrel and crenelated muzzlebrake salomon could understand why hed kept the weapon around just in case figuring if he ever got in trouble for owning it he could let his lawyers straighten it out they could simply claim that it had been taken from one of his film sets as a souvenir and that he had no idea it was actually real of course hed also have to claim that he didnt know it was loaded but a courtroom appearance was the furthest thing from his mind at this point all he cared about was staying alive racking the slide he made ready as ralston charged into the bedroom he heard the blast of a shotgun and his heart stopped rushing to the door of the master bath he saw blood and bits of flesh everywhere risking a closer look he stepped into the bathroom and saw a body on the floor and the distinctive doorbreacher muzzlebrake of salomons shotgun protruding from the far wall he leaped out of the bathroom just as the weapon erupted with another roar twelvegauge shot shattered the marble tiles right where he had been standing damn it larry ralston yelled cease fire its me luke his ears were ringing even harder now and he wondered if his hearing would ever fully return i need to get into the bathroom and see if hes dead dont you fucking shoot me he ordered okay there was a muffled assent from salomon whether it was muffled because his hearing was shot or because it was coming from behind a wall ralston couldnt be sure he peeked back into the bathroom and watched as the shotgun was retracted through the blownout drywall ralston grabbed two towels and threw them down so he didnt have to walk across the bloody floor in his stocking feet the intruder must have been very close when the shotgun went off as it had blown a huge hole in his chest ralston looked for any weapon he might have been carrying and saw another silenced pistol sitting on the edge of the vanity near where the man had been tearing through the wall to get at salomon a good portion of the mans suit coat and the shirt beneath were shredded once ralston had ascertained that he had no pulse he began peeling the strips of cloth away around his right armpit he heard the closet door unlock and seconds later salomon was behind him who the hell are they he asked spetsnaz replied ralston russian special forces i think how can you tell ralston lifted the dead mans arm and pointed to the blueblack cyrillic tattoo thats how they mark their blood type what the hell are they doing here why would russian special forces soldiers want to kill me youre not the only one they came for oh my god said salomon chip and jeremy they were downstairs i heard two shots his voice trailed off theyre both dead what were they doing here and what the hell happened to your office we were working on a film a documentary salomon said and then changed the subject we need to call the police no we need to get someplace safe said ralston weve got to think think replied salomon this guy killed chip and jeremy and was trying to make me the third he could be some homicidal maniac for all we know we need to call the cops ralston stood up this is a professional wet work team a russian wet work team team there was a driver outside and at least two others inside the house salomon was trying to piece it all together and you killed three of them ralston nodded how did you know i saw tire tracks leading up the service road i tried to call you but i couldnt get a signal my cell was down too said salomon they must have some sort of jammer like i said these guys were professional ralston stepped off the towels and out of the bathroom reaching for the shotgun he repeated there may be more of them we need to get going the producer shook his head i know how this plays out if we dont stay here and wait for the cops well look guilty and if we do stay and wait for the cops well both be dead im not going to let that happen the russians have infiltrated a lot of police departments across the country are you serious dead serious said ralston were not trusting anyone else at this point when these guys fail to report back in whoever sent them might send more theyre going to use every contact every means they have at their disposal we need to disappear salomon began to object but ralston was already making his way across the bedroom are you comfortable using this ralston asked as he handed his friend the suppressed pistol id rather have the shotgun ralston nodded and handed it over raising the pistol he prepared to enter the hallway and said stay close and if you see anything move at all you pull that trigger got it dont even worry about aiming salomon nodded and the pair slipped into the hallway and down the back stairs they stopped at the dining room long enough for ralston to grab his shoes he thought about wiping his fingerprints off the handle of the knife that lay only feet away but decided it wasnt worth the time they needed to get out of there as quickly as possible his damaged porsche was already going to tell the world that he had been there in the garage ralston grabbed a flashlight and walked over to the key box he bypassed all of salomons luxury automobiles and selected the keys for his vintage navy blue wagoneer disengaging the overhead opener he rolled up the garage door and told salomon to get in the truck hopping in beside him he fired up the wagoneer and pulled into the motor court the gates at the bottom of the drive were on a separate circuit from the house and opened as the wagoneer rolled over the pressure plates the marine layer had turned into a thick fog that would work to their advantage and it helped ralston decide in which direction to head youre bleeding said salomon as they turned out onto the road ralston touched the side of his head and looked at his fingers the bullet that had whizzed by his ear had actually grazed him dont worry about it he said salomon was worried about it though he was worried about all of it he knew ralston was right more men would be coming after him he had uncovered the truth and the truth made him a liability chapter sweden harvath had rented a farm on the outskirts of uppsala for their safe house it was far enough away from neighbors that they could interrogate their prisoner and come and go without attracting any attention in the city of uppsala itself he had rented an apartment where he had staged an assault team though they were outfitted with gear to look like members of the swedish security service the government of sweden had no idea an american operation was taking place on their soil they were purposely being kept in the dark for the time being somewhere in the intelligence community there was a leak because of that leak one of the highestvalue terrorist targets the united states had ever bagged aazim aleem had been assassinated sitting in the darkened room scot harvath played the entire scene across the panorama of his minds eye for the millionth time it was all thereall so vividthe boom of the rocketpropelled grenade leaving its launcher the whoosh as it blistered through the air en route to its target and finally the deafening explosion as the rpg connected with the trunk and gas tank of his car and the vehicle went up in a billowing fireball in a blinding flash his yemen operation had gone from a resounding success to a spectacular failure aazim whod been in the trunk would have purchased harvaths group some muchneeded goodwill with the cia but it was too late for that now staring out the window he caught a glimpse of his reflection although he had crossed the threshold into his forties he still looked as if he was in his early thirties his sandcolored hair showed no traces of gray his handsome greeneyed face bore few if any lines and his fivefootten body was in better physical shape than those of men half his age to see the toll the years had taken one would have to look elsewhere by most measures harvath was a success in the immortal words of mark twain he had made his vocation his vacation he was a man of particular talents who was deeply committed to his country those talents and that commitment had propelled him to the pinnacle of his career the cost to his personal life was something he didnt like to think about nevertheless ever since yemen his relationships had been very much at the forefront of his mind but it wasnt romantic relationships that he had been thinking about someone had professionally betrayed him someone with intimate knowledge of his organization someone close it was precisely because of this apparent leak that harvath had requested permission to run this assignment himself somewhere there was a leak and until that leak was plugged there was a very short list of people harvath could trust at the top of that list was a thirtyyear cia veteran named reed carlton carlton had watched as bureaucracy and inertia devoured what had once been the best intelligence agency in the world as management became more concerned with promotions and covering its tail and as the agencys leadership atrophied carlton could see the writing on the wall by the s when the cia stopped conducting unilateral espionage operations altogether he was disappointed but not at all surprised while there were countless patriotic men and women still left at langley the institutionalized bureaucracy made it all but impossible for them to effectively do their jobs the bureaucracy had become riskaverse even more troubling was the fact that the cia now subcontracted its actual spy work to other countries intelligence services they happily handed over huge sums of cash in the hopes that other countries would do the dangerous heavy lifting and would share whatever they developed it was the biggest open secret in the intelligence world and it was both humiliating and beneath americas dignity once the secret was out that the cia was no longer truly in the spy business carlton knew he had to do something it was then that he began recruiting former central intelligence agency and special operations personnel and stood up his own venturethe carlton group it was modeled upon the world war ii intelligence agency known as the office of strategic services or oss it was composed of patriots who wanted one thing and one thing onlyto keep americans safe no matter what the cost frustrated with the cias reluctance to do its job the department of defense eventually turned to carlton to provide private intelligence services in iraq and afghanistan the groups operatives had performed dramatically developing extensive human networks across both countries they penetrated multiple terrorist cells and delivered exceptional a intelligence that resulted in huge successes for american forces not to mention the saving of countless american and coalition lives based upon this success a key group of dod insiders decided to bring the carlton group all the way inside they were paid from black budgets and hidden from dcs grandstanding selfserving politicians the fact that not one single central intelligence agency employee had lost his or her job after told the pentagon all they needed to know about the broken culture at langley the carlton groups mission statement was a testament to their singular focus and consisted of only three simple yet powerful words find fix and finish an exceptional judge of talent reed carlton had studied harvath for some time before making his first approach harvaths background and abilities were a perfect fit for the private intelligence service carlton had begun to build originally a member of seal team harvaths language proficiency and desire for more challenging assignments had gotten him recruited to the storied seal team while with team he caught the eye of the secret service and was asked to come help bolster counterterrorism operations at the white house having been trained to take the fight to the enemy harvath didnt do well in a defensive role with the secret service waiting for bad guys to strike was just not his thing whats more he lacked diplomacya prerequisite when working around politicians as a result harvath pissed a lot of people off some of them very powerful the one person he had managed to keep in his corner was the thenpresident of the united states jack rutledge recognizing that america was faced with a fanatical enemy who refused to play by any rules rutledge had taken a significant step toward tilting the playing field back to americas advantage in short he had set harvath loose the clandestine program the president had established worked exceedingly well harvath did overwhelming damage to the enemies of the united states and continued to do so right up until the end of rutledges second term whereupon a new president entered the oval office with a different approach to dealing with americas enemies direct action political speak for wet work was replaced with engagement diplomatic speak for capitulation and harvath found himself out of a job as many men of his background do he moved into the private sector it wasnt the same and though harvath told himself he was still doing good for his country he was disappointed with the job opportunities it was then that reed carlton had come into his life and had made him an offer he couldnt refuse within twelve months the old man as harvath affectionately referred to carlton had drilled thirty years of tradecraft and hardwon espionage experience into him he had also smoothed out many of his rough edges combined with the deadly skills harvath had acquired as a seal and the exceptional things he had learned in the secret service harvaths training at the hands of carlton vaulted him to the top of a very exclusive food chain he had reached a level many seek but few ever achieve he had become an apex predator the old man made the resources available and turned harvath loose with a simple threeword mandatefind fix finish his job was to identify terrorist leaders track them to a fixed location and then capture or kill them as necessary using any information gleaned from the assignment to plan the next operation the goal was to apply constant pressure on the terrorists and pound them so hard and so relentlessly that they were permanently rocked back on the defensive if not ground into dust in addition to directaction assignments harvath was allowed to stage psychological operations to eat away at the terrorist networks from within sowing doubt fear distrust and paranoia throughout their ranks it was everything the united states government should have been doing but wasnt at least it hadnt been until the carlton group came on board looking at his watch harvath decided mansoor aleem had been marinating long enough it was time to begin the interrogation chapter the best interrogators knew that the most effective tool at their disposal was time left alone long enough a prisoners mind would do half an interrogators work for him if not more no matter what horrors you could conceive of inflicting on a prisoner the prisoner himself would always conceive of much worse that was why harvath liked to leave his interrogation subjects isolated and alone for as long as possible interrogation was a delicate art the key was getting the subject to tell you what you wanted to know not what he thought you wanted to hear a good interrogator operated like a surgeon he wielded a scalpel not a machete only amateurs and the incredibly desperate actually resorted to true torture and true torture was not turning up the airconditioning putting a subject in a stress posture shaking him by his shirtfront or giving him an openhanded slap across the face those were harsh interrogation techniques they were not torture harvath knew the difference he had used harsh interrogation techniques he had also used torture and while he had never taken pleasure in it it wasnt something he had a moral problem with torture was something he had used only as an absolute last resort he loved to hear tv pundits and others cite the geneva and hague conventions putting aside the fact that most of them had never read any of those treaties the key fact that they all missed was that americas islamist enemies were not a party to these agreements whats more the conventions strictly forbade combatants from hiding and attacking from within civilian populations lawful combatants were also required to appear on the battlefield wearing something whether a uniform or even just an armband identifying them as combatantsovergrown beards and highwater pants didnt count the long and short of it was that if one party refused to sign on and follow the rules it couldnt expect any sort of protection from those rules and as far as harvath was concerned those who championed the extension of geneva and hague to islamic terrorists were uninformed at best and apologists for terrorists at worst believing his country to be made up of good reasonable people he preferred to put the terrorist protectors in the former category harvath never allowed himself to underestimate the capabilities or determination of americas enemies he had looked directly into the eyes of some of the most capable warriors islam had dispatched and he saw not only the depth of their conviction but also the depth of their hate for the west and everything it stood for there would be no truce with islam and while there were indeed good decent muslim people around the world there were not enough of them they lacked the collective will and desire to not only stand up to the violence being carried out in their name but to reform the very tenets of their religion that called for that violence this was not how harvath wished the world to be but the world cared little for what he wanted it was what it was harvath had shouldered a herculean burden on behalf of his country so that it might remain free and unmolested though many others were also responsible for the fact that america remained free harvath found particular shame in the fact that it had not remained unmolested attacks on americans and american interests both at home and abroad had been picking up speed for every attack that was thwarted and every terrorist taken off the street ten twenty even thirty more popped up in their place as more attacks had been put in play some had begun getting througheven to american soil a handful of those attacks had been harvaths responsibility to stop he hadnt always been able to do so and while the attacks that had slipped through might have been much worse had harvath not acted people had still been killedlots of people this knowledge followed harvath like a diseased crow sitting on his shoulder the only way to disrupt the enemy and beat them so far back that they couldnt attack was to relentlessly hunt them down like the animals they were and unceasingly take the fight to them that meant the gloves were off it also meant that certain operations had to be kept secret from grandstanding politicians who would sooner bare americas throat before the pack of wolves outside its door than summon the fortitude to do the hard work necessary to ensure americas survival though harvath couldnt pinpoint exactly when it had happened at some point in the last seventyorso years the political class had become completely disconnected from reality it was a malady that struck equally on both sides of the aisle it was evident in every single thing washington dc did from its profligate spending to granting terrorists greater rights and protections than cia and military interrogators harvath knew what a chilling effect the threat of litigation had created throughout the ranks of american interrogators it made little difference that the interrogators had gotten real intelligence that had saved lives only a select few of the decent politicians remaining in washington understood what had to be done and supported it if the rest of the pols though discovered even a fraction of what harvath had done he had no doubt theyd drag him to the public pillory and follow that up with a crucifixion upon the capitol steps with all the media present harvath didnt care very much and he worried about it even less first they would have to catch him then they would have to prove it he had no intention of ever allowing either of those things to happen in fact as harvath opened the weathered barn doors to interrogate his prisoner consequences were the furthest thing from his mind chapter though no longer part of a working farm the barn still retained the musty smell of raw earth and animal dung it was exactly the kind of sensory input a man like mansoor aleem would find offensive harvath made a loud show of closing and locking the wide doors behind him as he entered in the center of the barn the young jihadist was tied to a wooden chair taken from the farmhouse kitchen a hood had been placed over his head before they had pulled away from the accident scene though mansoor had been an unknown up until quite recently it wasnt hard to work up a profile on him in fact by the very nature of what he did it was quite easy to understand how he thought and thereby select the best approach for his interrogation as far as the real world was concerned the young jihadist was a loser he was unremarkable in almost every way with a poor complexion unappealing features and a pair of eyes that bulged just enough to suggest he might have a thyroid condition he was considerably unattractive he was too skinny and therefore unimpressive physically beyond the bulging eyes he fit the cyber jihadihacker mold to a t while he was nothing in the real world in the digital world he could very well be the heat he might woo the women in the chat rooms as if he were don juan incarnate but hed never have the courage to approach a member of the opposite sex in the flesh cybergeeks like mansoor were all about control the control of information it was the only thing they could have power over without it they were impotent when you placed them in a situation where they were devoid of any authority or more precisely devoid of any control it was tremendously unsettling for them they were also completely visual depriving them of the ability to see tipped them offbalance and made them more pliant to interrogation harvath knew that the young man would still be in shock over what had happened in the car that shock would only have been compounded since he had been taken prisoner and kept in the dark he had been stripped down to his underwear and was shivering in the nighttime cold of the barn harvath walked over and stood just behind the mans left shoulder he knew mansoor had heard him enter and he didnt doubt the man could sense his presence directly behind him keeping an eye on his watch he allowed several minutes to pass adding to the mans discomfort without warning harvath drew his hand back and slapped the jihadist hard in the side of his hooded head to make sure he was psychologically offbalance and hadnt manufactured some semblance of resistance or bravado it was important for the jihadist to understand that he was absolutely helpless harvath stepped back and waited a full three minutes before speaking when he broke the silence he was explicit let me explain to you what is going on he said the only reason youre alive is that until now i have let you live i can very easily decide to let you die the choice is one hundred percent mine the people i work with couldnt care less what happens to you everything that happens from this point forward will depend on whether you cooperate with me do you understand mansoor aleem nodded good replied harvath i also want you to understand this we know everything and i mean everything we know who you are we know why you are here we know all of it if you lie to me even once i am going to kill you do you understand that once again mansoor nodded reaching forward harvath ripped off the mans hood as his eyes were adjusting harvath tore the piece of duct tape from his mouth tell me why you are here demanded harvath im cold he said his teeth chattering answer my question and i may be able to find you a blanket mansoor tried to lick his lips but he had trouble creating saliva i need something to drink may i have some water youre not going to get anything until you answer my questions said harvath raising his voice why are you here i dont know harvath withdrew his taser activated the laser and pointed it at him the jihadist flinched and turned his head away anticipating another painful jolt of electricity i dont know he repeated youre lying to me mansoor said harvath it people harbored a collective fear of anything that would impair their computer skills it was almost percent universal threatening their eyes their hands or the ability of their brains to function was very powerful maybe instead of killing you i should hit you with so many jolts of electricity that we take that fortygig brain of yours down to two kilobytes how about that they sent me a ticket thats all i know he pleaded who sent it to you friends of my uncle your uncle aazim demanded harvath mansoor nodded and dropped his gaze to the floor and why would they do that when the young man didnt respond harvath put the laser dot on the floor where he knew mansoor could see it and then traced it up his leg to the yellow stain on his underwear why because he had been killed mansoor responded as he raised his eyes to lock them on harvath they brought me here to protect me harvath turned off the laser and tucked the taser back into his coat pocket they didnt bring you here to protect you mansoor they brought you here to kill you just like they killed your uncle the young man didnt know how to respond he was shocked he looked away a full minute passed finally he said i dont believe you i dont care what you believe im telling you the truth harvath wasnt telling the truth but that made little difference if he could convince mansoor the uppsala cell had brought him here to execute him he might be willing to cooperate you think about that for a little bit said harvath as he began to replace the hood over the mans head what are you doing the jihadist implored his teeth still chattering his lips azure harvath didnt reply once the hood was in place he walked over to the doors unlocked them and let himself out chapter hermosa beach california w hat do you think youre doing luke ralston asked as he watched larry salomon reach for the cordless telephone on the kitchen counter leaving a message for my office replied the film producer ralston shook his head no calls no emails nothing he said sternly as he poured a mug of coffee and motioned for his friend to sit down they had driven south of la to the quiet coastal community of hermosa beach ralston had steered clear of the freeways and major arteries in an effort to avoid traffic cameras he had also disassembled his cell phone so no cellular print could be made of his progress or direction he didnt need to worry about salomons phone as it had been left behind at the house in coldwater canyon ralston knew he needed to get them someplace safe it had to be somewhere they could lie low and figure out what their next move was going to be going to ralstons apartment was out of the question sooner or later it would be crawling with police the same went for any of the properties salomon owned in palm springs or up near santa barbara for all intents and purposes they needed to completely drop off the grid and for that to happen they were going to need some help at just after three in the morning they pulled into the driveway of a modest stucco house with a spanish tile roof two blocks back from the ocean it belonged to an old friend of ralstons named hank mcbride hank was a former navy seal in his late sixties who dabbled in a wide field of endeavors including technical consulting in hollywood though he had yet to work on any of salomons movies despite their age difference ralston and hank mcbride had developed a good friendship and shared many of the same friends within the small tightly knit special operations community how long before we see it on the news said hank who had the tv near the kitchen table turned on but muted ralston had just come back inside after having parked salomons wagoneer in the garage and covered it with a tarp if i had to guess the window on this id say probably not for a few more hours he replied the graze on the side of his head had been easily covered with a bandaid but it was a serious reminder of how close he had come to being killed salomon sat down and accepted the mug of coffee if i dont get the studios publicist working on this its going to be a nightmare just let me make one call so she can get ahead of it once again ralston shook his head this already is a nightmare larry a gradea shitstorm i know i could be tainted by this forever look at what happened to phil spector and thered been only one body in his house ive got salomons voice trailed off as he did the math six bodies if you count whats left of the one outside who you apparently parked on hank let out a low whistle six thats pretty good only four of them were bad guys clarified ralston the other two worked with larry speaking of which salomon suddenly realized something the hard drives damn it we forgot to get them out of the house what hard drives from the computers in the office ralston needed him to slow down lets take things one step at a time first i want to know about the two men who were killed jeremy and chip said salomon who were they they were working on a film project with me you said it was a documentary asked ralston the movie producer nodded but didnt elaborate why was everything set up in your office at home why werent you working at the studio because this was a private project ralstons antennae went up private yeah said the producer somewhat absentmindedly as he stared into his coffee cup personal larry were pretty good friends wouldnt you say salomon nodded so why dont you come clean and tell me what youve been up to lets start with who jeremy and chip are the producer took a sip of coffee and set the mug back on the table he was still very upset they were friends of mine chip is a blogger and political activist and jeremy is or i guess i should be using the past tense jeremy was a film student who had teamed up with chip to make a short film a short film about what endowments ralston wasnt sure he had heard that correctly as in financial endowments like at universities salomon nodded not exactly the type of summer blockbuster youre known for but everyone in hollywood has their pet projects i guess what i dont understand is why you were working on this out of your house hank mcbride looked away from the tv and over his shoulder at salomon short film isnt code for porn is it ralston held up his hand at the man im just saying replied hank as he went back to monitoring the television something doesnt sound right you dont get a visit from a wet work team for making documentaries and you probably dont get it for making porn either argued ralston you do if the russians are involved somehow countered hank he had a point turning his attention back to salomon he said lets back all the way up is there any reason someone would want to kill you the producer shrugged thats not a no larry the film weve been making might not be too popular salomon responded do you think its something worth killing over maybe ralston was taken aback then we really do need to start from the beginning whats the film called salomon mumbled his response and ralston had to ask him to repeat it well endowed he said i was right said hank without turning away from the tv making skin flicks do you mind asked ralston hank shrugged and went back to clicking through the muted channels searching for any stories about what had happened at the producers home refocusing on salomon ralston said was this project your idea or did somebody bring it to you its a long story well it doesnt look like youre going to be going anywhere for a while said hank as he stopped on a channel that was streaming helicopter footage from above a hilly wooded area your house is in coldwater canyon right yes said salomon then id say the window for when your story would make the news just got slammed shut chapter realizing he wasnt going to be going back to bed hank mcbride disengaged from the tv and offered to cook breakfast while his two guests or the two fugitives as he had referred to them until ralston told him to drop it continued their conversation at the table its all very complicated and convoluted said salomon as he held his mug out for ralston to top off its like a shell game the way foundation money gets moved around in fact shell game had been jeremy and chips working title for the project i thought well endowed was a little more provocative and would help the film get more attention sell the sizzle said ralston reflecting on an old advertising adage he had often heard salomon use not the steak precisely documentaries are a tough sell anyway but a documentary about endowments forget it the only way we were going to get people interested was to sex it up ralston had his reservations about whether a pithy double entendre would make much of a difference but with the film business you never knew so how did jeremy and chip get on your radar screen was it at a film festival or was one of them a waiter at one of your favorite dinner spots a fatigued yet knowing look crept across salomons face hollywood was packed with wannabe actors wannabe screenwriters and wannabe directors anyone with even a semblance of power who could help get a movie made was under constant assault by those looking to break into the business producers in particular had pitchman horror stories including being wooed while in the dentists chair as well as the mother of all famous stories involving a producer being pitched at a rather sensitive moment in her gynecologists office what difference does it make he was being cagey again and ralston pressed him on it why do you keep holding out on me the producer looked up from his coffee im not holding out on you youre not answering my questions and im beginning to think maybe hank was right maybe you were making porn maybe you ran up a huge drug debt with the russians too and they came to collect im not making porn insisted salomon and you know me i have never touched drugs in my life ralston did know his friend and he didnt believe for a second that salomon was making porn or into drugs but he didnt like having his questions parried larry im going to chalk a lot of your current condition up to my current condition interrupted the producer what are you talking about ralston held his hand up for him to stop what happened tonight would put anyone into shock add to it that this would have been rachaels birthday it is rachaels birthday no it isnt its the anniversary of rachaels birth shes gone larry salomon went off like a flare you think i want you to spell it out like that you think i give a good goddamn about how you see it she wasnt your daughter luke dont you ever forget that the outburst was so intense it froze hank in midscramble over his eggs at the stove ralston motioned for the old seal to bring the bottle of bushmills from next to the fridge as hank placed it on the table and retreated to the stove ralston pulled the cork from the bottle and poured a generous amount into each of the coffee cups he was feeling the effects of everything that had happened as well a little anesthetic would be good for them salomon took a deep drink of his irish coffee and said nothing ralston respected the silence just as he had hours earlier in the producers driveway even hank maintained a respectful distance in the kitchen im sorry the producer eventually said ralston reached out and put his hand on his friends shoulder theres no need to apologize jeremy and chip were good people good filmmakers i think rachael would have liked them and they her she was a wonderful girl larry you have every right to be proud of her the producer smiled taken away for a moment by a thought from a happier time in his life as his attention returned his expression became more serious i met jeremy and chip at a social function if you dont mind my asking said hank as he brought over three plates of food and set them down on the table howd you lose your daughter lets not go there ralston replied trying to protect salomon thats okay looking up at hank the producer said my daughter was murdered during a trip to israel three years ago hank sat his considerable frame down onto a chair im sorry to hear that i hope they caught the fuckers and strung them up salomon shook his head unfortunately they didnt catch them thats the hardest part for me how can anyone move on knowing that person or persons is still out there and probably still committing unspeakable acts how do you even begin to let that wound heal ralston knew that talking about rachael would only end up sinking salomon deeper into depression so he decided to change the subject so you met jeremy and chip at some social event right the filmmaker nodded and scooped up a forkful of eggs thats right i didnt know much about chip before that it turns out that he was a real agent provocateur via his blog sites hed broken a handful of scandals before the mainstream media even realized what was happening and jeremy jeremy was chips protege the two of them were looking to broaden their platform beyond the blogs they saw a potential niche for certain types of documentary films they thought could really do well between them they must have had a hundred different ideas many of which were very topical and actually quite interesting to get started though they had to narrow it down to just one some whistleblower had approached chip with a story for one of his blogs a while back she worked for the ford foundation and had uncovered some unusual activity that she felt should be brought to light what kind of unusual activity asked ralston financial who the money was being funneled to how it was being funneled that kind of thing but before he could go to press with the story the woman disappeared chip received a note allegedly from her saying that she had made it all up why would she do that salomon shook his head nobody knew they figured somebody had gotten to her so what happened chip and jeremy kept after the story the more they looked into it the more they uncovered they started thinking it was too big for the blogs thats where the idea for the documentary came in they pieced together a short rough cut and were screening it for different people who they thought might be interested in helping to get it made i just happened to be in the right place at the right time yet you didnt want any of your hollywood pals to know you were working on it thats why you were doing it out of your house mused ralston the producer nodded and took a bite of his bacon before replying with technology these days especially for a documentary that doesnt require any special effects we didnt need to be at the studio we could do it all from home you said you were worried the production was going to ruffle a few feathers i can see ticking off some foundations by exposing what they might have been up to but i cant picture them getting together and putting out a hit on you said ralston that doesnt make sense not until you understand how much money is involved and whats at stake salomon replied one hundred years ago there were only eighteen american taxexempt private foundations today there are more than sixteen thousand the us notforprofit sector is the worlds seventhlargest economy the foundations sit on over five hundred billion untaxed and largely unregulated dollars some of the biggest foundations give away more in a year than some nations gdps the power of a few of these foundations rival that of our own federal government as well as the power of countries like russia france and great britain that was the crux of our filmhow where and why that money and power is being spent we were looking at the foundation world in general but more specifically at a disturbing ideological agenda shared by many of them we wanted to know how many of these large foundations started by successful probusiness americans had turned so antibusiness and in some cases downright antiamerican why were environmental organizations lobbying washington on issues that had nothing to do with the environment why were labor organizations lobbying on issues that had nothing to do with workers why were foundations funding prosocialist and procommunist textbooks and lessons in schools why were others supporting the eugenics movement and the works of josef mengele from auschwitz masquerading under the banner of human genetics the list went on and on the key in each instance was in following the money and the more we followed it the further down the rabbit hole we went what we discovered was that beginning in the s radical elements inside the united states had recognized that there were these huge piles of money just sitting inside multiple large foundations and endowments all across the country these big government collectivists globalists socialists and communists realized that if they could get into positions of power say on the boards of directors at the foundations or the endowments they could steer the money any way they wanted and that was exactly what they did so what youre saying replied ralston is that they used the money to buy influence not only to buy influence the producer continued but to develop and push entire agendas it was like having a tray of financial syringes any cause that met their radical agenda received huge injections of cash any causes that ran counter to their agenda received huge injections of poison and found themselves beset by opposition groups with bottomless wells of support they used their money to cozy up to politicians influence public policy and elect their own candidates but how could they get away with that asked ralston how would nobody raise a fuss or try to expose them salomon shook his head this isnt just a mountain of hush money were talking about its a whole range of mountains this kind of power and influence can purchase a lot of silence and their boards just rubberstamp anything they do they dont need a rubber stamp replied the producer when the boards have all been stacked with members who see the world through exactly the same prism if the people who had started many of these foundations were alive today theyd be stunned to discover what was going on ralston didnt doubt it but so what the more you talk larry the less i think this has anything to do with your documentary i think we ought to be looking at other possibilities youre wrong replied salomon am i asked ralston so lots of foundations and endowments have drifted from their original intent big deal your documentary might bring some unwanted attention to some in that industry but as long as theyre not breaking any laws i dont see how anybody is really going to care thats what i thought too until i saw what chip and jeremy had begun to dig up which was what the foundations and the endowments need to make a return on their principal so they invest in different vehicles often times those vehicles are hedge funds we discovered that a small group the most radical invested with one hedge fund in particular its called the standing fund and is managed by james standing the billionaire the vehemently antiamerican billionaire salomon clarified so what so we discovered that there were some things even the most radical foundations and endowments were afraid to be tied to what they werent afraid to do though was to use standing as a cutout each of them agreed to allow standing to retain part of their investment return in order to fund something they referred to as project green ramp and whats project green ramp salomon looked ralston directly in the eyes and stated an intricate plan to completely collapse the united states of america chapter sweden h arvath was on his way out of the farmhouse with a blanket and a bottle of water when his cell phone rang go ahead he said answering the call and setting the items down weve got a fix on the mobile phone phoenix three contacted from the accident site said reed carlton phoenix three was the code name that had been given to sean chase for the operation harvath was phoenix one and riley turner was phoenix two weve got an address asked harvath thats affirmative said the old man ill pass it off to you on the back channel the back channel was a reference to the secure network the carlton group used to communicate and pass information to each other roger that said harvath using the code name they had created for mansoor based on his initials the old man asked any progress with massachusetts not yet replied harvath but i think hell be warming up to us soon good i want this op wrapped up and everyone out of there as soon as possible understood roger that replied harvath he and carlton spoke at length about how long to give phoenix three before launching their takedown of the uppsala cell they both understood that the longer chase was in their midst the more he might be able to learn they also understood that the longer he stayed the greater the odds were that he might be discovered if he was theyd kill him on the spot the call ended harvath gathered up the blanket and the water bottle and headed outside anything he asked as he approached the operative standing guard at the barn praying crying anything knowing how their prisoner had spent the time since harvath had been gone would affect how he decided to continue the interrogation nothing replied the operative an excia man named andy bachmann he was in his late fifties and built like a drill instructor the old man had suggested him for this operation as theyd known each other in the old days back at langley and bachmann had worked in sweden before not a sound mansoor aleem might be tougher than harvath had thought nodding he walked past bachmann unlocked the barn door and jerked it wide he stood there with the door open for several seconds to encourage the flow of cold air the prisoner didnt move considering how hed been shivering there was no way that mansoor could have fallen asleep had he slipped into unconsciousness that would be a world record he hadnt been exposed to the cold that long for a moment harvath wondered if he was being played time to wake up mansoor he said as he walked up to the man and snatched off his hood there was no reaction the mans head was bent forward his chin resting on his chest harvath grabbed a fistful of hair and tilted his head back so he could look at his face he slapped him but the man didnt even flinch he wasnt conscious harvath opened one of his eyelids the eye failed to dilate he placed two fingers against the mans carotid and felt for a pulse nothing fuck said harvath as he then yelled for the operative outside andy andy damn it bachmann threw open the door and charged inside his mp drawn from beneath his coat what is it he said scanning the barn as he tried to figure out what was happening get riley harvath ordered now tell her mansoor has flatlined as a medical student and winter x games athlete turner had been one of the first recruits into a covert department of defense program known as the athena project its goal was to provide women with the same training male delta force operatives received making it possible to send them into the field alone on allfemale teams or in various mixed assignments such as harvaths sweden op the bad guys could often see the men coming but rarely if ever suspected women he had requested riley now a trauma surgeon personally having worked with her before he knew she was exceedingly capable there were also personal reasons he wanted her along but those were far from his mind right now as bachmann took out his radio to raise riley harvath cut his prisoner loose and laid him on the floor harvath had killed plenty of people in his career but theyd all been bad guys who had deserved to die harvath had killed each of them intentionally mansoor aleem was definitely a bad guy but harvath didnt want him dead and he definitely didnt want it to happen because he had screwed up with him on the floor harvath immediately began cpr the new guidelines called for doubling the number of chest compressions and not worrying about blowing air into the victims airway dont you die on me asshole he said as he rapidly compressed the mans chest dont you die what happened riley shouted as she ran into the barn and saw harvath on the floor performing cpr ive got no idea said harvath as he kept focused on his prisoner when i came back in he didnt have a pulse dont bs me she replied as she rushed to his side i cant help him if i dont know what happened i just told you i dont know what happened did you hit him no damn it harvath snapped if you struck him she said i need to know exactly where and with how much force for gods sake riley i didnt touch him fine she said reaching out to check mansoors pulse stop the compressions for a second harvath did as he was told and watched as she checked for a pulse anything riley shook her head picking up where harvath had left off she continued chest compressions with quick swift pumps were going to need to get him to a hospital the hell we are replied harvath we do that and were going to have an international incident on our hands scot she said as she continued the compressions hes dead hypothermia hypothermia heart attack what difference does it make harvath didnt respond if its hypothermia riley added that could work in our favor youre not dead till youre warm and dead but i dont have the kind of equipment we need to revive him harvath looked at the bag she had run in with and had tossed on the floor what about adrenaline can you use a syringe and pump it straight into his heart intracardial injection whatever you call it can you do that asked harvath sure she replied but you need to defibrillate the patient as well we dont have a defibrillator prep the adrenaline said harvath as he waved bachmann over when the excia operative neared harvath told him to take over for riley and keep giving mansoor chest compressions what are you going to do asked riley dont worry just hurry up and get that syringe ready as riley opened her bag and prepped the adrenaline harvath drew his taser and pulled out its cartridge a taser wont give him the kind of jolt he needs theyre not built that way she said harvath didnt care hed seen people take punches to the chest and have their hearts restart if he could put enough juice in mansoors body and cause it to convulse violently enough maybe it would work grabbing the taser from the holster on bachmanns belt he removed its cartridge as well when riley had the syringe ready she nodded and harvath told bachmann to stop the compressions and stand back looking at riley he said do it with no time to swab the mans chest with an alcohol pad she felt for the fourth intercostal space and pushed the needle through tissue and into his heart depressing the plunger she injected the contents of the syringe into the young mans ventricle when she was finished she withdrew the needle and stood back this wont work it has to work said harvath as he kneeled over the body riley pointed to where defibrillator paddles would normally be placed and then stood back here we go said harvath indicating that he was ready when riley nodded harvath counted to three and pulled both the tasers triggers at once chapter the young muslims body went rigid his head rolled back and his back arched off the floor harvath withdrew the tasers and rocked back on his heels as mansoors body landed with a thud on the dirtcovered barn floor riley reached forward and placed two fingers on his neck to see if he had a pulse anything riley shook her head scot this is not going to work harvath ignored her stand back he said scot stand back he repeated when she was out of the way harvath reapplied the tasers gave the warning he was about to deploy another charge and then pulled the triggers the prisoners body went stiff once more and then came to rest on the floor check his pulse harvath said riley did as he asked feeling nothing she shook her head and scooted back damn it cursed harvath everybody back up im going to hit him again riley and bachmann did as they were told placing the tasers against mansoors left and right chest walls harvath applied yet another stun drive of electricity as had happened each time previously the young mans body convulsed and then dropped back to the dusty barn floor hes gone said bachmann he doesnt get to choose when he goes snapped harvath im not done with him without any warning this time harvath repositioned the tasers and pulled the triggers mansoors body stiffened and then dropped back down check him again he said riley moved forward and reached out her fingers nothing fuck harvath yelled abandoning the young mans right and left chest walls harvath placed both tasers directly over mansoors heart and pulled the triggers when the body fell back to the ground he did it again and then again once more scot bachmann said but harvath ignored him angry at the prisoner and even more angry with himself harvath pulled the triggers two more times riley said something but harvath didnt listen to her either she put her hand on his shoulder but he shrugged it off it wasnt until she grabbed his arm just above his triceps in a viselike pinch that she broke the spell son of a he began as he turned his anger toward riley he twitched she said he what riley shoved harvath aside and laid her fingers on mansoors carotid she then leaned her ear over his mouth i think i can feel a breath tilting the prisoners head back she pinched his nose placed a cpr barrier over his mouth and delivered a breath of air she waited for several seconds and then repeated the process two more times until he began breathing on his own is he alive asked harvath barely replied riley we need to get him warm and get an iv started bachmann wrapped mansoor with the blanket harvath had brought with him and then went to the farmhouse to gather more harvath handed riley the items she requested from her medical bag and then rigged up a makeshift iv stand once she had the fluids running into the young muslims arm harvath asked how long until hes ready to be interrogated again riley looked up at him he couldnt tell if what he was seeing on her face was admiration or disgust he figured it was probably a mixture of both youve got to be one of the luckiest people ive ever met dont push it harvath had often said it was better to be lucky than good but he didnt offer that sentiment to her i need to know how soon i can start asking him questions again riley shook her head first hes got to regain consciousness how long harvath insisted its indefinite at this point he probably has some sort of underlying heart condition i think thats why he coded he could also have brain damage now hes going to need some tests tests we cant conduct where were supposed to be going were going to need access to a friendly hospital harvath knew what she meant by a friendly hospital they had planned for the possibility that mansoor might get injured in the car crash whether that happened or not he was going to be drugged up and flown out of sweden on a sentinel medevac jet all the paperwork was in order and an impeccable passport had been created for him theyd be portraying him as the son of a wealthy arab whod had a stroke and was being flown back to the uae for emergency medical treatment not even the most rigorous of authorities would have any reason to suspect the party and their patient were anything other than who they said they were by the time mansoor awoke from his druginduced stupor the flight plan would have been refiled for jordan and he would find himself in one of the multiple extraordinary rendition black interrogationdetention sites still in operation despite the us governments public proclamations to the contrary based on the cyber jihadists enhanced medical needs though they were probably going to have to reevaluate which host countrys site they were going to use carlton and the dod would make the final call the members of the uppsala cell were another matter harvath had decided it would be foolish to put all of his eggs in one basket he wanted mansoor out of the country as quickly as possible he had developed another plan for getting the safe house terrorists out of the country though he still had no idea at the moment how many there were first things first how long until he can be ready for transport asked harvath as he gestured at mansoor riley glanced at her patient and again shook her head at this point i dont even want to try to move him to the farmhouse that said the plane has a lot of the medical equipment hes going to need so as soon as he is ready to be moved i think we should move him getting mansoor to the airfield was another shell game which would be played out via a private ambulance service from stockholm willing to make the drive up to uppsala looking at the man lying on the floor harvath wondered if hed even survive the trip to the airport fortunately that wasnt his problem it was rileys he had other problems the biggest among them was deciding how long to leave sean chase in place and when to take down the uppsala cell with riley now tied up with overseeing mansoor harvath was going to have to shift to his contingency plan he didnt like it but they had all known that it was a possible outcome the team and more important harvath would have to do without her that meant that things were about to get much more dangerous chapter the two brothers who picked chase up at the soccer field did not speak they didnt ask about his medical condition nor did they offer him any food or water they simply drove him to an abandoned garage on the outskirts of uppsala and kept an eye on him while they all waited what they were waiting for chase wasnt exactly sure but he had an idea more than likely the man he had spoken to over the phone the man he assumed was in charge of the cell was checking out his story about the accident when it was time to pray the two men let chase pray alongside them but he stopped when the wound on his head opened up and started bleeding again fairly confident of how the authentic mansoor aleem would behave he made sure to make a real pain in the ass out of himself he lectured his two guards about islamic doctrine and their duty to see to his wellbeing he harangued them so badly that one of the men threatened to kill him eventually he wore them down and one of them left to purchase some items he had asked for the man came back twenty minutes later with energy drinks candy bars and firstaid supplies they allowed chase to use the garages filthy foulsmelling bathroom to clean himself up and tend to his wounds he did the best he could and then came out and choked down some nourishment he hated energy drinks and he wasnt all that big on candy bars but that was the quintessential ithacker diet and it was important that he looked the part right down to the smallest detail as the smallest details often played the biggest part in making or breaking a cover if he had wanted to chase could have taken out both in quick succession there were multiple items lying around the old garage that could have been used as weapons in the bathroom he had found a decent strip of metal that he had folded to about four inches long it was rusting yet had a sharp enough point that it could be used as a shiv he wrapped the handle portion of the weapon with plumbers tape hed found around one of the pipes beneath the sink hed been processing every single nuanced nonverbal cue the two men had been giving off since they had picked him up he knew all too well what he could end up having to do and how far he might have to go and he was getting himself all jacked up over it he had to get it under control taking a look in the mirror he took a deep breath and told himself to relax everything was cool all that nervousness was just his limbic system a student of hagakure hed meditated extensively on death hed done so right before this operation it was the same before every operation death was inevitable he imagined the worst for himself daily whatever was going to happen was going to happen that didnt mean though that he wouldnt take as many of them with him as possible nevertheless he decided to abandon the homemade weapon while he probably could have concealed it in his pocket if it had been discovered it would have created no end of problems for him even the most paranoid of computer geeks wasnt going to be fashioning his own shivs in the gray halflight that spilled in from the dirty glass skylights above chase studied the men whod been charged with babysitting him if he had to he could take them but there was a lot that could go wrong and if something did go wrong he had no doubt either of the men would kill him without hesitation they were of medium height and solidly built their eyes were hard and dark like pieces of flint and told him everything he needed to know about them these men were no strangers to violence despite the mens rough demeanor chase kept up the haughty hacker act and repeatedly asked the men how much longer they were going to have to wait until they could leave the garage when one of the men retrieved a newspaper from the car and tossed it at him chase took a look at it and threw it right back at the man saying in arabic do i look like i read swedish the sooner the men could get rid of him the happier they were going to be two hours later one of the mens mobile phones rang and he listened before saying a few words back and hanging up he then motioned for his colleague to join him at the far end of the garage where they conversed in private chase didnt like it the sudden sequestration made him very apprehensive when the men finally returned he asked them what the call had been about but they wouldnt say he was starting to regret having left his shiv in the bathroom once again he took stock of anything in his immediate surroundings that could be used as a weapon with nothing to do but wait he cracked another energy drink and sipped on it as he put together a plan for which of the two men to kill first and how if he needed to he was running through the clever ways he could dispose of the bodies when there was the bleat of a car horn outside and one of the men went to open the garage door once the door was opened wide enough an anemiclooking volvo rolled inside chase watched as it came to a stop and its engine was turned off seconds passed through the windshield the driver appeared to be on his cell phone when the call was over the man lowered the phone and stepped out of the car he was very large and judging from the way the other two men reacted to him someone of stature within the organization he had a certain presence about him and for a moment chase wondered if he was looking at the cells leader he was a bit too rough around the edges though and chase pegged him as being somewhere in the command structure but not at the very top of the pyramid this was not the kind of man who could blend in and easily remain beneath the radar there was also something about his bearing that chase could not quite place as he approached there was a way he walked that he found interesting he had the bearing of a cop his face was a mix of the most exaggerated of arab features the long hooked nose the darkcircled heavily hooded eyes thin lips and dark weatherbeaten skin his sheer physical size on the other hand made him one of the biggest arabs chase had ever seen salaam alaikum said the man as he approached and kissed chase on both cheeks wa alaikum a salaam replied chase returning the greeting the mans enormous hands gripped chase by the shoulders allah has taken two of our brothers today but you he has spared chase was not sure how to answer was the man testing him i am undoubtedly unworthy of allahs favor he replied the large man smiled may i he asked indicating he wanted to remove the bandage covering the wound on chases head without waiting for permission the man reached out and peeled the bandage back placing his other hand under chases chin he tilted his head back so he could better see the laceration even if chase had wanted to he couldnt have stopped him the man was that strong apparently satisfied he released his chin and gently put the bandage back in place sit down the man said pointing to a crate nearby chase did as he was told the man was speaking to him in english now it wasnt perfect but it was quite good he told the other two men in arabic to wait outside once they had exited the garage he turned his attention back to chase tell me about the accident he said chase was definitely being tested someone ran us off the road he made sure there was just enough british in his accent intentionally run off chase shrugged what did the car look like asked the man it was blue or gray i cant really remember you didnt see it not until it was too late nafees and i were talking the man studied him talking about what chase was silent for a moment finally he replied about my uncle and what exactly about your uncle were you talking about i wanted to know what had happened to him how he had died i wanted to know who killed him i wanted to know why what did nafees tell you the man asked he told me the same thing he had at the airport he told me to wait until we arrived in uppsala and all would be revealed and what did waqar say during your drive not much except that i ask too many questions the big man smiled but as quickly as the smile crossed his face it disappeared how did they die chase had been trained by the best he knew the man was probing him the mantra that was drummed into every intelligence operatives head was to deny deny deny and launch counteraccusations the big man had yet to accuse him of anything directly but the intimations were clear and he needed to go on the offensive how do you think they died i told you we were in a car accident you dont believe me why dont you go take a look at it yourself theres blood all over nafees was thrown halfway through the windshield but waqar was still wearing his seat belt said the man and the man shrugged and said nothing i dont even know who you are said chase i am sabah your name could be mickey mouse for all i care mate how do i know you are not a cop the big man smiled again i am not a police officer at least not anymore well thats not very reassuring waqar and nafees were friends of my uncle i dont know the rest of you at all yet you accepted the plane ticket and came when we asked i came when waqar and nafees asked clarified chase sabah nodded understood i only have one more question only one what happened to the other car what other car asked chase the exasperated smartass programmer tone fully apparent in his voice the one that ran you off the road said sabah i was in the backseat i didnt see where it went it didnt stop the driver didnt offer you aid i told you i hit my head sabah smiled you told me no such thing well whoever i talked to on waqars phone i told him so you were knocked unconscious when you awoke the other car that ran you off the road was not there is this correct the more you talk the more im convinced youre a cop said chase youre not answering my question i must have blacked out because the last thing i remember is us rushing headlong into a tree the next thing i remember was the blood pouring from my head and finding waqar and nafees both dead yet you had the presence of mind to take waqars cell phone and call us replied sabah who else would i call i dont know anyone in this country how did you know to use waqars phone to call us thats a serious question sabah nodded and chase rolled his eyes because chase said thankful theyd had the men under surveillance at the airport waqar placed a call when we were walking to his car after i got off the plane i assume he was calling to tell you i had arrived what did you do with waqars cell phone after you made the call i did exactly as i was told chase removed his shoe pulled out the two sim cards and handed them to sabah just before the village with the soccer pitch there was a small lake i took the phones apart and threw the pieces into the water anything else you want to ask me sabah smiled and placed his large hand on the young mans shoulder no i have no more questions he said all that matters is that allah has delivered you safely to us as sabah motioned to his car it was obvious to chase that the man didnt trust him at all he was beginning to think that leaving the shiv behind had been a very bad idea chapter southern california ralston wanted to know all about the plot salomon thought he had uncovered to collapse the united states give me the details on project green ramp to understand it said the producer you have to grasp its underlying principle it actually boils down to a simple question if we were in a house and i thought it was burning but you didnt would it be okay for me to lie or even use force to get you out of the house hell no why not what if youre wrong salomon smiled bingo what do you mean bingo individualism in america is hardwired into our dna we want to make our own decisions even if it means making mistakes we dont want other people telling us what to do theres a group of people though who believe that you and i are too stupid to make our own decisions and that they should do it for us despite america being the greatest force for good in the history of the world they see it as greedy and evil theyve been tearing it apart bit by bit for decades and have become desperate to finish the job they believe they can and should use any means necessary to get across the goal line no matter what the cost the ends justify the means said ralston exactly salomon replied and getting across the goal line means collapsing the united states according to james standing the united states is the only remaining obstacle to a just and stable world ralston shook his head thats beyond insane so is sending a russian wet work team to kill three filmmakers standing is a fullon sociopath nothing about him makes sense despite being born and raised jewish hes a rabid antisemite despite being a billionaire many times over hes a vehement anticapitalist despite having benefitted greatly from everything america has done to empower the individual he is a vocal proponent of social engineering and the redistribution of wealth one of the best descriptions of him i ever heard was that he was a malignant messianic narcissist who left unchecked would bring about horrors beyond those performed by hitler stalin mao or pol pot so whos keeping a check on him asked ralston nobody come on salomon held his right hand up and rubbed his thumb and forefinger together money may not be able to buy happiness but it can buy almost anything else even an entire political system ralston looked at him now whos insane i heard a comedian make a pretty good point recently he said that all members of congress should be required to wear nascar uniforms you know the kind with the patches that way wed know who was sponsoring each of them i think he was kidding and wed never be able to get them to do it but its a great idea and would wake people up in this country instantly and standing would be seen as the root of all evil thats hard to believe he has a very clear vision as to what he wants to have happen to america along with a handful of leaders of other key foundations he developed a very simple plan to bring it about he started by using his wealth to coopt anyone who could have any impact on popular culture or public opinion newspapers actors journalists publishers politicians business people unionsyou name it the idea was to be able to control the media as well as any other voices americans trusted they knew they needed to change the way americans saw themselves its ideological subversion plain and simple to get it to take hold though they needed to begin planting this new way of thinking in the most fertile minds they could get a hold of which means kids said ralston precisely salomon replied thats why standing and the foundations aligned with him have been such heavy contributors to educational endowments its the golden rule he who controls the gold controls the rules or in this case the curricula but it wasnt enough to simply plant this new ideology for it to blossom it had to grow without being challenged hence the disappearance of civics classes and the portrayal of american history through the lens of imperialism and aggression instead of social studies children were taught studies in social justice with america repeatedly shown as the bad guy how long has this been going on ralston broke in decades replied salomon the students subjected to standings propaganda are now adults theyre everywhere you lookbusiness the media government even teaching successive generations of kids in our schools couldnt they be deprogrammed asked ralston im sure itd be a monumental task but the movie producer shook his head theyre completely immune to anything that deviates from their ideological perception of reality and what they have been taught is the real truth the lens they look through life at has forever been altered its both terrifying and brilliant in its totality ralston nodded it was terrifying on top of indoctrinating kids said salomon standing wanted to get as many people dependent upon the government as possible government handouts even for corporations are like heroin most people once theyre hooked remain hooked and dont even realize it they rationalize that theyre entitled to the handouts and the politicians are just as addicted except theyre addicted to power and to increase their power they need to keep doling out more and more handouts it doesnt matter if we cant afford the handouts theyll keep borrowing and printing money running the country deeper into debt in order to keep the heroin flowing its a vicious selfperpetuating cycle in fact one of the most apropos political observations i have ever read is that a democracy can exist only until the voters discover that they can vote themselves largesse from the public treasury from the moment that realization takes hold history shows that the majority of the people will always vote for the candidate promising the most goodies from the public treasury history also shows us that once a democracy goes down this road things never end well each and every single time the democracy collapses it always happens it collapses over loose fiscal policy and democracy is always followed by dictatorship and guess what the dictator promises utopia ralston replied salomon shook his head no when democracy collapses fear violence and uncertainty fill the void in essence its chaos and thats what the dictator preys upon the people are so terrified that they will agree to trade anything even the most precious possession they havetheir libertyin exchange for a return to order but when order is restored freedom is never seen by those citizens again so thats standings goal said ralston but how does he intend to get there how the hell could he force america to collapse thats the tricky part salomon replied historically when democracies have collapsed its because they were already unstable to begin with like us then some sort of crisis or a group of crises come together in such a way that they push the democracy over the brink they can come in any form often its some sort of black swan event like the earthquake and tsunami that hit japan stated ralston thats a perfect example the attacks were another basically a black swan is something that no one would have ever expected to materialize which ends up causing massive unforeseen consequences and after the fact is rationalized as something everyone should have seen coming so green ramp is about choreographing a black swan event thats what we think salomon replied ralston shook his head standing manipulates america right up onto the ledge and then shoves he ought to be tried for treason now you know why i wanted to make this film he needs to be exposed what he needs is to be swinging from the end of a rope thats the price you pay for treason not anymore salomon said not in todays america we dont try people for treason much less put them to death for it its looked upon as an archaic reaction to what should be handled if at all as a criminal matter if we began hanging traitors wed lose a good many of our politicians business and union leaders even teachers considering some of the crimes that had been committed in the past twenty years in america ralston didnt exactly think that would be a bad thing do you have any idea what kind of black swan event they were looking at creating unfortunately no its not the kind of thing they put on their website and it might not be just one black swan it could be a whole wedge of them but itll probably have something to do with the economy right some sort of new financial crisis the film producer shrugged considering his expertise that makes sense but there are other possibilities hes stirred revolutions in other countries by creating crises of confidence in government hell rig an election and then leak that the election was rigged but even that might be too pedestrian when it comes to what he has planned for the united states with his money and demented worldview anything is possible remember no matter what james standing feels that the ends justify the means do you have any idea exactly what his ends are what is it he has in mind some sort of global governance asked ralston standing is a globalist all right replied salomon and he definitely believes he can help usher in some sort of utopia but theres one final step that would have to be undertaken and thats the most frightening thing of all about him what is it remember what i said about him being worse than hitler stalin mao or pol pot if left unchecked ralston nodded we found an interview he gave on the sidelines of the economic forum in davos switzerland it was some small european paper and maybe he didnt think it would get any pickup but he allowed his proverbial mask to slip in the twentieth century he said the world saw the loss of about million people due to war genocide and disaster according to him the only way mankind can survive the twentyfirst century is if the world population is cut by at least five billion and that will only happen if every industrialized nation is forced into collapse starting with the united states chapter new york city j ulia winston crossed her legs in just such a way that james standing couldnt help but wonder if she was doing it purposely for him it wouldnt have been the first time a female reporter had done that it didnt make any difference that he was old enough to be her grandfather henry kissinger had been wrong power wasnt the ultimate aphrodisiac money and power were and standing had more than most could even imagine winston was wearing an aline skirt the kind that clung tightly to her upper thighs and showed off her tiny waist she wore an inexpensive yet chic collared shirt probably from brooks brothers or god forbid banana republic her jewelry consisted of what appeared to be a small pair of diamond stud earrings but that might have been fake the only place she seemed to have spent any real money was on her shoes smart girl thought standing while most men wouldnt have made it past her tits any of the women in the field she was competing with would have checked out her shoes the difference between bitch and classy bitch with women always came down to the shoes standing did in fact judge women on their looks and how they dressed but the makeorbreak for him was in the brains department he didnt have time for unintelligent people he was too busy and life was too short though new york city was filled with gorgeous women there were few who could keep up with him intellectually after his penis there was no greater erogenous zone than his brain if a woman couldnt stimulate both he wasnt interested the attractive financial times journalist sitting across from him though seemed more than capable of doing both so he decided to take the provocative way in which she had crossed her legs as just that lets talk currencies winston said as she chewed the top of her pencil and flipped through the pages of the steno pad balanced expertly atop her stockinged knee they were seated on lowslung couches in the plush sitting area of his office in midtown manhattan floortoceiling windows offered a dramatic view of the empire state building and the sheets of polished marble that covered the floors as well as the walls gave one the feeling that they had stepped inside some sort of modern pantheon it was an aura of grandeur and it had been created entirely on purpose standing studied the woman who used pencils anymore he wondered he liked it it was a nice touch that made her stand out made her different he liked different he also liked how she chewed on the eraser he was beginning to wonder more and more if she was entertaining the thought of going to bed with him while mens sexual energy seemed to ebb as they got older at seventyeight standings had increased he had no idea what those overpriced doctors and highend nutritionists were crushing up into his socalled vitamin shakes but he didnt care hell he had half a mind to reverseengineer the recipe and put it on the market himself itd be like fusing red bull and viagra both multibilliondollar products julia winston raised her eyebrows waiting for a response im sorry my dear said standing his mind had drifted only making money could have taken his mind off the prospect of bedding such an incredibly attractive woman what was it you were asking the woman repeated herself picking up on your remarks about social justice and social responsibility we talked about your efforts to get affordable medications to aids patients in africa we also discussed your belief that america should be just as diligent in providing medical care for everyone in this nation regardless of immigration status you have described housing health care employment and fair wages as basic human rights exactly said standing more focused now which brings me to currencies particularly the us dollar recently you said you wanted to see a managed decline of the dollar can you expound upon that remark certainly the dollar due to the nations huge and rapidly expanding deficit is not a very strong currency and it has only grown weaker normally in times of crisis we see flights to safety investors seeking safe havens have historically turned to the us dollar among other things the young journalist interrupted standing smiled and nodded of course but its important to point out that investors no longer consider the dollar a safe haven they are fleeing to hard assets commodities this demonstrates both a lack of confidence in the dollar as well as a lack of confidence in currencies overall the system doesnt work it is broken and needs to be fundamentally transformed the worldwide distribution of wealth is completely out of balancea select few get richer while everyone else gets poorer the only way to correct this is with a new currency system so if the dollar is no longer the worlds reserve currency winston asked what is something like oil bought and sold in in the beginning we would use a basket of currencies special drawing rights or sdrs as theyre known those would give you the makings of a new currency system and i would add that the united states reluctance to consider this move only supports what the rest of the world already knows said standing which is what that runaway capitalism is a failure some would say that the true failure is too much government regulation too much intervention in the markets if you unshackle business you actually have greater growth that growth creates a rising tide that lifts all boats standing winked at winston tell that to the clients of mr bernie madoff the financial reporter made sure she had his remark verbatim as she wrote the billionaire continued the use of the sdrs could greatly benefit the united states but there is an innate parochialism that exists in america a xenophobia that has been holding this country back for decades we live in a global society now communications are global corporations are global trade is global tourism is global why not currency the woman looked up at him from her pad some would say that a global currency would put the world just one step away from a global government the billionaire shrugged whos to say thats a bad thing you me i think the american people for starters would say its a bad thing maybe even a very bad thing he leaned forward ill tell you a secret as long as youll agree its off the record julia winston nodded the american people arent that bright the entire nation is made up largely of idiots as long as they have their mcdonalds and their sitcom television they really dont care what happens politically the reporter was at a loss for how to respond so back to a global currency standing said as he leaned back in his chair and signaled that they were on the record again america can no longer sit on the couch resting on its status quo we have always led the world not lagged behind america needs to progress into the future it cannot stand still or heaven forbid fall behind the other nations of the world in the short run there will be difficulties but what matters is the long run and what if america says no asked the woman having regained some of her composure whats the downside look like standing considered his response for a moment and then said the usa will become a nothing a nobody we need to realize that the good old days are not ahead of america anymore they are behind us and they will continue to be unless the united states climbs on board with the rest of the world a new system has to be created part of that system involves shedding our ridiculous reliance on the dollar americas economy is pulling the rest of the world down you dont believe that the us economy is showing signs of recovery standing laughed who told you that a little elf in a little hollow tree if you see him again you should make sure to ask for a unicorn ride winston smiled uncomfortably i will tell you this offered the billionaire america must stop seeing itself as the center of the universe it is not only unhealthy its unrealistic you talked about a rising tide what does a rising tide do to people who have no boats it drowns them so you no longer have confidence in america i have confidence that the american model as we understand it no longer works and when something doesnt work what are your choices you can either sit and wring your hands or you can help guide people to something better and whats better than america standing looked at his watch excellent question he said with a smile and one im afraid we will have to save for another time perhaps we can have dinner and discuss it the billionaire didnt wait for the reporter to reply as he stood the large doors on the other side of the office opened and standings assistant walked in to show julia winston out it has been an absolute pleasure speaking with you my dear ill make sure my publicist sends you a photo for your piece good the woman thanked him and shook his hand standing watched her leave he enjoyed the way her hips moved beneath the tight skirt and the sound of her expensive shoes clicking across his marble floor after escorting winston to the elevator his assistant returned i assume youd like me to set up a followup the financier had removed his suit coat and sat down behind his expansive desk yes do it for tonight tonight the assistant said consulting his ipad tonight you have a cocktail reception for donors to the united nations infinitum project its from seven oclock to nine fine replied standing set dinner up afterward something expensive but not too a la mode i dont want to be the oldest person in the room le bernardin or san pietro yes sir anything else the billionaire wished he could ask him if hed received any word on california but his assistant knew nothing about what was transpiring out there standing was very careful about keeping things compartmentalized no he replied nothing else very good replied the assistant as he backed out of the office the financier waited until he heard the door click shut and then removed the encrypted blackberry from his desk he had waited long enough he should have heard something by now he was about to dial when one of the multiple flatscreen televisions covering the various cable networks cut to footage of a fancy gated driveway he searched for the remote so he could turn up the sound one by one all of the other networks started running similar footage including aerial shots so its done standing thought to himself good he now had something very much worth celebrating tonight a thorn had been removed from his paw the california problem had been taken care of or had it turning up the volume of the tv tuned to cnbc he caught the closing remarks of a local reporter throwing back to the studio in new york at this point she stated authorities have no idea where larry salomon is or what happened to the man seen accompanying him all that is known and again this is still unofficial at this point is that hollywood movie mogul lawrence salomon is noti repeat apparently notamong the dead back to you in new york chapter thames house mi headquarters london robert ashford sensed his phone was going to ring before it actually did it wasnt any grand feat of clairvoyance on his part though hed been expecting the call most of the day in fact he should have been the one initiating it considering how the los angeles operation appeared to have gone sideways he probably also should have taken the day off to monitor things from a secure location but that was exactly why he had come in to work on the remote chance that things went bad in la he needed to be able to maintain as much plausible deniability as possible dismissing his staff from around the small conference table the barrelchested man in his early sixties with steelgray hair and a flat broad nose unwound the earbuds from around his cell phone he was one of the deans of british intelligence and those who worked under ashford were used to his secretive and sometimes enigmatic nature they saw him as old school an espionage legend who had cut his teeth in the cold war and who continued to play his cards very close to his vest from his perfectly knotted tie neatly manicured nails and gleaming cufflinks to the mirrorfine polish of his shoes and knifelike creases in his trousers he cut the gallant figure of an aging british gentleman he had been with britains domestic intelligence service for more than thirty years mi was responsible for national security counterterrorism and counterespionage within the united kingdom it was similar to americas fbi and was often confused with its sister organization mi which was like the american cia ashfords staff also knew that he had personal relationships with many in the royal family as well as leading figures in the british business world no sooner had they exited and closed the door to his office than the speculation began about what powerful figure he was most likely speaking to little would they suspect that he wasnt doing any of the talking whats going on robert james standing demanded this was supposed to be a simple undertaking in fact what was that stupid cockney expression you used with me bright and breezy though standing was speaking on the encrypted phone that ashford had provided for him he had been cautioned to speak in code and be as roundabout as possible when discussing things the united kingdom hosted two enormous listening posts that fed emails text messages and cell phone calls into the americans nsa listening program echelon every electronic communication in the united kingdom be it over the internet a cellular network or a telephone line was harvested and a copy kept on permanent storage at one of the nsas massive server farms it was always better to be safe than sorry and ashford always assumed someone was listening in there has obviously been some sort of hiccup said the mi man hiccup replied standing back in manhattan you brits are amazing i think fuckup would be a more apropos term wouldnt you ashford didnt bother responding there were times when standing really got under his skin are you still there asked the billionaire yes im still here arent you going to say anything the mi man pinched the bridge of his nose what do you want me to say i want you to tell me what happened replied standing i want to know how we went from bright and breezy to all screwed up unfortunately i dont have access to that information right now the sources wed normally reach out to in a situation like this are not answering their phones dont give me that we bullshit robert you need to get to the bottom of this right now do you understand me only some of the bread got baked whats more the bakers seemed to have been very badly burned ashford felt a migraine coming on before his staff meeting hed been flipping back and forth among several american news feeds hed been able to assemble a limited picture of what was happening but there were still too many blanks that needed to be filled in he had called his contact in los angeles but the number was no longer in service he had gone dark ashford was not pleased the russians were normally very good at this type of work in fact the mi man had paid a lot extra to use former spetsnaz operatives it was a bit like using a sledgehammer in lieu of a fly swatter but standing had a bottomless well of cash and he wanted the cleanest of clean the most untraceable of hits each weapon was only to be fired once and then gotten rid of the hitters were then supposed to be taken to a hotel near lax to fly back to russia the next morning the good thing about hiring spetsnaz operatives was that on the outside chance something got screwed up and they were caught they would never ever speak escrow accounts had been set up for each of the hitters and news of their arrest would trigger an automatic payment to their designated beneficiary and annual payments would continue to be made for every year they remained in prison it was referred to in russian as an annuity of silence the fact that the operation appeared to have been foiled didnt make any sense the targets had been three american civilians with no bodyguards or security presence whatsoever they had neither military nor law enforcement backgrounds it should have been one of the easiest contracts ever but somewhere something had gotten screwed up kitchen fires are very dangerous things continued standing they have a way of spreading ashford didnt exactly know how to interpret that remark was standing worried about salomon coming after him youve got plenty of fire extinguishers the mi man replied referring to the billionaires personal security detail i wouldnt worry about it thats the problem with fires you may think you have it under control but then suddenly it explodes and its all around you those kinds of fires get lots of news coverage no one likes fires but those are the fires i like the least i understand just in case standing asserted let me be perfectly clear if i start smelling smoke i am going to be very upset believe me im just as upset as you are then get this handled immediately im working on it replied ashford youll want to do better than that said standing this one could have a very big impact on your career what the hell is that supposed to mean check the box ordered the billionaire who then terminated the call the box referred to the email account ashford and standing shared it was an additional form of clandestine communication that allowed them to communicate without actually sending any messages over the web they conversed by leaving messages for each other in the accounts draft folder rising up from the conference table robert ashford walked to his desk and sat down in front of his computer to log in through a cleansed difficulttotrack server on the isle of man he knew that whatever was waiting in the draft folder wouldnt be good news when he opened the message from standing he immediately realized how much trouble he was in he had been careful but apparently not careful enough he scrolled through picture after picture of himself in yemen they showed him arriving at the apartment building and then atop the roof unpacking the rpg the very last picture in the series turned out not to be a picture at all but a video though he knew what that would show as well he still clicked on it instantly he was sorry he had the video showed ashford firing the rpg and then leaving the building but several minutes of footage followed it focused on the carnage the rpg had wrought the twisted wreckage of the burning car that had been targeted as well as the dead dying and wounded in the street before the video ended it panned the cafe across from where the car had been parked there robert ashford saw a quick glimpse of a nonarab face and knew exactly who it was it was the man who had captured aazim aleem had stuffed him in the trunk of that white toyota corolla and had driven him to the cafe to be given up to the cia the threat from standing left no room for confusion ashfords migraine flared he reached into his desk drawer for the bottle of painkillers but then stopped hed have to work through the pain he couldnt afford to have his brain muddled hed made a mistake trusting standing actually that wasnt correct he had never truly trusted the billionaire hed trusted their commitment to a shared cause but he shouldnt have overlooked standings selfpreservation instinct ashford leaned back in his chair shut his eyes and massaged his temples with the heels of his hands he was in a dangerous box and would have to chart a very careful course injecting scot harvath the man from the cafe into the game had just raised the stakes to a new level chapter sweden h arvath knew the old man was right he was always right sightseeing was for tourists not for counterterrorism operatives they needed to get off the x as it was called as soon as possible the operation had been designed to last only a matter of hours twentyfour tops and no more because of how vulnerable chase would be the insertion had been done completely clean there were no follow cars and he wasnt carrying any weapons or tracking devices the assignment was incredibly dangerous no one wanted to add to the jeopardy he was already in by throwing another ingredient into the mix that could get him killed if anything happened to him the agency would devote its full attention to driving a stake through the carlton groups heart ever since the old man had started his organization the powers that be at langley had wanted it shut down the carlton group was doing everything the agency claimed couldnt be done and doing it better faster cheaper and often a lot more quietly it upset the cia to no end that the old man had sucked up a lot of their talent and was employing them in a much more streamlined organization that wasnt afraid to take risks they knew they were too topheavy they also knew that they were choking themselves to death on their own red tape when the next major terrorist attack hit the united states america was finally going to wake up to how inefficient the central intelligence agency was and call for a stake to be driven through their heart that fact more than any other was what kept cia bureaucrats lying awake in their beds every night america had been too forgiving after it wouldnt make that mistake again but instead of fixing its leaking ship the cia focused on protecting its turf the writing was on the wall eventually they were going to be replaced by a leaner more productive organization they were in a fight for their very existence and they lashed out accordingly at anyone or anything they saw as a competitor and that was exactly how the carlton group was perceived while there was no love lost between the old man and langley he didnt want to be sucked into their petty games already a handful of stories had been leaked to the new york times about his organization in an effort to discredit it he had enough sources both within the paper and back at the agency to know whod been behind it though he found it unprofessional he understood why the cia was doing it thats why hed been intent on mending fences like it or not his organization was here to stay no matter how badly the cia didnt want them around the carlton group now had the top cover and protection of the dod that didnt mean though that langley couldnt make it difficult for them the old man had decided the best way to stop the pissing match was to offer an olive branch thats what the yemen operation had been all about was it the best idea to swoop into the country and in a matter of days pinpoint and roll up the bad guy that the cia had been trying to track down for a month probably not but handing him right over and not wanting any credit was a very good idea had the attack on harvaths vehicle not happened and had aazim been turned over to the agency it might have improved the relationship at least that was what the old man had believed harvath hadnt been so sure though he had kept them to himself harvath had reservations he thought they might see it as having had their faces rubbed in it he also doubted theyd share any of the intel they gleaned from wringing aazim aleem out like a dishcloth carlton had to be part mind reader without harvath saying anything the old man knew exactly what he was thinking he was quick to remind harvath of several things each of which stung a bit and therefore stuck with him the old man made it clear that harvath was an exceptional operative but not yet as smart or as experienced as he was he also stated that while one of harvaths greatest skills was his ability to think and act on his own it was also one of his greatest flaws that last part burned the hottest most likely because it was right on target even in the seals harvath had danced just on the edge of being a team player despite the fact that he was very well liked his superiors had warned him again and again about his individuality while there wasnt any one thing they could specifically point to he was warned that if he wasnt careful he was eventually going to get his teammates killed harvath hadnt liked hearing it then and he certainly didnt like hearing it now from a man he had so much respect for under the former president harvath had been expected to operate alone and to do things his way he had excelled but those days were behind him for better or worse harvath was back on a team again which required that he perform accordingly he was determined to make it work that was a big reason he was upset to lose riley turner to the care of mansoor aleem the very reason the athena project had been created by delta was that an attractive womans beauty automatically disqualified her as a threat harvath chastised himself for not remembering one of the seals maxims two is one and one is none they all knew that mansoor could have been injured in their manufactured car accident he should have brought another member from the athena project along just in case but he hadnt and he knew why hed felt chemistry the moment he met her he thought she might have felt it too but he couldnt be sure she was very hard to read he didnt know if that was a good thing or a bad thing all he knew was that he thought about her entirely too much he didnt like that it meant that something was going on that he couldnt control and harvath was all about control it was one of those traits that had interfered with his ability to be a proper team player he had avoided bringing another athena project member on the assignment because he had wanted her to himself so to speak he didnt want to share her it was stupid but if given a mulligan he knew hed do it the same way again harvath was not only exceedingly good at what he did he was also a fun guy to be around nevertheless the landscape of his personal life was like a tropical beach scattered with the wreckage of broken relationships as long as you looked at the sand closest to you it looked pretty good but the further you glanced down the beach the more you realized there had to be something out there just beneath the surface of the water to have wrecked all those ships there was certainly a reef out there but it was only recently that he had begun to understand what it was made of the razorsharp coral that gashed the hull of anyone who got too close to him was in part due to his career there were very few people whom he could tell exactly what he did and even fewer who could tolerate his frequent and often unannounced absences like a double helix the dna of harvaths career was entwined with something elsehis desire for a family and a stable home life the biggest thing people in harvaths industry had in common was divorce disappearing at a moments notice to go off to some of the darkest corners of the world to do dangerous and unspeakable things wasnt exactly the fertile soil in which happy families grew you missed anniversaries birthday parties holidays soccer games school plays parentteacher conferences and on and on it took an amazingly resilient and unique spouse not only to put up with it but to keep the family strong and together though harvath knew a woman like that was next to impossible to find he specialized in the impossible and refused to give up looking the old man must have sensed harvaths interest in riley turner because he had been reluctant to okay her for this operation though harvath had worked with her once before his desire to learn more about her had tipped his hand nevertheless carlton had given in and allowed her to be part of the uppsala operation there were no other athena operatives with her medical skill set he hadnt needed to overtly remind harvath to keep it professional his tone when okaying rileys participation had said it all while he had sons of his own none of them had gone into his line of work and the old man felt a special affinity for harvath that said he knew harvath had lost his own father also a seal just after high school and he wasnt above manipulating the fatherson bond they had developed it often proved the key to getting through harvaths headstrong personality and making sure he did the right thing he suspected something might be materializing between riley and his operative but carlton knew there was little he could do about it much like a parent employers also had to trust that the people they task with difficult jobs will do the right thing and put the successful outcome of the assignment above everything else and thats exactly what harvath did he had kept things professional right up until he was ready to leave to join the assault team in uppsala after placing all his gear into his car he walked back into the barn bachmann had helped riley wrap mansoor in the blankets hed brought from the house he was now standing a respectful distance away while riley tended to her patient harvath tilted his head toward the door indicating he wanted the excia man to wait outside bachmann did as harvath requested once the barn doors were closed harvath approached hows he doing riley looked up at him his pulse is still thready will you be able to move him probably not for a couple of hours the old man says youll be going to the site in iceland now better medical there riley nodded again he also said he sent a team into mansoors apartment outside london they didnt find much continued harvath we are assuming he uses a cloud cloud computing referred to virtual networks where data was stored it acted as a failsafe for terrorists in particular in case they were captured if they didnt give up their cloud it was nearly impossible to locate their data they could also set up their clouds in a way that required them to touch back at regularly scheduled intervals or a countdown would be enacted and all of the data on that cloud would be destroyed dont worry said riley im going to be with him the entire time as soon as he regains consciousness ill press him for the cloud good said harvath for a moment he stood there just looking at her she was handsdown one of the bestlooking women hed ever seen the answers no she said harvath snapped out of it what answer the answer to whatever it is youre thinking of asking me who said i was going to ask you anything he replied riley shook her head i know that look i didnt give you any look fine she said there was no look you need anything else before i go he asked im sure if i need anything andy will help me harvath shook his head she was playing with him he knew she was pointing at mansoor he said stay in touch i want to be kept up to speed on how hes doing will do said riley as she turned away to prep another iv for her patient with nothing else to say harvath walked toward the door and exited the barn but just as he had the first time they had met he could feel her eyes on him as he walked away he thought about turning around but then decided against it he needed to get his head into the game for what was awaiting him and the rest of the assault team in uppsala the takedown was going to have to happen very fast in and out in three minutes or less they had to be gone before the swedish police arrived at the scene and an international incident was made of the raid that meant there was no margin for error it also meant that there was a very high likelihood that something could go wrong and as harvath drove away from the farm toward uppsala that was exactly what his gut was telling him was going to happen chapter harvath had wanted to keep the parameters of chases operation as limited as possible this wasnt a longterm deepcover operation he was to be their inside eyes for the takedown chase was to ascertain how many members the cell contained with whom and how they were communicating what critical intelligence was being kept at the safe house and where as well as what their defensive capabilities were at the accident scene harvath had cloned the dead terrorists sim cards they also had the mobile number the driver had called after picking up mansoor aleem at the stockholm airport and chase had dialed after the accident did it belong to the cell leader would the carlton team back in the states be able to track it as chase left the accident scene no one knew therefore harvath had developed a twopronged plan the most critical information for the assault team if they could pinpoint the location of the terrorists safe house was how many people were inside whether they were armed whether there were any explosives present and what if anything had been boobytrapped assuming that chase was not going to have access to a cell phone and might not have access to a computer harvath laid out a simple means of communicating the critical information via whatever window coverings the safe house employed it was a simple espionage tactic that would draw little to no attention blinds shutters shades or curtains unless the windows had been painted or newspapered over would communicate the details harvath had every confidence that it would work to communicate to chase that they had pinpointed his location harvaths car would be parked on the street outside with a book left on the dashboard this was where harvath was upset to have lost riley if they couldnt get a parking space they were going to have to create one riley could have been used as a diversion perhaps dropping her purse as her companion harvath got into the car they needed to move while she was gathering up the contents to place back in her bag harvath would work on starting the car to anyone watching it would simply appear as if he was waiting for her before starting the vehicle if he needed extra time or was having some sort of trouble hotwiring they could even stage an argument with harvaths hands working beneath the dashboard no one would be able to see what he was really doing that option though was now off the table if chase didnt see the car with the book on its dash by midnight he had been told to assume that they hadnt been able to pinpoint his location and that the cavalry wasnt coming he would be on his own he was to gather as much intelligence as he could and somehow get himself out once out he was to contact harvath with details and keep the safe house under surveillance from an optimum distance the good news was that they had caught a break the satellite team back in the united states had been able to track the mobile phone of the cell member chase had spoken with now all harvath had to do was position his vehicle with the book near the safe house where chase could see it and wait for him to signal southwest of uppsala in the lowincome suburb of gottsunda scot harvath began to believe the fates were smiling on him on a dirty street flanked by rows of drab apartment complexes he found the perfect parking space with the book on the dash he got out of the car removed two sacks of groceries from the trunk armed the alarm and walked away the area was so rough thanks in part to rampant lawlessness by muslim youths that even swedes hired to pilot googles street view cars had refused to drive through and map the area it was yet another in a long and growing list of europes sensitive no go areas while swedish police still responded to calls they only did so in great numbers because bricks and molotov cocktails normally greeted them upon their arrival there were still ethnic swedes to be found in the area though many of the housing complexes were now filled with a mixture of arab and somali faces as with most of uppsalas poorer suburbs and neighborhoods the residents had been coopted by the hard left political parties it was one of the few tidbits about gottsunda that harvath had found helpful to help him blend in he had donned a dirty pair of jeans tennis shoes a worn jacket and a tshirt with an antiestablishment slogan one of the assault team members had found near the university from what they had been told the immigrants tended to stay away from the ethnic swedes who blamed a lot of their problems on the muslim invaders unless he encountered a group of youths looking to start a fight harvath expected to be given a wide berth his swedish was limited the only words he knew were those he had picked up in the seals when he had dated a string of sas flight attendants and earned his call sign norseman as many people do with foreign languages hed learned the bad words first if anyone did come up to engage him he could act the part of the surly drunk toss out a few choice phrases and keep going he hoped he wouldnt even need to do that right in front of the safe house and right on cue the rip harvath had placed in the bottom of one of his grocery bags tore the rest of the way open and spilled its contents onto the ground he swore in swedish and muttered to himself as he bent over to pick everything up stealing the occasional glance at the building he saw that all of the window shades were drawn tight chase wouldnt communicate his message until he saw the car parked on the street with the book so harvath gathered up his groceries and continued down the block at the end of the street he turned the corner and walked three blocks in a weedchoked parking area sat a large panel truck covered with graffiti six seriouslooking extremely fit men in matching blue tshirts and jeans stood talking alongside their truck they looked like a team of movers which was exactly what harvath wanted people to believe as he got nearer harvath could see that though they appeared casual their eyes were constantly scanning the area taking nothing for granted the old man had put the assault team together himself and they were true professionals loaded for bear and ready for anything the team leader was a former us special forces soldier who then spent several years with the cias special activities division before being transferred up to the paramilitary special operations group composed of exdevgru seals and cag operators he was a tall man with a fishhookshaped scar on his left cheek his name was schiller and he was only a year older than harvath once the plan for raiding the safe house had been hatched schiller had been the one to find the truck inside were cardboard boxes filled with the assault teams gear posing as a swedish moving company they would unload the boxes onto dollies and wheel them into the building once inside they would unpack the weapons radios swedish security service uniforms helmets and body armor and suit up for a job like this it was customary to have at least two to three times as many men as they had ideally youd also have a surveillance team watching the apartment from somewhere close by one operator would watch the front of the building while another watched the back and a third stayed behind the wheel of the truck on the perimeter an additional operator would be in charge of communications inside the teams would post men in the stairwells and at the elevator finally there would be the assault team itself which would be in charge of actually hitting the apartment that was how it was done on your own turf or in a cooperative assignment with a foreign government but because the swedes had no idea that the americans were operating within their territory theyd had to remain lean as someone who never asked people to do what he wouldnt do and as someone who always wanted to be the first through the door harvath had wanted to lead the team inside schiller though had been against it harvath was in charge of the operation and thought about pulling rank but instead he took a deep breath and stood down the assaulters were schillers men there could be almost a telepathic bond on assault teams they instinctively knew where each other would be and what each would do at every minute harvath understood not to take it personally he hadnt trained with them he couldnt blame schiller or his assaulters for not wanting to compromise the integrity of their team without riley they numbered seven total schiller wanted harvath to stay outside and watch the rear of the building while one of his assaulters stayed with the truck in front the apartment complex backed up to a large wooded area where a cell member could disappear quickly it was a good idea but it wasnt perfect none of schillers men spoke swedishnot even any of the bad words sitting in the truck might result in some sort of interaction with someone from the neighborhood therefore this time harvath asserted his authority and stated that hed remain in front with the truck while one of schillers men watched the back and coordinated the radio communications schiller agreed and threw harvath an extra blue tshirt as harvath changed schiller reviewed the rest of the assignments he would be leading three of the assaulters into the apartment while a fifth would stay in the hall and cover their six so no one could hit the team from behind all of the weapons and radios had been checked before the team had left their temporary apartment in uppsala in a sports bag in the cab of the truck was a suppressed mp for harvath along with a radio and a black plate carrier vest emblazoned with the word sakerhetspolisen across the front and back schiller also handed him a blue baseball cap since hed already walked right past the safe house once to sit outside in the truck harvath needed to do everything he could to make sure that he wasnt recognized the man had raised a good point that also meant that until they were ready to launch their operation harvath couldnt go anywhere near the safe house again someone else was going to have to look to see if chase had raised his signal in fact they were probably going to have to take turns once again harvath wished that riley was with them each of the assaulters had brought a change of clothes so harvath put together a surveillance rosterwho would go when he would go and what his ruse would be while passing the safe house so that none of them would draw undue attention they had an additional vehicle parked a block away from the truck and harvath decided they would use it as well but sparingly if any of the members of the cell saw the same vehicle go by twice especially one that wasnt a regular in the neighborhood they might get spooked and do something stupid with all the rotations decided upon all they could do was wait the ball was now in chases court chapter chase had zeroed in on the cell leader the moment hed been shown into the apartment mustafa karami was a slight man who looked much older than the other members he sported a patchy beard a slim nose and a pair of deeply set dark eyes he radiated a controlled simmering anger that seemed ready to erupt at any moment he was different from most of the jihadists chase had come across not unique just different most of them were not very bright and they lacked selfcontrol that wasnt karami though he was the picture of selfcontrol he was also very intelligent chase could tell that just from one look at his face thats what made him different as the man embraced and kissed him on both cheeks chase sensed something else this was a man who would slash your throat at a moments notice if he felt it necessary he would feel no remorse about it either hed probably sit there and drink his chai as he watched you bleed out on the floor between karami and sabah his number two chase had a lot to be concerned about the other cell members in the apartment were like the two men who had picked him up at the soccer field and had taken him to the garage they were either muscle or simply jihadist cannon fodder none of them were exceptionally intelligent nor were they particularly talented he doubted theyd be of any intelligence value whatsoever after welcoming him karami sat chase down and asked the huge man named sabah to fetch tea he made small talk as was customary and when sabah returned with a tray he poured the tea and offered chase a snack there were bowls of dates figs and nuts chase thanked him and helped himself your uncle was a wonderful soldier of allah he is in paradise now mashaallah chase replied god has willed it it was your uncles desire that if anything happened to him we take care of you chase shrugged and took a sip of his tea it was important that he maintain his aloof disinterested hacker attitude when was the last time you saw him karami was testing him as sabah had the last time chase had seen aazim aleem was when pieces of him had been blown all over a yemeni sidewalk but he couldnt exactly share that he also couldnt exactly share how he and aazim had first met chase had spent three years infiltrating aazim aleems terrorist network he had worked his way right into a position next to a man named marwan jarrah who was helping coordinate aazims attack plans for the united states then harvath showed up jarrah was gunned down and aazim disappeared but not before several attacks in chicago were launched and scores of people were killed these attacks had come on the heels of a wave of attacks in europe targeting american tourists aazim had built a very sophisticated network what bothered the cia was that many of his american cells were believed to still be in place nobody knew who they were much less where they were hiding and what they had planned chase had met with aazim only twice he was the only american operative to have ever done so the first time had been brief and had taken place while chase and jarrah were traveling through pakistan the second meeting had happened in chicago and had been much more substantive chase had finally put another piece of the puzzle in place as he discovered that jarrah was working for aazim who controlled the network the meeting had taken place in jarrahs office and chase so impressed aazim that the terrorist mastermind invited him to help execute a nationwide string of attacks beyond what was planned for chicago these attacks it was alleged would cause airplanes to rain from the sky radiation and plague to infect american citizens and multiple other horrors aazim despised america and his goal was for it to know terror like it had never known terror before and as that prediction began to unfold a mumbaistyle siege was launched against three commuter train stations in chicago and many innocent civilians had been killed jarrah had explained to chase that aazim had come to chicago to check on their final preparations from there he was going to los angeles for the next attack and he wanted chase to handle an attack planned for new york city when one of the chicago train station plots was interrupted and jarrah was murdered the la and new york attacks never materialized according to chatter aazim had fled the united states thats when chase had been charged with hunting him down the hunt had led him to yemen but aazim had proven elusive at least for the cia harvath somehow had much better luck he not only located the terrorist mastermind he managed to capture him and stuff him in his trunk chase had just been given the keys to harvaths car when it was struck by an rpg and aazim was incinerated the reason the cia had allowed chase to join harvaths current uppsala operation was that they were bound and determined to uncover the remainder of aazims network both within the united states and if possible the rest of the world the powers that be back at langley didnt much care for harvaths cowboy reputation they cared even less for harvaths boss reed carlton but they had little choice but to cooperate chase had invested years of his life in infiltrating aazims network he knew more about it than anyone else in the intelligence world and he made it crystal clear to agency brass that if they didnt sign off on his joining harvaths op he would quit and sign up with the carlton group either way he would finish the job he had started chase was a virtual encyclopedia of aazim aleem information british by birth the terrorist had been a fat man in his late sixties with a long gray beard when he had been shredded in yemen but his girth and facial hair were not his most distinguishing features that honor belonged to the two stainless steel hooks that he had where his hands should have been he had traveled to afghanistan in the eighties to fight in the jihad against the soviets and legend had it that aazim had lost his hands attempting to defuse a land mine near a school the story was pure propaganda the jihadist was a bomb maker and had lost them in a premature detonation he had been an adept islamic scholar who had studied at egypts prestigious hotbed of muslim extremism alazhar university in cairo known only as the mufti of jihad his anonymous writings and audio sermons on violent jihad were famous throughout the muslim world until chase no western intelligence service had ever been able to uncover the mufti of jihads true identity aazim had traveled extensively promoting war against the infidels and the west while collecting a full disability pension back in the united kingdom since no one really knew who he was until chase discovered him the man had traveled freely under his real name once he disappeared chase went back and studied that travel extensively it wasnt hard to put together a trail of tickets and every time his uk passport had been scanned it was how he was able to answer karamis question i saw him about three months ago he replied before he left for chicago and who was he meeting in chicago asked the leader of the uppsala cell marwan jarrah and then and then replied chase new york and los angeles but he left for yemen and i never saw him again karami studied the young mans face there was no way he could know these things unless he was exactly who he said he was nevertheless sabah distrusted the newcomer and sabah had excellent instincts tell me about the sheikh the sheikh from qatar sabah seemed interested in this question and leaned forward chase looked at both men what sheikh surely stated the cell leader your uncle confided in you enough to mention the sheikh apparently not completely he never mentioned any sheikh you never questioned where the funding came from why would i care im an it person replied chase i had nothing to do with his finances chases mind was moving like a rubiks cube trying to align the information so that the entire puzzle fell into place he had never heard about any sheikh from qatar this was completely new to him marwan jarrah had been near the top of the organizations pyramid but chase had always known he was taking his orders from someone above him that someone had turned out to be aazim aleem the next question was who had been giving aazim orders was he the ultimate stringpuller or was there someone else and what was the uppsala cells connection to all of this at least harvath had played it smart had he thrown a hood over the nephews head and dragged him off to some black site in eastern europe for interrogation the minute theyd uncovered him instead of surveilling him the united states might not ever have learned about the uppsala cell it had come as a complete surprise even to the real mansoor aleem his uncle aazim had been smart the man kept his network compartmentalized he had to it was like bulkheads if one was compromised it didnt have to mean the entire ship was going down which brought chase back to the uppsala cell why had aazim set it up what was its purpose was it an insurance policy of sorts a guarantee that if he was taken out their mission would continue if so did that mean he had entrusted them with the knowledge of his nephew there were so many pieces of the puzzle missing as chase spun the blocks of information in his mind karami asked him another question it put him on edge because it showed the cell leader was not fully convinced he was who he said he was tell me about your uncles impairment what impairment chase replied his hands karami said nothing his face was impassive inscrutable he lost them in afghanistan chase continued his gaze was locked on karami just out of his field of view he could feel sabahs eyes burning a hole right through him how did he lose them asked the cell leader chase could sense sabah was ready to handle any incorrect answer do you want the fable replied chase or the truth as the prophet peace be upon him said we should appropriate truth for ourselves and avoid lying chase nodded its a shame as the fable is much more glamorous he lost his hands when a bomb he was building detonated prematurely it also resulted in pitted scars around his left eye this is why he often wore sunglasses even in the evenings people mistook him on occasion for being blind but he had perfect vision the answer seemed to satisfy karami who smiled he also sensed sabah relax slightly but not much the cell leader was about to ask another question when one of the cell members appeared in the doorway and asked if the trio would be joining the others for asr prayers do you feel up to it karami asked the key of paradise is prayer replied chase quoting mohammed apparently the men who had been watching him at the garage had told karami of his inability to complete the salah the men stood and chase was directed to a bathroom where he could perform his ritual ablutions after washing his hands and feet he joined the others in the apartments dining room there was no furniture only prayer rugs spaced evenly along the floor once all of the men were present prayers were begun chase had been given an extra rug to use and he went through the motions perfectly no one would have known that he wasnt muslim as he prayed he was able to take a head count of how many men there were in the apartment hed also been able to at least glance into all of the rooms from what he could tell there were no boobytraps he didnt see any explosives or weapons but that didnt mean that they werent hidden away somewhere what it did mean though was that there werent any right at hand when harvath and the assault team hit they would have surprise on their side and therefore the upper hand that was if they hit chase had still not had a chance to get to one of the windows to look outside for the car with the book on its dash he had decided he might only get one chance to get near a window and that if he did he should kill two birds with one stone if he did get the opportunity hed look for the car while positioning the window treatments so that the team outside would have a rough idea of what was waiting for them when they took down the apartment both while moving through the apartment and while at prayer chase kept his eyes peeled for objects he could use as weapons if harvath and the assaulters didnt succeed in locating the safe house chase was going to have to either sneak out or fight his way out with nine men present karami probably ran an aroundtheclock guard chase slowly began preparing himself for what fighting his way out might look like once again he reflected on the lessons of hagakure but try as he might he couldnt quite focus something was bothering him it took him several minutes to figure it out there was something missing in the apartment it wasnt just weapons that were absent it was computers there wasnt a single one to be seen if a raid did take place they might be able to get to hidden weapons quickly but computers not a chance not unless there was a rack of them in one of the closets all powered up and ready for their hard drives to be wiped clean or blown to kingdom come with the touch of a button there werent many places they could be hidden he planned on finding out if there were any here or not after prayers he expected karami to pick back up with his questioning but the cell leader apparently had other pressing business and disappeared into one of the rooms along with sabah and two other men and closed the door this left chase free to converse with the remaining cell members it also left him somewhat free to move about the apartment chapter in the first room chase found multiple mattresses only one of which was covered by a sheet there was a milk crate for a nightstand and atop it a table lamp with an exposed bulb and no shade a small tv dvd player and cushions scattered across the floor completed the makeshift dormitory cum rec room in the corner he noticed a couple of old hookah pipes sitting on cushions in front of the tv were four cannonfodder cell membersall mouth breathers as chase liked to call the iqimpaired they were watching footage of american military vehicles being taken out by ieds in iraq and afghanistan the men found the carnage extremely amusing and were laughing out loud at every explosion thats okay thought chase yours is coming soon enough keep laughing only one of the men looked up and acknowledged that chase had walked into the room the cell members seemed to know that he was related to someone important which meant he was treated with a certain amount of deference but he was still a newcomer so despite that deference they kept him at arms length none of the men invited him to sit that was fine by chase he had other things on his mind pretending to be interested in what they were watching he made his way across the room the closet was partially open and he stole a quick glance inside nothing only shirts trousers and a row of cheap shoes stepping near the windows he stopped and leaned against the wall the view outside would be perfectright out over the street minutes passed the explosions on the tv continued and the four men guffawed right along with them the joy they took in the killing and maiming of american soldiers spoke to how incredibly sick they were as not one of them had given him as much as a second glance he decided to risk a look through the blinds which had been drawn tightly shut it took him a moment and at first his heart sank as he thought the car wasnt there but then he saw itbook and all it was like a shot of caffeine being pumped into his bloodstream immediately his heart raced and he could feel a rush sweep through him harvath and the rest of the team knew where he was this jihadist rats nest was going to get the shit kicked out of it withdrawing his hand from the aluminum blinds he forced himself to take a deep breath be cool he told himself just as he had back at the garage everythings cool he ran through his head exactly how he needed to construct his signal in order to let harvath know what was going on inside he debated whether he should check out the other rooms first waiting was a gamble what if karami sent for him or sabah decided he needed to be watched more closely it definitely was a crapshoot chase decided on the bird in the hand hed send the signal now he could convey the number of men and that he had not seen any boobytraps weapons or explosives the assaulters would still hit the safe house just as hard expecting all of those things to be there so without wasting any more time chase got to work what are you doing one of the men asked when he heard chase monkeying around with the blinds im opening the window he replied in arabic it stinks in here it did in fact smell quite badly but the man either hadnt noticed or didnt care we were told not to go near the windows i have to get some fresh air said chase it is forbidden chase signaled to the man not to worry it is my decision brother i will take the responsibility enjoy the television used to his place at the bottom of the cells hierarchy the man gave up admonishing the newcomer and he and his associates went back to watching war porn chase didnt waste any time he lifted two sets of blinds to the same height about a quarter of the way up he then adjusted the angle on one set opened each of the windows differing amounts and let the string for the blinds hang out the window on the left with his bat signal blazing he grabbed a cushion and sat down with the jihadists to watch tv by his estimate the windows had been open for a little more than ten minutes when sabah entered the room who touched the windows he bellowed in arabic no one answered as he repeated his question he looked directly at chase who did this i think the dates dont agree with my stomach said chase fanning the air with his hand whats going on said karami who suddenly appeared in the doorway sabah gestured toward the windows our guest has been busy creating problems i wasnt creating problems chase insisted i just opened the window whats the big deal the big deal said karami as he walked over to the windows is that we have certain rules one of them is that the windows and blinds must remain closed chase didnt like how intently he was studying them after a moment he retracted the cord closed the windows lowered and shut the blinds turning back to chase he said the rules were not explained to you so you will be forgiven your transgression this time gesturing to sabah he signaled for him to follow at the doorway he beckoned the palestinian to lower his head and spoke so that only sabah could hear he removed a pen and a small pad from his pocket whether what he did next was to sketch or write something down chase couldnt tell when karami was finished he tore off the piece of paper and handed it to the palestinian who glared at chase for a moment and left the room karami then said i do not wish for any more problems is that understood i just opened the window chase began but the cell leader silenced him no more problems none at that moment chase heard sabah bark at one of the other cell members in the hallway seconds later the front door opened and the giant stomped out slamming the door shut behind chase had no idea if they were on to him or not but before backing out of the room karami forced a smile it reminded him of the mouth of a shark curling back and revealing its teeth every fiber of his being was telling him that he was blown that he needed to get the hell out of therenow but he refused to let the fear take hold of him instead he tried to relax everythings cool he told himself everythings cool it was a lie of course and he knew it but he kept repeating it anyway either way it was all going to be over soon he just prayed to god that harvath had seen his signal chapter the apartment buildings up and down both sides of the street were nearly identical it was only by tracking the signal of the phone chase had called right after the accident that they were able to pinpoint the exact location of the safe house harvath had spaced the trips past it as far apart as he could they had rotated half of schillers men through over the last two hours they were debating whether they should send the car down the street on the next pass when one of the assaulters came back to the moving truck and said we got it every man who had gone down the street had been carrying the hidden video camera system riley would have carried in a ruse they had concocted for her had she been able to accompany them removing the memory card harvath slid it into his computer pulled up the file and scrolled through the footage till he got to what they had all been looking for the resolution of the video of the outside of the safe house was excellent freezing the shot he wanted he zoomed in there was chases signal no doubt about it they were all gathered in the back of the moving truck and harvath proceeded to decode his fenestral semaphore for the team so nine tangos total said schiller referring to the number of men chase had signaled were in the apartment plus no traps explosives or weapons none that we know of replied harvath schiller thought about it for a moment and then began sketching out a plan with his assaulters there had been a lot of talk in the runup to the operation about use of force the cia wanted as many of the cell members taken alive as possible though this technically wasnt an agency assignment and theyd deny any knowledge of it if it became public both harvath and the old man had been inclined to agree with them there was no telling who was inside what they knew or how valuable any of them could be having been on the inside chase would have a rough idea of the structural hierarchy and would be able to help interrogators separate the wheat from the chaff pretty quickly which reminded harvath of something he pulled up two photos of chase on his computer he didnt like telling people how to do their job but he was in charge and the ultimate responsibility for how things went down rested with him he showed the photos to the team one last time they had been taken that morning and showed both a fulllength and a tight headandshoulders shot of chase everybody got him committed to memory the team all nodded he may still be dressed like this continued harvath or they might have made him change clothes just remember his face once again the team nodded as harvath added and dont forget you take him down just as hard as you do the others if you have to tase him tase him hes a big boy he can handle it the other cell members have to believe hes one of them got it a chorus of roger that swept through the truck and harvath turned his computer back around and powered it down the team went over their satellite footage of the area once more they discussed points of ingress and egress as well as plans b c and d when they had finished schiller opened one of the cardboard boxes he lifted out what looked like two thin plastic briefcases with a shiny metal scorpion logo in the middle and handed them to harvath what are these harvath asked opening one of them up stinger spike systems it looked like a collapsible metal wall bracket for a makeup mirror except that it was studded with very sharp stainlesssteel spikes harvath had seen law enforcement agencies lay them down across roadways to take out the tires of vehicles in highspeed chases just in case we need to buy a little more time schiller added it was a good idea and harvath was glad the assault team leader had thought to bring them along all that was left to do was to launch the assault harvath and schiller had briefly gone back and forth on the timing they had debated hitting the safe house just after sunset in hopes of catching the cell members in their maghrib prayers but it was a very limited fivetotenminute window and there was no telling exactly when they would start their prayers there was also the issue of when a moving truck would legitimately show up to unload late afternoon was believable and though earlyevening moves did happen from time to time they were out of the ordinary and would therefore attract attention schillers assaulters were already amped up and pulling on the leash harvath decided that the team would move now first in would be the assaulter schiller had assigned to cover the back of the building a former green beret named pat murphy murphy grabbed a small backpack and hopped out of the truck he would repark the other car and approach through the wooded area behind the apartment complex where he would take up his position as he climbed out of the truck one of the other assaulters leaned out the window and said god help us if theres an irish bar between here and there murphy flipped the man the finger shouldered his pack and began walking harvath watched as he crossed the parking area and disappeared around the corner reaching down into the gym bag harvath turned on his radio twentytwo minutes later they heard from murphy phoenix seven in place he stated bang a gong that was the allclear they had been waiting for it was time to take down the safe house chapter deserted streets always made harvath nervous over his career hed been ambushed a handful of times and the scene had always looked the same people and even animals seemed to be able to sense when something bad was about to happen more often than not either the bad guys had told the people to hide inside or the people had noticed the bad guys were up to something and therefore quickly made themselves scarce whatever the reason for this block being devoid of any activity harvath didnt care it just gave him a bad feeling pretty quiet he said as they neared the apartment complex too quiet replied schiller who covertly banged on the cabin bulkhead behind him to let his assaulters in back know that they were rolling up on the target harvath scanned the windows and rooftops for any sign of a spotter but saw nothing even so he felt like there were a thousand sets of eyes on them ten seconds he said schiller knocked twice on the wall behind him when they arrived in front of the apartment complex harvath brought the truck to a stop put it in park and turned off the ignition there was no service entrance everything went in and out of the building through the front door it wasnt lost on him how exposed they all were out there in the middle of the street he wanted to get the assaulters into the building as quickly as possible then hed be the only sitting duck out in the open he schiller and one other assaulter climbed out of the cab and got to work harvath walked around to the back of the truck extended the ramp and rolled up the door schiller and his assaulter stepped into the lobby of the building while schiller pretended to be buzzing up to someone on the intercom system his assaulter used a lockpick gun to open the second set of doors as soon as they were open he pulled a rubber wedge from his pocket and propped it open schiller followed him inside and called for the elevator while he waited for it to come down he pried the glass cover from the firemans key box removed the key and replaced the cover when the elevator arrived he stepped inside and inserted the key it was now under their control the assaulters from the back of the truck had already debused and were stacking boxes on dollies when schiller and the other man came out to assist them once the dollies were all loaded up the men disappeared inside with them harvaths job now was to stay with the truck and be the teams eyes out on the street he pulled down the rear door threw the lock and then walked back up front and climbed into the cab though he wasnt a smoker harvath removed the pack of cigarettes he had purchased lit one and hung his arm out the window it had always been fascinating to him how someone just sitting in a car doing nothing could be suspicious but the minute you gave him a cigarette and he adopted a casual posture somehow he became less so he couldnt explain why that was but hed seen it work enough times that it had become a tactic he liked to employ when he had to hide in plain sight the trucks side mirrors had been angled outward before they departed the parking area to give them the best possible view of the street and the sidewalks on either side he could even make out the car with the book on its dashboard several car lengths back noticing it he used his free hand to pull the baseball cap he was wearing down a little tighter he pretended to fumble with the trucks radio as he looked out the windshield and studied the windows of the buildings around him he had yet to shake his feeling that somebody was watching that something wasnt right he also hated just sitting there it had been the right decision but it still didnt mean he liked it he wanted to be where the action was not sitting in a van waiting for everything to go down ultimately being where he was right now had been his call and it had been the right call leadership was not only about taking charge it was also about giving your team everything they needed to succeed and then getting out of their way it meant knowing when you should be the first person charging through a door and when you should stand down and let someone else do it harvath had the makings of a good leader and at some point way in the distant future that was going to be important because he couldnt dance on the pointy tip of the spear forever eventually his reaction times were going to slow when that happened he was going to have to come to terms with the highspeed life he had lived since his late teens time catches up with everyone at some point the secret lay in knowing when to dial back your lifestyle now though wasnt the time harvath was in the best physical and mental condition of his life and there was no end of bad guys that needed to be dealt with as long as he stayed on the right side of his ops and the people he worked for everything would be fine no sooner had that thought entered his mind than the radio in the bag next to him clicked schiller was indicating that he and his assault team were geared up and ready to breach the apartment murphy clicked back the allclear from behind the complex and after one last check of the street harvath reached his hand into the bag and clicked back his response all clear it was time to clean out the rats nest as harvaths hand felt for the butt of his mp he could completely visualize what was going on upstairs with the allclear having been signaled from outside schiller would motion up his breacher have him pause and then click his radio one last time before giving the man the command to swing the breaching ram and knock the safehouse door right off its hinges flicking his cigarette into the street harvath drew his left hand inside the window and hovered it over the trucks horn he wanted to give chase a headsup but he knew he couldnt he needed to appear just as shocked by the entry team as everyone else if there was a signal before the attack they could very well cue in on that after the fact harvaths plan for leaving chase under cover with them once they had been transported to a black site for interrogation could all come unraveled as harvath waited on the street below for the assault team to enter the apartment his heart began to beat faster and the hairs on the back of his neck suddenly stood on end as if the air was charged with electricity it was a way his gut had of signaling him that something wasnt right chapter having seen the book on the dashboard of the car outside chase knew the assault team would hit the apartment before nightfall there was no way of knowing if they had seen his signal he hoped so because he couldnt do it a second time there was a very bad vibe in the safe house if he got caught opening the blinds or any of the windows again he had no doubt thered be hell to pay sabah had returned and he and karami had shut themselves up in one of the rooms at the end of the hall chase wondered if there were any computers or weapons hidden away in that room he also wondered where sabah had gone in such a hurry and what he and karami were now talking about chase was certain that the uppsala cell was in the final stages of something what it was he had no idea but it sure felt as if they were about to go operational on something was the uppsala cell aazims dead man switch had he provided karami with a target deck and a way to activate the networks sleepers in the united states and elsewhere upon his death these were all questions chase couldnt wait to start asking he also wanted to know why it had been so important for the uppsala cell to bring aazims nephew in was the uncle just that overprotective or did mansoor know something or have access to something of value theyd be getting to the bottom of all of it soon enough in the meantime chase stayed with the cells cannon fodder and watched war porn one of the jihadists got up at one point to get tea and actually brought back an extra glass for the newcomer it was a good sign a sign of respect quietly chase hoped that it meant that they had begun to accept him their willingness to believe he was one of them would affect how successful the interrogations would be once they had been deposited in whatever black site harvath had arranged for them chase knew exactly what was in store for him very likely he was going to get tasered when the assault team hit the safe house hed be flexcuffd and hooded if he resisted which he planned on doing quite vehemently hed get a tuneup which meant hed be slapped around after they were tossed in the truck with the other cell members and spirited back to the farm harvath would line them up in the barn and have their clothes cut away from their bodies with emt shears theyd then receive the same packaging all extraordinary rendition prisoners had been receiving since after being fitted with suppositories containing a psychotropic drug to make them more compliant and to disorient their comprehension of time and space theyd be fitted with diapers for the long plane ride dressed in matching coveralls shackled and with their heads still hooded with bags that allowed for no light to get in theyd have sensory deprivation headsets fitted over their ears from there theyd be placed in a different windowless vehicle from the moving van that had been used in the raid harvaths clever plan for getting them out of the country with the swedish government none the wiser would be put into effect chase wasnt looking forward to any of it but no one had forced him to take this assignment he had agreed to it because he knew that until they had hunted down every last member of aazim aleems network america wouldnt be safe you couldnt just cut out part of this kind of cancer and hope that it never came back you had to get all of it any cells left behind were guaranteed to metastasize there were many ways of going after the cancer of islamic terrorism there was the radiation of interrupting terrorist financing the chemotherapy of denying havens from within which to train and operate and the most delicate and most efficient method which was also the most dangerous and timeconsuming was to go in with a scalpel and carve up every single cell only through the last and most extreme method could you be absolutely sure that no cancer remained behind it was in this particular area that men like sean chase and scot harvath were particularly skilled but unlike harvath because of his background chase could be injected right into the muslim corpus he could drift through the islamic bloodstream seeking out the most radical the most deadly cancer cells without ever being seen as foreign and eliciting any sort of immune response once in he could mount his own tcell response calling in highly efficient killer cells run by men like scot harvath to attack the cancer and permanently purge it from the body harvath liked chases nobs attitude and ability to cut through red tape to get the job done though he had been trained for longterm deepcover assignments with little to no contact with his handlers when he did have to deal with daytoday operations at the cia the bureaucracy bothered him it had chewed up and spat out a lot of good operatives a handful of them had written books about how broken agency culture was much to langleys displeasure one of the most insightful the human factor had become a huge favorite among cia employees and a de facto field manual for those who wanted to keep america safe chase had read the human factor so many times the cover had fallen off and while he hadnt been at the agency long enough yet to become completely jaded the lessons he learned from the book informed everything he did that was part of the growing appreciation he had for harvath mission success was everything to a guy like that if harvath broke some of the crockery along the way that was the cost of doing business hed worry about the krazy glue later though it would drive his bosses nuts that was exactly how chase thought the war on terror or whatever politically correct term the seventh floor was using these days ought to be fought as the thought drifted from his mind chase watched one of the jihadists lean over and grab a hookah pipe from the corner standing up he took it into the bathroom and filled it with cold water do you smoke he asked when he returned and began packing the bowl while another man pulled out a pair of tongs and a lighter chase hated tobacco flavorful or otherwise but the men were making a new overture toward him and he was determined to take advantage of it of course he said the man with the tongs used them to withdraw a small piece of coal from a paper bag near the tv holding his lighter underneath he heated the coal until it began to glow and then placed it on the screen above the fruitflavored tobacco or shisha chase was offered the honor of smoking first the hose was covered in brightly colored braided silk chase placed the plastic tip between his lips and breathed in the water inside the pipe gurgled as the smoke was cooled and fed into the hose chase took a deep drag and allowed the smoke to completely fill his lungs he held it for a moment and then instead of allowing it to slowly escape through his mouth or nostrils he encouraged his coughing response and began hacking the four jihadists roared with laughter the newcomer was obviously a neophyte and had no experience with a hookah instead of telling the truth he had lied to protect his manliness still hacking chase struggled to stand he continued coughing as he placed his hands on his thighs and fought to breathe the cannon fodder laughed as if they were watching the funniest thing theyd ever seen being the butt of the joke didnt bother chase in fact thats exactly why hed spurred on the coughing fit shuffling toward the window he kept coughing as the men kept laughing in fact it wasnt until he had his hand on the blinds that they realized what he was up to dont said one of the men who could barely stop laughing long enough to get the word out karami will cut your hands off said another a third added hell cut all our hands off as the men began laughing even harder i cant breathe said chase who was pretending to be in between coughing fits he knew the men were serious about his not opening the window and would probably try to physically restrain him if they had to but he had no intention of opening it he just wanted a peek outside and would then immediately abandon the window appearing to heed his colleagues warnings as he pulled back the edge of the blinds chases cough immediately stopped the moving van was already outside but it wasnt in the right place harvath and the assault team had made a mistake they were hitting the building across the street and though it was difficult to tell for sure it looked as if someone had adjusted the windows and blinds of an apartment across the street exactly the way he had chapter as harvath was envisioning the assault team entering the safe house the entire third floor of the apartment complex exploded the shock wave tilted the moving truck up onto two wheels and almost knocked it completely over onto its side shards of glass rained down on the street as columns of boiling fire leaped out of the thirdstory windows and rolled up into the sky stunned harvath snatched up his radio and tried to hail the members of the team but his ears were ringing so badly that even with the volume all the way up he wouldnt have been able to hear anything it was as if yemen were replaying itself all over again the terrorists must have had the whole third floor wired with explosives pulling his plate carrier from the bag he threw it over his head and then snatched up his mp opening the door harvath leaped out of the truck and bolted into the building it was exactly what he had been trained not to do even if the explosion was a boobytrap rigged to the front door or had been set off by the terrorists inside when they realized they had been compromised there could still be a secondary device a device meant to kill any rescuers who then rushed into the building that was all true but harvath didnt care those were his men up there if any of them were alive he was going to get them out as harvath charged up the stairs three at a time the temperature soared and thick black smoke filled the air it was nearly impossible to breathe pulling his tshirt up from beneath the vest and over his mouth and nose he exposed the flesh of his midsection it felt as if the surface of his skin was being blasted with a blowtorch he was starting to burn but he pushed it from his mind the deafening roar of the fire grew as he neared the third floor coming up to the last flight of stairs he saw that the blast had blown the metal fire door completely off its hinges and it was now blocking the stairwell harvath reached for the railing to leap over it but the railing was so hot that he snatched his hand right back striking out with the heel of his boot harvath kicked at the door until it dislodged and he shoved it down the stairs behind him he tried to crouch beneath the smoke but it was so heavy so thick and so voluminous that there was just no bottom to it hoping to get some sort of break once he actually got into the hallway he bent his head and charged the rest of the way up to the landing he could feel the hair being singed off his arms as he lunged through the empty door frame and into the hall there was debris everywhere harvath was going to shout to see if there were any survivors and if they could hear him but he couldnt get enough oxygen into his lungs the heat was unbearable the bright orange blaze burned hotter and the flames leaped higher harvath knew he should get out there was no way that anyone could have survived that explosion but chase and schiller and the rest of the team were his responsibility if only one of them was still alive harvath needed to find him so he pushed deeper into the burning hallway he had gone no further than a few steps when there was an earsplitting crack as a larger section of the floor above came pancaking down with visibility next to zero harvath would have been crushed had it not been for a hand that reached out grabbed him by the drag handle of his plate carrier and yanked him into the stairwell weve got to get out yelled pat murphy who had burst into the building from the back no harvath shot back theyre all dead lets go we dont know theyre dead theyre dead murphy insisted as he dragged harvath away from the landing after the first couple of steps harvath began moving on his own when they hit the ground floor and exited the lobby a crowd had already formed in the street the people blanched when they saw the two ashandsootcovered men exit the building carrying weapons someone noticed that they were wearing swedish security service plate carriers and started to ask murphy questions in swedish the exgreen beret ignored him the other car is about two hundred meters behind the woods said murphy leaning in so harvath could hear him but keeping his voice low enough that the onlookers couldnt discern that he was speaking english lets get the hell out of here harvath had no choice but to agree there was nothing they could do here if they stayed theyd be arrested and an already tragic situation would be made much worse harvath nodded at murphy and the two set off for the back of the building the woods and the car parked just beyond neither the truck nor the car with the book on the dashboard could be traced back to them so harvath didnt think twice about abandoning them the key now was to get out of the country as quickly as possible they were about to swing around the side of the burning apartment complex and disappear when there was the sound of breaking glass and screams from the crowd of onlookers harvath spun just in time to see a man falling backward out of a fourthstory window of a building across the street chapter chase now knew that karami had been sketching the windows somehow he had figured out the signal he had created with the blinds karami had either known or suspected an attack was coming and hed set up an ambush across the street duplicating chases entire signal and if he had done all that then he had to know chase was not who he said he was therefore the young operative wasted no time he was dramatically outnumbered and the only thing he had on his side was surprise surprise and the shock the men in the room around him were in due to the explosion from across the street as soon as he knew he was going to have to fight his way out he again wished hed brought along the shiv hed made the hookah was the nearest and best weapon he had available and it broke over the head of the first jihadist he struck with it unconscious or dead chase didnt care the man dropped to the floor and that left three chase slashed the second islamists throat with the jagged broken glass base of the hookah as the two remaining men turned on him they charged in unison chase caught the first man with a low thrust kick to the knee and the other with a foreknuckle strike to the throat the man who received the kick to his knee fell to the floor screaming in pain the other man who had been struck in the throat was a different story his windpipe should have been crushed but chase had failed to grab his hair or his clothing and pull him into the strike the man had recoiled just as the punch came in lessening its severity like an enraged bull he gathered himself and charged again this time chase would not screw it up as the man came in he bent his head and ran at chase with his fingers spread and his hands outstretched like claws wherever he had grown up apparently it was his mother who had taught him to fight chase slipped between the mans arms and caught him right beneath the chin with a perfectly placed uppercut chase drove him backward with two jabs to his face the man swung wildly and got lucky punching chase in the side of the head the blow hurt like hell and immediately his ear felt as if it was on fire chase let his anger get the better of him spinning he kicked the man directly in the center of his chest sending him out through the glass window down to the street below chase knew he couldnt have survived the fall and didnt bother to look to see if he had there were five men left in the apartment and he moved quickly he wasnt about to wait for them to come find him he had made it almost all the way to the doorway when he saw the barrel of the rifle he wasnt surprised that the terrorists had had guns hidden away grabbing the weapon he tried to twist it away from his attacker there was a rapid burst of fire as the rifle erupted where all of the rounds went he had no idea all he knew was that one had torn right through his right bicep and hit the bone the pain was excruciating and he immediately lost the use of his arm sweeping his left arm he came up underneath the barrel and knocked it off him just as another volley of shots was fired the noise at such close range was deafening by moving the weapon chase had his opponent offbalance finding the weapons upper handguard he pushed down with all his might forcing the man to lean forward as he did chase snapped his head forward there was a spray of blood and a sickening crack as chase connected with the bridge of the mans nose it was game over chase snatched the rifle away from him balancing the buttstock against his left shoulder he depressed the trigger and put a threeround burst right through the mans chest he then spun and capped the jihadist with the blownout knee who was coming back at him from behind five down four to go he could sense movement from out in the hallway and didnt bother looking to see who it was propping the gun up against his shoulder once more he fired a burst directly through the wall there was a scream and the sound of a weapon clattering to the floor shooting without identifying the target was usually a bad thing but chase didnt give a damn even if he had capped karami this was kill or be killed he doubted karami would have come down the hallway himself thats what cannon fodder was for he hoped hed just nailed sabah but he doubted it it was probably one of the two goons from the garage bending his left arm into an l shape he positioned the stock in the crook of his elbow up against his good bicep popping the weapon around the edge of the door frame he sprayed the hall with another burst he waited for any return fire and when none came he risked a quick look his guess had been right lying facedown on the floor in a pool of blood was the man from the garage who had gone out and bought him the bandages and energy drinks six down chase now had a decision to make duck back inside the room and wait the other three out or take the fight to them neither option was that appealing in a matter of seconds the street outside was going to be filled with police and other firstresponders he needed to capture karami and sabah if he could do a quick sweep of the apartment and then get the hell out of there he had no choice but to step out into the hallway and risk exposure wedging the rifle against his shoulder again he took a deep breath and swung into the hall his right arm hung limp at his side blood was rolling down his hand and dripping off the tips of his fingers with his heart thudding in his chest chase moved forward as quietly as he could his senses were hyperalert attuned for any sudden movement or noise he might hear above the ringing that might give his remaining attackers away the apartment though was quiet too quiet as he moved he was plagued by the thought that the technique he had used would be used against him and any moment now he would be shot through the drywall hagakure he reminded himself hagakure he carefully peeked into the first room he came upon it was empty after a quick scan he turned his attention back to the hallway the rifle was growing heavy in his left arm the next room was a bathroom which was empty as well he stopped repeatedly and strained his ears for any sign of where the others might be hiding there was nothing growing ever closer to the room that karami and sabah had disappeared into earlier he had a good idea of where the remaining three men were sure enough the door to that room was closed chase was a risktaker but he wasnt an idiot there was every reason to believe that kicking the door in could only result in all sorts of bad news for him there could be three heavily armed men waiting for him on the other side or the door itself could be boobytrapped stepping into the bathroom which had only a shower no tub chase crouched behind the toilet and balanced the rifles magazine on the seat at this angle he could see only a very narrow sliver of the door he was shooting at taking aim he squeezed the trigger and let another hail of lead fly the rounds chewed up the left side of the door splintering the frame chase waited for a response but none came picking up his weapon he walked into the hall and put another burst through the door as well as through the drywall no response against his better judgment he decided to kick the door open he counted to three and let his foot fly the moment his shoe connected he heard a roaring barrage of gunfire chapter harvath ran across the street and charged directly into the building hed seen the man fall from he didnt know if his mind was playing tricks on him or if hed actually caught a glimpse of chase in the upper window murphy was right behind harvath and they ignored the elevator and headed right for the stairs they were halfway up to the fourth floor when some islamist skidded to a halt on the landing above them and tried to bring his weapon up to fire the man never had a chance harvath and murphy both drilled him with suppressed rounds to his chest and face the mans finger pulled down on the trigger in spasm and his weapon discharged wildly rounds ricocheted through the stairwell sending harvath and murphy diving for what little cover there was when the dead terrorists weapon fell silent harvath doubletapped him with two quick shots to the head just to make sure after kicking his weapon away they resumed their charge up the stairs when they got to the fourth floor murphy covered harvath as he stepped into the hall there were only four apartments per floor and based on the window the body had come out of harvath knew exactly which one they were looking for he just prayed that chase was inside and that he was still alive covering the apartment door with his weapon he signaled for murphy to come forward and join him harvath studied the door frame for any sign that it was wired he didnt see anything but that by no means meant it was safe schiller and his team hadnt seen anything either and the entire third floor of the building across the street had been incinerated this apartment could be rigged to explode as well if it wasnt rigged and they did have chase inside was he sitting there with a gun to his head would they shoot him if harvath kicked open the door and rushed in without knowing how many there were could he and murphy take them out before they did anything to chase it was a big gamble five men on his team were already dead whatever harvath decided to do hed better be sure he was absolutely certain about it he already had gallons of blood on his hands he needed more information taking a deep breath he placed his ear against the door and listened he heard a noise from inside it was faint at first but the longer he listened the louder it grew it sounded like a scuffle then harvath realized it wasnt a scuffle at all but rather the sound of somebody turning the place inside out he signaled murphy to be ready and then taking a step back harvath raised his boot and kicked the door in nothing exploded except the door off its hinges from the force of harvaths kick he figured he had a fiftyfifty chance of being right if someone was turning the place over it meant he was looking for something and you dont bother looking for something if youre about to blow yourself up at least that was what harvath hoped lucky for them hed been right harvath moved quickly inside his weapon up and at the ready murphy was right behind him they hadnt even made it through the living room when there was a burst of automatic weapons fire and rounds came slamming through the wall at the other end of the room harvath and murphy hit the floor the green beret came up onto his elbows and prepared to return fire but harvath waved him off they had no idea where chase was they couldnt just fire blindly through the walls phoenix three harvath yelled are you in here harvath came the reply roger that im coming out dont shoot chase stepped out into the hallway and walked toward them his arm was covered with blood is there anyone else here chase shook his head as murphy swept the rest of the apartment harvath ripped open chases sleeve and checked his wound does it hurt a lot it hit bone well get you taken care of replied harvath right now weve got to get out of here is there anything worth gathering up maybe i turned the place upside down fast and dirty but couldnt find anything if we had more time we dont already the sounds of approaching emergency vehicles could be heard in the distance the apartment is clean said murphy as he rejoined them what do you want to do harvath knew what he didnt want to do he didnt want to walk through the throngs of people out on the street around behind the burning building and off into the woods to pick up murphys car too much could go wrong his car the one with the book on the dashboard though was parked right outside it didnt matter if people saw it or gave a description to police they wouldnt be using it long enough to make a difference all they needed to be able to do was make it back to the barn with murphy on point the three men exited the apartment and quickly made their way down the stairs they laid chase down on the backseat murphy rode shotgun and harvath slid behind the wheel the onlookers stared their mouths agape they didnt know what to make of any of it the last thing the trio heard as they sped off were the cries of revulsion from the crowd as harvath drove over the body of the dead terrorist still lying sprawled in the middle of the street chapter two extensive medical kits had been allotted for the operation one was with riley turner and mansoor who along with andy bachmann had already left for the airport near stockholm the other belonged to the assault team and was sitting in the back of the moving truck that had been abandoned at the scene of the failed safe house raid harvath though had a couple of items in his bag of tricks that he never traveled without as he debriefed chase and cleaned up his wound he unwrapped a tampon cut off about an inch and packed it into the hole he then wrapped chases arm with duct tape it would do for now but chase was going to need professional medical help riley had arranged to delay the flight until they could get there it was a big enough aircraft and the three additional passengers would be posing as the security detail for the wealthy arab patient as long as chase didnt start bleeding they should be okay just to be sure harvath wrapped a few more pieces of duct tape around his arm it was going to be a pain in the ass to get off but that was a problem for later murphy sanitized the barn and the farmhouse as harvath helped chase put on his suit he must have left the phone in there knowing wed be tracking it said chase as he winced sliding his arm into his jacket karami definitely knew something was up stated harvath he reproduced your signal perfectly chase felt terrible i got those men killed no you didnt if id just found a way to look back out the window sooner maybe i could have warned you harvath shook his head and the two men fell silent you didnt see karami or sabah leave the building asked chase no but i wasnt looking if it wasnt for the guy that came through the window i never would have known there was a second apartment i thought you were dead chase let that sink in for a moment before saying how about the sheikh from qatar any idea who he is no replied harvath but thatll be one of the first questions mansoor is going to get asked i dont know how well get access to any of the forensics but ill bet the swedes find fried computer parts in at least one of those apartments that got blown up harvath nodded i agree they were getting ready to go operational chase said im telling you we need to hunt them down and we need to stop them first things first replied harvath you need to get your arm taken care of dont worry about my arm chase said as he tried to move it and failed as soon as we get this redneck bandage off and let a real doctor have a look ill be fine harvath doubted it chase was going to be out of the game for months if not longer whatever you say boss dont patronize me harvath he shot back i want you to promise me that youll wait for what for taking out karami and sabah said chase i want to be there harvath understood the mans desire for revenge harvath felt it just as intensely if not more so he had learned though to keep such things to himself lets figure out what kind of shape your arms in and then well talk chase held up his left index finger and pointed at harvath i want us to do it together harvath smiled the kid was a liar he just wanted to do it it had nothing to do with harvath he just didnt want to be left out im going to go make sure everything is ready we shove off in five okay roger that replied chase as he turned to the mirror and tried with one hand to straighten the knot harvath had tied in his tie staring at his reflection as he struggled he couldnt help but wonder if this was what so many of americas disabled vets went through he didnt like needing somebody elses help getting dressed in fact it pissed him off and reminded him of the ied videos the jihadists had been laughing at back at their safe house that only made him angrier the swedish airport authorities stamped the groups passports and waved them out toward the tarmac where they boarded their waiting aircraft sentinel medevac was a private company the carlton group hired jets from on occasion their normal clientele were humanitarian groups and international ngos sentinel was viewed as something akin to the red cross and that was why the old man liked working with them their planes were an excellent means of covertly moving personnel and equipment in and out of foreign countries what harvath liked about them was that in addition to their fleet of extensive highend aircraft sentinels ownera successful young doctor out of north carolinawas a patriot who was more than happy to assist the old man and his operators the doctor always sent the best jets and the galleys were always well stocked normally harvath waited until the plane had taken off before fixing himself a drink not this time losing all those men had been devastating he walked straight to the back of the plane dropped a handful of ice cubes into a glass and poured several fingers of makers mark he was halfway finished with his first drink before the plane had even been cleared for takeoff when its wheels finally left the ground he settled back in his seat and tried to make sense of what had happened operationally they had played their cards very close to their vest the old man had kept the needtoknow circle tight working long hours and doing several jobs himself nevertheless the operation had been a total failure worse than yemen in yemen all they had lost was a highvalue target in uppsala a highvalue target and his second in command had gotten away and five members of the operations assault team had been killed from a straight scorecard perspective it had been very very bad coming on the heels of the failed yemen op only made it worse karami the cell leader was a serious player who truly knew what he was doing requiring his safehouse to be completely sterile while cell phones were left in a secondary operations center of some sort across the street showed both discipline and intelligence picking up on chases signal via the windows and blinds showed an amazing attention to detail having prewired the secondary location to detonate showed an ability to think several steps ahead harvath and his team had been incredibly lucky to have gotten as close to karami as they had it would be very difficult to do so again but uppsala didnt appear to have failed for the same reason yemen had did yemen happen because of a leak or was there another reason despite how careful he had been could harvath have been followed by aazim aleems people would they kill their own man by blowing up the car he was in via an rpg rather than let him be extradited and interrogated by the americans it was possible anything was possible harvath made a mental note to be even more diligent in the future it made him think about the whirlwind of events that had just occurred technically as badly as the uppsala operation had gone it hadnt been a total failure they had mansoor aleem in custody and they had successfully inserted chase into the cell long enough for him to id its leader and pick up some minor intelligence on some supposed sheikh from qatar their newest problem was chases certainty that karami was about to activate some sort of attack harvath had witnessed firsthand aazims previous attacks by his european and chicago cells very few nights went by that harvath didnt picture the faces of the screaming children in the chicago train station who had come so close to being killed after that kind of trauma he had no idea how they could ever grow up to lead normal lives it was incredibly sad sadder still was the number of innocent people who had been killed around the world by muslim terrorists people who had been doing nothing more than going about their daily lives the majority of these victims had been muslims themselves in fact for all the propaganda to the contrary the biggest killers of muslims were other muslims if it were up to harvath hed drop all the supporters of a worldwide islamic caliphate onto an island and let them battle it out hed also include all those who supported islamic charities knowing full well their money was going to finance terrorism that you werent blowing yourself up or hijacking aircraft didnt mean you werent participating in the jihad there was jihad of the pocketbook as well there was also public relations jihad it was active daily in the american press either media figures denied entirely that there was a muslim terrorism problem or they tried to play the false moral equivalency card and paint christian fundamentalists as equally dangerous and prolific in their violence when asked for examples they often cite the oklahoma city bomber timothy mcveigh though mcveigh never claimed to be a christian and never cited the bible or any other religious text for that matter as his reason for carrying out his horrific act of terrorism it was amazing how many people believed the disinformation then there were those media figures who actually tried to put a happy face on muslim extremism and sharia law under the banner of cultural diversity surely the victims of honor killings and those beaten and killed for not wearing headscarves for dating men from outside their faith or for trying to convert to another religion would strongly disagree harvath was stunned at times by how uncommon common sense was as far as he was concerned all of the media figures and the politicians who enabled that kind of barbarism could go to the island too better yet he would have loved to have flown them all over to waziristan and dropped them off anyone who made it back alive could then spout off about anything they wanted until they had seen the evil done in the name of that religion and how good muslims were brutalized by the people of their own faith hed rather not hear them opine on the subject hed seen the worst of what was being done in the name of islam and it needed more attention not less for good muslims to be able to reform their faith and live peacefully with the rest of the world they needed american media and politicians on their side not the side of their enemies there were times when harvath wondered why he continued to do what he did why defend a country that included many who thought their nation was arrogant and deserved to be humbled and brought low why defend these people better yet agree or disagree why risk everything including your life over and over again for over million people you would never meet these were good questions and went to the core of who he was and why he did what he did harvath had become a seal after his father had died in part because he felt guilty about how rocky their relationship had been at the end but making your dead father somehow happy or proud of you wasnt enough fuel to have propelled a career like harvaths there had to be something deeper and there was harvath had no brothers or sisters because of his career his father had spent a lot of time on assignments in places he couldnt talk about he often left without even being able to say goodbye though his mother tried to compensate for his fathers lengthy absences he carried an emptiness that he had never been able to fill he always wanted to feel needed that he was worth coming home to or better yet was worth never leaving growing up on coronado island his best friend had been his nextdoor neighbor a developmentally delayed boy with an enlarged head named fred other children taunted him mercilessly and called him egghead though not particularly big harvath stood toe to toe with all comers to defend his best friend without his father around to teach him to fight and his fathers pals stopping by only occasionally to take him fishing and check up on his mom he had to learn how to defend himself and fred he became streettough real fast often fighting several other children at the same time never once was he afraid to do what had to be done to defend his friend he was the boys everpresent protector a role nobody played in his own life it was a void harvath wouldnt have filled until he joined the seals and had teammates comrades in arms to whom he would entrust his life on a regular basis and who always had his back was there a need in harvath to take risks and would that need have been there regardless of the amount of time his father spent deployed most likely that need to take risks in order to feel alive to do the impossible to face ones fears and not back down was present in every single warrior hed ever met they also shared a sense of honor in being chosen to stand and defend the country and people they held dear protecting them and protecting america making sure no harm came to either meant they were defending that which they cherished more than their very lives harvath willingly defended those he didnt agree with even those who loathed the very existence of men like him because as americans or allies he believed passionately in their rights as individuals to think and do what they wished it didnt matter how he might disagree with them or vice versa he felt it made him stronger to defend their rightswithout any expectation any recognition or any reward in part he and other warriors like him did it for themselves to have a better sense of selfworth it was who they were and what they did best they did it for the man next to them the men who had come before them and the men who had been taken from them on dangerous missions in dirty little places no one would ever hear about it was simple and it was complicated all at the same time much like harvath himself harvath lived by the adage that the measure of a man was what he did when no one else was looking he also knew having learned it with fred that very few people will stand up and put themselves in harms way to protect those who cannot protect themselves at its root protecting people was his calling in life it was something he couldnt ignore his honor wouldnt let him and in a sense it was because he had devoted himself to protecting the american dream for others that he had never been able to fully enjoy it for himself harvath couldnt stop thinking about the assaulters who had been killed he wondered how many of them had families most likely several of them maybe even all of them how many wives were they leaving behind how many children what kind of impact would losing their fathers have on them the stories that would never be read the hugs that would never be given the right piece of fatherly advice at the right time that now wouldnt be offered the impact was incalculable opening his eyes harvath lifted his head and looked toward the rear of the aircraft riley was trying to remove the hillbilly bandaid from around chases arm it wasnt going well almost as if she knew he was watching her she glanced up shook her head and went back to what she was doing harvath had no idea what that was supposed to mean and at this moment he didnt care he tried to focus his mind on rolling up the rest of aazims network before they could carry out any further attacks to stop them though harvath was going to have to predict where lightning was going to strike he was going to have to be in the right place at the right time or as the father of hockey great wayne gretsky taught his son skate to where the puck is going to be not where it has been the puck had been in sweden was it still there or had it moved someplace else if it had moved where would it be next those questions were still at the forefront of harvaths mind as he closed his eyes once more and his exhausted body slipped off into the regenerative unconsciousness of a deep black sleep the flight from stockholm to the former united states naval air station in keflavik iceland took just more than three hours harvath was still asleep when the wheels of the private jet touched down and jolted him awake though on paper the naval air station had been turned over to the icelandic defense agency in there was still a heavy american presence at the facility the aircraft taxied into a large hangar where an ambulance was waiting to take mansoor to the bases hospital riley had insisted that chase his arm in a sling come along as well so that they could take a better look at him chase could have hopped a flight back home if he had wanted to and gotten patched up back there riley had already irrigated the wound redressed it and started him on a course of antibiotics it hurt like hell though and he figured the sooner he knew the extent of the damage the sooner hed know how soon he could get back in the fight he also didnt want to go anywhere until he knew what mansoors prognosis was if the guy was going to be ready for interrogation again soon chase wanted to be there for it he knew the most about the network and he wanted to help guide some of the questions if not do a portion of the interrogation himself riley was going to stick around and wait for the prognosis as well even though shed be handing him over to a new doctor she still felt responsible for him harvath was the only one without a reason to stay in iceland the only thing he could think of was that if karami or sabah popped up somewhere in europe hed be a lot closer and get to them a lot faster from iceland than he would from dc something told him that europe was where the puck had been america was where he needed to skate to now thats where the puck was going to be he couldnt help but think that if aazim aleem had come to chicago in advance of those attacks and had planned on sending chase to new york while he went to la to oversee additional strikes the uppsala cell leader would have to do the same thing he had nothing to back that up though it was just a gut feeling his gut also told him that despite what she had said in the barn back in sweden he shouldnt give up on riley turner it could take days for them to run the battery of tests on mansoor this could turn out to be the perfect window hed been looking for to get to know her better and for her to get to know him coming off the deaths of the assault team though the timing wasnt right men had died on their operation she hadnt been at the scene but she was part of the team it was a loss for all of them it was also probably just as well the old man was going to want harvath to render a full debrief there was also the issue of monitoring the swedish investigation knowing the old man hed already reached out to the authorities in sweden with a piece of intelligence that pointed the finger of responsibility for what had happened at a completely different foreign intelligence service whatever service he chose to implicate he would do so in such a way as to not be airtight but to be enough to convince the swedes there was little doubt it also probably served one of the many other ops the old man was running at the moment he often likened running an intelligence service to dropping pebbles in a still pool you had to know not only how far out every ripple would radiate but which ones would intersect and with how much force the man was truly a savant was it the best way to treat an aligned nation like sweden no but it was unfortunately the way the game had to be played in the world of threedimensional chess checkers players found themselves swept from the board pretty fast you were either steps ahead of everyone even your allies or they were steps ahead of you the carlton group had been created to help catapult america back into the lead considering the old mans attention to detail harvath wasnt surprised when moments after stepping off the jet his cell phone rang yes sir he said moving aside for the ambulance team that was transporting mansoor and his stretcher down the stairs the old mans voice was as clear as if he were standing right next to harvath whats the situation there he asked theyre transferring massachusetts to the ambulance now harvath replied referring to mansoor aleem by his operational code name any change in his condition negative are you sure hes not faking it thats textbook for these guys you know harvath was well aware that they were taught to feign illness severe if possible to avoid interrogation for as long as possible they were also taught to inflict physical harm on themselves and to blame it on their captors in hopes of having their interrogations suspended altogether three seals harvath knew had been accused of abusing a prisoner in iraq after the guy had thrown himself out of the back of their truck and smashed his own head against his cell wall the seals were eventually exonerated but not until after being put through a ridiculous trial and having grandstanding members of congress suggest that all terrorist captures be videotaped via helmet cams and that they remain under video surveillance harvath had a better idea seeing as how most of them were of little to no intelligence value he figured he could save the us government a lot of money the united states should simply adopt a policy of no longer capturing terrorists if we find you youre dead no gitmo no nothing just dead it would be interesting to see what ran out firstvirgins in paradise or muslims down on earth willing to martyr themselves his heart stopped so i dont think hes faking it replied harvath whatever it is theres plenty of people there who can handle it said the old man i need you back here doubletime whats going on your little friend moonracer has been breaking a lot of eggs harvath knew immediately who he was talking about his little friend was a dwarf named nicholas who until recently had been better known to western intelligence agencies as the troll he dealt in the purchase and sale of highly sensitive and often classified information used to blackmail governments and powerful individuals nicholas had a way with databoth analyzing and accessing it he had crafted countless algorithms and one of his trading programs had been purchased by a major international financial institution none of his legitimate clients knew his true identity if they had none of them would have done business with him rightly assuming that his products contained countless trap doors harvath had crossed paths with nicholas on multiple occasions and their relationship had moved from one of hostility to detente to friendship despite his stature and various peccadilloes he was a man of amazing abilitiesabilities that harvath recognized could be of incredible value to the united states nicholas had discovered aazims nephew mansoor and the young mans connection to the terrorist network harvath wanted nicholas to be brought inside the carlton group and the old man had been dead set against it he had even threatened to terminate harvaths contract over the issue if harvath didnt drop it harvath didnt drop it nicholas was an asset and either he could be their asset or he could be someone elsesor worse continue to work on his own account for his role in stealing classified american intelligence nicholas had been made an enemy of the state the old man had constructed multiple conditions before he would accept nicholass involvement with the group of which the highest and hardest was getting nicholas pardoned presented with information on nicholass valuable skills and repeated cooperation with previous clandestine assignments a closeddoor meeting of the senate select committee on intelligence decided to make a recommendation in favor of his pardon to the president the president accepted their recommendation but the pardon came with multiple strings attached including the surrender of certain patents and trademarks nicholas held the money from which would be accepted in lieu of prison time while nicholas complained that uncle sugar as he liked to call the us government was bleeding him dry he was happy to join the carlton group because of his size he had spent most of his life alone he felt ennobled to be part of something bigger than himself moonracer was the group call sign hed been issued when the old man said that nicholas was breaking a lot of eggs harvath remembered nicholass warning when he had joined the group his type of work wasnt pretty much of it was also illegal breaking a lot of eggs meant he was going to have to do a lot of things reed carlton wouldnt like he promised to insulate him from as much of it as possible that said he was going to continue breaking eggs well sir replied harvath some organizations need leg breakers and some need egg breakers at least weve got the best we can debate that later i want you back here because hes apparently broken enough eggs to put together an omelet harvath gripped his phone a bit tighter and lowered his voice did we get a lead on something youll see when you get here now get that jet refueled and get moving harvath had no idea what nicholas had uncovered but he quietly prayed that it was something they could use to stop karami and the other cells before they could strike again chapter southern california larry salomon had finally hit the wall and asked if there was someplace he could lie down hank mcbride showed him to the guest room luke ralston though was too amped up to sleep there were too many unanswered questions moving around in his head he stayed in the kitchen poured himself another cup of coffee and turned the volume on the tv back up helicopter footage was being broadcast on all the local channels splitscreened with live shots of reporters speaking outside the gates to larry salomons home comparisons to the tatelabianca murders phil spector and even nicole simpson were being made though none of those murders were directly comparable to what had happened the only thing they had in common was that celebrity was involved and that was all that the los angeles newscasters needed as macabre as it was people loved stories like these and it was where the phrase if it bleeds it leads came from toss in a ton of money and more than a little dash of hollywood and the story was destined to bust out as a national news phenomenon the reporters still had very little to go on they knew that there were multiple fatalities inside the house and that the residence belonged to legendary movie producer lawrence salomon there was no mention of russian spetsnaz there was no mention of the two dead documentary filmmakers and there was no mention of a search under way for either salomon or ralston ralston had no doubt though that it was on bigtime in fact there were probably police officers going through his house right now more officers would be talking to his neighbors detectives would be pulling his phone records as well as salomons to see who each had been talking to in the hours leading up to the events at salomons house when the restaurant where larry had left his car opened up theyd be calling the authorities and more officers would swoop down on the restaurant the vehicle would be impounded and staff would be questioned all in the hope of uncovering even the smallest detail that might explain what had happened even though the murders had happened further up in coldwater canyon it would still be in the lapds jurisdiction that meant that some of the best detectives in the country would be working the case ralston wondered how long it would take for them to uncover his background probably a while the army was very protective of the identity of its special operations forces especially tier one delta operators considering the magnitude of what had happened though his background wouldnt stay hidden forever in the meantime he had to hope that the lapd detectives working the case were going to look at the size of those russians and start putting things together what worried ralston though was that without anyone to explain who the bad guys were the russians might be viewed as salomons security whod all been taken out in an attempt to kidnap the famous film producer the more ralston thought of it the more he started to worry that that might end up being the working hypothesis salomon didnt have lots of people up to his house ever since rachael had been murdered he hadnt been the same and his friends and colleagues would tell the police as much hell even ralstons visits to the house seemed to be happening less often he hadnt even known about the documentary salomon had been putting together right in his home office as good as the lapd detectives were they would still be tempted to take the path of least resistance too often in law enforcement investigations could be more about closing the file than about solving the case without any witnesses the police would be operating in a vacuum theyd be going strictly on the forensics ralston went through in his mind what theyd probably already assembled outside the home they had his wrecked a ford econoline van and one very mangled body maybe they had found the getaway drivers shotgun inside the house the man named jeremy lay dead in the kitchen and chip in the home office one dead russian lay near the dining room and two more lay upstairs one having been shot from inside salomons closet cum safe room finally two of salomons vehicles were not in the garage no jewelry cash artwork or other valuables were apparently missing ralston asked himself what hed be thinking right now if he was an lapd detective the russian on the first floor with his throat cut would be one of his primary focal points the body of the young filmmaker jeremy would be the other one had been killed with a gun the other a knife in fact ralston had left the fillet knife right there on the floor next to the first russian he had killed though no law enforcement agency had his fingerprints on file once the prints were lifted off the knife theyd be sent for verification to the army and thats where the unraveling of his background would begin even someone who wasnt a detective would be able to figure out that the fillet knife had come from the block in the kitchen it meant that whoever had cut the throat of the man outside the dining room hadnt come to the house prepared that said a lot about motive what he also hoped would be apparent was the chronology of events on the first floor killing the man outside the dining room with a knife meant that ralston didnt have a gun at the time jeremy had been killed in the kitchen while eating a bowl of cereal only an idiot would assume that ralston had breezed through the kitchen grabbed a knife moved on and sliced the throat of the man outside the dining room only to return to the kitchen and shoot jeremy that would just be stupid and while all of this seemed obvious to ralston he realized he had the benefit of knowing everything that had happened he couldnt trust that the police would put things together the same way retracing his steps in his minds eye he went through salomons office and up the back stairs on the floor of the hallway was another very large and very dead man the more he thought of it the more he realized how their look screamed private security what didnt scream private security and should be a dead giveaway to the cops was the fact that none of them was carrying an id ralston had patted two of them down and had not been able to find anything that was a pretty strong calling card for contract killers eventually he assumed ballistics would show that jeremy and the man lying in the hallway upstairs had been killed with the same weapon would they figure out that ralston had taken it from the dead russian downstairs after cutting his throat then there was the man in the bathroom whom salomon had blown a hole through with his shotgun with the fireplace tool nearby on the bathroom floor and the rippedup drywall even a neophyte would have been able to tell what happened there that being the case ralston still tried to imagine any other way it could have been interpreted he couldnt come up with anything it was just too obvious that the dead man in the bathroom was trying to tear his way into the safe room and that someone presumably salomon had blown him away tests for gunpowder residue inside the closet would confirm that based on the wounds the man in the hallway had received one round beneath the nose and another through the throat what conclusions would the police draw ralston wondered that kind of shot placement coupled with the knife work hed done downstairs would signal a high degree of skill theyd know salomon didnt do those things those things had to have been done by a professional firing from inside the closet with a shotgun though in their minds would be consistent with something salomon would do the question was would the detectives put it all together this way it seemed to ralston that the evidence should be crystal clear salomon had been under siege and ralston had rescued him there was only one problem and the movie producer had called it right at the crime sceneinnocent people dont flee that would be the one glaring thing that didnt make sense no matter how clear the evidence was there could only be one reason in a detectives mind for why salomon and ralston had fledthey were guilty of something from there it was only one step to any number of harebrained motives the cops might come up with ralston and salomon had had an argument ralston had kidnapped salomon ralston intended to do away with salomon but decided to finish the job somewhere else it didnt matter whether it made sense or not ralston had been around long enough to know that with a big enough hammer and the right amount of force a square peg could be pounded through a round hole the longer it took for the police to find them the more they were going to believe that at least one of them was guilty of something ralston didnt have to wonder which one of them that would be he knew all too well he also knew how his military background would be used as an excuse to allocate significant and extraordinary resources to the investigation that was something he hadnt thought of at first the lapd had a very deep bench but when it came to hunting a guy like him they would not be shy about asking for help very soon they were going to have a former operator if not a team of them out looking for him as soon as that happened it was going to be nearly impossible for him to get to the bottom of what had happened every time he thought he understood his window of opportunity it was suddenly slammed shut there was too much at stake though to let that deter him if there was one thing he had learned early on at delta it was that when god closes a window it just means you need to kick open a door whoever had sent that wet work team to larry salomons house was going to learn what a mistake it was to fuck with a tier door kicker but first he was going to need to figure out exactly who had sent that wet work team for that to happen he was going to need access to very special informationinformation that would not be easy to come by he knew who he had to call he also knew that person had promised to kill him if and when he ever did chapter not only do you have a lot of nerve calling me said the voice on the other end of the line but you lied to my assistant lied to her about one of my kids to pull me out of a meeting im sorry replied ralston i knew you wouldnt take the call unless youre damn right i wouldnt have taken your call in fact i have no idea why im even still talking to you ralston knew why she was still talking to him but he kept his mouth shut they both knew his giving voice to it would have only made her angrier though and that would have guaranteed the end of the conversation hot tempers ran in their family ali listen he began you dont get to call me ali okay alisa said ralston relenting hed burned this bridge and hed have to eat as much crow as she chose to dish out in order to be able to get across this river in fact the woman plowed on the last time we spoke i told you never to call me again i know you did i wouldnt call you unless it was important important you want to talk about important my sisters trial that was important ralston had known before even dialing her number that she would go there she still resented him he didnt blame her had their roles been reversed he might have felt the same way you were the only one she said the only one she took a breath and ralston didnt attempt to fill the silence she needed to vent to be angry everyone testified against those two monsters she began again everyone but you and its because of you that those bastards never went to prison they never served a single solitary day for what they did to my sister so fuck you luke fuck you ralston had met alisa sevans younger sister ava not long after arriving in los angeles he had been invited to his first hollywood party a saturday afternoon barbecue at a directors home in malibu he saw ava chatting with a group of friends out by the pool she was stunning she was wearing a bikini with a brightly colored sarong tied provocatively around her hips her thick black hair spilled over her shoulders ralston had never seen a more gorgeous woman in his life when he introduced himself her friends found it cute that he had no idea who the twentyfiveyearold soapopera actress was she found him fascinating unlike the pretend badboy actors and models she had dated he was the real deal he was also in hollywood but not of hollywood which made him refreshing and quite a find even more important he made her feel safe their relationship was very passionate right from the start ava was a party girl and liked to have a good time she drank dabbled in drugs and was an absolute tigress in the bedroom though ralston could have done without the drugs part everything else about her was spectacular and he chalked it up to being young sexy and successful in hollywood doing coke or dropping some ecstasy from time to time was nothing more than a way to accessorize her lifestyle ralston though kept his recreational pursuits to cocktails his motto was you always know what comes out of a bottle not long after they began dating ava brought him to meet her family her father one of las premier criminal defense attorneys lived in pacific palisades with avas mother and her two yorkshire terriers that first dinner was also when ralston met her older sister alisa she was equally attractive if not more so but thats where their similarities ended while ava was wild and devilmaycare alisa was focused and traditional she had gone to law school and had become a successful entertainment attorney choosing to trade on her smarts instead of her looks she had married an investment banker in her late twenties and they had three children though skeptical of ralston at first the family had come to appreciate him as a solid man who truly cared for ava their hope was that hed be a good influence on her she needed to grow up and everyone had been concerned about her substanceabuse problems as levelheaded as ralston was though hed fallen completely under avas spell though he was tough as hell he was entranced by her and that led to making excuses for her behavior he loved the merrygoround they were on and he had no desire to get off was ava a drinker sure but she never missed a day of work and always delivered her lines perfectly drugs yes she did drugs but not enough to be worried about or so he had thought ava actually had a bad addiction problem that was getting progressively worse she tried to hide it from ralston and the rest of the people who cared for her but soon no one could deny it she and ralston broke up three times and each time he took her back thinking he could fix her finally he insisted she get into some sort of rehabilitation program ava reluctantly agreed and enrolled in one not far from where they had first met it was supposed to last for weeks within days she was home proclaiming herself cured it was one of the saddest things ralston had ever seen ava held out for seven days not even having so much as a sip of wine with dinner then she fell right off a cliff she not only began using again it also became apparent that she had run up some pretty big debts her jewelry went first then she traded in her leased mercedes for a much cheaper hybrid vehicle she could claim all she wanted that she was trying to give the earth a hug but ralston knew why shed made the switch avas father called him a week later and told him that ava had reached out for a sizable loan he wanted to confirm what it was for and ralston told him the truth avas drug problem was completely out of hand the soap opera had placed her on a leave of absence even their makeup artists couldnt hide what ava was doing to herself though ralston probably should have left her for real and allowed her to hit bottom he couldnt he stayed with her but to his credit he never gave her a single cent neither would her father as it turned out but ralston didnt learn that until later avas familyher mother father and alisahad joined in a united front they would pay for rehab if she would fully commit to it but other than that she was on her own alisa kept in contact with ralston from that point forward ava was so angry with her family for not helping her out that she stopped speaking to them when ava finally lost her apartment ralston knew that if he didnt let her move in with him some opportunist would take her in and get her to do god only knew what as screwed up as she was he loved her he wasnt a complete idiot though he still had to work during the day and so cleared all of the booze out of his house along with anything of value she might be tempted to steal and pawn for drugs he also quit drinking hoping that by setting a good example he could help her get clean it didnt work ava used the brains her family was renowned for and what little of her looks she had left to get what her addictionriddled body needed bad people reentered her life from an earlier time before ralston alisa though did know them and she warned him to keep them away from her ava was circling the drain there was little ralston could do short of kidnapping her and taking her deep into the mountains somewhere to go completely cold turkey he decided that there was no other option if she kept going like this she was going to kill herself he began looking for a cabin to rent and started studying the phases of detoxification and what to expect alisa bought a stack of nutritional books aimed at rebalancing the body and had them sent over to his apartment she also offered to pay for half of the expenses for renting the cabin ralston appreciated her offer he wasnt exactly rolling in money he was wrapping up a project with a studio and figured he could be on the road to the cabin with ava in two weeks ava had even mentioned that if they could just get away she thought she could hit the reset button on her life it made him feel better about his plan maybe there was hope after all that hope faded after about two days avas hybrid was repossessed and at first ralston thought that might be a good thing it was better that she wasnt driving then she took another turn for the worse she disappeared for three days and came back with needle marks in her arms when ralston asked her where she had been she told him she didnt want to talk about it she pushed past him and went into the bathroom to take a shower she was in there for hours and ralston could hear her crying the entire time he needed to get her the hell out of la he called the producer he was working for at the time and asked to be let go early the producer said that they couldnt afford to replace him at the moment and said that he was sorry but ralston would have to stay ralston went in to work the next day and when he came home ava was gone again at two in the morning she called him crying she was incoherent but he managed to get her to tell him where she was the abandoned house was near crenshaw boulevard in las dangerous hyde park area ralston kicked in the door there were empty liquor bottles beer cans and cigarette butts but no ava in the back portion of the house he found a filthy mattress lying in the middle of the floor a couple of portable lamps were positioned on each side they had been switched off but were still warm to the touch nearby was the plastic packaging for a particularly vile sex toy ralstons heart sank hed been on enough movie sets to know what he was looking at he needed to find her as he stepped into the kitchen he heard a noise from outside it sounded like the lid of a dumpster had been dropped when he made it to the alley he saw two men in the distance running away he also found a dumpster without opening its lid he knew what he was going to find inside praying to god ralston eventually found the strength to lift the lid what he saw broke his heart wide open by the time he dialed the men hed seen running from the alley were long gone in the days that followed the cops asked him a lot about avas drug use they wanted to know who she bought from ralston couldnt help them he had no idea alisa provided the police with a ton of information ava had met her dealer through one of the soap operas crew members alisa even knew the identity of the next person up who supplied her dealer the detectives found her depth of knowledge interesting to say the least and wanted to know how she knew as much as she did alisa was no fool she was an attorney after all and never answered the officers questions at least not truthfully that didnt come out until the trial alisa and her father had paid off both the dealer and the supplier to not provide ava with any more drugs both of the subhumans had agreed at first and then tried to extort more money out of the family threatening to hook ava on even worse substances when they refused the drug pushers had made good on their threat both alisa and her father were convinced it was the same two men who had been responsible for avas death putting them at the scene of the crime would have been all that was necessary to secure a conviction but as much as ralston wanted to see the people responsible for avas death pay he hadnt seen the faces of the men in the alley he couldnt id the two drug dealers as the figures hed seen running away from the dumpster even the district attorney tried privately to convince ralston to testify against the two men they were career criminals with horrific records it didnt matter if they were really the ones who were responsible they had been responsible for untold suffering and if they didnt kill ava they were going to wind up killing someone elses son or daughter the arguments were not lost on ralston at the very least these were the men who had gotten ava hooked on drugs and continued to feed her addiction but ralston had only one thing that truly belonged to him in life his honor as much as he wanted to kill both the pushers with his bare hands he couldnt lie he could not positively identify them as the two men from the scene without his testimony the case had fallen apart and so had his relationship with avas family they had needed him and in their minds he had let them down now several years later he needed them i understand why youre still angry he said are you patronizing me boy do you have balls you know i should have had you drummed out of the business alisa i need your help the woman laughed you want my help with something let me rephrase my prior statement you have colossal balls ralston considered telling her that not a day went by that he didnt think about ava that he didnt wish for some sort of penance he could perform for letting ava down though he knew avas addiction was just thatavas addictionhe still felt incredibly guilty for her death he tortured himself wondering whether if he had quit the movie hed been working on he could have gotten ava up to that cabin and gotten her sober he wondered what would have happened if hed chased those men down the alley would he have been able to id them in court would he have even survived the altercation all he had was the tire iron from his car what if theyd been carrying firearms i never wanted ava to die he said please there was silence several moments of it please he repeated i need your help alisa knew that ralston was a good man she also knew that the men accused of avas death were the ones who were responsible she was one hundred percent sure about that ralston had allowed avas killers to go free it made it very difficult to hear from him now much less be asked to help him if this is about cozying you up to one of my firms clients to help you get some movie deal i swear to god ill make good on my promise to kill you do you understand that its not about business im in trouble if you need a lawyer youve come to the wrong place replied alisa youll have to find somebody else no said ralston i dont need a lawyer at least not yet she had no idea what was going on but he definitely had her attention what have you done ill explain it when i see you oh just like that were having a meeting she replied sorry im booked damn it ali this is serious what this is luke is my time which gets billed at eight hundred and seventyfive dollars an hour at least thats what i get paid when i am working which is what i was doing before you called pretending to be from my childrens school and pulled me away from my client and a very important negotiation im trying to hammer out for her ralston decided he was going to have to give her something to get her to meet with him and as strained as their relationship had been she was the closest thing to family he had did you hear what happened at larry salomons house did i hear about it everyones heard about it its all people in this town are talking about this morning why would you ask me she said her voice suddenly trailing off tell me you had nothing to do with what took place at salomons house i need to see you i need a favor oh my god ali please he said i need to see you did you kill those people no comment no comment she replied oh my god ali come on what happened to salomon hes fine said ralston hes with me he can vouch for everything then i suggest you two turn yourselves in to the police pronto we cant at least not yet thats what i need to talk to you about alisa was quiet as she thought about how to handle it are you still there ralston asked quiet she replied im thinking ralston remained quiet where are you she finally asked are you somewhere in la ralston was hesitant about answering but realized he was going to have to trust her were south how far south san diego mexico city he decided that for the time being it was better for all involved if he didnt give her too much information until he knew for sure that she was on his side he was going to be very careful after all she had promised to kill him and though he doubted that she really meant it there was still part of him that knew better than to cross her or her father can you get down to manhattan beach he asked picking a quiet beach community just north of where he was well you certainly cant come up and meet me in my office can you it was a rhetorical question that ralston didnt need to answer how soon can you be there alisa checked her watch ill have to figure out what to tell my client and cancel the rest of my appointments depending on traffic i can probably be there in about an hour they picked a place to meet and ralston said thank you i really appreciate your doing this for me dont thank me just yet wait till you get my bill i charge double for travel chapter ralston printed alisas picture from her law firms website and gave it to hank who made the short hop up to manhattan beach to make sure she wasnt being followed he sat across the street from a small shop on manhattan beach boulevard called barbie k wearing what he referred to as his retired mans formal attireflipflops tshirt and a pair of board shortshe fit right in with the rest of the locals ralston had picked the small boutique off the internet and told alisa that there would be an envelope waiting for her when she got there she wasnt crazy about all the cloakanddagger but she had agreed ralston figured his picture had to already be circulating with the police it was only a matter of time before it wound up on the news and he was named as a person of interest the last thing he wanted was to meet alisa anywhere near a television set or where a police car might roll by fortunately california offered the perfect place for them to meet and talk without being disturbed knowing what a fashionista alisa was especially when it came to her shoes ralston had written a note telling her what to buy and where to meet him and then had hank leave it with one of the salesgirls at the boutique fortyfive minutes later alisa showed up fifteen minutes after that she exited the store wearing a new much more casual outfit and a sensible pair of shoes hank followed her from across the street and watched as she walked back to her car popped the trunk and deposited the shopping bag with the business attire and highheeled shoes she had driven down from la in to her credit she didnt pull the note back out of her pocket she knew where she was supposed to go next the street ran downhill toward the ocean and it was easy for hank to hang back and watch convinced that she was not being followed he pulled out his cell phone when she got to the little restaurant and called his house ralston answered on the first ring shes clean he said ill see you in five ralston had not wanted to leave salomon alone he was still sleeping but ralston was afraid of what he might do if he woke up and no one was there he might rationalize a quick call or email to his office and then all hell would break loose when hank got back he described what alisa was wearing and then handed over the keys to his car ralston had borrowed a change of clothes from his friend plus a baseball cap and sunglasses hank gave him ten minutes and then picked up his phone dialing to block caller id he described alisa to the hostess and asked if she could bring her to the phone as it was midafternoon it didnt take long to track her down the beach should be very nice right now he said especially south of the pier then he hung up alisa went back to her table paid for her diet coke and left the restaurant she walked the block and a half down to the beach and stepped onto the sand the weather had been nice for several days it was sunny and the sand was warm she didnt visit the beach normally at this time of year in fact she didnt visit the beach much at all between the kids and work she didnt seem to have much time owing to the unusually nice weather there were more people out than she would have expected only in california she thought could this many people avoid work in the middle of the week she looked around for luke but she didnt see him so she continued walking toward the water the waves were a decent size and there were dozens of surfers bobbing up and down in the ocean waiting for the next one to carry them in at the waters edge she removed her sandals it felt good to be barefoot she watched as a nice wave began to form and the surfers paddled hard to catch it tilting up her face she stood for a moment enjoying the warmth of the sun she had no idea ralston was standing behind her until he spoke hello ali alisa didnt turn around she wasnt ready yet she stayed where she was her face upturned to the sun when you close your eyes and listen to the sound of the ocean its hard to imagine theres anything wrong in the world ralston let her have a few more seconds of soaking up the sun the years had been kind to her being a mother a wife a successful attorney it all seemed to agree with her she was even more beautiful than he remembered she had long black hair and green eyes just like ava and the same long dark eyelashes she kept herself in very good shape but the sex appeal she radiated was different than her sisters had been alisas sex appeal came not so much from her looks but from her selfconfidence how about a walk he finally said she nodded and they walked along the waters edge away from the pier ralston seemed to have trouble deciding what to say and it was alisa who broke the silence im billing you for the new clothes as well as my travel time ralston smiled fair enough you want to tell me what happened he did he wanted to tell her all of it but he needed to be careful last night would have been rachael salomons twentyfirst birthday rachael was larrys daughter wasnt she killed on a trip to israel or egypt ralston nodded israel did they ever catch who did it the israelis had their suspicions but no they never did catch who did it that must have been very painful for him the irony of the two situations wasnt lost on him rachael was the salomons only child and it ended up destroying their marriage elizabeth left larry and moved back to manhattan thats very sad said alisa i dont think she liked la and the movie business much anyway replied ralston but it is sad as my father says the truest test of gold is fire hows he doing hes fine still practicing law ralston smiled again i know i see his name in the papers all the time without promotion alisa said with a smile as she quoted him again something terrible happens nothing ralston chuckled your father has always been a smart guy and he makes sure everyone knows it i remember that joke he told me the first night i came to the house alisa rolled her eyes the whole it takes at least two jews to outsmart an armenian hes definitely proud of his heritage my mothers jewish and she absolutely hates that joke i know said ralston ava told me after we left that night your mom puts up with a lot but deep down she loves your fathers big personality the mention of ava brought a lull to their conversation a wave broke and washed up onto the beach neither of them moved out of its path the wet sand was heavy and difficult to walk through you know my parents liked you a lot alisa said i liked them too you were the first person that ava brought home that my dad didnt complain about as soon as you were out the door everybody else tried to impress him you didnt he liked that he wasnt crazy about me being older than ava though said ralston true until my mom reminded him that they had the same age difference even though it was small talk the conversation was good for both of them they both needed to heal as avas older sister alisa had felt partly to blame for avas death that guilt had been projected onto ralston for not testifying she needed to stop blaming him for the pain she felt over avas death and ralston needed to stop blaming himself they both needed to let go and to be let go hows brent ralston said changing the subject to alisas husband hes fine the kids theyre good too she replied but we could have done the whole hows your family thing over the phone ralston knew that wasnt true they needed to see each other they needed to acknowledge together that ava was gone they needed to close that chapter and as painful as it was put it behind them it was the only way they could move forward it was the only way that he could be sure that she would help him alisa noticed that ralston was limping are you okay she asked what about larry is he okay were both fine he replied but youre limping ralston waved it off my hip acts up from time to time dont worry about it what happened its a long story alisa pointed down the coastline its a long beach ralston looked at the ocean and then back at her as they walked he told her everything that had happened why havent you called the police she asked once he had finished no district attorney no matter how publicity hungry would bring charges in this case you need to turn yourselves in we cant not yet at least and thats why i need your help said ralston alisa looked at him i dont understand why you cant turn yourselves in because the men who came to kill larry were professionals whoever hired them not only can afford to send more he probably will you know who sent them we have an idea said ralston then tell the police tell the district attorney they can help protect you as another wave rolled up onto the sand ralston stopped and turned to look at her the men who came to kill larry were russian special forcesspetsnaz i dont need to tell you how influential the russians are in los angeles no he didnt need to tell her there was a large russian community in la and a part of it was composed of russian armenians because of her fathers heritage hed attracted a lot of their business his reputation as the toughest criminal defense attorney in los angeles attracted the rest of the russians especially many of the most colorful and less than virtuous you dont think the police can protect you do you she said i know they cant there are just too many foxes in the henhouse so what are you going to do ralston didnt need to think about his answer for starters im going to find out who sent that team to kill larry and let me guess she said thats where i come in ralston nodded those three hitters inside larrys house were fresh off the boat somebody local had to set it all up they needed to be met at the airport given their weapons driven to salomons thats the way these things normally work what do you want me to do she asked take out an ad in the russian kurier newspaper id like you to talk to your father im guessing that theres only a handful of people in la who could have put this together most likely its someone who worked for the russian fsb or its predecessor the kgb hold it said alisa that my dad has represented some unsavory people from that community doesnt mean he knows who to go to for contract killings im not saying he does replied ralston what i need is for you to ask him he knows enough people one of them is going to know who could have put something like this together and what happens when word gets back to this person that my father is asking questions whats to say theyre not going to come after him or my mother ralston tried to set her mind at ease your fathers wellrespected in that community nothing is going to happen to him and nothing is going to happen to your mom im glad youre so confident ali your dads a smart guy we both know that he knows how to ask questions without getting himself in trouble there are probably a hundred people who can tell him what i need to know and very likely they all owe your dad a favor im just asking for him to cash one in for me and why would he want to do that she asked ralston looked at her the attraction hed never acted upon but had always felt slightly guilty about while dating ava was still there he tried to put it out of his mind he knew she had felt it and fought it as well that was the reason she hadnt hung up on him when he called it was why she was standing here on the beach with him now it was why she wanted to help him she just needed a reason to something other than the feelings shed always harbored for her sisters boyfriend your father wont need a reason said ralston and he wont ask you for one i was good to ava he knows that i tried to help her thats all that should matter and if he says no he wont replied ralston youre pretty sure of yourself arent you said alisa no what im sure of is you you wont let him say no before she could respond he removed a small piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to her memorize this and then burn it what is it she asked its an email account i want you to use so we can communicate the instructions are there ive left a signed agreement in the draft folder retaining you as my attorney ive also left a letter clearly stating that you have directed me to turn myself in to the police and that i intend to do so once larrys safety can be guaranteed he replied what about your safety ralston closed her hand over the piece of paper and let his hand linger atop hers i can take care of myself alisa thought about drawing her hand back but didnt why wont you tell me whos behind all of this i cant he said as he let go of her hand not yet please just talk to your father for me with that he turned and walked away alisa watched him go her mind filled with questions about what kind of trouble he was in as well as what kind of person would send a russian hit team after one of the most popular producers in hollywood chapter new york city do you always travel with security julia winston asked as she took another sip of the drc montrachet that james standing had ordered they were sitting at a corner table in new yorks famed le bernardin restaurant the billionaires protective detail occupied two additional tables a respectable distance away unfortunately the world can be a dangerous place he replied lowering his glass back to the table the reporter still had many more questions she wanted to ask him and she wasted no time picking up her pad and pencil she said thats a perfect place for us to pick back up lets talk about the world as you see it or more precisely how youd like to see it id like to see us all get along meaning meaning were all citizens of the world what happens in one nation can affect another and because of that we need a better collaborative decisionmaking process it must be something that allows for more intelligent decisions to be made and for those decisions to be made faster with less bickering and footdragging we share a planet where a volcano that erupts in iceland can disrupt flights in europe an earthquake and tsunami that sweep japan can destroy nuclear reactors causing radiation to drift across the pacific to the us these are all things of collective interest and affect more than just one nation agreed julia nodded where these items of collective interest exist where multiple nations have skin in the game as it were it is my opinion that the only way to get the right things done is by subordinating state sovereignty in favor of international law and for international organizations as well standing smiled yes in fact i just came from a reception at the un you see its all about clarity of purpose if we can come together with a shared set of values and a shared sense of purpose we can make the world a much better place lets take economics for instance a subject i know you and i are both interested in we cannot continue the failed economic policies of the last thirty years our planet is dying and we have more people than ever before in poverty the only way to bring about reform is for the pendulum to swing from the market toward the state julia looked up from her pad but hasnt the free market actually lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty standing shook his head the capitalistic system is morally bankrupt what about india and china average incomes there have skyrocketed over the last thirty years im glad you mentioned china china is a perfect example of what staterun capitalism can achieve it proves that capitalism doesnt require democracy in fact it operates better without it and as far as india is concerned it is home to a third of the poorest people on the planet id think twice about using india as an example of the benefits of capitalism so we should ignore that the s and s often known as the new golden age of capitalism saw the proportion of the worlds population living on a dollar a day or less drop so dramatically that it was enough to offset rising populations in developing countries she asked not at all replied standing life has in fact gotten better for people around the world that is thanks to globalization but quality of life is nowhere near as good as it should be the planet is possessed of abundant resources and wealth yet yet you think that wealth should be spread around correct i think that if it is in our power to make the lives of our fellow human beings better we should do everything we can to make that happen would that include transferring americas wealth lets say to citizens in poorer nations standing laughed what wealth america is bankrupt in fact if we had a global reset america would be much better off better off how he thought about it for a moment and then said this is oversimplifying it but picture a homeowners association somewhere in america lets say there are fifty homes the spectrum of the owners indebtedness will run from no debt and healthy bank balances to one maybe two families who are hanging on by their fingernails not sure how theyll afford their next bag of groceries much less their next mortgage payment julia looked at him youre saying the family who has worked hard paid off their mortgage and has saved their money should bail out the family who cant afford their house much less groceries its not that simple cautioned standing what happens if the poor family defaults on their mortgage why dont we examine why they cant afford their house and groceries did they bite off more than they could chew who knows maybe mom and dad just had a run of bad luck maybe they both got laid off that these people have financial problems doesnt mean they deserve them im not saying they do but answer my question said standing what happens if this family goes under and defaults on their mortgage i assume theyll be foreclosed on and eventually evicted correct replied standing and what happens to the house then it goes on the market at what price at whatever the market will bear said julia thats the way markets work not in this case you see the bank doesnt just have one house it has thousands hundreds of thousands it doesnt want to be in the home ownership business it wants to be in the moneylending business its motivation is not to hang around and wait for the free market system to work it wants to dump that house as quickly as possible and to do that its going to dramatically mark down the price what would that do to the values of the other properties in the homeowners association it would effectively lower them which means through no fault of your own the equity in your home has been diminished so what would make more sense losing your equity or everyone chipping in together to make sure everyone succeeds the woman looked at him youre offering a false choice no im not of course you are mr standing if i have worked hard saved my money and paid off my mortgage i shouldnt have to bail out another homeowner not even if they have fallen on hard times he asked imagine if you were in their shoes i have no doubt that it would be terrible but it isnt the governments job to take money from one group and give it to another standing smiled again really what do you call taxes then i disagree with a lot of how the us government spends my money but were not talking about taxes in a way we are what happens when the family in our scenario doesnt pay their share of the fees and assessments of the homeowners association i would imagine that their property would end up getting a lien placed on it she replied but in the meantime the associations expenses still need to be paid for and that burden falls more heavily on the other owners they have to dip into their reserves or if the reserves are too thin they have to pay more in order to cover those who cant we can push those who have the most to give more but as increasing numbers of homeowners go under sooner or later the burden to make up what they cannot contribute will be overwhelming we wont be able to collect enough from the wealthiest homeowners to make up for it wouldnt it be better not to mention easier to simply rebalance the scales the sooner you can get that family who is in default back into a job and working the better it is for everyone the prosperity effect as i like to call it inures to everyones benefit this is about recognizing peoples dignity and in no place on earth she said have the freedom and dignity of the individual been more available and assured than in america human dignity is a global concern replied standing there cant be social cohesion as long as there is such a vast chasm between rich and poor in the world and you see dismantling capitalism as the answer she asked i see unfettered capitalism as the reason the chasm exists human dignity cannot be realized without equitable income distribution because human dignity and social cohesion matter to all of us this is an issue that transcends national sovereignty therefore it should be dealt with by international law and international governing bodies she replied repeating his earlier statement exactly said standing this is why a global reset would be so good for so many nations including the united states as with the homeowners association everyone would benefit it would give every nation the chance to be rid of its debts and to start fresh but what you fail to realize is that one persons debt is another persons asset i look at my mortgage much differently than my bank does to me its a debt one that i took on willingly by the way and one that im morally obligated to pay back to the bank its a business transaction which it took on willingly and from which it rightly expects to profit thereby serving the interests of its shareholders no one put a gun to either of our heads so the housing bubble all happened by accident asked standing no julia replied the housing bubble happened for a multitude of reasons one of the biggest was the government strongarming banks into providing mortgages to people who didnt qualify people have a right to a place to live youll forgive me mr standing but i think you and i have a very different view of what rights are rights should be what an enlightened government decides is best for everyone the reporter shook her head as americans we hold that we have been endowed by our creator with our rights these rights cannot be taken away or limited by any government we have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness standing said with a wave of his hand i know but tell me how anyone can be happy without a place to live theres nothing in the founding documents that says the government owes you a house theres also nothing in there that says the government owes you a job an education or medical care those documents you love so much were written over two hundred years ago he replied there is no possible way americas founding fathers could have seen how complex society would become and if they had been able to see into the future you think they would have felt it best for people to be ruled over by an elite group government should provide opportunity i agree but government isnt the solution to our problems julia stated government is the problem i wouldnt have figured you for a radical ms winston im not really it sounds to me as if youd like to do away with government i dont want to do away with government she replied i want to make it work so do i said standing and if we all started over together the global economy would instantly rebound but once we start over how would you prevent disparities from growing again its a fact of life that some people will work harder than others some people even will choose not to work wed need a universal set of rules applied to everyone equally these rules would also govern capitalism absolutely he replied capitalism is the source of all thats wrong in the world it has become too big for any one nation to regulate people are hurting and it is within our power to stop that hurt we are a noble species it is our duty to lift people out of despair the only way to do that though is to challenge global capitalism headon with redesigned international institutions and far more encompassing international laws all overseen by a global governing body she said for collective issues like human dignity and things that affect it of course individual rights have to take a backseat for the good of everyones collective rights is there anything this global governing body wouldnt have control over it seems that almost anything could be placed beneath the umbrella of human dignity and collective rights i see what youre doing replied standing with a wry grin youre trying to box me in the journalist shook her head i just find it interesting that a billionaire someone who has so benefited from capitalism should be such an outspoken proponent of socialism standing bristled at the remark youre an attractive woman my dear but you had better wise up big tits and a pretty smile are only going to get you so far julia was stunned by his vulgarity excuse me you have no idea how offensive i find that remark do you have any clue any clue at all how fatiguing it is to be committed to doing good only to be hammered for it day in and day out by people like you people like me yes you freemarket zombies all you do is complain about government intervention you lie to anyone who will read your columns listen to your radio programs or watch your tv shows you tell them we need less government regulation you tell people that capitalism works precisely because people pursue their own selfinterest you dont want any checks on that selfinterest at all every man and woman for him or herself no accountability leading financial figure or not julia had no intention of letting his remarks go unanswered your tasteless comment about my breasts aside mr standing i never said people in the free market should not be held accountable i think they should but the answer isnt adding more rules its to enforce the ones we already have if our lazy inept bureaucrats had been doing their jobs bernie madoff would have been caught whats more the thousands of wall street bankers who bundled lousy loans in collateralized debt obligations they knew would tank would also be locked up and while were on housing as far as your hoa analogy goes i wouldnt want the value of my home to drop for any reason if it did drop then id lose equity but i should decide if i help neighbors in their time of need the government shouldnt make that decision for me sometimes its not a handout that people need its a kick in the rear if a family has honestly fallen on hard times then i believe good neighbors would pull together to help them thats what we do in this country and we do it because its right you though dont want to address how that family fell upon hard times in your mind theyre automatically victims their situation could never possibly be their fault if theyre poor or in financial straits thats because somebody else put them there somebody stole what was rightly theirs or prevented them from achieving youd never think to ask if maybe they purchased a home they couldnt afford did they purchase expensive vacations and flatscreen tvs instead of laying away emergency funds for a rainy day and while you see these people as victims i and the other freemarket zombies as you put it see these people as individuals individuals empowered to make their own decisions neither you the government nor anyone else has the right to be in the business of trying to regulate outcomes you can call it social cohesion income equality or social justice it doesnt matter despite whether the term offends you or not what you are advocating is pure socialism standing gripped his butter knife and tried to keep his temper in check if asking society to invest in its citizens in order to make life better for them is socialism then i guess im guilty as charged but youre not asking society to do these things youre trying to force it you want to subvert the power of nations to decide their own destinies in order to impose a global system of laws overseen by a global system of governance youre not only a socialist mr standing youre a socialist who has not only benefited greatly from capitalism but one who then wants to use those gains to utterly destroy capitalism and replace it with your vision of what will bring about some sort of perfect world where an omnipotent government provides everything people could ever want or need socialism and communism are simply terms meant to demonize i dont even think you know the difference between them julia winston nodded vehemently i most certainly do they both seek public control of the production and distribution of wealth and while many believe they mean the same thing they dont one is voluntary and the other is involuntary standing rolled his eyes yes yes yes evil communism forces everyone into what the state wants and socialism is elective wrong she replied communism is the end game of socialism communism is the theoretical stateless utopia where mankind has been perfected to the point where government is no longer needed a completely voluntary communist society stems from the marxist theory of evolution for the marxists the communist utopia is the apex of human developmenta time at which man has genetically evolved out of his selfish ways and consistently acts toward the common good completely of his own volition to get from capitalism to the hypothetical utopia of pure communism society must be subjected to the tyranny of socialism thats where people make their mistake in describing the two philosophies they think socialism is voluntary and communism is involuntary when actually the reverse is true so in the interim phase between selfish capitalism and selfless communism we have socialism under socialism mankind for its own supposed good is subjected to the authority of dictatorship an enlightened ruling class of elites who control the human environment in egalitarian terms in order that they may steer the proper genetic evolution of mankind standing looked at her you are such an attractive woman i could almost believe anything you say i think thats why fox news has been so successful you are changing the subject mr standing said julia i havent changed it my dear you have dont you believe in justice dont you believe in people not being allowed to game the system of course i do then why are you so against making the world a better more equitable place for all of us standing asked you have given me the usual shallow shopworn defense of capitalism but you havent given me one concrete reason why my ideas are so unreasonable one concrete reason the reporter replied i can actually give you four first it is morally wrong to take anything that doesnt belong to you and having the state do the taking doesnt magically make it okay or right second socialism has been tried repeatedly and has never worked anywhere yet each new crop of elites think they can enact socialism and this time it will be different they stick the socialist fork back in the electrical outlet expecting a totally different outcome but it always ends up the same third when people become reliant on the state that reliance erodes their selfrespect their sense of selfworth their work ethic and their independence finally socialism promotes class envy and class warfare the makers resent the takers for draining their resources and the takers resent the makers because no matter how much the takers take they always want more they erroneously believe that the makers have an abundant supply from which they should be continuously compelled to give but as maggie thatcher so aptly put it the problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other peoples money standing shook his head im afraid you have misunderstood me my dear you know what mr standing at first calling me my dear was cute you reminded me of my grandfather but now i find it patronizing the billionaire liked that he had gotten under her skin but he didnt like being compared to her grandfather and as far as misunderstanding you she continued i havent i understand you all too well listening to you speak i keep remembering that old chinese proverb give a person a fish and hell eat for a day teach a person to fish and hell eat for a lifetime your problem is that you want to give everyone fish if you really cared about human dignity youd be giving everyone fishing lessons standing shook his head once more why was this so hard for these flatearth types to understand despite everything weve talked about despite the disproportionate number of haves versus have nots the inequitable distribution of wealth all of it youve never had one doubt about capitalism you can look me in the eye and tell me that somehow greed and selfinterest are good things all i know mr standing is that there is no perfect place where greed doesnt exist in fact the greater the government control the more greed there is the people who are the worst off in our world dont live under capitalism they live in societies that have turned away from or are prevented from embracing capitalism and free trade so youll pardon me for saying so but what youre proposing isnt going to make the world a better place if you were successful at doing what you say youd like to do it would make the world a much much worse place and i pray to god it never happens god said standing with a derisive sniff you see the state our planet is in and you still believe in god you really arent very bright are you it wasnt a question it was a statement im bright enough to realize that now that youve made your money and are one of the wealthiest people in the world youve abandoned the ideas that got you here and have replaced them with fantasies of a classless utopia said the reporter as she stood up the billionaire was taken by surprise whats going on thank you for the wine was she leaving where do you think youre going back to my office to finish writing my article i asked you to dinner and expect you to stay for all of it he replied his eyes narrowing as he took hold of her arm sit down youve got less than two seconds to take your hand off of me mr standing i promise you that ill snap your wrist before your security team even knows what has happened i can only imagine that bones break very easily in a man of your age and take very long to heal how dare she standing was enraged yet he forced a smile onto his face and removed his hand from her arm people in the crowded restaurant were watching lets not embarrass ourselves im sure we can find something else to talk about sliding out of her chair julia winston forced her own smile good night mr standing as she walked away standing got in the last word uttering it loud enough for her to hear bitch he snapped his fingers to get the attention of his security detail and indicated that he was ready to leave hed be damned if he would suffer the additional embarrassment of sitting at his table and dining by himself like some lonely old man his waiter rushed over is everything all right mr standing everything is fine jeffery he said a lessthanconvincing smile upon his lips something has come up and we wont be able to dine with you tonight im sorry to hear that sir looking at the threethousanddollar bottle of wine he added what would you like to do with the montrachet though he would only pour it down the drain once he got home standing certainly wasnt going to gift such an expensive bottle of wine to a mere waiter put a cork in it and give it to max he said gesturing over his shoulder at the head of his security detail he then stood up from the table and headed for the front of the restaurant he had no idea that his evening was about to go from bad to worse as he climbed into his armored denali standings encrypted cell phone rang chapter standing told his driver and security team to stand on the sidewalk while he sat in the denali and took the call he didnt want anyone to listen to him speaking to robert ashford im afraid i have bad news said the mi operative you seem to be in the badnews business a lot lately robert replied standing its starting to become a habit i dont care for and ashford didnt care for the rebuke but he held his tongue standing had too much incriminating leverage stacked against him he decided to get right to the point ive received word that the rabbit hutch was compromised standing had expected the conversation to be about what had happened in la not about mustafa karami and the terror cell in sweden rabbit hutch was the code name it had been given how was it compromised local authorities are being very tightlipped they suspect a foreign intelligence agency had targeted the cell standings blood pressure was starting to rise which intelligence agency they believe it was the french the french how the hell would they have been involved they have some sort of evidence pointing to the dgses action division they seem pretty convinced it was them the french of course are denying it of course theyre denying it snapped standing theres no way the french could have put any of this together well someone did ashford was right tell me what happened the hutch operated two apartments one across the street from the other one was where operations were handled the other was a completely sterile safe house all computers cell phones and whathaveyou were kept in the operations apartment somehow the location of the apartments was uncovered an assault team outfitted to look like the swedish security service attempted to take them down attempted meaning they didnt succeed the operations apartment was rigged to explode and when the assault team hit it did what about the safe house apartment asked standing two of the faux swedish security operatives were seen going into that building as well one man from the hutch was thrown from the window and killed there was also gunfire according to witnesses when the phony security services men exited the building they had another man with them he was bleeding they had a car parked outside they laid him on the backseat and then the three of them drove away standings heart suddenly stopped beating was it westminster all of the terrorist networks commanders and lieutenants had been named after locations in the united kingdom the head of the network aaazim aleem was oxford mustafa karami westminster no he was much younger said ashford was he from the hutch some said he looked arab some said italian but i think we should assume he was one of ours okay but why only take him asked standing what happened to the rest of them wheres westminster including the man who had been thrown out the window they have found seven bodies at the safe house apartment they were all younger men in their twenties and early thirties so no sign of westminster what about cardiff he asked referring to sabah based on what i have been able to glean replied ashford they are not among the dead at the safe house which means either they were in the operations apartment when it blew or they managed to escape altogether correct standing worked to keep his anger in check first they had gotten to aazim and now they had tracked down karami he needed to think could the americans be behind this he asked carlton and his group i dont know how they could have located the hutch but they were the ones who tracked down oxford so we should probably put them at the top of our list i dont want to hear probably i want to hear for certain you have a relationship with them use it ashford was getting angry again and just what am i supposed to do ring them up and ask if they happened to have anything to do with hitting a terror cell in sweden we were lucky to have taken care of oxford before they could turn him over if i start asking questions about sweden theyre going to get suspicious then youd better see to it that they dont youre the spook you figure it out said standing adding if westminster did manage to get away how long until he makes contact it depends on how long it takes him to get to the alternate safe house once hes in place well hear from him if you dont hear from him in the next eight hours cut him out of the loop and promote the next commander that would be birmingham fine replied standing and if westminster does make contact what do you want me to tell him standing thought about it for a moment whether it was the americans or not someone had managed to track down the uppsala cell whom they had taken out of the safe house and driven away with was anyones guess someone was way too close they needed to step up their plans all of the attacks had been colorcoded the silver and goldsmiths have already received the newsletter correct yes said ashford using the code words for the next attacks silver and gold are ready to go but do you really want to jump that far ahead we dont have much choice do we somehow trade secrets have been compromised i want silver tomorrow and gold the day after ill handle it anything else asked ashford have you cleaned up your mess in los angeles im still working on it well work faster said standing your ass is on the line ashford was about to reply when standing disconnected the call and the line went dead arsehole he thought to himself his dislike for the man was growing by the hour nevertheless standing had every right to be angry over what had happened in los angeles the fact that ashford couldnt reach his contact only made him look more unprofessional he was going to locate him soon or else come up with some sort of plan b as soon as silver and gold were unleashed the united states was going to be locked up tighter than a drum chapter reston virginia the carlton groups offices were located in a nondescript glass office building ten minutes from washington dulles international airport pat murphy the surviving assaulter from the uppsala operation and andy bachmann the former cia man had hitched a ride home on the jet with harvath murphy kept to himself in the back of the plane hed lost his entire team and harvath knew there was nothing he could do to help assuage what the man was feeling harvath had simply thanked him again for pulling him out of the building handed him the bottle of makers mark and left him alone after the postlanding formalities at dulles a team met murphy to accompany him home it was standard operating procedure the man had been through too much to just be sent off on his own bachmann offered to go along too harvath extended the assaulter his condolences once more and told him that hed be in touch before climbing into one of the black suburbans the old man had sent to the airport for them he thanked bachmann and asked him to make sure murphy had anything he needed when the vehicle pulled out onto the dulles toll road it was just after midnight it took them eight minutes to get to the office they pulled into the underground parking structure and harvath was let out near a service door he punched a code into a pad at the wall the lock released and harvath entered a short maintenance corridor at the end was a service elevator he looked up at the surveillance camera in the corner and then waited for the elevator to be sent down when it arrived and the doors opened harvath stepped inside the building was twentyfive stories tall and the carlton groups offices were on the top floor the main elevators that served the building proper and all its tenants had buttons from l to but no which meant those elevators technically only went to the twentyfourth floor as a precaution the group also controlled the entire twentyfourth floor which supposedly included a collection of unoccupied offices should anyone ever manage to get a peek at the twentyfourth floor it wouldnt appear unusual at all the special service elevator harvath was in went only to the twentyfifth floor when the doors opened he stepped out into a carpeted foyer area sitting behind a desk were two large men dressed in suits and ties they nodded to harvath and buzzed him in passing through a heavy blast door hidden behind panels of mahogany he entered the headquarters of the carlton group the entire space had been built to the strictest tempest specifications though the carlton group was a private organization they were contracted to the dod and handled classified information every step was taken to safeguard against what was referred to in intelspeak as compromising emanations or ce ce was any electrical mechanical or acoustical signal from equipment that was transmitting receiving processing analyzing encrypting or decrypting classified information that could be intentionally or accidentally intercepted it was a sophisticated science that looked at everything from magnetic field radiation and line conduction all the way to how window blinds can vibrate and give away conversations held in offices and what is being typed on a keyboard feet away from a window the antieavesdropping measures aside the carlton groups offices resembled a large successful law firm there were private offices conference rooms and multiple cubicle areas that had been collectively nicknamed kubistan by staff as in the cias counterterrorism center employees were grouped according to the regions and areas in which they possessed expertise taking a page out of silicon valleys handbook they were encouraged to move when assignments dictated via mobile workstations that looked as if they came straight out of an ikea catalog the groups director of operations referred to it as clustering and had found that often the personnel themselves formed more effective and productive teams than when management assigned specific people to specific projects one of the nations longestserving and most revered spymasters the old man was not a management guru he believed in simply hiring the best people possible and then trusting them to do their jobs hed watched how too much management and bureaucracy had choked the life out of the cia and he had sworn hed never let it happen at his organization that said hed drawn a few lines in the sand with his management team employees were expected to dress like business professionals there were no casualdress fridays he expected people to comport themselves with dignity they were the best and he expected them to look like it he was particular about facial hair unless you were going into the field and it was a part of your cover male employees were expected to be cleanshaven he didnt want to see any piercings other than earrings and then only two on female employees onlyone in each ear if you had a tattoo it had better not be visible there were also strict rules about physical conditioning grooming and hygiene there were only two exceptions to reeds rules of order as they were known the first had to do with smoking as a relapsed smoker himself he allowed people to smoke but they couldnt go outside to do it smokers had a habit of getting too chummy and chatty with strangers and other tenants in a building they milled around outside and lingered over cigarettes wasting productive time they also made themselves vulnerable to surveillance and approach to cater to the smokers hed built what became known as the coffina small glass booth barely big enough for two people at the far end of the office it had an intense airpurification system that roared so loudly you could barely hear yourself think it wasnt supposed to be comfortable there wasnt even a place to sit down inside you went in got your fix and got out strangely enough no one ever saw the old man using the coffin and it was widely suspected he had had an equally efficient though much quieter system placed in his office allowing him to smoke whenever he wanted to the other exception to reeds rules of order had to do with his newest employee moonracer he was an eccentric little man who was also particularly cunning the old man didnt trust him a single bit when it came to bringing nicholas on board carlton had been one hundred percent against it but harvath had made a very compelling case and hed eventually relented once the man had been able to secure his presidential pardon that didnt mean that he had changed any of his ways the old man had created a secure area within which nicholas operated and within which he could constantly be monitored nicholas had refused to shave his beard and had also insisted that the two enormous white russian ovcharkas or caucasian sheepdogs he owned which were never away from his side be allowed to come to work with him though reed carlton loved dogs he had refused the request the little man then claimed they were service animals and hinted at bringing a suit against him for violating the americans with disabilities act the old man didnt know if nicholas was pulling his leg or if he was actually serious once again harvath had stepped in and had lobbied for the dogs explaining that the group wouldnt secure nicholass cooperation unless the dogs were part of the deal carlton relented once more it was obvious that harvath had appointed himself the little mans guardian that point was driven home shortly after nicholass first day on the job because of the mans physical limitations a special sensitive compartmented information facility scif for short had been built for him a scif was an enclosed area within a building used for processing sensitive information nicholass scif was built to his specifications on a raised floor and stuffed full of all the computer equipment and data links he had asked for as with the other sections of the carlton group nicholass scif had been assigned a title based on its function a white sheet of paper with the words digital ops had been printed out and taped to the door the next day it had been taken down and replaced with another sign the lollipop guild when harvath heard about it he had hit the roof it took him less than fifteen minutes to track down who had done it and cornering him in the mens room it took every ounce of restraint he had for harvath not to punch the mans lights out to his credit the man didnt deny that he had posted the sign in fact he owned right up to it and launched into what a mistake he felt it was having brought a criminal like nicholas into their operation harvath didnt care what the man thought he told him that if he didnt stay away from nicholas he would put a bullet in his head and dump his body where his family would never find it five minutes later the man was in his supervisors office registering a complaint against harvath to the supervisors credit he had backed up harvath and told the man that if he didnt close his mouth and get back to work harvath wouldnt have a chance to shoot him because he was going to do the job himself that seemed to put an end to things word quickly got around that anybody who screwed with moonracer was going to get a visit from his big brother norseman and that harvath had carte blanche to do whatever he wanted and management would turn a blind eye arriving at the scif harvath punched in his code waited for the green light to come on and listened for the locks to slide back and the hiss of air as the door was released chapter the growling of nicholass two dogs argos and draco ceased as soon as they saw who it was both of them stood up from their beds and trotted over to see harvath hello boys he said patting them on the head hello nicholas the little man was typing away at his keyboard he quickly raised his left index finger indicating hed be with harvath in a second and then returned to typing in the eerie lighting of the scif harvath studied nicholass face he had been attacked over the summer with a razor it had happened in a remote mountainous region of spain there wasnt a hospital or even a clinic for over a hundred miles one of the monks who found him had some medical experience and had sewn him up all things considered nicholas was lucky to have received any stitches at all in fact he was just lucky to be alive he had since undergone two procedures to help improve his appearance and reduce scarring from what harvath could see nicholas was almost back to normal as soon as the little man was finished with what he was typing he hit the enter key saying and a dolly for sue nicholas needed an extraordinary amount of computing power to do what the carlton group had brought him on board to do when the nsa categorically denied him access to their massive data centers he turned to the next best thing and hacked into googles google had dozens of data centers around the world and more than a million servers from right there in reston to places like sao paulo moscow milan tokyo and hong kong nicholas had given the ones he used most often nicknamesspotted elephant bird fish charlieinthebox ostrich cowboy scooter for jimmy and a dolly for sue harvath had chalked it up to eccentricity until someone in the group had asked him if he knew the significance of nicholass code name the little man had chosen it for himself and it had been approved harvath figured it had some poetic meaning for him until he learned that moonracer was the name of the winged lion that ruled the island of misfit toys he was responsible for flying around the world each night in search of unwanted toys it was a fitting moniker when it became obvious that nicholas was not going to grow any bigger his godless soviet georgian parents had decided he was an embarrassment and would forever be like a stone around their necks they no longer wanted their son and decided to get rid of him they made no attempt to find him a suitable loving home they didnt even try to place him in an orphanage instead they abandoned the boy selling him to a brothel on the outskirts of the black sea resort of sochi there nicholas was starved beaten and made to participate in unutterable acts no child should ever be subjected to it was there that nicholas learned the true value of information pillow talk from the alcoholloosened lips of the brothels powerful clients proved to be a gold mine once he knew what to listen for and how to turn it to his advantage the women who worked in the brothel were societys castoffs just like nicholas and they took pity on him those ladies of the night were the first to ever treat nicholas with respect they became the only family he had ever known and he repaid their kindness one day by securing their freedom he had the madam who ran the brothel along with her husband dispatched for the inhuman cruelty he had suffered at their hands though he moved beyond the horrors of his youth he never forgot them he carried with him a tremendous burden of shame he was no angel he had done many bad things since leaving the brothel in sochi he had done many good things as well particularly with the vast amount of money he had made and lost over the years he wanted to cleanse himself whether that was possible only time would tell agreeing to come to work with harvath was a step in that direction pushing his chair back from the desk he reached his tiny arms into the air and arched his back lowering them he turned to face his friend im sorry about uppsala he said me too replied harvath nodding toward the minifridge on the opposite wall nicholas nodded help yourself crossing over to it he opened the door and peered inside does the old man know youve got a bottle of wine in here what he doesnt know wont hurt him besides with the hours ive been putting in i deserve a drink now and again do you have any beer asked harvath do i look like ive suddenly turned into a beer drinker though a man of diminutive stature nicholas had perhaps the best taste of anyone harvath had ever met from clothes to wine and food nicholas was a connoisseur of all the good things life had to offerand that included beer harvath had sat and drunk with him before seriously you dont have any beer harvath asked it was hard enough getting the wine in here without carlton knowing five percent per volume versus twelve you do the math wine packed a stronger punch than beer harvath got it he settled on a red bull instead and closed the fridge door i thought you didnt drink that stuff anymore said nicholas only in emergencies he said popping the lid and rolling a chair over like when theres no beer nicholas smiled and made room for him hows chase i heard he got shot in the shoulder bicep harvath corrected pointing at his own i think it hit the bone hell be riding the bench for a while so he continued changing the subject the old man says youve made some progress i have replied nicholas as he pulled up an instant message screen and typed a note to the old man that harvath had arrived is he still in the office yeah he wanted me to let him know when you got here so we could go over everything together while were waiting for him why dont you give me the thirtythousandfoot view of the situation nicholas nodded and turned back to his computers moving his little fingers across the keyboard he brought up a series of images on the screens around the scif in the early s the chinese watched in utter fascination at how rapidly the united states defeated saddam hussein in the first gulf war they realized that there was absolutely no way they could ever meet the technologically advanced american military on the conventional battlefield and win they also realized something else as they studied how the united states had waged its wars they saw that leaps in technological innovation drove innovation in american military tactics not the other way around the chinese considered this quite a profound discovery and began to embrace the idea that in a chinaversusamerica conflict the inferior china could beat the superior united states in fact chinas defense minister general chi haotian even stated that war with the us was inevitable and that china would not be able to avoid it he posited that the key issue for the chinese armed forces was going to be controlling the initiative or how the war would be fought it would all come down to how each side approached waging war china knew exactly what their plan would be their blueprint became known as unrestricted warfare the first and most important rule of unrestricted warfare is that there are no rules nothing is forbidden the plan calls for merciless unconventional outofthebox thinking the key is asymmetrical attacks on every sphere of american lifepolitical economic and social using the ancient martial doctrines of leaders like sun tzu they focused on the timeproven methods of surprise and deception particularly by weaponizing civilian technologies and employing them without morality mercy or limit in order to crush american society what do you mean by weaponizing civilian technologies asked harvath what is one of the most important technologies that touches every single home and business in america said nicholas harvath thought about it for a moment and replied the internet you are correct but the internet is the second most important the first is electricity if electricity were weaponized meaning an opponent had found a way to use it against the united states america would be devastated without electricity fuel doesnt get pumped trucks dont move food and drugs dont get delivered the economy comes to a grinding halt as the economy grinds to a halt society starts to break apart fires dont get extinguished looting and crime doesnt get stopped you pick up the phone to dial and there is no dial tone soon there are no police there are no firemen all there is is chaos with power grids and power stations so dependent on the internet i would argue that losing the internet to an army of hackers would have the same effect as an enemy turning off our electricity either through widespread sabotage or with an electromagnetic pulse weapon the chinese military leaders who developed the unrestricted warfare plan explained that in the realm of lowintensity conflict the vulnerabilities of the united states actually become exponentially more pronounced in essence there are multitudes of things that us citizens believe are harmless that a clever enemy could turn against them and use to cripple them in a heartbeat the blackout of hit eight us states and parts of canada not only was power generation and delivery affected but so were the water supply transportation communication industry and the overall economy there was also looting the overall cost was estimated at between seven and ten billion dollars the outage affected more than fiftyfive million people and was the second mostwidespread electrical blackout in history and ill give you one guess who was behind it the chinese said harvath nicholas nodded forensic investigations showed that plasponsored chinese hackers or crackers as theyre referred to had hacked into a us electrical power system network that controlled distribution to the northeast and were mapping it it has been privately alleged that they were leaving behind hidden malicious software known as trojan horses that could be activated at a later date specifically in a time of unrestricted warfare in order to knock american power systems offline where it went wrong supposedly was that while leaving the trojans some cracker or group of crackers accidentally activated theirs causing the blackout you dont believe that its possible that the crackers made a mistake subsequent investigations of networks across the united states showed widespread compromise of the nationwide electrical system by the chinese trojans had been planted everywhere if thats true why didnt the us confront china over it these kinds of things are very difficult to prove senior government and intelligence officials didnt want to rock the boat with china unless they could prove it beyond a doubt harvath shook his head people have no idea how dangerous that country isour politicians included i agree replied nicholas at least eleven people died because of the blackout and it contributed to the fall of the ontario government in a provincial election and it only lasted a couple of days the impact on national security was just as serious without power critical systems used by the united states to detect illegal border crossings port landings and breaches of sensitive sites were all compromised even more disturbing was that the blackout was a neon sign for terrorists if you will pointing right at one of americas greatest achilles heels makes me wonder if it really was a mistake by the chinese or a dry run indeed the only way to be sure of your hypothesis is to test it if the blackout was a test it was successful but it exposed all the trojans they had planted throughout the us electrical system unless that was intentional said harvath if they triggered the blackout on purpose to see what would happen and how we would respond they had to have known wed do a comprehensive analysis of all of our networks to see how badly wed been penetrated maybe they intended for us to find all of those other trojans we find them clean them out and thank god we got them before they could be activated as well nicholas smiled only what the us discovered and cleaned out was exactly what the chinese wanted them to discover and clean out the united states pats itself on the back stopping its search right there you think there are more deeper trojans in the us electrical network i think its a virtual guarantee said the little man in fact i wouldnt be surprised if the chinese had actually written programs intended to piggyback off american efforts to rid their power networks of the surface trojans the us may very well have unwittingly helped the chinese burrow deeper providing china greater access than they could have ever achieved on their own thats the driving philosophy behind unrestricted warfare it is all about positioning yourself for victory why meet your enemy sword to sword where he is strongest when you can force him to expose his side where he is weakest and strike at him there besides weaponizing civilian technologies what else does the plan call for asked harvath nicholas ran his hand through his short dark hair slowly influencing the culture with their values via cultural warfare influencing american media cornering and rigging the markets for things america needs such as oil and rare earth minerals through resource warfare joining international bodies like the un security council and voting against american resolutions and interests as part of international law warfare manipulating the value of the dollar and subverting the banking and stock markets via financial warfare the list is multifaceted and it goes on and on and it includes terrorism most definitely you see while they watched americas mighty military deal with saddam in the first gulf war they also noted the severe difficulties that the same mighty military had in dealing with a lowintensity conflict like somalia they noted how effective the us embassy bombings were in beirut kenya and tanzania they noted as well the havoc caused by terrorists in the first world trade center bombing in they noted how chechen terrorists were able to plague the russians as northern ireland guerillas had done to the british for the chinese terrorism became seen as an exceptional weapon to wield against the united states it can not only cause great physical and economic damage but it delivers a severe psychological shock to the citizens of the country it is visited upon if you could somehow harness and focus islamic terrorism it would give you a great battlefield advantage it would also provide camouflage as you would be using foreign nationals to do your bidding theres an interesting tidbit many people arent aware of when the attacks happened we all saw dancing in the streets of the muslim world what we didnt see though was the sheer exuberance displayed by statecontrolled chinese media they produced video games books and documentaries glorifying the violence and calling it a humbling blow against an arrogant nation many people also dont know that the chinese predicted that bin laden would hit the world trade center and that they predicted it three years before it happened us intelligence also learned that before the chinese military had been providing training to the afghan taliban and al qaeda the american intelligence apparatus was stunned by this revelation and couldnt figure out why the chinese were mixing with islamic terrorists it all had to do with unrestricted warfare the chinese wanted to build their own worldwide islamic terror network that they could unleash against their enemies particularly the united states at will they developed deep ties with the taliban in order to develop even deeper ties with al qaeda much as they had mapped us electrical networks they wanted to map existing islamic terror networks particularly aq the chinese are brilliant students they have an almost superhuman ability to sublimate their arrogance and approach subjects with a completely open mind they assume nothing and feel no embarrassment at their lack of knowledge not that it would make too much difference if they did it wouldnt last long the chinese are incredibly fast learners taking their new knowledge they compare it against what they know of the world and what they have learned from thousands of years of history then they slowly begin to put it into play this is how the chinese were able to build a terrorism network rivaling al qaeda which was headed by aazim aleem said harvath correct exactly aazim headed the entire network but he had no idea that he was working for the chinese he believed he was running a branch of al qaeda with al qaedas full knowledge and support he had no idea that he was a tool in the unrestricted warfare toolbox but the chinese lost control of the network nicholas held up his tiny index finger to make a point technically they didnt lose it it was stolen from them this is the big mystery weve been dealing with who stole the network and why harvath was about to pose a new question when a chime rang and the green light at the scif door illuminated a fraction of a second later there was the hiss of air as the locks released the door was opened and in stepped the old man chapter reed carlton walked into the scif he was a tall fit man in his midsixties with a prominent chin and silver hair harvath stood up and greeted him we got our asses handed to us in sweden the old man said as he grabbed a chair and wheeled it over it was late and he was tired and not in a good mood i dont care what it takes were going to nuke these bastards thats the word from on high at dod as well harvath knew the old man was speaking figuratively about nuking the terrorists it was his term for complete and total victory nuke em he would often say before harvath left on assignment there were times though in anger over the loss of lives he would suggest nuking the entire middle east region the arabs hed rant were ungovernable and immune to civilization as international terrorism sprang almost exclusively from the middle east and the middle east refused to curtail it why not put an end to it once and for all why allow a single additional american to be killed by the fanatics the last time i checked he would say as people who didnt know he was exaggerating listened aghast we can still drill through glass he didnt mince words and harvath admired that about him he had the type of takenoprisoners getthejobdone and tohellwithpoliticalcorrectness attitude that the united states needed a lot more of nicholas had a mug in front of him picking it up he looked at carlton and offered coffee its a little late for coffee the old man replied why dont you pour me a glass of wine wine son i know every single thing that goes on here carlton said nicholas liked being called son he turned his eyes to harvath who was the closest to the fridge harvath rolled over to it in his chair and withdrew the bottle grabbing three cups he rolled back i thought you didnt want any said nicholas as harvath poured what was left in the bottle into the three cups changed my mind he replied as he passed out the cups it wouldnt be right to let you two drink alone carlton accepted his cup and held it up to those who have fallen harvath and nicholas repeated the toast together and drank from their cups they then waited for the old man to take charge this isnt a book club he finally said you dont need me to kick things off just pick up from wherever you were when i walked in yes sir replied nicholas as he set down his cup and pulled up another image on the closest screen as i was explaining the chinese had created a sophisticated islamic terror network as part of their unrestricted warfare plan for the united states but this network was stolen from them in fact as best we can tell it wasnt just the network that was stolen it was everything everything what do you mean everything asked harvath nicholas brought up a satellite photo the chinese militarys unrestricted warfare planning took place exclusively at this outpost in mongolia the project was so classified the base didnt even have a name they referred to it with a threedigit number site as weve learned the sole purpose of this base was to allow the chinese to study america and plan their unrestricted warfare package the operatives there spoke only english ate only american foods read american books watched american tv played american video games studied american politics and financial markets and surfed nothing but american and western websites it was as close to america as you could be without leaving chinas umbrella the operatives there were steeped in american culture and the american way of thinking most of them had previously worked or studied abroad in the us their job at site was to study america and to find its weaknesses under the supervision of their military handlers they were then charged with developing the most unusual and devastating attacks they could come up with attacks from the side said harvath yes replied nicholas as he put up another image someone discovered what the chinese were up to and hired an extremely adept hacker to steal the unrestricted warfare plans then they launched an attack on site making sure no one was left alive and no copy of the plans was left behind but they didnt stop there any chinese military or intelligence officer who had any knowledge of the program regardless of where he was was hunted down and killed whoever stole the plans wanted to make sure that they had the only copy and that they were the only ones who could activate it but we dont have any idea who stole it or why do we asked harvath nicholas shook his head at this point no we have the hacker who helped steal the unrestricted warfare plans she has been interrogated and is still being held at an offshore site she claims she never knew the identity of the person or persons who hired her the interrogators believe she is telling the truth what we were able to get from her though is that despite her clients warning against it she opened the package she stole whats more she copied some of the data onto a separate drive which you were able to recover said harvath and which you tried to sell back to the united states government rather than doing the right thing and turning it over added carlton nicholas put up his hands i eventually saw the error of my ways and delivered the drive to this organization what was on it asked harvath as youll recall you and i spoke while you were in yemen just before harvath held up his hand he didnt need to be reminded the call had come in just before his car and aazim aleem had been hit by the rpg what i had shared with you continued nicholas was that there was some pretty interesting information on that drive that was how we learned that aazim had a nephew in london who was a digital courier for him i also discovered that the drive held some highly encrypted data from it we began to get a better handle on what unrestricted warfare was the problem though was there werent any specifics i was able to figure out that the recent attacks we had seen in europe and in chicago were only a small wave preceding a giant tsunami and that the tsunami was meant to crush the united states but that was all at least i thought it was all until i came at the encryption from a different angle and found this harvath watched as nicholas pushed a key and all the screens showed the same image a map of the united states a black dot popped up in chicago followed by one in new york and one in los angeles what are we looking at based on what chase learned inside aazims network we believe we are looking at target cities interrupted harvath exactly we know aazim had been in chicago and that he wanted chase to handle an attack in new york while he went to oversee one in la we think these represented the first wave first out of how many nicholas looked at carlton who nodded see for yourself said the little man as he pressed another button on his keyboard instantly a dot appeared in dallas followed by houston and miami then philadelphia had a dot and then newark and san francisco next came atlanta phoenix seattle and denver the dots were multiplying so fast harvath couldnt keep track some cities had more than one dot in addition to major american cities there were smaller ones ones not immediately thought of when considering potential terrorist targets there were dots next to madison wisconsin casper wyoming and wichita kansas bloomington indiana hartford connecticut johnson city tennessee springfield missouri and billings montana had also been marked my god harvath said how many are there over two hundred replied nicholas cells thats what we think the scope is amazing but now watch this nicholas pressed another button and harvath watched as all of the dots changed color why are they doing that we think the colors represent the style of attack said the little man you can see chicago is lit up red blue orange silver and brown you mean there may have been five different kinds of attacks planned for chicago yes and we only disrupted two unfortunately harvath studied the map looking at the different colors chase was inside the chicago cell and he only uncovered the suicide bomb and active shooter plots you think they kept things that compartmentalized aazim aleem had three other types of attack planned for chicago that chase never learned about its very possible replied carlton especially if the actors were working alone and didnt need the support of the overall network its the way id do it five different attacks was a large number to throw at one city like chicago but there were plenty of cities on the map that appeared to have been targeted for multiple attacks harvath was looking for some sort of pattern orange dots seem to be pretty randomly dispersed any idea what those represent nicholas leaned back in his chair took a sip from his cup and studied the map no idea not even a guess guesses are something ive got plenty of honestly orange could be anything there are orange dots in new york city san jose dallas atlanta cincinnati and a bunch of other locations silver and gold seem to be just as random what about purple im only seeing those in a few places all of them port cities new york again los angeles houston seattle we noticed that too replied nicholas but those are also major urban centers with large populations and there might be another factor they have in common that were not seeing thats the problem theres just so much we dont know harvath looked back at the old man any other thoughts if you were behind this carlton was studying the monitors ive been looking at this map until my eyes bleed without some additional piece of information its nearly impossible to unlock what kind of warning are you giving the cities that do have the dots carlton shrugged the fbi will quietly inform local and state law enforcement of a nonspecific terrorism threat to their jurisdictions and theyll raise their internal alert levels accordingly no mention of this to the public then asked harvath not right now we dont want to tip our hand if we go public with this it could speed the attacks up whoever is pulling the strings could give the cells the green light the old man was right but they couldnt just sit and do nothing if this map is accurate said harvath at least we know the cities where theyre planning to strike how do we filter it down even more nicholas waved at all of his computer equipment im doing everything humanly possible im looking for any data points i can find no matter how small im turning over every single digital rock you can imagine were leaving nothing unturned the ops tempo was already very hot but with chase saying he felt something was about to kick off weve kicked everything on our end into overdrive what about the names chase gave us karami sabah some sheikh from qatar its all in the blender we just have to see what we get out harvath turned to carlton how about any ids of the cell members chase took out in the safe house were working on that said the old man were also working on seeing if their forensics teams uncovered anything from the apartment building across the street where the explosion happened for the moment the swedes are being very tightlipped they suspect the involvement of a foreign intelligence service and until they feel theyve figured out who it was theyre not talking with anyone i assumed you would have already helped them out with that its in the works trust me subtlety is a delicate art it requires patience these guys though could begin lighting up american cities this morning replied harvath theres got to be something else we can do what you can do is go home and get some rest said the old man i want you ready to move as soon as we do hear something harvath was wiped out he knew he needed sleep draining what was left of his cup he stood up as soon as we hear from iceland with the medical assessment on mansoor i want somebody to call me they need to start interrogating him as quickly as possible we have to access his cloud in the meantime said carlton were working every other angle we have we still dont have anything on who targeted my car in yemen with that rpg though do we the old man shook his head no not yet obviously interjected nicholas someone didnt want the us interrogating aazim aleem obviously replied harvath whoever was responsible for having aazim killed didnt want him revealing either who he worked for or what the scope of his operation was theres one thing that bothers me about all that whoever hijacked the unrestrictedwarfare plan was running aazim via whatever cutout the chinese had established ostensibly the sheikh from qatar we dont know if the sheikh is a real person that members of the network have ever met with or if hes some disembodied figure who only communicates through emails or telephone calls what are you getting at asked harvath i dont think aazim was taken out to prevent him from revealing who gave him his marching orders he couldnt give away intelligence he didnt actually possess so then he was targeted to prevent revealing the scope of his operation thats what bothers me said nicholas you and chase were sitting at an outdoor cafe within sight of your car when it exploded you said the rpg came from a rooftop a block or two away harvath nodded why silence aazim why not simply aim the rpg a couple of degrees in the other direction and take out you and chase at the cafe in the ensuing chaos aazim could have been released from the trunk and then spirited away disappearing yet again both harvath and the old man looked at nicholas he had made an excellent point dont get me wrong he added im sure whoever was running aazim didnt want him interrogated but it would have made more sense to kill you the fact that hes dead means that he either made someone very angry or had outlived his usefulness or both said carlton or both agreed nicholas but with aazim gone theres definitely tension and uncertainty within the network i think thats why this karami character wanted mansoor brought to sweden maybe he doesnt trust the sheikh from qatar maybe he wanted to pump mansoor for as much information as possible if thats true then maybe we can find a way to exploit the upheaval and use it to our advantage thats a good idea replied harvath as he said goodbye to both of the dogs but were going to need a hell of a lot more intelligence before we can even think of launching an operation like that carlton stood up placed his hand atop harvaths shoulder and guided him toward the door go home and get some rest he repeated ill call you if anything breaks harvath did as he was told retrieving his personal vehicle from the garage he headed south on i toward home by the time he hit us all he could think about was a hot shower and falling into bed he let the water pound on his body for a good five minutes before turning it off and reaching for a towel he was too tired to shave after cracking the bedroom window he lay down and closed his eyes sleep should have come quickly but it didnt instead his mind took over and replayed everything that had happened in sweden over and over again he couldnt escape his feelings of responsibility the guilt he felt over the deaths of the assaulters he tried to focus on something else something positive he thought about riley turner and what she might be doing at the moment it worked for a while but then he was back on the mental rack his mind torturing him with whatifs and secondguessing over what had happened he thought about pouring himself a stiff drink and numbing it all away but chose instead to lie there and take it finally two hours later he drifted off into a fitful sleep in it he was haunted by visions of a larger more gruesome attack he felt sure was about to hit the united states chapter london saturday morning robert ashford possessed one of the key character flaws necessary to a traitor he thought he was smarter than everyone else this allowed the overeducated career bureaucrat to sell out his own country because he believed he knew what was best for his nation and its people of course he was being wellpaid for his treason but he rationalized the money away by telling himself that it wasnt about money this was about right and wrong and if only england and the rest of the west had stood up and done the right thing none of what he was doing would have been necessary it was this deepseated belief and growing disenchantment with the direction of the world that had drawn him to james standing ashford had read all of the billionaires books never had one person been able to put what he was feeling so succinctly into words standing was the high priest of a glorious new truth a majestic ship was about to sail and there would be only so many seats on board ashford had no desire to be left behind in fact he thought he could be very helpful in bringing about the new dawn that james standing was going to usher in the two had been introduced at a cocktail party given by a mutual acquaintance an influential member of parliament standing was impressed not only with ashfords thorough reading of his books but also with his dedication to his vision of a new world slowly the mens relationship built ashford was a confirmed bachelor and the billionaire had originally thought him gay until he realized the mi man was simply a careerist entanglements familial and otherwise were seen as something that could only slow him down without wife children or girlfriend ashford could work any and all hours without fear of recrimination with both military and intelligence training he was the perfect man for the job standing was creating when the billionaire had assured himself that ashfords loyalty could indeed be purchased and assured he parted the curtains and drew the man inside now ashford was trapped standing had him and he could never go back and despite most of his colleagues having already retired ashford was still in the game it was all that mattered to him and he was damn good at it at least he had been all of a sudden though too many things were not working the way they should while he still had no idea what had happened to the sanction of the hollywood producer the source of the rest of his operational headaches was easy to pinpointarabs ashford was an unrepentant bigot of the highest order he didnt just dislike he actually detested working with muslims in his opinion muslimsarab muslims in particularwere some of the laziest and most uncreative people he had ever come across their zealotry bred myopia and an inability to think for themselves in his experience the only thing they were good for was blowing themselves up he had yet to meet enough clever members of the faith to believe that those possessed of even average intelligence were anything more than an aberration he was putting the finishing touches on elevating the next commander in the aleem network when mustafa karami finally made contact he found the email in the draft folder of the account he was about to delete he quickly copied it into a translation program and when the arabic had been translated to english he read the mans brief account of what had transpired in uppsala both the safe house and the apartment used for their ops center across the street had been compromised according to karami a team of men posing as professional movers had been behind the attack the ops center had been detonated but two men survived they were both dressed as swedish security service agents karami reported that both he and sabah had been able to escape to the emergency retreat location but that he had no idea what had become of the rest of the cell members at this point he was standing by awaiting further instruction ashford took several minutes to compose his reply he frontloaded the email with what he referred to as muslim mumbo jumbothe blessings of allah and all of that antiquated nonsense that he felt was a complete and utter waste of time but was important to maintain the charade of his being the number two to the man who financed the entire network the mysterious sheikh from qatar the chinese had established the fictitious sheikh as the networks financial benefactor and ultimate authority who allegedly took his orders directly from the al qaeda leadership the mistake the chinese had made though was that they had not perpetrated the myth of the sheikh much past aazim aleem the operational director of the network when ashford had been forced to kill aazim before he could be interrogated there was reluctance on the part of mustafa karami to take over karami was used to taking orders from aazim he had never met the sheikh and therefore didnt trust him ashford had been tempted to cut karami out of the picture right then and there and simply move to the next commander in the networks hierarchy but standing had told him to have patience karami had been aazims designated successor for a reason he trusted karami and recognized him as the most able to take over should anything ever happen to him and it had ashford had been extremely fortunate to get to aazim before scot harvath and the carlton group could hand him over to the cia as aazim was a british citizen and ashford had worked with harvath and the carlton group to stop an aazim cell from carrying out attacks in london carlton had kept him abreast of what was happening including reading him in on the operation to apprehend aazim and turn him over to the cia in yemen but as soon as aazim had been killed the information flow stopped ashford knew better than to be paranoid they were closing their ranks and being much tighter with their compartmentalization it just meant information would be harder to get they had to believe he had something of value to trade and an idea had already begun to form in his mind about how to get reed carlton to let down his guard and show his cards for the time being though he needed to focus on karami james standing wanted the silver and gold attacks launched carefully he typed out the appropriate activation message translated it and placed it in the draft folder for karami logging out of the account he scrubbed his back trail and shut down his computer he did the math in his head and computed when news of the first attacks would hit the wires at best there were about sixteen hours before all hell broke loose in the united states chapter southern california like most in the special operations community retired or otherwise hank mcbride was incredibly resourceful he had managed to track down everything on luke ralstons list with southern california the home to seal teams and under naval special warfare group one hank had probably done it with one phone call two at the most the motorcycle was a red yamaha yzf it was a bit much for ralstons taste but no one gave flashy street bikes a second look in southern cal it was fast and maneuverable which was what he had asked for if he needed to weave through traffic or outrun the police the yamaha would do the job perfectly using a motorcycle also meant that he could wear a fullface helmet and be able to better conceal his identity the pistol was a cold drop piece that one of hanks buddies always took with him when he drove down to mexico it was a colt anaconda with a fourinch barrel chambered in magnum ralston hadnt expected a revolver especially from a seal but he was happy to have a firearm any kind of firearm and he tucked it into the backpack hank had given him along with the other items it had been a big gamble meeting alisa in manhattan beach the day before it was an even bigger gamble traveling up to la now broad daylight was not the environment ralston wanted to operate in but hed been given no choice alisas father had refused to help her unless she told him who the favor was for she was asking for a very dangerous introductionone incongruous with the legal dealings of an entertainment attorney hed already lost one daughter because he wasnt able to protect her from violent criminal elements hed be damned if he was going to lose another with no choice alisa had filled her father in on the entire meeting shed had with ralston martin sevan wasnt happy he told her hed have to think about the favor ralston wanted the sevan family to do for him two hours later martin called alisa back and told her to have ralston come and see him the next day at noon ralston had no idea if the man was going to help him or not but the fact that he had asked him to come to the house and not the office was a good sign and ralston had decided to go prepared he arrived two hours early after driving by the front of the house and not seeing anything that gave him cause for concern he found a place to park his bike and then secreted himself in a ravine along the side of the house he had a perfect vantage point from which to surveil martins property as well as that of his immediate neighbors ralston didnt know how much animosity if any avas father harbored toward him over her death for all he knew the man despised him and was planning to set him up and hand him over to the police he had to accept that as a possibility he could very well be walking into a trap from his vantage point though the only people he had seen in or near the house were the gardener and the housekeeper both of whom he had met before that was it at a quarter to twelve a black aston martin rapide pulled into the driveway and stopped near the entrance to the house ralston watched as martin sevan exited the vehicle retrieved his briefcase from the backseat and walked inside his movements were calm and unhurried he didnt glance around furtively as if trying to pick out nearby police spotters who might be poorly hidden and who could give the entire sting away he looked like any businessman who might have come home for lunch so far so good thought ralston he decided to remain in the ravine a little while longer five minutes later a white acura pulled into the driveway and parked right behind martins aston martin from behind the wheel a heavyset middleaged man wearing a dark suit climbed out of the car unlike sevan this man was a bundle of nervous energy he was visibly uncomfortable he took a long slow glance around his immediate area before turning toward the house walking up to the front door he depressed the button for the bell and waited to be admitted ralston didnt know what to make of the man he was definitely jumpy about something at five minutes after twelve having seen no further activity ralston decided he needed to make a decision actually he needed to make a move the decision had already been made he hadnt come all this way just to turn around and leave he had no idea who the second man in the house was but he assumed he would soon find out with no police surveillance that he could detect he had no choice but to make his way inside he looped around the back of the house skirting the swimming pool he found the patio doors unlocked martin sevan and the man in the dark suit were sitting in sevans home office waiting for him hello marty ralston said as he stepped into the room sevan was in his late fifties he was short but powerfully built his black hair was slicked back and he had the same penetrating green eyes as his daughters he had removed his suit coat and his shirtsleeves were rolled halfway up his thick forearms it was the first time the two men had seen each other since the trial hello luke sevan responded howve you been ive been better he replied knowing that lawyers never asked a question they didnt know the answer to sevan didnt bother responding instead he introduced the man in the dark suit luke id like you to meet aleksey lavrov aleksey this is luke ralston shook the mans hand and sevan invited them to sit anybody need a drink he asked as he poured himself one yes please said lavrov his english was heavily accented the collar of his shirt was too tight and fleshy rolls of fat spilled over the top despite having put on a suit presumably for the meeting he hadnt managed to get the knot of his tie all the way up and his top button showed by about a halfinch he was sweating and his narrow eyes purposefully avoided ralstons gaze luke sevan asked something for you no thanks marty sevan poured a drink for himself and one for lavrov and then took a seat behind his large desk while the other two men sat in upholstered chairs on the other side facing him so he said drawing the word out ralston remained quiet this was martys show and he was going to run it any way he saw fit ralston just hoped that having lavrov present meant that he had the information he needed i made a couple of phone calls on your behalf luke sevan stated the lapd are very interested in speaking with you well get around to talking sooner or later im sure you will what about mr salomon what about him asked ralston is he okay unharmed hes a little shaken up as you might imagine but hes doing okay all things considered why sevan pursed his lower lip as he shook his head just making sure thats all i told alisa he was okay she told me you did so why are you asking because luke im a litigator a big part of what i do is reading people i wanted to hear you say it or more important see you say it ralston didnt like being put under the microscope but it was he who had come asking for the favor so he bit his tongue larry salomon is alive and well you know one of the theories that the lapd detectives are pursuing is that you kidnapped salomon stated sevan well thats a pretty stupid theory is it for crying out loud marty if i was going to kidnap larry salomon i would have been a lot more creative and wouldnt have left calling cards with my name on them all over his house and property replied ralston reasonable or not its one of their theories they definitely have you pegged as the person who did all of the killing all the killing two of larry salomons associates were already dead when i entered the house if i hadnt done what i had larry would have been killed as well sevan put up his hands and with a wry smile said dont shoot im just the messenger ralston wondered if he was being played with and decided to get to the point alisa tells me you can help interesting all i told her was that you shouldnt have asked her for that kind of favor i explained that if you wanted something like that youd have to come to me sevan was playing with him well here i am marty you didnt need me to come all the way up here especially with the police and god knows who else looking for me you could have told alisa to tell me to go to hell but you didnt you wanted me to come see you therefore i can only assume you wanted to tell me to go to hell in person or you want to help me which one is it are you going to help me let me ask you a question instead replied the attorney what would you have done if you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that those two scumbag drug dealers were the ones in the alley that night what if you knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that they had been the ones who had killed ava would you have testified then no sevan arched his eyebrows no why not if i could have positively identified the people in that alley they never would have made it to trial i would have killed them both myself said ralston the attorney smiled at the man in the dark suit lavrov as if to say be careful with me i know dangerous people he then turned his focus back to ralston you still sound very passionate almost genuine fuck you marty i didnt come here to take your crap if you want to hold me responsible for what happened to ava if you want to blame meafter all you know i tried to do for herthen at least have the guts to say so but dont you dare impugn my integrity and question how i felt about her and still feel about the people who did that to her dont you fucking do that sevan sat quietly as did lavrov who was being made very uncomfortable by what he was hearing finally sevan said what if i told you you were right right about what right about the men in the alley that night what if i told you that i had tracked down the men responsible for murdering ava id say youre lying why would you say that because replied ralston if youd found them youd have already turned them in to the police sevan opened the drawer in front of him and removed an envelope slowly he slid it halfway across the desk whats this the names and addresses of the two men who murdered ava ralston looked at him and youve just been sitting on this information lets say ive been trying to decide what the right thing is to do with it was sevan nuts talking about taking out avas killers in front of lavrov the attorney seemed to be reading his mind mr lavrov is trustworthy dont worry about him you dont want this on your conscience marty give whatever you have to the police even if it means avas killers only get life in prison or worse walk free marty youre an attorney for gods sake youd throw that all out the window for revenge all of this ralston asked looking around the luxuriously appointed office your family already lost ava they couldnt stand to lose you too dont be a fucking idiot marty whoevers names are in that envelope give them to the cops you may hate my guts but one day youll thank me sometimes revenge is a dish thats better never served sevan looked at lavrov i told you didnt i told him what said ralston sevan shoved the envelope the rest of the way across the desk so that it came to rest in front of ralston open it ralston was tempted but at the same time he knew that if he read what was inside that envelope and those people ended up dead hed be one of the prime suspects having lavrov witness the entire thing just gave him a bad feeling not interested sevans eyebrows arched again i think you should open it ralston leaned back in his chair his body language was answer enough the attorney looked at lavrov and said you open it lavrov glanced at ralston and then leaned forward and timidly retrieved the envelope the mans fat fingers approached the flap of the envelope as if he were handling the repository of some historic document hurry up already sevan prodded lavrov did as he was told he removed a single folded sheet of paper setting the envelope on the desk he unfolded the page and turned it around so ralston could see chapter any question that martin sevan had called him to the house to do anything but mess with him was immediately put to rest the piece of paper lavrov held up was completely blank fuck you marty ralston said as he grabbed his backpack and stood up he was halfway to the door before he heard sevan say get back in here you passed i what he said turning angrily to face the attorney you heard me i said passed now get back over here and sit down up yours marty sevan nodded yeah youre pissed off i get it now stop acting like a little girl and sit down weve got a lot to go over is this some big game to you marty the attorneys face was as serious as ralston could ever remember having seen it this is not a game this is my career hell this is my life and my familys lives you think im just going to hand over the kind of information you asked for without knowing if i can trust you what does trusting me have to do with anything luke do i look like im stupid larry salomon is your meal ticket in this town nobody likes when somebody messes with their rice bowl understand ralston was following him but didnt know exactly where he was trying to go with it sevan shook his head this town robs people of their souls i needed to know that you hadnt sold yours i needed to know that you were still the kind of guy who would do the right thing now ralston really was confused wait a second he said thats what i did at the trial and you hate my guts for it hates a very strong word dont bullshit me marty your entire family wrote me off after i refused to testify against those two guys it was a tough time for our family ralston looked right into the mans eyes yeah well at least you all had each other i had nobody i loved ava and still miss her to the point that it hurts worse than that i have to live with always wondering what would have happened if i had only gotten to her faster or what would have happened if i had told the producer i was working with at the time that he could fire me but i had to take ava away for her own good what do you want me to say asked sevan frankly marty i dont give a damn i loved ava i know you did too but your family circled the wagons and i was left out in the cold i get it i was just avas boyfriend you didnt owe me anything and i didnt expect anything the attorney looked at him we could have handled things better im sorry that we didnt an apology that had been the last thing ralston had been expecting he didnt know how to respond and sevan seemed to sense that it wasnt right we wanted no strike that we needed someone to blame for avas death and when those two animals walked free from that courtroom we focused our anger on you i think all of us in time realized that was the wrong thing to do but you were essentially out of our lives and our pride kept us from seeking you out las a pretty small town marty we just wanted to put all of it behind us it was easier to just let it go picking at a scab doesnt help it heal ralston shook his head scab nice analogy sevan tilted his head to the side and raised his palms the fact is that i have a chance to try to make things right and thats why ive asked you here gesturing to lavrov he added thats why ive asked both of you here ralston retook his seat and turned his attention to the overweight man in the dark suit he didnt say a word he simply set his backpack down at his feet kept one eye on the window and waited for the man to speak lavrov looked at sevan when the attorney nodded lavrov turned his eyes back to ralston and said clearly and evenly i think i know who sent the spetsnaz soldiers to kill your friend chapter ralston didnt know aleksey lavrov from a hole in the ground informants could be notoriously unreliable especially somebody elses they liked settling scores by turning parties against each other that marty sevan vouched for the guy didnt mean lavrov was without an alternative agenda until he was sure ralston knew enough to play his cards close to his vest ever the exceptional reader of people sevan noted ralstons reticence and said before we proceed it would probably be helpful if aleksey gave you a bit of background on himself yes that would be helpful ralston replied the attorney gestured to lavrov as if he were coaching him for trial and nodded for him to speak the husky man reached for his cocktail and took a long sip before setting it back on the coaster after drying his mouth with the back of his meaty hand he cleared his throat and said i work with the fbis los angeles field office i am a naturalized american citizen but russian by birth i work in the offices russian organized crime task force ralstons eyes flicked to sevan what was he getting him into dont worry the attorney said aleksey is an informant for the task force hes not an agent i am one of the fbis sources within the russian community lavrov clarified and whats your connection to mr lavrov asked ralston im his attorney said sevan i actually arranged his relationship with the fbis los angeles field office in exchange for dropping certain charges that had been brought against aleksey and he owed you a favor aleksey is a very smart man who realizes that it pays to have a good lawyer right aleksey the heavyset man nodded ralston looked at the russian warily so what do you have for me aleksey mr sevan explained to me that you think the men who tried to kill your friend mr salomon were russian more specifically russian spetsnaz correct correct lavrov rubbed his chin please i am not being disrespectful but many american people watch movies and think every russian is spetsnaz ralston looked at him mr sevan did not explain to you who i am did he he told me you work in movies that you make sure people understand how to shoot guns and drive cars i assume then that you are a stuntman correct youre partially correct ralston replied glad sevan had not told the man everything about his past i am a technical consultant on films before that i was in the us military i have worked with russian spetsnaz before then you must have been someone very important in the military russian spetsnaz are not easy to kill they are very difficult to kill even regular russians are not easy to kill but you killed four spetsnaz ralston didnt want to get into details with lavrov you will have to take my word for it aleksey you are sure that these men were not russian mafia maybe one of the men had a tattoo right here he said pointing under his arm it was his blood type in cyrillic this is spetsnaz lavrov relented you are correct so who in los angeles would have been able to coordinate a spetsnaz hit team the russian thought about the question for a moment you would be looking at someone with experience within the russian intelligence services the fsb or what used to be called kgb same people same mentality same game plan only the name is different i can think of three men three ralston thought he was going to have his work cut out for him ill need names addresses and what kind of security they may have lavrov held up his hand one of the men has been in russia visiting family since the beginning of the summer another man is very old and lives in a nursing home i dont think these are the men you want why not besides one being out of the country and the other needing a nurse to feed him ralston knew that the italian mafia often ran operations longdistance and that some of their most senior members were also their most dangerous the line about old age and treachery popped into his mind yes he said besides age and proximity why should i discount those two the first man the one who is on vacation in russia he was kgb ninth directorate he operated the moscow vip subway the man in the nursing home was in the fifth directorate he dealt with censorship of writers and filmmakers i still find it ironic that he ended up retiring in hollywood lavrov raised good points tell me about the third man said ralston his name is yaroslav yatsko former russian fsb and current russian organized crime figure here in los angeles what was his position with the fsb he was with the first chief directorate of the kgb actually he specialized in foreign espionage and stayed on through the transition from kgb to fsb from what i understand he continued with foreign espionage activities before moving to california ralston had to wonder what the hell was wrong with the american government that they let these kinds of people into the united states whats he doing now what kinds of things is he involved with lavrov shrugged extortion stock fraud antiquities scams identity theft credit card fraud money laundering counterfeiting human trafficking from mexico arms dealing and film piracy take your pick what about murder for hire violence and murder are the sine quibus non of russian organized crime offered sevan without those two ingredients there would be no russian organized crime yaroslav yatsko said lavrov keeps a very quiet low profile he hides behind multiple legitimate businesses in order to justify his income and comfortable lifestyle but is he known to carry out murders for hire repeated ralston specifically no but it is rumored throughout the community that he has facilitated several highprofile assassinations in mexico allegedly he has carried these attacks out on behalf of warring cartels politicians and business leaders thats mexico im talking about here what about in the us lavrov shook his head then ill want the address of that nursing home too it looks like im going to be busy that might not be necessary replied sevan why not because of the mexico rumors said lavrov what about them most of the victims had exceptional security they had bodyguards alarm systems dogs all of the things you would expect of the wealthy and powerful especially in a third world country like mexico supposedly that is yaroslav yatskos claim to fame he can get around anyones security and how did he do that by eschewing local talent and bringing in his own people from russia said lavrov he is known for only using the best he only hires spetsnaz chapter northern virginia if his cell phone hadnt rung harvath could have easily slept another several hours fumbling for the device on his nightstand he activated the call and brought the phone to his ear harvath he said looking for his watch to see what time it was scot asked a womans voice on the other end its riley did i wake you up no he lied sitting up in bed and trying to focus im still trying to beat back the jet lag whats up i owe you an apology for what for massachusetts harvath knew who she was talking about but not what i dont understand his condition remember when i told you the tasers werent designed for what you wanted to do she said but it worked it did but i thought it was just dumb luck or maybe the hand of god i dont know but i wasnt ready to believe you could restart someones heart with a taserno matter how many times you zapped him well weve been running tests here and it turns out that our patient has something called wpw or wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome it has to do with having an extra abnormal electrical pathway in the heart symptoms often dont appear until people are in their teens or early twenties it can cause rapid heartbeat and in more serious cases sudden death so whats his prognosis weve performed a catheterbased procedure known as ablation it should correct the problem thats great news said harvath and he meant it they were overdue does he have any brain damage not so far as we can tell when will you be able to restart the interrogations soon she replied hows chase all things considered pretty good the bullet did chip his humerus though impossible chase doesnt have a humorous bone in his body very funny harvath liked flirting with her and could picture her rolling her eyes hes going to live though right first this wasnt a lifethreatening injury said riley in fact i think your duct tape field dressing posed more of a risk to him than anything else most doctors think my duct tape bandages are cool those doctors probably had nurses to assist them your duct tape idea may be clever but its a pain to remove especially for the patient hes a big boy trust me he tells me all the time you didnt hurt him you asked about his injury she replied trying to steer the conversation back to where it had been there appears to be a little wrist drop due to some radial nerve injury but if he does the requisite physical therapy everything should be fine what do you mean by wrist drop riley took a breath and then said hes a bit limpwristed harvath laughed please tell me thats how youll write it up for his medical file its not funny yeah it is that file follows you for life she ignored him anyway i thought youd want the update i appreciate it thank you i guess thats it then harvath was picturing her in his mind and didnt want to let her go just yet he liked the sound of her voice whos going to head up the interrogation once it gets started he asked hoping to extend their conversation a little bit longer i havent seen them yet said riley but apparently the agency flew in a couple of specialists last night theyre ready to go as soon as the medical team gives the allclear theyre good people some of the best theyll do a good job they couldnt be any worse she said than who asked harvath chase chase what are you talking about asked harvath he tried to start the interrogation already no but he asked if i had access to ketamine horse tranquilizer thats one of its uses in humans its highly hallucinogenic chase showed me a pair of specialeffects contact lenses he had with him that could make a persons eyes look like the devil he wanted to pump the patient full of ketamine and freak the hell out of him in hopes of getting him to talk harvath laughed again i guess thats one way of doing it you would actually endorse that kind of thing for some backwater taliban member living in a cave in waziristan maybe but not for this patient i think chase was just pulling your leg i might be inclined to believe you if he didnt actually own a pair of those contacts replied riley hes young and aggressive hell learn in the meantime im not letting him near the ketamine probably a good idea said harvath who sensed their conversation was winding down ive got to get back ill call you if i learn anything new i appreciate it thanks for keeping me in the loop sure thing she replied stay safe you too he answered and then disconnected the call and set the phone back on his nightstand she didnt have to call him she could have had the old man or even chase do it he was glad that she had contacted him personally harvath sat there propped up in bed and debated whether he should try to grab some more sleep though the quality of what hed been able to get so far was marginal at best hed still been out for ten hours what he needed now was some exercise getting out of bed he got dressed in a pair of shorts and an atomic dog tshirt a creature of habit he tucked a loaded taurus mm slim semiautomatic into a belly band and headed downstairs he bypassed the coffeemaker and grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge after hydrating he pulled on his running shoes and stepped outside it was a perfect day sunny and with a light breeze his house was a small renovated eighteenthcentury stone church known as bishops gate that stood on several acres of land overlooking the potomac river just south of george washingtons mount vernon estate during the revolutionary war the anglican reverend of bishops gate had been an outspoken loyalist who had provided sanctuary and aid to british spies as a result the colonial army had attacked the church inflicting grave damage it lay in ruins until when the office of naval intelligence or oni was established to seek out and report on the enormous postcivil war explosion in technological capabilities of other foreign navies several covert oni agent training centers were established up and down the eastern seaboard to instruct naval attaches and military affairs officers on the collection of intelligence and the finer aspects of espionage because of its isolated yet prime location not far from washington dc bishops gate was secretly rebuilt and became the onis first covert officer training school as the oldest continuously operating intelligence service in the nation the oni eventually outgrew bishops gate the stubby yet elegant church with its stone rectory was relegated to mothball status the navy had many such properties in its inventory but the majority of those suitable for use as dwellings were reserved for highlevel defectors and other displaced political personages the united states government found itself responsible for regardless of a propertys status if it fell within the us navys portfolio the us navy was responsible for maintaining it with so many properties to look after maintenance and carrying costs were quite high this coupled with the fact that harvath a us navy seal had shown exemplary service to the nation played a large role in the secretary of the navys agreeing to a special arrangement suggested by the former president of the united states the church building and the attached rectory which had been converted into a nicesized house came to more than four thousand square feet of living space those structures along with a garage an outbuilding and the extensive grounds of bishops gate had been deeded to harvath in a ninetynineyear lease per the lease he was to pay a token rent of one us dollar per annum all that was required of him was that he maintain the property in a manner befitting its historic status and that he vacate the premises within twentyfour hours if ever given notice with or without cause by the united states navy while harvath had gone above and beyond for the president he had still been stunned to be extended such a generous offer on his first visit while exploring the rectory attic he found a beautifully handcarved piece of wood upon it was the motto of the anglican missionaries it seemed strangely fitting for the career harvath had pursued transiens adiuvanos it read i go overseas to give help at that moment he had known he was home that was several years ago and now he couldnt imagine living anywhere else standing on his front steps he stretched each of his legs he had decided on a short run just up to mount vernon and back once his muscles were warm he started his jog exercise always had a way of clearing his head and making him feel more energized today was no exception he didnt think about work at all he thought about the things he needed to get done around his house he thought about getting out on the potomac and doing a little sailing he also thought about what kind of ruse he could run to get riley turner to dc for a visit a few miles later at the entrance to mount vernon he turned around picked up his pace and ran back when he returned to the bottom of his driveway he stopped and walked the rest of the way to the house allowing his body to cool down it had been a good workout and the endorphins were racing through his body passing through the kitchen he ignored the coffee machine again and headed upstairs for a quick shower when he was finished he threw the temperature selector to the coldest setting and forced himself to remain under the icecold water for a full thirty seconds it was better than three shots of espresso he toweled off and shaved at the sink when he was done shaving he walked into his bedroom and grabbed a pair of jeans and a shirt from his closet it had been a while since hed had time all to himself to do whatever he wanted the last couple of months had been a blur because it was saturday there were plenty of people harvath could have called to meet for drinks but traffic in and out of dc would be a nightmare he also had a policy of not going out for the first couple of nights after getting back from an operation he knew himself well enough to know that he might feel good now but in an hour or two he could be ready to crash again hed be better company on another night besides sometimes he enjoyed spending the evening alone with his fridge all but empty cooking wasnt an option grabbing his keys he headed outside and hopped into his truck twenty minutes and two stops later he had returned with a sixpack of beer and a bag of barbecue from johnny macs rib shack parking the car he breezed through the house long enough to drop four of the beers in the fridge kick off his shoes and grab a roll of paper towels before heading down to his dock it was officially fall but northern virginia was enjoying a nice indian summer having been on the road so much harvath was grateful to be enjoying at least a small piece of it walking to the end of his pier he sat down and leaned against one of the posts out on the water there were plenty of boaters getting a head start on their weekend and enjoying what was left of the quickly fading daylight harvath opened one of the beers and took a long sip hed made the right choice by staying in tonight right now there wasnt any place hed rather be than sitting right there looking out over the potomac no matter how often he traveled or how long he was gone when he thought about home this was what he thought about a couple of beers and his pier this was the one place in the world where he always felt the most relaxed it was the one place where he seemed to be able to leave his problems at least most of them back on the shore taking another drink he watched as a boat passed by pulling a young skier in a wetsuit inside the boat mom dad and a sibling cheered harvath smiled it reminded him not only of why he did what he did but also of what he hoped to have for himself at some point in time reaching into his bag from johnny macs he pulled out a barbecued pork sandwich and tore a paper towel from the roll as he watched the sky begin to turn orange he figured the evening was just about perfect the only thing that could have made it better was having someone else there to share it with him for the moment he was happy to take what he had been given he knew all too well that perfect moments had a way of getting shattered chapter des moines iowa the century theater multiplex in jordan creek was the perfect place to see your very first movie they had twenty screens stadium seating an arcade area and even ice cream at the concession counter mike bentley smiled at his wife shannon as their fiveyearold twins grabbed their hands and pulled them through the parking lot in hopes of speeding up their parents pace mom youre too slow complained trevor cmon dad said tyler cmon just to drive the boys nuts mike pretended he had pulled a hamstring and began to limp the twins cried out in protest mike teased them a moment more and then gave in and the family increased their pace the closest the twins had ever been to a movie theater was the dvd player in the back of shannons minivan tonight would be their first real movie theater experience it was opening weekend for a new animated family movie that mike and shannon had heard great things about they had read all of the books in the series to the boys and decided this would be the perfect first film experience for them mike an iowa state trooper had even arranged to have the night off so they could all go together shannon had suggested that maybe an afternoon matinee would be better but the boys had insisted that nobody goes to movies in the daytime if you want to see a real movie they had said you have to go when its dark in the face of such wonderful child logic shannon found she couldnt say no the boys had taken a nap that afternoon and when they came down from their room their mother and father were bowled over to see that they had dressed up for their evening out they wore matching khaki trousers blue blazers white buttondown shirts and matching striped clipon ties it was so incredibly sweet that shannon had trouble keeping herself together even sweeter was that the boys insisted that their parents get dressed up for the big event as well mike and shannon complied when everyone was ready to go they piled into the minivan and drove to pizza hut the boys favorite restaurant for dinner everyone commented on how handsome the boys looked mike and shannon were very proud according to his wife mike was actually beaming at one point trevor and tyler did a great job of not spilling anything on their nice outfits and actually passed on dessert in order to save room for popcorn at the theater after paying for the tickets mike handed one to each of their sons and allowed them to hand them to the ticket taker who tore them in half and guided the family to theater number six anybody want to play some video games before the movie starts mike asked trevor looked at him dad first weve got to get our popcorn and then we have to get our seats yeah said tyler if you dont get your seats early you have to sit in the front row and you end up with a whole creek in your neck who told you that grandpa the boys said in unison mike looked at his wife and shook his head shannons father lived with them and the boys never made a move without conferring with him theyd wanted him to come along with them tonight but his emphysema had been bugging him and he didnt have the strength to drag his oxygen around with him mike loved the man like he was his own father but he was enjoying its just being the four of them tonight well i dont want anybody getting a crick in their neck he said winking at shannon so i guess wed better get our popcorn and hurry up to our seats when asked by the concession stand attendant what size popcorn they wanted the boys each requested an extralarge shannon tried to talk them out of it but they had brought money along from their piggybanks wanting to help pay for the evening and they insisted if they dont finish them they dont finish them mike whispered to his wife and if they get sick in the car on the ride home she replied daddy gets to clean it up mike smiled and gave shannon a pinch right in the spot that always made her yelp she laughed and slapped his hand away then told the boys they could each have their own popcorn bag if they ordered the small negotiations began in earnest and shannon caved allowing each of the boys to have a medium popcorn and drinks in hand mike bentley led his family toward theater number six as they walked in the boys eyes widened at the enormous space despite what grandpa had said both of the boys said they wanted to sit in the front row though there was no such thing as a bad seat in a modern theater like the century mike was happy when tyler spotted a group of four seats about halfway up and close to the middle when it came to seats hed always been a middlemiddle kind of guy and he was pleased to see that it was obviously a characteristic passed down on the y chromosome a lot of families had turned out for the movie the theater was quickly filling up and more families were still pouring in the bentleys settled into their seats and mike began fielding questions from the boys about all the premovie ads playing on the screen during a lull while something onscreen had captured the boys attention he leaned over to shannon and kissed her as far as he was concerned this was just about the perfect evening when the lights began to dim the boys nearly leaped out of their seats they were so excited mike was so focused on his family that he never noticed a north african man carrying a backpack who walked into the darkened theater all by himself and sat four seats away chapter qusay ali atwa had been waiting for this moment for years there were times when he thought he had been forgotten about but they had told him that that would never happen he had been instructed to blend into american society as best he could and to wait he was to pray and maintain his faith above all he was never to reveal and also never to forget why he had been sent to america in exchange qusays family in sudan had been well looked after they received monthly payments that allowed them a much better standard of living than they ever could have realized had he stayed behind in their village qusays standard of living had been considerably improved as well even the poorest of the poor in the united states lived better than the majority of the islamic world they had cell phones air conditioning flatscreen tvs satellite service food clothing cars and shoes it was all the more reason to hate america they hoarded the worlds wealth and placed manmade law above gods divine law qusay had to work every day to conceal his hatred for them des moines had not been his choice it had been chosen for him the winters were unbearably cold no matter how many layers he wore he spent nearly half the year chilled to the bone he was an extremely slim man in his thirties whose appearance reflected the effects of starvation and malnourishment in his youth his eyes were sunk deep into their sockets and his cheekbones were severely pronounced the brown skin across his face was drawn taut his skull appeared misshapen and his twiglike limbs appeared impossibly thin as if they were ready to snap at any moment but despite his outwardly frail appearance inside qusay ali atwa beat the heart of a warrior he believed deeply in allah and the messages he had conveyed through the prophet mohammed as the holy quran instructed qusay took neither jews nor christians as his friends he had been taught since childhood that they were perverted transgressors they were unbelievers and unbelievers were like panting dogs they were the vilest of creatures and it was his duty to fight them sometimes he had to work extra hard to remind himself of these facts at the poultryprocessing plant where he worked he saw incredible acts of kindness and even love between his coworkers such acts had even been directed at him in inclement weather he had been offered rides at holidays though they knew he was a muslim they had invited him to their homes on one occasion when he had been very sick several of the women had cooked for him and had dropped the food off at his home they had even included lists of ingredients for each dish in order to demonstrate that the meals had been prepared with his halal dietary restrictions he threw all of the food into the garbage qusay consoled himself with multiple verses from the quran that clearly stated that good deeds by unbelievers made no difference in the eyes of allah if they refused to submit to islam they were destined for the fires of hell there was no redemption for them the quran was also clear that people of religions other than islam were to be violently punished not only in the afterlife but in the here and now nonmuslims were to be fought with every tool available until there was no other religion but islam it was qusays duty to pursue the unbelievers to seize them wherever they could be found and slay them allah was strict in his punishment and qusay accepted willingly his fate in carrying it out when he received the phone call he was very excited he was told to put his affairs in order he was told how soon before the attack to make his martyrdom video and what to do with it his handler cautioned him not to speak about his assignment with anyone lest the infidels discover their plan qusay took every word seriously and followed the instructions to the letter he selected the materials just as he had been taught breaking up the purchases among several stores so as not to attract attention they were readily available everyday items and no one gave any of them or him a second thought back in his apartment qusay combined the ingredients and assembled his package just as he had been shown he had been told to start detaching himself from this world and to begin thinking of what awaited him in paradise two days before he was to carry out his assignment he received a package in the mail it was a small vial of pills sent from a supposed internet pharmacy he was instructed how and when to take the pills and was told they would help make his assignment easier as he would be more relaxed finally it was explained to qusay one last time what would happen to his family if he did not successfully carry out his operation he understood and he vowed that he would not fail the only thing he wished was that he could have contacted them one last time he would have liked to have spoken with his father and his two brothers to his disappointment it was strictly forbidden qusay could only hope that they would be proud of him he prayed and took strength reading from the holy quran before leaving in the theater parking lot he removed the orange vial from his pocket and consumed the last of the pills twenty minutes later he purchased his ticket and entered the multiplex the lights had already been dimmed when he entered the extremely crowded theater number six and took one of the last remaining seats to his relief no one seemed to notice him or the backpack he was carrying placing it at his feet he sat back and silently prayed trying to remember not to nod or move his lips as he had been told law enforcement officers had been trained to look for such cues as they indicated that a shahid was about to martyr himself as far as qusay could tell though there were no police officers present in the theater it was nothing but families mostly mothers with young children though there were a handful of fathers scattered about one in particular with two blond boys had turned several minutes into the film and looked at him he had then turned and looked at him twice more despite the calming effect the drugs were supposed to have qusay grew more apprehensive each time the man turned and looked at him he was worried that somehow the man had divined his intent but if that was so why hadnt the man done anything qusay decided it was foolish to wait any longer he readied his package just as the man looked at him a fourth time and stood up from his seat mike what are you doing a woman said but the man ignored her moving to the end of his row and stepping out into the aisle the man pointed at qusay and gestured for him to get up qusay stared at him his heart racing the man removed a badge of some sort held it up and gestured once more for him to get up and step into the aisle all around them people were beginning to pay attention to the unfolding spectacle rather than the movie you ordered the man as he swept his sport coat back and placed his right hand on the butt of a pistol holstered at his hip iowa state trooper put your hands where i can see them at this point qusay could feel all eyes in the theater on him he thought of his family and smiled as mike bentley drew his pistol qusay ali atwa detonated his backpack chapter northern virginia when the light had completely gone and harvath had finished his meal he left the dock and headed back up to his house sooner or later the old man was going to want his written report tonight seemed as good a time as any grabbing his laptop from the safe in his office harvath powered it up and made himself comfortable at his desk normally his dog would have been sitting right underneath his feet but hed been away so much hed left him with friends harvath spent the next several hours working on his report reed carlton was a detail person and never complained that harvaths summaries were too long that was fine by harvath he was a detail guy as well and he found that the deeper into detail he went the better he was able to wrap his head around what had gone right what had gone wrong and what needed to happen going forward he had begun his narrative in the aftermath of the yemen operation and moved forward halfway through he knew he wasnt going to be able to sleep until he had written everything down so he got up and went into the kitchen to brew a pot of coffee carrying an extralarge mug back to his desk he sat down at his laptop and picked up right where he had left off as he wrote he became increasingly confident that karami the uppsala cell leader was still in sweden leaving the country after what had happened would have been too risky his network might be able to get him out by boat but theyd have to wait until the heat died down harvath made note of it in his report and also made a mental note to bring it up with the old man from there harvath moved on to a momentbymoment breakdown of everything that had happened leading up to the explosion chase was undoubtedly working on a similar report for his superiors and harvath made an additional note to get a copy of it to see if it would help fill in any of his blanks soon he found himself speculating about what had gone wrong it wasnt easy reliving the blast and envisioning the deaths of schiller and his team but it was necessary harvath put his ego aside and was completely candid about where he felt he had failed and how he believed the terrorists had been able to gain the upper hand harvath was focused on being brutally honest regarding his possible failings in the assignment men under his command had died and he owed it to them and their families to try to ferret out every single detail no matter how damaging it might be to him in order to make sure that such a thing never happened again he was so focused on this part of his report that he didnt at first hear his cell phone vibrating on the credenza behind him when he did finally notice it he reached for it without looking and raised the device to his ear harvath he said absentmindedly as he finished typing his sentence with his free hand do you have the tv on asked the old man harvath was no longer focused on his report no why he asked reaching for the remote and turning on the tv in his office whats going on we just got hit simultaneous attacks in multiple cities across the country what were the targets he asked as he flipped to the channel he wanted movie theaters multiple bombings in at least twenty of them harvath had one of the cable news networks up on his tv and he could see live footage of fire trucks and ambulances outside a theater complex in oregon the death toll is predicted to be in the thousands harvath feared the old man was right on a saturday night many theaters would be packed do we know anything about the bombers the fbi has taken the lead and theyre already on the ground at several of the sites ive got a call in to a contact there and hes going to share whatever they find harvath watched as footage from other movie theater bombings was fed onto the screen there was no one word to describe the feeling that was rushing through him it was eerily reminiscent of how he had felt on it was a mixture of pure rage and a haunting guiltridden feeling of responsibility it was his job and the job of others like him to stop things like this it was their job as sheepdogs to keep the wolves away from the flock they had failed though they needed to be right days a year the terrorists had to be right only once it was only a matter of time nevertheless that didnt make harvath feel any better about what was unfolding right now on tv screens across the country somehow the wolves had snuck one pasta big one thousands of people were dead there was no telling at this point how many more were injured the sheepdogs had just chalked up a major loss do we have any idea who was behind this he asked not at this point said carlton but i think we should assume its our network if that turned out to be true then chase was spoton about their going operational what can i do moonracer thinks he may have something how soon can you get to the office harvath looked at his watch i can be there in an hour hurry up replied the old man if this is our network this is just a warmup theyre going to try to hit us again and i want to make sure they dont succeed chapter even though he was contracted to the dod harvath and his organization technically didnt exist that meant he couldnt barrel up to reston under lights and klaxon he didnt even have them instead he had to apply a lead foot and hope he didnt get pulled over along the way the traffic wasnt as heavy as it would have been only an hour before but it was still rough harvath shot from lane to lane ticking off a lot of other drivers many of whom leaned on their horns and gave him the finger the fact that he was driving a brandnew black chevy tahoe made no difference if you didnt have lights or a klaxon you were the same as everybody else he tried to not let his own stress and animosity get the better of him nobody knew who he was to them he was an overly aggressive driver as he tore his way up to reston harvath listened to the reports of death and destruction coming in on his satellite radio it was horrific one thing was for sure mansoor aleems interrogation would be kicking off momentarily there was no way the cia was going to allow this attack to stand the president and the director of national intelligence were probably already rattling the cage of the director of central intelligence every single law enforcement and intelligence agency was calling its personnel in right now it was all hands on deck just then harvath saw a set of red and blue flashing lights racing up behind him he cursed out loud as he prepared to be pulled over but as the lights grew closer they suddenly swung over onto the shoulder harvath had no idea to whom the blackedout suburban belonged it was probably some fed racing back to dc in response to the attack harvath decided to take advantage of his lead and he swung onto the shoulder as well and slammed down his accelerator in order to catch up and ride his bumper at springfield the suburban took the capital beltway toward dc and harvath weaved back into traffic as he kept going toward reston in the twenty minutes it took him to make it the rest of the way to the office he counted no fewer than seventeen vehicles complete with flashing lights headed in the opposite direction toward dc pulling into the garage he grabbed the first parking space he could find and made his way to the service door and the private freight elevator beyond the first thing he noticed when he stepped onto the twentyfifth floor was that the guards at the entrance to the carlton group had been doubled and they were no longer in suits they were outfitted in full tactical gear with kneetocranium crye precision level iv ballistic protection and toting mps the companys security protocols were very specific a terrorist attack on us soil automatically kicked their alert level up several notches harvath was buzzed in and was told the old man was in the tactical operations center also known as the toc it was a hightech command post outfitted with computers and video monitors used for guiding tactical teams during an operation right now all of the monitors were tuned to different news channels each screen showcased the carnage from the bombings across the country the death toll is already over three thousand said carlton as harvath entered the toc shaking his head he motioned for harvath to follow they left the toc and joined nicholas in his scif the dogs barely stirred as the two men entered thered probably been a lot of activity over the last couple of hours and they were growing used to people coming and going we should have been able to stop this said nicholas we werent fast enough even if we had known about this specific attack theres no guarantee we could have stopped it in time said carlton harvath reached into nicholass fridge and pulled out an energy drink how does this stack up against your map of dots nicholas made a couple of clicks with his mouse and brought up a map of the united states these are the cities and towns where theater attacks have been confirmed he said as the locations popped up from coast to coast he next overlaid the terrorist map with differentcolored dots all around the country he then deactivated all of the dots except for one color and said we now know what kind of attack silver represents silver screens replied harvath how many years have we been worrying about an attack like this too many said the old man wait a second interjected nicholas you knew an attack like this was coming harvath shook his head al qaeda in particular likes symbolic targets the film industry has always been a deep concern for the united states so why didnt the government do anything like what ring every theater with tanks why not search people as they go in if we did that where would it end said harvath grocery stores buses libraries it would be better than nothing the government didnt just sit by carlton explained theyve been working closely with the movie industry for years the last thing hollywood wanted to do was suggest that theaters were unsafe but they were unsafe up till now they were completely safe now theyll be completely out of business said harvath the quintessential american experience of sitting with strangers in the dark watching a story unfold on the big screen is over nobody will go back to a theater after this people went back to flying after largely because they had to said carlton i agree with scot this will be different if you own any stock in netflix replied harvath it just went through the roof they all studied the map up on the monitor in silence for a moment what do we know about the identities of the bombers harvath asked anything the fbi has already pulled the security footage from all of the theaters that had cameras said carlton it appears to have been a mix of middle eastern men eighteen to thirtyfive and africans of the same age range from somalia or possibly sudan all of them carried backpacks into the theaters any names anything we can crossreference one ayman hasan shafik police in albuquerque were reviewing cctv footage with the fbi from their theater that got bombed and they recognized him immediately apparently he had been involved in several domesticabuse calls each time though his wife refused to press charges harvath shook his head shafik was a naturalized us citizen originally from egypt said carlton ill let nicholas fill you in on the rest the little man turned halfway around in his chair to look at harvath ever heard of tip harvath shook his head tip continued nicholas is short for total intelligence paradigm its something a finnish company has built and its absolutely amazing not only can it search any database but it looks for patterns and as it does it actually learns and thinks using artificial intelligence it searches medical records military records utility bills phone traffic patterns bank accounts facebook usage twitter emails online purchases credit card usage voter registration you name it it is so sophisticated it can access much older antiquated databases without having to write new programming to access it essentially it can read blind outofdate data the most amazing part is that it doesnt just spit out a list of items attached to the name you give it it develops an entire profile and from there builds a relationship tree of the people associated with your subject and the finns gave you access to this not exactly said nicholas but thats beside the point whats important is that we were able to enter ayman hasan shafiks name and then watch what tip came back with which was what said harvath fifteen years ago shafik arrived in the united states on the same egypt air flight as a man named mohammed fahad nazif that thing pulls up fifteenyearold flight manifests nicholas nodded so whos nazif according to tip nazif is a suspect in a highly classified fbi investigation wait a second replied harvath how does tip know about a highly classified fbi investigation nicholas exhaled the air from his lungs and shook his head he glanced at carlton before responding when the old man signaled his approval the little man began to speak what he had to say wasnt good in fact it was very very bad chapter up until tip said nicholas the gold standard in intelligence software belonged to the united states an american company called inslaw manufactured the premier collection case management and analysis system called promis prosecutors management information system it was the precursor to tip and operated looking for nexuses and correlations between people places and organizations its brilliantly adept at accessing proprietary corporate databases like those of banks credit card companies and electric water and gas utilities running complex algorithms it built amazing relationship trees outlining exactly who knows or who interacts with whom for example if you were the subject of an investigation and you started using more water or electricity it would suspect you had people staying with you it would then search through all your phone records and emails looking for any of your contacts that had suddenly stopped or reduced their usage of specific utilities and suggest that they might be the ones at your house this would be backed up with credit card transactions showing train or plane ticket purchases gasoline et cetera promis would then focus on these people and pull up all of their records searching for any criminal history mentions of them in previous investigations and any and all hints of a conspiracy that might exist between you two and what it might entail it was like the terminator it never slept it never stopped and the us was all too happy to share this software with its allied intelligence partners i say all too happy because the us had built a backdoor into the system this door allowed the us to monitor everything the other intelligence agencies were doing with the program and provided uncle sam with the same data that foreign intelligence agencies were accumulating interestingly enough the israeliswho conduct relentless espionage against their supposed ally and benefactor the united stateshad also been able to build a trapdoor into the system before america offered it to its intelligence partners the trapdoor provided the mossad with a treasure trove of information on jordanian intelligence operations in particular their vast dossiers on problematic palestinians copies of promis wound up on the black market and intelligence agencies and governments around the world began using it to track and kill dissidents the system was incredibly effective and became known as the perfect killing machine promis could tell an intelligence officer or a military commander that a certain dissident had been spotted in a particular part of the country and had taken a bus or train to another location where the dissident spent the night at a particular persons house it didnt matter if that person traveled under a false name or not age height hair eye color and any other distinguishing features could be fed into promis and it would search until it found the person it succeeded in getting tens of thousands of dissidents killed around the globe in fact theres an infamous story about an impending miners strike in south africa back in the apartheid days promis helped track down the instigators all of whom then disappeared the strike never took place it is easily one of the most incredible and most incredibly dangerous pieces of software ever constructed at least it was when the finns discovered the trapdoors in promis they realized they needed their own system not one provided by a foreign government with potentially ulterior motives thats when they started working on tip and took the process to an entirely new level they kept all the features of promis and then via true artificial intelligence went supernova by giving it a fully functioning brain tip not only can think it can anticipate the us is going crazy trying to catch up thats one of the reasons nsa has partnered with google and if you think tip is scary waitll you see what google is building with all theyre learning about human behavior from the millions of google search queries logged on their system every day harvath didnt doubt it and while he appreciated any edge he could get in the fight against americas enemies the damage programs like promis and tip could wreak in the wrong hands was obvious theres really no such thing as privacy anymore is there he said not in the united states replied nicholas at some point remind me to explain the narus technology to you and the electronic driftnet the nsa has strung out across cyberspace suffice it to say that every single email text message fax and phone conversation is being recorded and stored the problem for the nsa is sifting all that data for what they want its like trying to drink from a fire hose its one of the big reasons the terrorists are going lowtech as the chinese recognized when assembling their unrestricted warfare plans the us is overdependent on technology outwit that technology and you can flummox the worlds sole superpower thats what the finns have done with tip the system is so amazing it has been able to double back on america how many us intelligence agencies has it compromised asked harvath we dont know yet said carlton but weve alerted the appropriate people on our end was our group penetrated not that we can tell said nicholas they seemed more interested in the fbi cia nsa dia and other more highprofile places how long have you had access to tip not long enough okay so whats the connection with this guy shafik in albuquerque asked harvath changing gears you ran his name through tip and you came up with the egypt air flight manifest he arrived in the us with another egyptian named mohammed fahad nazif nazif is the subject of an fbi investigation correct correct why is the fbi interested in nazif nicholas clicked his mouse and zoomed in on the map three weeks ago mohammed fahad nazif blew himself up while rigging the support columns of a downtown chicago office building with militarygrade explosives what replied harvath the building is known as north riverside plaza we believe it was selected as another transportation target because it was built suspended over the amtrak train tracks so at least one of the dot colors represents transportation thats what we now think how come we didnt hear about this asked harvath the fbi used local media to put out a cover story about a gas rupture and a minor explosion said nicholas it happened in the business district late on a sunday evening no one other than nazif was injured or killed even so we should have been read in carlton shook his head you keep forgetting that youre in the private sector the fbi doesnt have to tell us anything it was true a decade past the fbi and the cia still barely shared any intelligence to expect either of them to share with a private organization was crazy weve got two dead egyptians then said harvath they both originally came into the country on the same flight fifteen years ago and both attempted to carry out terrorist attacks with explosives a few weeks apart one succeeded and one didnt does that about sum it up almost said nicholas they both came into the country on what is known as dual intent visas one came in on an l the other an hb the exact type of visa isnt important what is important is that because it was a dual intent visa they were allowed to apply for a green card while they were working here both requests were granted tell me they were both sponsored by the same employer said harvath nicholas shook his head unfortunately no they were sponsored by two different companies whats interesting though is that by accessing the department of state database we discovered that both men applied for their visas at the us consular office in cairo within weeks of each other okay said harvath sensing there was something else after accessing the immigration and naturalization service database we learned that both men though living in different parts of the country and working for different companies used the same law firm to process their green card applications dual intent visas with an american sponsor would have meant a lot less scrutiny upon arriving in the united states said harvath it also meant that they could come and go back to their country of origin if they wanted without raising significant attention essentially they had a corporation standing behind them vouching for their authenticity and because of their visas they were recognized as aliens of extraordinary ability how many dual intent visa holders were on that flight including shafik and nazif replied nicholas eight so besides our bombers there were six others said harvath hopeful that they might be on to something how many of the six ended up applying for and being granted a green card or us citizenship nicholas held up his left index finger only one another egyptian nicholas nodded want to venture a guess about when and where his original visa application was made same us consular office and within the same time frame as shafik and nazif he also used the same law firm to apply for his green card thats it said harvath what do we know about the law firm did the same lawyer handle all three green card applications the firm is based in new york replied nicholas though it could be the same attorney farming out the work to associates a different lawyer was listed on each application were trying to get hold of their billing records to see if there is some similarity in how the legal fees were paid where is our third egyptian now los angeles his name is tariq sarhan i want everything you can find on him said harvath ive already started said nicholas as he selected one of his monitors and brought up a multicolored graph whats that a quick snapshot of utility usage at the home registered to a mr tariq hafiz sarhan according to tip hes taken on several houseguests in the last thirtysix hours which means either hes got relatives who just dropped in or hes planning something replied harvath who then turned to carlton we need to handle this just us meaning no feds no local law enforcement thats not going to sit well especially not in the wake of what just happened we could get our asses handed to us we already have said harvath two of our operations have already gone sideways carlton knew he was right what do you want to do until we know whats going on we need to be totally off everyones radar we limit everything to just you me and nicholas the operation cant leave this room we dont even tell dod if we dont have to we go full black the old man looked at nicholas and then back at harvath okay he finally said tell us what youre going to need chapter los angeles the home of yaroslav yatsko the exfsb agent sat in the hollywood hills above sunset boulevard it was pink stucco with a small mosaicstudded swimming pool and hot tub that spilled its warm water into the pool like a waterfall the landscaping was lush and thick it was early evening and no one saw luke ralston when he magnetized an alarm contact point jimmied a window in the back and let himself in the house was empty yet the smell of sour russian cigarette smoke lingered in the air yatsko had been here and judging by the packed bag sitting at the foot of the bed in the master bedroom he was planning to come back ralston searched the bag it included some clothes and a few toiletry items but that was all yatsko appeared to be getting ready to go to ground there was probably a safe or a cache of some sort in the house with money a weapon and maybe even a few fake ids with matching credit cards ralston was going to need some extra cash and he had no problem taking it from some twobit russian hood lavrov had made some phone calls trying to quietly pin down yatskos whereabouts the former fsb man had been seen briefly at several of his businesses before disappearing for the rest of the afternoon the man probably had a bunch of loose ends to tie up before falling off the grid ralston was glad he had managed to get to the house before the russian disappeared for good now all he had to do was wait after selecting an item from yatskos impressive baseball memorabilia collection ralston found a seat and made himself comfortable less than two hours later he heard a car enter the drive and pull around to the garage at the side of the house as the garage door went up ralston made his way to the window and watched as a black bmw turned around and backed into the garage yatsko was alone that he was backing into his garage made no sense unless it was a security measure of some sort ralston stepped into the hallway off the kitchen near the door that led into the garage and made ready to welcome the russian home the bmw rolled into the garage and its ignition was turned off as the garage door descended moments later ralston heard a door slam shut followed by footfalls and then a code being punched into an alarm panel in the garage when the door into the house opened ralston waited until the russian had stepped all the way inside before swinging the bat it connected squarely with the russians knees and he screamed in agony as he collapsed to the floor ralston pulled out a pair of plastic restraints from his pocket and quickly ziptied the mans hands behind his back youre dead yatsko yelled through his clenched teeth he had a thick accent i dont know who you are but you are dead thats right ralston said you dont know who i am and youre the one whos going to be dead if you dont shut your fucking mouth wheres the safe thats what this is he groaned a robbery ralston kicked him hard in the side wheres the safe asshole bedroom despite the mans size ralston grabbed him by the collar and dragged him across the wooden floor to a hallway on the other side of the living room which one the last one said yatsko on the left ralston dragged him into the bedroom and let go of him the walls of the room were lined with fabriccovered panels an ugly overly large fourposter bed took up way too much space where demanded ralston wherever you go ill find you said the mobster i promise you the only thing i want to hear out of you said ralston as he cranked the bat back and swung it hard at the mans broken right kneecap is where the safe is and how to get into it the russian cried out once more and tears again poured out of his eyes and streamed down his face how about the other knee should i hit that one again too behind the wardrobe the man stammered whats that the wardrobe he repeated his voice quavering the safe is behind it ralston pushed the chest out of the way all that was behind it was one of the ugly fabric panels gently he pushed on it and it popped open upon a set of hidden hinges whats the combination yatsko gave it to him inside ralston found multiple stacks of currency passports a portable computer drive and some jewelry pulling a pillowcase off one of the pillows on the bed he crossed back over to the safe and took everything but the jewelry grabbing yatsko by the collar again he dragged him out of the bedroom but i dont have anything else worth stealing he implored shut up ralston dragged the russian back across the house and into the hallway near the kitchen he dropped him near the door to the garage do you want my car the mobster asked take it the keys are in it he was trying to negotiate to offer the intruder something anything he had to have sensed that the man had not come just for a robbery is there fuel in the car ralston asked yes yatsko replied hopeful good replied ralston as he pulled a roll of duct tape from his backpack tore off a piece and placed it over the russians mouth because were going to take a little ride ralston kicked open the garage door and dragged yatsko over to the rear of the bmw popping the trunk he noticed the mobsters eyes widen then he figured out why inside was something wrapped in several garbage bags and taped up in the shape of a mummy ralston looked at the russian lying on the garage floor yaroslav you piece of shit what did you do pulling a knife from his pocket ralston sliced through the tape and garbage bags what he found was what appeared to be a homeless man around yatskos height and age upon closer inspection he saw that all of the mans teeth had recently been pulled out and his fingertips had been cut off there were several gas cans in the trunk as well ralston lifted one and sloshed it around full yaroslav he said were you going to set your house or your car on fire with this poor guys body in it with no teeth and no fingertips no one could ever say it wasnt you in fact itd probably look like you got whacked by some competing faction eh you are one slippery motherfucker arent you ralston bent over and wrapped the russians ankles with duct tape pulling him to his feet he pushed the mobster backward into the trunk where yatsko whacked his head against the lid and landed atop the corpse ralston looked down at him and smiled at least youll have company for our ride out to the desert after wiping the house clean of his fingerprints ralston returned to the garage climbed into the bmw and turned the key in the ignition hed have to work fast he had only so many hours of darkness chapter the pearblossom highway was an old undivided twolane blacktop interspersed with remote homesteads and dirt roads that led out into the mojave desert toward las vegas ralston had worked on a small independent film in the mojave years ago and almost missed the turnoff the dusty road wasnt marked by anything more than a twisted joshua tree and a large rock formation that looked like the side of an indians face the heavy bmw sedan bumped and jolted as it hit numerous potholes and washouts along the way finally ralston pulled off the access road into a small clearing ringed by sagebrush and turned off the ignition stepping out of the vehicle he stretched his arms overhead and then leaned from side to side in order to stretch out his sore back when he was done he grabbed his backpack from the backseat fished out a flashlight and walked around to the trunk it was a clear night and the stars in the desert sky were fairly bright but there were several different species of things ralston didnt want to step on if he could avoid it popping the lid of the trunk he clicked on the flashlight and shined it in yatskos face he had a small laceration on his forehead probably from getting bumped around in the trunk were here said ralston as he pulled the russian out and let him drop onto the dusty ground yatsko was somewhere in his late sixties or early seventies he had a broad flat face that looked as if it had been hit with a shovel his greasy hair was dyed unnaturally black ralston used the flashlight to get his bearings once he figured out where he was going he propped the russian against the car and then flipped him over his shoulder he weighed a ton despite the pain radiating up his spine from his hip ralston kept going he didnt have far to go the wash was just through the brush beyond the clearing when he got there he set yatsko on the ground propping him up in a sitting position he could see even through his trousers that his knees had swollen up like basketballs hed thought about bringing the baseball bat along but had decided against it he wouldnt need it all he had to do was tap the guy in the knee with the toe of his shoe and the man would be sent into fits of agony the question was considering the pain he was suffering would he cooperate hed worked with russians before and had watched them take amazing amounts of punishment they could be like plow animals it was time to find out if yatsko was going to play ball reaching down ralston ripped the piece of duct tape from his mouth he expected a string of invective to start immediately it didnt the russian was trapped he knew it and was sizing up his captor you already have the money from my house he eventually said i can get you more much more this isnt about money replied ralston despite the pain the former fsb man smiled it is always about money how many people during your career in russia offered you money deep in the bowels of the lubyanka ill bet there were many who are you im nobody just someone who happened to be in the right place at the wrong time yatsko looked at him a slow trickle of blood running down the side of his face do i know you no you dont know me then i must know the man who sent you ralston shook his head slowly no one sent me then who are you damn it he spat why did you bring me here first tell me who the man is in your trunk who cares its none of your business ralston took his flashlight and swung it at the side of the russians face it connected with a sharp crack yatsko saw stars and when the pain receded and his vision returned he looked up at ralston and spat two teeth out at him fuck you ralston hit him again harder ive got all night and no place to be he waited for the mobster to recover and then repeated his question hes a vagabond the russian yelled nothing no one trash did you kill him yes i killed him why asked ralston you already know why so you could burn the body and disappear yatsko didnt answer he didnt need to tell me who hired you demanded ralston hired me for what ralston brought his foot down hard on the mans left knee hired me for what damn it the russian cried out you sent a team of men to kill a friend of mine i dont do killings bullshit i do lots of other things but never killings said yatsko what the fuck do you call the dead guy in your trunk thats different tell me who hired you the russian looked up at him and with a straight face said i cant tell you what i dont know ralston was now at the end of his rope this guy was one of the worst liars he had ever met it was going to take him all night to beat the truth out of him he decided to speed things up dont move he said knowing the man couldnt even if he had wanted to ill be right back leaving yatsko alone in the wash he trudged through the sagebrush back to the car moving the corpse out of the way he removed one of the cans of gasoline and shut the lid of the trunk walking around the edge of the clearing he played his light over the ground there were empty beer cans and wine bottles but that wasnt what ralston was hoping to find then several feet away he saw it returning to yatsko he dropped the tire on the ground next to him and opened the gas can i wish i could tell you that i was a patient guy yaroslav but im not the mobster looked at him trying to figure out what he was doing ill bet youve done a lot of bad things in your time havent you yatsko didnt reply have you ever necklaced anybody ralston waited for the man to respond but he remained quiet its a terrible way to die he said standing the tire up on its side and filling it with gasoline he then rolled it forward several feet and back again in order to evenly coat the inside yatsko looked away legend has it that it began in africa but there are some who say it started in haiti the brazilians also lay claim to itthey call it microondasa play on the word microwave apparently it gets pretty hot but not so hot that you die right away they say it can take up to twenty minutes go to hell said yatsko ill let you go first and do some reconnaissance for me replied ralston as he lifted the tire the russian squirmed and tried to avoid being ringed but sitting on his ass with two broken knees in front of him and his arms lashed behind his back there wasnt much he could do the pungent odor of the gasoline filled his nostrils as his captor forced the tire down over his shoulders you sent a team to kill my friend yaroslav now were alone in the desert no ones coming to rescue you this is going to end very badly its up to you i told you to go to hell he repeated fucking russians ralston thought to himself its certainly not the way id want to go he said producing a book of matches hed found back at yatskos house removing one from the pack he struck it and leaned forward yatsko turned to face the match and with a puff blew it out ralston grinned youre a funny guy last chance he said as he struck another match and used it to light the entire pack on fire he held the flaming pack just above the tire the russian could huff and puff all he wanted but he wouldnt be able to blow them all out whats more they were soon going to be too hot to hold on to and ralston would drop them right onto the gasolinesoaked tire the former fsb agent seemed to realize he had no choice his name is ashford he offered suddenly robert ashford hes a british intelligence officer for mi mi yes it didnt make any sense ralston figured the russian was making it up to save his own skin he wanted to make sure the man was telling the truth he dropped the flaming matchbook into the sand and crushed out the flames with his shoe who were you hired to kill yatsko looked right at him and without hesitating said larry salomon the movie producer and two other men he was working with why were you hired they dont tell me and i dont ask how many men did you send four said the russian one of my men was the driver he was supposed to wait outside three others were brought in from russia to do the job brought in by you yes brought in by me and you were hired by someone named robert ashford who works for mi said ralston thats what i told you why would mi want to kill larry salomon and a couple of documentary filmmakers i told you they dont tell me and i dont ask ralston found the man awfully flip for someone who still might very well get roasted alive you didnt think the job was a little strange you could never do what i do stated the russian ralston looked at him you ask too many questions yatsko was really pissing him off i believe that you sent that team to salomons house said ralston but i dont believe this has anything to do with mi i can prove it he was negotiating again but ralston listened anyway how the portable drive you took from my safe what about it it has copies of my communications with him said the russian really ralston said sarcastically an mi operative was that careless what do you have copies of the personal check he scribbled out for the hit everyone slips up everyone makes mistakes at some point my mistake has been listening to you i think youre full of shit yatsko shook his head when youve been at this game as long as i have you learn to protect yourself listen you dont want me im just the middleman in all of this you want ashford but to get him you need whats on that drive the file is encrypted though if you want access to it youll need a password give it to me the russian smiled once im safe and away from you ill provide you with it ralston turned and began walking back to the car where are you going asked the mobster to find some more matches cobb say that again ralston instructed as he turned and came back cobb cobb has two bs as in ty cobb without a computer ralston had no way to know if the man was telling the truth or not bending down he pried off the tire once it came free he gave it a shove and rolled it the rest of the way down into the wash so what happens now asked yatsko you take my car and make me crawl ill eventually need some of that money you took from me this guy really did have balls ralston looked at him and shook his head theres still the matter of the two filmmakers at salomons house who your spetsnaz guys whacked the russian looked at him you what about me youre the one salomon was at the restaurant with you drove him home who are you i told you replied ralston im nobody you killed them didnt you ralston didnt respond youre not going to let me walk away from here are you you couldnt walk if you wanted to you know what i mean said the russian yeah said ralston pulling out his revolver yatskos face changed there was nothing but hate in his eyes fuck you he yelled fuck you he was about to yell it again but the sound of ralstons weapon discharging drowned it out ralston pulled the trigger once for each of the murdered filmmakers chip and jeremy he then fired a third time for the homeless man in the trunk of the car and kept pulling the trigger until the weapon was empty the russian deserved much worse he deserved to have been necklaced ralston though wasnt the kind of man who could torture another man to death not even one as evil as yaroslav yatsko ralston was after all still a man of principle chapter the house nicholas had found for harvath had been foreclosed on and would be going to auction at the end of the month it should be coming up on your right he said over harvaths earbud i see it harvath replied as he rolled past the house was located in monterey park just east of downtown los angeles hows the line of sight nicholas asked from back in reston ill let you know in a minute harvath maintained his speed as he passed tariq sarhans house it was three houses up on the left harvath had seen it before arriving by using google street view it was a singlestory ranch with a high wooden privacy fence that ran the length of the front there was no light from inside its going to be tough he said to nicholas once he had driven past were not going to see anything over that fence not unless i can plant one of the remote cameras somewhere youve got two with you you could put one on the front and another on the back harvath looked at his watch it was already after am the sun would be coming up in less than three hours he didnt want to get near the target house until he had had a chance to study it better i think id better get set up at my new digs first making a right turn at the end of the street harvath drove several blocks over and then doubled back parking around the corner from the house he was going to occupy he popped his trunk and removed a heavy backpack closing the lid he locked the car and got ready for the hardest part of his entry he was going to approach the foreclosed property from behind but to do so he was going to have to cut through four backyards he prayed none of the homes had dogs slinging the pack over his shoulders he stepped onto the sidewalk and cut across the lawn of the first house there were motion lights near the garage so he chose to go around the other side at the gate to the backyard he stopped and readied his taser the last thing he wanted to do was to tase some poor dog that was just doing its job and protecting its territory but there was no other way for him to get where he needed to go undetected after looking over the fence for any telltale signs of animals he quietly rattled the gate and waited nothing happened lifting the latch he pushed the gate partway open and slipped into the yard he stayed away from the house hugging the property line and moved quickly in the far corner he crouched low scratched at the fence and waited when no dog came to investigate he boosted himself up and over he repeated the process two more times until he reached the final fence separating him from the foreclosed property fortunately he hadnt encountered any dogs leaping the final fence he landed in a backyard untended and overgrown with weeds he moved rapidly to the rear of the house and peered through a kitchen window all of the appliances were gone and there was garbage strewn across the floor at the back door he removed a lockpick gun and a thin spring steel tensioning wrench sliding the tensioning wrench into the lock he applied pressure and then inserted the pick gun as he clicked the gun the pick struck the pins inside the lock and knocked them upward with each click he applied a little more pressure to the wrench causing the plug to catch the top pins seconds later the door was unlocked and harvath slipped inside he did a quick sweep of the first floor unoccupied homes that had gone into foreclosure had become frequent targets of squatters looking around he saw that the house had been absolutely trashed there were large holes punched through the walls most of the fixtures had been stripped out and it looked as if even the copper pipes had been taken once he was confident that the first floor was clean he retraced his steps and set up a batterypowered msensor wireless perimeter security system if anyone else entered the house hed be alerted instantly moving back to the stairs he headed up to the second floor there was a small room above the garage that promised to provide the best view of sarhans the upstairs was in an even worse state of disrepair than the first floor as harvath quickly checked out each room to make sure it was unoccupied he marveled at the damage he couldnt begin to understand the mind of someone who would strip a house bare and vandalize it so totally on his way out it was just something he could never picture himself doing at the end of the hall he found the room he was looking for and stepped inside it wasnt any better than the other rooms on that floor but it wasnt any worse and compared to a lot of the hides he had holed up in around the world to do surveillance this one was pretty nice it wasnt the ritz but there were no bugs and no snakes plus he had a roof over his head all things considered he had it pretty good removing the clean cell phone he had brought with him he texted a quick message back to nicholas and the old man im in he then took a small headlamp from his pack affixed a red filter and slipped it on the lamp provided just enough light to see by but not enough to be noticed by anyone from outside unpacking his equipment he laid it all out methodically on the floor he had brought everything he thought he might need that would fit in his pack in addition to the perimeter security system and the two wireless cameras nicholas had mentioned there was an infraredcapable digital video camera infraredcapable still digital camera a laser microphone lightweight tripods a night vision monocular and several other small pieces of equipment he was also carrying a laptop with a filtered screen so it wouldnt give off too much light in the darkened house it was set up to stream the feeds back to nicholass scif via cellular network or satellite harvath powered it up and was pleased to see the signal was quite good the homes previous residents had destroyed everything except the window treatments though the ones in this room were old and soiled harvath was happy to have them after turning on his monocular he balanced it on the base of the window frame and pulled back the curtain partway he could see sarhans home but in addition to the privacy fence there was a tree which blocked a significant portion of the sight line the laser mic worked by being beamed through a window at something inside such as a picture on a wall that would vibrate as people spoke harvath could already tell they werent going to get any audio and until he figured out whether it was worth the risk to get close enough to the house to plant his two remote cameras he wasnt going to be getting any decent video either the only things he had a halfway decent view of were the street and sarhans driveway pulling back from the window he turned off his monocular and assembled the equipment after everything had been camouflaged and positioned in the window just the way he wanted it he checked the image quality on his laptop and then began streaming the feeds back to reston he had worked out a shift schedule with nicholas so that there would always be a set of eyes on the house in the morning the little man would covertly reestablish the homes power they had decided to wait until daylight in case any of the lights had been left on the last thing they wanted to do was advertise that the home was suddenly occupied sliding a cliff bar from his pack harvath leaned back against the wall and tried to make himself comfortable there was no telling how long he would be here chapter while it was nicholass shift harvath closed his eyes and allowed himself to drift off it was morning and he had been asleep for several hours when his cell phone began vibrating and woke him up he popped the earbud in and his eyes were drawn to the laptop as he activated the call do you see what i see asked nicholas from the scif back in reston i do now replied harvath as he grabbed a pair of binoculars and crawled over to the window a white passenger van had pulled up in front of sarhans house he read off the license plate number im running it now harvath readjusted the laser mic and also activated a small parabolic he had pointed toward the driveway nicholas had an update for him momentarily the van is registered to a cardboard box manufacturer in torrance california throw it into the tip program and see if it connects any dots roger that harvath had moved to the still camera and was taking pictures of the van it was hard to make out the driver from this angle he appeared to be waiting for someone two minutes later the microphones picked up the sound of sarhans door opening muted goodbyes were exchanged in arabic before two young middle eastern men appeared towing wheely bags harvath snapped several wide shots and then got closeups of their faces lets run these right away im already on it replied nicholas they were dressed in casual business attire it reminded him of the airport security footage of the attacker mohammed atta he suddenly had a very bad feeling about what he was seeing where are you two girls going the two men placed their heavy bags in the vans cargo area and climbed inside the driver then pulled away from the curb can you follow them in the traffic cam system asked harvath yes you should ping the old man and let him know whats going on already did good said harvath as he watched the van disappear at the end of the street what is going on inside that house he wondered had they just wrapped up some sort of meeting and these two guys were heading home or was something else going down ten minutes later the mystery deepened as two more men with luggage exited the house and climbed into a taxi that had just arrived once again harvath snapped pictures and everything was beamed back to nicholas in reston we need to follow that taxicab as well make sure you get all the information about the cab company and the driver and put it all into tip there was a delay in nicholass response as he clicked away at his keyboard finally he said scot i cant sweep data and follow two vehicles get the old man to help you i already am said carlton who had joined nicholas in the scif and had plugged into the call were going to have to open this up a bit no weve got to keep it contained scot im making the call nicholas will remain in charge on this end but im going to open this up to the personnel in the toc we need the manpower harvath knew better than to argue just tell them these are people of interest they dont need the big picture agreed replied the old man as he clicked off to activate the offices tactical operations center so far said nicholas the two vehicles appear to be headed in opposite directions maybe theyre going to different airports or maybe one pair is going to catch a plane and the other a train or maybe theyre doing sdrs stated harvath referring to the surveillance detection routes one used in order to ascertain whether one was being followed just stay on them they look like theyre headed out of town as soon as we know where we need to have teams waiting to put them under surveillance the old man already has teams standing by harvath was about to say something when another taxi pulled up and two more men exited the house are you getting all of this asked harvath as he took still more photographs yes replied nicholas the driver popped the trunk the men placed their wheely bags inside and after shutting the lid slid into the backseat and the vehicle pulled away that makes three twoman teams in less than half an hour said harvath adding you still have nothing back on the photographs or the vehicles all of the vehicles check out this cab too do we have any idea yet where the other two are headed no said nicholas im starting to believe you may be right about the sdrs whatever you do dont lose them replied harvath harvath glanced for the thousandth time at the dated picture of tariq sarhan he had been issued all of the men who had left the house were too young to have been him he still had to be inside and at this point there was no question that he was definitely up to something harvath decided he couldnt wait any longer to find out what he grabbed several extra mags for his compact caliber h ampk usp tactical pistol along with its suppressor he tucked the pistol into a holster at the small of his back and the rest of the gear into the pockets of his coat im going to zero comms he stated i want a closer look at the target a closer look replied nicholas or are you going over to take him if the old man asks tell him you cant raise me understood i dont think thats the right thing to do lucky for me that harvath cut himself off midsentence repeat please said nicholas hold on whats up ive now got a black lincoln town car approaching said harvath who was at the camera as two more young middle eastern men exited the house with wheely bags they were soon followed though by a third zoom in on the third man please said nicholas harvath didnt need to be told he zoomed in and began snapping pictures of tariq sarhan thats our guy he stated is he going to get in the car with them negative replied harvath as he watched sarhan kiss both of the young men on the cheeks and remain in front of the house as they walked down to the curb im running the plates on the town car now roger that said harvath as he watched sarhan through the camera i hope you saved a little cake for me tariq because you and i are going to have a little party of our own the town car looks clean its registered to a los angeles limousine company wow that makes eight guys he really did have a lot of people in there now were going to find out exactly what the hell hes up to said harvath ill call you back harvath disconnected the call and stayed at the window he watched as the town car pulled away and sarhan turned and went back into his house after grabbing a roll of duct tape and his taser harvath exited the little room and headed for the stairs he had no idea if sarhan was alone or not now but he had a pretty good feeling that he was the man had aged a lot since his photograph had been taken he was still very thin but his face was drawn his hair had gone gray and he wore glasses he looked more like a university professor than a terrorist but that didnt mean anything harvath would know soon enough what the mans game was having disabled the perimeter security system he was halfway to the back door when his cell phone vibrated unwinding the earbud and placing it in his ear he activated the call and said i told you we were going to zero comms sarhans on the move stated nicholas what replied harvath he stopped and thought about returning upstairs to see for himself he just came back out wearing a jacket and opened his garage door is he alone as far as i can tell harvath turned around and headed for the front door tell me when you can see his car hes backing out now said nicholas it looks like a blue nissan sentra he read harvath the license plate tell me which direction he goes when he pulls out of the driveway roger that seconds ticked by finally nicholas said hes coming south hes going to go right past you with the tall hedges in front of the downstairs windows harvath knew hed have a hard time seeing the street let me know when he does fifteen seconds harvath waited he should be passing you now harvath unlocked and cracked the front door sure enough he heard the sound of sarhans car as it passed he figured it would take him at least ten seconds to get to the end of the street fishing the car keys from his pocket he said to nicholas you let the toc handle the other cars i want you personally tracking sarhan for me got it i got it said the little man as he began clicking once again at his keyboard back in virginia what are you going to do there were only two things harvath could do he could break into tariq sarhans house tear it apart turn it upside down and see what he found or he could go after the man himself as far as harvath was concerned there was only one move that made any sense chapter come on nicholas harvath said over his phone that car has to be somewhere it didnt just vanish harvath had stepped out of the house and looked down the street just as tariq sarhan had applied his turn indicator and made a right turn as soon as the car had disappeared from sight harvath had taken off running he reached his rental car about a minute and a half later jumping inside he started it up and pulled out into the street at the end of the block he came to a fourway stop nicholas had yet to pick up the blue sentra on any of the traffic cams im still searching said nicholas having grown up in southern california harvath knew its freeway systems intimately right now he was inside a sort of rectangle made up of four different freewaysthe san bernardino to his north the pomona to his south the long beach freeway to his west and the san gabriel river freeway to the east sarhan could be headed toward any of them how about the other four vehicles he asked trying to figure out what was going on do we know anything yet about where theyre headed negative said nicholas the toc is tracking them but theyre all headed in different directions the longer harvath sat at the stop sign the more rapidly his heart began to beat he tightened his hands around the steering wheel come on nicholas he said again where is he there were several agonizing moments of silence before the little man responded got him he just made a left turn four blocks in front of you good job said harvath as he stepped on the gas dont lose him sarhan looped around doubled back and changed direction multiple times he even stopped twice for gas there was absolutely no question that he was trying to figure out if he was being followed this went on for more than fortyfive minutes before it appeared he had finally committed to wherever it was that he was going he followed the pomona to the santa monica freeway and continued west toward the ocean as harvath saw signs indicating the intersection for the or the san diego freeway as it was known he wondered if sarhan would alter his course or keep going toward the ocean he was staying as far behind the blue sentra as possible and was forced to endure long stretches where he couldnt even see the vehicle fortunately he hadnt exited and nicholas had been able to keep relatively good track of him the same couldnt be said for the other vehicles they had lost two out of the four and were scrambling to find them hes changing lanes nicholas said over harvaths cell phone they were coming up on a series of choices sarhan could remain on the santa monica freeway or the as it was known or he could head north or south on the the first ramp was for the south toward san diego hes in the far lefthand lane now hes not getting on the at least not southbound are you sure asked harvath so far stand by harvath watched as the exit for the interchange got closer whats he doing hes still in the far left lane no change stand by standing by it looks like we can safely say began nicholas who then stopped midsentence and shouted south he just swung across four lanes of traffic hes taking the south son of a harvath cursed beneath his breath as he tried to maneuver he was boxed in and had to slow down dramatically in order to find a gap and change lanes the traffic was so tight that he almost missed the exit once he had fully merged onto the sarhan parked himself in the far righthand lane and despite how fast the other cars were going he kept his vehicle at fifty miles an hour harvath was about to ask what the hell the guy was up to when nicholas reported that sarhan was apparently preparing to exit for the howard hughes parkway harvath continued to follow at a safe distance moments later nicholas said the toc has relocated the two missing vehicles good replied harvath where surface streets fifteen and twentytwo miles away respectively what about the other two one of them is on the century freeway headed west and the other one looks set to join it its merging onto the century from the harbor freeway harvath could picture the entire map in his minds eye and he now knew where they were headed get the old man on the line right now it was only a matter of seconds but it felt like minutes to harvath finally carlton clicked in and said what do you have i know where theyre headed where lax replied harvath the old man snapped his fingers at someone probably indicating he wanted a map of some sort and said los angeles international are you sure unless theyre all meeting up for a fishing charter out of marina del rey thats where theyre headed sarhan has already gotten off the and any moment is going to start doing his final sdrs on the surface streets that lead to the airport weve got vehicle descriptions plates even eyes on do you want to alert lapd and have them stopped before they can get too close to the airport it was a very tough call and one harvath didnt completely want the responsibility of making if lax was a target the sooner they were stopped the better but if it wasnt if these men were doing nothing more than returning to their cities of operation then pulling them over would ruin everything they would know theyd been blown and the one and only lead harvath and his team had would be lost scot the old man repeated its up to you if you want to pull the trigger on these guys ill make the call to the lapd myself harvath knew what they had to do no he replied we need to let them go and if the airport is the target then they need to be ready call dhs and tell them they need to conduct an immediate shift change the old man understood what harvath was calling for when credible threats to us airports were raised the department of homeland security swapped out regular tsa employees with specially trained former military special operations personnel they would be dressed exactly the same as the tsa agents but thats where any similarities ended realizing that air marshals should only handle planes and not airports a highly secretive and secure training facility had been established near harpers ferry west virginia there counterterrorism exercises were run against a host of realistic airport structuresterminals baggage claim areas even an airport hotel in addition to operators posing as uniformed tsa agents there was also a highly lethal plainclothes contingent dressed to look like passengers when the government wanted to be ready for a threat but not to broadcast it to the public and especially not to the bad guys this was how it was handled the only problem in this case though was the timing theres no way dhs can do a shift change in time said carlton harvath caught a glimpse of sarhans car as it turned a block ahead of him and replied tell them they dont have a choice chapter harvaths assumption that sarhan was headed for lax was confirmed when the mans circuitous route ended with his pulling into the parking structure adjacent to terminal one can you tap into any of the garage cameras asked harvath as he sped up itll take a few minutes said nicholas hurry up replied harvath as he swerved around the car in front of him and pinned the accelerator i need to know where he is and what hes doing for all we know hes going to switch vehicles im going as fast as i can instead of entering the parking structure on the upperdeck departures level like sarhan harvath chose one of the arrivallevel entrances snatching his ticket from the dispenser he pulled in and began scanning for the blue nissan where is he nicholas stand by still waiting for access to the camera system human nature being what it was most people wanted to park close to the terminal and have less distance to walk harvath easily found a parking space near the garage exit and parked there if sarhan was planning on driving out of the terminal hed have to drive right by harvaths vehicle no sooner had that thought entered harvaths mind than he realized that if sarhan did have a backup vehicle it didnt necessarily have to be in this parking structure he could easily walk out hop on the shuttle and head to the longterm lot where he could have another car waiting it seemed a bit farfetched to harvath but anything was possible weve got garage video nicholas said interrupting his thoughts do you see his car negative he may have already parked are you scanning the parked cars or just the ones that are moving asked harvath both but there are only so many cameras you cant get a perfect view of every single vehicle have dhs make sure sarhans picture gets to all of the parking lot attendants at the airport if anyone sees him make sure they call it in tell them not to do anything else but call it in got it said nicholas whose voice trailed off for a moment as something caught his eye ive also got a blue nissan sentra where second floor harvath was already out of his car and heading for the nearest stairwell as nicholas gave him the precise location of the car is the license plate a match he asked as he opened the stairwell door i cant see it i cant even get a partial is he in the car or has he already gotten out nicholas took a moment and then replied unless hes taking a nap the car appears to be empty find him check all the other cameras roll back the footage do whatever you have to do were working on accessing the recorded footage now and make sure nobody moves in on sarhan or any of his people unless i say so said harvath that may be a problem harvath was about to open the door to the second level what do you mean that may be a problem dhs told carlton that they appreciate the tip but that this is their jurisdiction and we dont have any authority damn it he replied theyre going to mess this whole thing up do they know im the person in the field no carlton didnt want to reveal that harvath didnt know that it would make any difference it had been over two years since hed worked for dhs and there was a completely new secretary in place now he wouldnt care that some former dhs employee was tracking a team of wouldbe terrorists if his people could pinch them before anything happened hed rack up truckloads of brownie points with the press the public and especially the white house harvath should have seen that coming in the wake of so many successful attacks on us soil dhs needed a win though he wanted to believe theyd do the right thing too often it was the political thing the thing that would play well for public relations that was chosen did they tell you where they were on the shift change negative said nicholas damn it harvath repeated as he got ready to open the door tell the old man that he needs to find a way to work this out somebody somewhere owes him a favor if dhs jumps the gun they could blow this entire operation im sure hes doing everything he can harvath opened the door and stepped onto the second level where are the other vehicles he said quietly the first one is about two blocks away okay lets keep chatter to a minimum until got him interrupted nicholas sarhan where he got out of his vehicle all right but he didnt walk toward any of the exits he walked to the northeast corner of the structure did he get in another car asked harvath negative do you have him on any of the cameras negative replied nicholas not at present roger that said harvath as he approached the parking stall with the blue nissan checking the plate he relayed the numbers back to nicholas thats it harvath slipped his hand into his pocket and withdrew what looked like a threaded screw it was a tool a spook buddy of his had designed and had given away to his friends in the community as a christmas present foreign intelligence agents overseas had long been known to drive nails or screws into the tires of americans they suspected of conducting espionage harvaths buddy had seen it happen on more than one occasion and had decided to take the tactic to the next level employing a pal who was a machinist he had him fabricate a screw with a hollow shaft and a small opening at the top and the bottom in essence it was an inchlong spike that relieved a tire of its air very quickly he eyeballed the interior of the vehicle scanning for any sign of what sarhan might be up to did he have any bags with him he asked negative nicholas replied just what looked like a zippered case for a small laptop or an ipad maybe keep looking for him choosing the tire he wanted harvath leaned over jabbed in the screw and kept walking if sarhan hadnt come to catch a flight or to switch vehicles there was only one other reason based on what harvath had seen for the man to be here lax had to be the target four twoman teams had left sarhans house and via intricate sdrs had taken great pains to make sure they werent being followed despite leaving before sarhan he had beaten them to the airport any doubt about what was about to happen was fading from harvaths mind sarhan was the cell controller he had picked the parking garage at terminal one as an overwatch position from the northeast corner of the garage he could watch as all four teams drove past the fact that the men were traveling in pairs also made sense now it was an insurance policy each was there to keep the other committed to the operation with a twoman team cowardice could be minimized if not completely eradicated if one of the men chickened out the other would take care of the situation it was a growing trend in terrorist operations sarhan was there to make sure everything went off as planned very likely he had been instructed to film as much of the carnage as possible so that it could be fed to al jazeera which in turn would joyfully broadcast it to the muslim world harvath though was determined that none of that was going to happen holding his keys in his hand he moved past the rows of cars pretending he was looking for his the first of the vehicles just entered the airport said nicholas understood harvath replied as he kept walking did you notice anything off about any of the vehicles negative why one of the guys in the toc thinks that the cab that just pulled in is riding too low harvath had been so preoccupied with sarhan and the men coming out of his house that he hadnt paid nearly enough attention to the vehicles nobody got out he said into his earbuds microphone excuse me replied nicholas the van driver the taxicab drivers even the driver of the town car none of them got out when they picked the men up at sarhans so so it doesnt make sense said harvath why didnt they get out and help with the bags maybe they were told not to why nicholas thought a moment because they dont want anyone else handling the bags bingo i just got another im from the guy in toc he really doesnt like that first vehicle he says it reminds him of vbieds he saw in iraq harvath had seen his share of vehicleborne improvised explosive devices as well watch where it goes and tell him to look at the other vehicles i want to know if he thinks the same thing what are you thinking nicholas asked im thinking those guys with the bags go in explosions happen and when survivors rush out of the terminals if those four vehicles are vbieds the survivors get taken out in a secondary attack thats even worse than the first what should we tell dhs it was the right question but not the one harvath wanted to have to answer if they told dhs that they now believed they had four teams of suicide bombers being dropped off by vehicles loaded with explosives it was game over they wouldnt wait to see what happened theyd shut the entire airport down if harvath was right dhs would succeed in saving countless lives if he was wrong sarhan and his men who could very well be controllers of other cells scattered across the country would know they had been blown and all those potential leads would evaporate the fbi would get involved but even if they used cia interrogators theyd never be able to lean on sarhan and his men hard enough to get any actionable intelligence out of them and once the fbi was involved theyd see to it that the men were afforded every single protection under the law nobody would be putting bags over their heads and transporting them to iceland or one of the other black sites caught on american soil theyd be handled under criminal court rules and proceedingsthat is if the fbi could come up with enough to even hold them it wasnt that harvath didnt respect the bureau he did it was just better that they didnt get mixed up in this it was also better at least at this moment that dhs not be given any encouragement to pull the trigger prematurely dont tell them anything he said and if those are vbieds asked nicholas harvath could now make out the silhouette of someone standing in the northeast corner ducking into a row of parked cars he crouched and adjusted the side mirror of the vehicle he was leaning against contact he said quietly into his microphone chapter whats he doing asked nicholas watching in a sideview mirror through multiple layers of autoglass harvath had a pretty lousy view hes leaning against the concrete halfwall with a laptop open whats he doing on the laptop i think its a ruse hes trying to look busy while he watches his teams arrive at the airport now what asked nicholas harvath knew that the only way anyone was going to get any answers out of tariq sarhan especially quick ones was if he was asking the questions the problem was how the hell would he interrogate him in the middle of a parking garage two vehicles away from sarhan was a brandnew white cadillac escalade harvath described it gave nicholas the license number and said how long give me three minutes he replied harvath looked at his watch youve got two make it happen ninety seconds later nicholas said the onstar folks are very sorry to hear youve lost your keys mr chaffee let me know when you want it opened stand by said harvath as he stepped out from the row of parked cars holding the key fob for the vehicle hed parked downstairs he proceeded forward sarhan had a pad pen and a few papers set up next to his laptop if anyone had wondered what he was up to he could have argued that he had just dropped someone off and was filing a quick sales report or was trying to be productive while waiting to pick someone up what none of them would suspect was that from this vantage point he was taking advantage of a perfect view of all the traffic coming into the airport unlock it now said harvath as he closed within fifteen feet of sarhan the lights on the escalade flashed and the locks thumped as they popped up the egyptian turned looked at harvath briefly and went back to what he was doing harvath ignored him walking around to the drivers side he opened the door and climbed in had there been space enough to maneuver there was nothing he would have rather done than to drive the escalade right into sarhan and pin him against the concrete wall it would have saved him a lot of time he listened as nicholas updated him that the first vehicle had dropped its passengers at the tom bradley international terminal and that two more were also just pulling in it was time to crash sarhans party grabbing the latch harvath popped the escalades hood and stepped out of the car as he raised the hood he looked around to see if anyone other than sarhan was in the immediate area satisfied the coast was momentarily clear he fiddled with the vehicles engine and cursed the egyptian glanced at him again and then went back to what he was doing the fact that the escalade had likely been there before sarhan arrived ruled harvath out as a threat to him there was no way anyone could have known he would set up there harvath stepped away from the truck and closed the distance with the egyptian so rapidly that he didnt realize what was happening until harvath was almost on top of him pulling his taser out of his pocket harvath hit the trigger and watched as the expression on sarhans face went from surprise to shock to agonyall in a matter of a few seconds the mans muscles seized and he fell forward harvath worked quickly after ziptying sarhans hands behind his back he gathered up his belongings and dragged him back to the escalade the rear windows were tinted and thats where harvath had decided to conduct his interrogation shoving the egyptian inside harvath climbed in behind and told nicholas to remotestart the vehicle he buckled sarhan into his seat belt ziptied his ankles and then took the seat next to him when the vehicle started harvath reached for the rear seat audio controls and dialed in a local funk radio station the escalade was well insulated in fact it was built like a bank vault but harvath turned up the volume of too hot to stop by the barkays just in case the egyptian began to scream sarhan didnt not at first he also didnt demand to know who harvath was and what he was doing to him the first thing he did was spit in harvaths face that was all harvath needed sarhan was guilty harvath brought his elbow around and smashed the egyptians nose a gush of blood sprayed and sarhan cried out harvath turned up the volume on the radio we know everything tariq all of it im only going to give you one chance how do we recall your men you cant the man said with a smile harvath gave him another burst from the taser the egyptian howled this time as the electricity coursed through his body tell me tariq the pain only gets worse from here fuck you he hissed harvath raised the taser to give him another jolt the mans body stiffened in anticipation harvath though had a better idea reaching back down he depressed the rear cigarette lighter he saw a flash of fear cut across sarhans face but as quickly as it had appeared it was gone the fourth vehicle has entered the airport nicholas said vehicles two and three have dropped off their passengers at terminals two and four roger that replied harvath im not afraid to die said sarhan harvath smiled i wish i was allowed to kill you unfortunately i cant you cant do anything i wouldnt go that far he said as the cigarette lighter popped i have rights the egyptian stated arrogantly and if i was a policeman i might care but today isnt your lucky day you see im not a policeman technically i dont even exist i promise though youre never going to forget who i am snatching out the glowing cigarette lighter harvath brought it close enough to sarhans face to feel the heat radiating off it how do we recall your men the egyptian tried to spit at him again but harvath moved out of the way the projectile of blood and saliva hit the window behind him and rolled down harvath was done playing games grabbing the mans face in a vise grip he drove the lighter right into the mans upper lip sarhan screamed bloody murder but harvath didnt let go until the smoke stopped rising from the mans seared lip the smell of burnt flesh filled the suv dropping the lighter to the floor he reached under his coat and drew his pistol he then pulled the suppressor from his coat pocket and began spinning it onto the threaded barrel he didnt even give sarhan a moment to think placing the weapon against his knee he pulled the trigger there was a crack as the weapon discharged and sarhan set off into a fresh chorus of screams and curses harvath brought his elbow up again and slammed it into the mans jaw causing the egyptian to bite down on his own tongue reed carltons voice suddenly came over harvaths earbud all of the teams are now inside the terminals whats our play harvath snatched up sarhans cell phone it had been set to silent and he had received four text messages each one saying the same thing we are in line shit he said aloud as he raised his pistol and placed it right against sarhans temple ive changed my mind tell me how to recall your men or i am going to kill you the egyptian looked at him and smiled before muttering a final defiant fuck you harvath pulled the weapon back and then brought it crashing down into the side of his head fuck you too what do we tell dhs harvath was out of time they couldnt risk it any further tell them to take them all down roger that replied carlton the old mans voice was then replaced by nicholass the lincoln town car just pulled in one floor below you our man in the toc says all of the vehicles are overloaded hes positive now that theyre vbieds chapter christie jacobson wasnt a big fan of flying it wasnt that she was afraid to fly she just hated all of the hassles her mother had worked as a twa stewardess back in the glamour days of airline travel in the s she could still remember how elegant it was you always got dressed up to fly you even got dressed up just to go out to the airport to pick people up when she was a little girl all of the stewardesses had looked to her like princesses or fashion models they wore tiny hats white gloves and perfectly tailored uniforms they even took your picture with a polaroid camera and gave it to you as a souvenir thats how special airline travel was things certainly had changed now airline travel was like bus travel no one dressed up the service was lousy and the entire air of elegance was gone before christie had changed positions within her company the experience used to be a bit better up until last year shed been a very frequent flyer which meant she was normally upgraded to first class and could check in at the premier counter she didnt have to stand in an insufferably long line like the one she was in now glancing at her watch she wondered if she was going to make her flight there had to be at least sixty people in line in front of her and only a handful of agents despite the automated checkin kiosks everyone seemed to be having problems and needing help christie looked behind her and saw that the line stretched past the retractabelts and stanchions and into the terminal there had to be several hundred travelers she didnt even want to think about what the security line was going to be like that was the one thing she hated the most about flying as a breast cancer survivor shed had more than enough radiation to last for two lifetimes she despised the fullbody scanners the tsa had introduced and how when she politely opted out of a scan she had to be subjected to a fullbody patdown if the scanners wouldnt have stopped either the shoe bomber or the underwear bomber she didnt really see the point she liked to joke that the friendly skies would be a lot more friendly if everyone was required to fly naked it was a cute joke at least she thought so during patdowns though shed been warned that joking wasnt such a good idea she didnt blame the tsa agents for the security measures they didnt make policy they were there to carry it out and christie made it a point to thank them every time for working so hard to keep all travelers safe like it or not life had changed because of considering what had just happened in all those movie theaters across the country she figured life was about to change again would there be patdowns and screenings at the local multiplex now probably something would have to be done to demonstrate that america was serious about never letting such an attack happen again christie had stayed up most of the night watching the news coverage in her hotel room it was incredibly tragic but she couldnt turn it off the entire nation was grieving shed felt very alone in her hotel as she watched and had called her husband theyd turned to the same cable channel and had watched the coverage together though they were thousands of miles apart she was glad to be going home the next day she wanted to hug her husband and her children she wanted to hold on to them for a long long time they were big moviegoers they loved seeing films the weekend they came out and as far as they were concerned there was nothing like the experience of the big screen their theater could have easily been targeted by the terrorists that seemed to be the message of the attacks no one was safe theaters in big towns and small towns alike had been struck and before the news had even confirmed it she knew who had been behind the attacks she knew it was al qaeda they had promised to return and they had first it was the train stations in chicago and now movie theaters what was next she wondered was she even safe in the airport shed noticed the two middle eastern businessmen standing several people in front of her could they be terrorists she supposed they could but it just seemed so farfetched what were the odds shed get into a line with two terrorists christie chastised herself for having those thoughts she refused to allow herself to look at every muslim person as a potential terrorist they were regular people until shown to be otherwise she wondered how many others were having the same thoughts she was having muslims of good conscience were going to have to stand and denounce the violence if they did that christie jacobson would be proud to stand with them she tried not to look at the two businessmen plenty of other people were probably staring at them and she didnt want to add to their number in fact if she were going to look at them at all it would be with a smile no matter how many accusatory looks they received today theyd remember the kind one the line shuffled forward and christie found herself in a position to deliver her encouraging smile catching the eyes of one of the men she smiled and nodded immediately the mans face darkened and he turned his head away his friend though saw christies gesture and nodded curtly he then turned to the other man and began speaking to him quietly the man didnt seem to care he was concentrating on thumbing out a text or an email on his blackberry christie felt foolish she tried to console herself with the notion that maybe it was a cultural difference maybe where these men came from women didnt directly engage them and smile at them she decided to leave them alone they didnt have to acknowledge her kindness to take her mind off the interminably long and slowmoving line she scanned the other faces in the crowd she enjoyed people watching it was fun imagining peoples backgrounds and what their professions might be there were plenty who might have been incredibly interesting but most just kind of looked blah and unkempt the game was more fun to play with unusuallooking people though shed never confess it to her husband christie found the game the most fun with unusually goodlooking people like the man who was standing several steps back from her because of the way the line wrapped around they were now facing each other she tried not to stare but it was hard he was really goodlooking the man was over six feet with bright blue eyes and one of those taut jawlines that screamed physically fit studying the man she tried to imagine what his profession might be he was big enough to have been a professional athlete of some sort he was probably in his early to mid forties bush pilot had a nice ring to it and seemed a good fit not wanting to stare she had averted her gaze but as she now risked a glance back at him she noticed his expression had changed there was suddenly an intensity to his face that was very unsettling he was moving away from her thats when she saw him draw the gun show me your hands he yelled open palms away from your body do it now it took christie a moment to realize that he wasnt talking to her but rather the two middle eastern men half the people standing in line had dropped to the floor while the other half were quickly backing away knocking over the retractabelts and stanchions intuitively sensing she was in the way christie dropped to the floor no sooner had she hit than she heard the earsplitting thunder of the mans weapon going off she looked up to see the head of the man she had smiled at snap backward as a pink mist materialized in the air all around people were screaming she looked at the other middle eastern man his hand looked to be wrapped in a death grip around the handle of his rolling bag as the man plunged the handle down she was reminded of an oldfashioned dynamite detonator box if there was any consolation it was that the explosion was so intense that christie jacobson and the others in the terminal never felt any pain chapter harvath had hopped into the escalades drivers seat and was halfway down to the ground floor when he heard the explosion what the hell just happened he demanded one of the bombers detonated replied nicholas terminal two damn it he shouted the lincoln town car is on the move harvath accelerated stop stop stop nicholas ordered hes going up up why the hell would he be going up i dont know harvath threw the big suv into reverse and stepped on the accelerator he only made it thirty feet before a car suddenly appeared in his rearview mirror slamming on his brakes he threw the escalade into drive and raced down the ramp i cant get back up this way he said as sarhan bounced around in back i have to use the up ramp watch that town car and tell me what he does will do racing onto the up ramp harvath backed off the gas just a bit if the town car was a vbied as they believed rolling up on him way too quickly was only going to spook the driver into detonating in the garage surely he had heard the explosion as well and knew that the attack was on that meant harvath needed to be doubly careful one wrong move and it was all over hes just exited the ramp on the third floor said nicholas why the third floor harvath wondered nicholas had the answer seconds later hes going to try to exit onto the upperdeck roadway through the entrance doesnt it have spikes if it does he doesnt seem to care harvath pushed the escalade faster he pulled the wheel hard to the side popped up onto the third floor and raced for the upperdeck roadway nicholass voice came over his earbud he jumped the curb and took out the ticket machine the far left lane which way did he turn to the right hes headed toward terminal two harvath pinned the gas pedal to the floor have all the other bombers in the other terminals been interdicted affirmative what about the other vbieds lapd is trying to move in on them now the entire upper deck was going to be crowded with people especially outside terminal two where the explosion had happened tell lapd that they cant ram the vehicles harvath insisted they have to shoot the drivers tell tsa to try to get everyone off the sidewalks now harvath had no idea if the other three vehicles had started their run or not all he knew was that his best option was to get the town car the lapd would have to get the others he just hoped theyd all be able to do their jobs on time racing toward the entrance harvath could see where the town car had made its exit hitting the curb at over sixty miles an hour he applied his brakes and pulled the wheel hard to the right as he shot out of the parking structure he came barreling out in the wrong direction and sideswiped two oncoming vehicles it was a lucky break if they hadnt been there he might very well have flipped the escalade as he spun out of the garage and pulled hard to his right punching the accelerator again he raced ahead there was no need to ask nicholas where the town car was headed it had to be terminal two that was where it was going to do the most damage seconds later he veered onto the main upperdeck roadway that circled the airport he could see terminal two dead ahead he could also see the town car there was no way he was going to catch it in time he heard the rapid crack of weapons fire as law enforcement officers engaged the town car and harvath watched in horror as the vehicle headed right for them terrified civilians ran in multiple directions some even right out into the street all trying to get away from the danger harvath had to swerve to avoid hitting a large group no sooner had he regained control of his vehicle than he saw the town car plow into two patrol cars and the team of lapd officers who had bravely stood their ground firing harvath brought his escalade to a screeching halt and leaped out holding his wallet in the air halfopened so as not to be mistaken as a threat and shot harvath blatantly misrepresented himself fbi he yelled and advanced on the twisted mass of vehicles they had all been pushed up onto the sidewalk harvath couldnt see any of the officers he was less than ten feet away when the door of the town car was thrown open dropping his wallet harvath raised his pistol in both hands the driver swung out one leg and then the other harvath shot him in each knee and raced forward the driver raised a pistol and began firing wildly harvath dropped to the ground and returned fire he put round after round on target ripping through the open driversside door in one fluid motion he depressed his pistols magazine release and flicked the empty magazine out of the butt of the weapon before it had even clattered onto the pavement several yards away he had inserted a fresh mag snapped the slide back to chamber his first round and was firing yet again as he did he came up on his feet and rushed the town car the driver didnt return fire coming up on the open door harvath saw the mans legs first then he saw the rest of him slumped over the armrest half onto the passenger side hands harvath yelled let me see your hands moving more to his left harvath got a better view into the car the drivers empty pistol with its slide locked back lay on the floor but there was something else in the drivers hand and seeing it harvaths blood turned to ice harvaths first shot blew the mans thumb completely off he put the next four into the drivers head even then he still wasnt sure and shot the man five more times tentatively harvath crawled into the town car and retrieved the cell phone the driver had been fumbling with there was a number on the screen that harvath was certain corresponded to a cell phone detonator somewhere inside the town car had the man been able to hit send the car would have exploded harvath carefully removed the battery from the phone set both pieces on the dash and crawled back out of the car popping the trunk of one of the patrol cars he extracted a medical kit and rushed to the fallen law enforcement officers two of them were already dead and several more were badly injured gunfire continued to rage across the airport it was like being in a war zone you you and you shouted harvath to a group of onlookers who had taken cover nearby these men need your help the civilians came over as he ripped open multiple vacuumsealed packets he rapidly applied pressure dressings and israeli bandages as well as two tourniquets and sent an additional onlooker to the other patrol car for more medical supplies explaining how to keep the officers stable he left the onlookers in charge and called in officers down over one of the police radios giving the location and range of injuries that was all he could do for them he needed to get back in the fight running back to the escalade he picked up his wallet got inside and quickly drove away chapter as harvath raced toward the tom bradley terminal nicholas informed him that the fight was over the lapd and dhs operators had been able to neutralize the other vbieds all of the terrorists were dead all that is except for tariq sarhan who was still unconscious in the escalades backseat the word had also already gone out to airports across the country to expect similar attacks two had already been uncovered and prevented nicholas had been right when he had stated that the attacks they had stopped only months before were just the precursor to a tidal wave set to crash down on the united states every time they faced down an attack more popped up where would it end harvath returned to the parking structure and located his rental car after wrapping sarhans knee in a hillbilly bandage he dumped him in the trunk as he got into his car he told nicholas to make sure to erase any of the airports cctv footage of him as he drove out of the airport a tidal wave of emergency vehicles rushed past him going in the opposite direction they served as a reminder of the need to arrange for transport for himself and sarhan he asked nicholas to get carlton on the line when he came on harvath said how soon until we can get a sentinel jet out here to pick us up ill look into it now replied the old man how bad is his condition he tried to suck on a cigarette lighter and also managed to tase himself before shooting himself in the knee but hell live understood well figure out how close the nearest aircraft is and then well decide on an airport lax has been shut down and probably wont reopen for a few days were also going to need someone to sanitize the house i was using said harvath i left all the surveillance gear in there well have someone handle it you should have a team go through sarhans house as well well get on that too replied carlton who then shifted gears in the meantime im assuming you took an unattributable phone with you of course i did why youve had two urgent calls from a man named hank mcbride harvath recognized the name immediately hank had been one of his fathers seal team buddies who used to come by the house and check on things when harvath was a kid and his father was deployed he was still very close with harvaths mom and his call could only mean one thing did he say what it was about negative he just left a number and asked you to call him as soon as possible harvath took the number told carlton he would call him back and made for the entrance to the freeway headed south his mother still lived on coronado island across the bay from san diego speeding through an intersection and a light that had already turned red harvath narrowly missed being hit by two cars as he dialed hank mcbrides number this is hank the old seal said as he answered the call hank its scot harvath replied whats going on with my mom your moms fine relax what happened nothing i didnt call about your mom i need a favor harvath backed off his speed moms okay shes fine insisted mcbride i saw her a couple of days ago when i was down her way actually she looks great thank god he thought as his heart rate began to lower hank im in the middle of an assignment right now im going to have to call you back when i dont know said harvath ill get back to you the old seal wasnt going to take no for an answer scot i wouldnt have tracked you down and left two messages at your office if it wasnt important already navigating the freeway on ramp harvath decided to give him until the next exit to explain what he wanted what do you need hank its not for me its for a friend of mine having worked for a prior president harvath was used to people reaching out to him for help with things in dc i can save you some time ive got no pull with the current administration thats not what this is about i dont want to be rude hank but you need to get to the point im really busy right now hank didnt waste any more time do you know who larry salomon is the movie producer of course i do someone sent a spetsnaz team to whack him when replied harvath the night before last said hank it was all over the news at least it was until those fuckers blew up all of those theaters my god what are they going to do next turn on your tv they just hit lax they what thats part of why im so busy right now hank so is salomon dead the old seal who hesitated as he tried to flip his tv on in the background finally said the technical adviser on all his films is a former unit guy named luke ralston hes a pal of mine and he was with salomon when he came home and found those guys the two of them killed the entire spetsnaz team salomon and the guy from the unit yeah its a long story which they probably ought to be telling the police thats just it said hank they cant at least not yet but heres the good part ralston knows who helped coordinate the hit and hes not talking to the police replied harvath hank let me give you a piece of advice steer clear of this entire thing if they cant take this to the cops theres something very wrong thats why im trying to help them junior harvath hadnt had mcbride call him junior since he was a kid and had gotten in trouble for fighting back when he was in school the tone no longer intimidated him but it did catch his attention so what is it you want from me asked harvath all my contacts and all lukes for that matter are pretty much in the special operations community we dont know many secret squirrel types at least none that we trust you on the other hand are very well plugged in i know some people in russian intelligence if that would help but its going to have to wait until no interrupted mcbride we already crossed that bridge the man who brought the talent into la for the hit was a former fsb operative based here the man who ordered the hit though was british intelligence british intelligence mi to be exact hank had to have gotten his facts wrong why would somebody from britains domestic intelligence service want to splash a hollywood movie producer thats what we need to figure out do you have any contacts you could reach out to harvath did in fact hed just helped mi and scotland yard take down a large terror cell in london and prevent a massive attack ive got a guy i can ask whats the name of this mi operative you think was behind the attack when mcbride said the name harvath couldnt believe his ears there was such a long pause the old seal thought they might have gotten cut off are you still there im still here replied harvath can you help with this robert ashford character or what this is a very serious accusation youre going to need proof lots of it weve got proof said hank you sound different all of a sudden why harvath ignored the question i want to see the proof you have youre welcome to it but its not something i can just put in the mail you dont need to ill come to you youre here said mcbride california im on the right now i dont have my regular cell with me so give me your address again hank did and after harvath told him to sit tight not to move and not to talk to anyone else he ended the call and picked up his speed once more he thought about calling the old man carlton after all was the one who had introduced him to ashford but as quickly as the idea had materialized in harvaths mind he dismissed it robert ashford had been read into their operational plans in yemen the old man had done it as a courtesy aazim aleem was a british citizen and ashford had been especially helpful to the carlton group in london harvath was beginning to wonder though if ashford could have been the reason the yemen op had gone sideways and until he had a firm handle on what the hell was going on he wasnt going to be making any phone calls chapter harvath backed into hank mcbrides driveway and parked underneath the carport near the kitchen door thanks for coming said the old seal giving him a hug no problem replied harvath you look good must be all my healthy habits harvath knew what a hard drinker and terrible eater hank was known to be and he smiled cmon inside said mcbride luke and salomon are looking forward to meeting you i need your help getting something out of the trunk first hank looked at him something or someone harvath directed him to the rear of the car and popped the lid who the hell is he the old seal asked he was never here you never saw him did he have something to do with what just happened at lax i dont want to get into it said harvath son of a said mcbride he pulled back his fist and punched tariq sarhan in the head before harvath could stop him for fucks sake hank knock it off so what tell them he slipped getting out of the car are you going to help me or not asked harvath just leave him in there said the old seal what do you need to bring him into the house for ever heard of sudden incustody death syndrome as in youve got some wiseass and you decide to throw him off a bridge if you leave a suspect ducttaped in a confined space for too long he can die said harvath the whole countrys going soft replied mcbride we used to leave shitbags like this in trunks for days at a time i always found it made them a lot more cooperative harvath ignored him i need a pole something thatll support a lot of weight and wont break a sheet too mcbride shook his head walked into the house and reappeared a couple of minutes later after making sure there was nobody who could see them from the street they pulled sarhan from the trunk and laid him down on the concrete apron on his stomach they slid the pole under his ducttaped ankles and then beneath his flexcuffd wrists which harvath had reinforced with more tape throwing the sheet over the pole they lifted him like a couple of bushmen returning to their village with a fresh hog and moved him inside once safely into the kitchen hank let go of his side of the pole woops he said harvath lowered his end withdrew the pole and pulled off the sheet where do you want to put him asked mcbride we can leave him right there you dont care who he sees or what he hears normally harvath wouldnt have cared but he had no idea where sarhan was going to end up the less he knew about everything the better do you have someplace we can put him asked harvath hank shook his head i should start charging rent he said as he motioned for harvath to follow him harvath grabbed sarhan by the back of his shirt and dragged him across the linoleum floor and down a short hallway to mcbrides laundry cum hobby room he knocked and the door was opened by another man who harvath assumed was ralston sitting next to the old seals workbench was larry salomon harvath had seen his picture many times before on the floor and also restrained with duct tape was a man about hanks age with greasy black hair and a pug face sorry were late said harvath as he let go of sarhan another pinata replied ralston now things are getting interesting if you gentlemen want to use the kitchen to talk said hank ill keep an eye on these two harvath thanked him and followed ralston and salomon out as he was leaving he reminded the old seal not to abuse his prisoner hank picked up a ballpeen hammer from the workbench and told him he wouldnt dream of it shaking his head harvath joined the other men in the kitchen ralston introduced himself and then salomon im a big fan harvath said to the producer thank you we appreciate your coming why dont you tell me whats going on said harvath as he motioned at the kitchen table for the men to sit he saw that hank had a pot of coffee made and helped himself he offered to pour for the other two men but they politely refused sitting down at the table he listened as luke laid out what had happened and salomon filled in some of the details twenty minutes and an additional cup of coffee later ralston finished by saying thats when hank called you and here we are it was an amazing story harvath leaned back in his chair processing what he had heard for what its worth you were smart not to kill yatsko i gave my word replied ralston that said i probably ruptured his eardrum discharging the weapon so close to his head he deserves to pay said salomon harvath nodded in agreement you both did the right thing though changing gears he asked what happened to the homeless guy in his trunk after i dumped yatsko here i drove the car back up to la wiped all of my prints off it and left it in his garage wheres the hard drive ralston reached under the table where it had been taped removed it and handed it across to harvath he then gave him the code the russian had revealed out in the desert you havent tried to open it have you ralston shook his head he was bargaining for his life so i think he was being straight with me but ive dealt with this stuff enough to know that he could have given me a kill code i didnt want to type in that password only to have it fry the entire drive smart replied harvath weve got somebody back east that should be able to get into it and see whats there what about project green ramp you said it was a plan to weaken the united states and then collapse it via a black swan event do you have any idea what kind of black swan could that be whats behind all of these terrorist attacks you probably shouldnt rule anything out ralston replied with a shrug but i dont see standing as the terrorism type hes a financial guy who buys influence and messes with currencies and economies who may have used an active mi operative as a cutout to hire a russian wet work team to kill mr salomon i guess when you put it that way anything is possible it was definitely possible in fact having the unrestricted warfare piece of the puzzle harvath now saw standing as highly likely to be behind the entire thing he had the financial means he also from what harvath knew had the ideology and hadnt been shy in his public calls for the american system to be replaced with something else if ashford is dirty asked salomon will you be able to link him to standing well definitely try but it would be helpful to have copies of the material you were working on did you back it up offsite or does the lapd have all of it now as part of their investigation everything was in my home office at the time of the attack so no backup then no said salomon theres a backup i just dont know how you can get to it let me worry about that replied harvath figuring the old man could put together a team to take care of the job where is it back at the house i have a stack of highcapacity portable drives in a locked cage hidden in the basement my entire life is backed up on those things including the rough cut or at least as far as we had gotten on it of the well endowed documentary if you can get someone past the police and into the house i can tell them how to find the cage and access the drives as ralston and salomon began to sketch out a map of the house and the surrounding property in coldwater canyon harvath stepped outside to make a phone call he needed to bring the old man up to speed on what he had learned but more important he needed to lay the groundwork for what they had to do next reed wasnt going to like it but they were going to have to go after robert ashford chapter a civilian lockheed l hercules was waiting for harvath at the los alamitos joint forces training center fortyfive minutes south of hank mcbrides home in hermosa beach also waiting was a seal team contingent who had been choppered up from naval amphibious base coronado as harvath was transferring both sarhan and yatsko back to the east coast the old man wanted to make sure he had all the additional manpower he might need the guards at the base gate were expecting harvath and waved him through the l was parked on the tarmac outside hangar three with its rear cargo ramp down upon seeing harvath one of the young seals at the base of the ramp shouted into the plane moments later harvath and his vehicle were guided right up into the belly of the enormous aircraft as this was a black flight with no records the seals were dressed in civilian clothes only first names were used harvath introduced himself as bob it wasnt that he didnt trust them on the contrary these were his brothers he knew that it was better for them if they knew zero about him once his vehicle was secured the cargo ramp was closed and the crew instructed everyone to prepare for takeoff the men took their seats as the four massive turboprop engines were started slowly the enormous bird began to roll forward and taxi out to the runway harvath was exhausted and allowed himself a few minutes to lean back and close his eyes this was not going to be a relaxing flight there were still dots all over nicholass map in reston representing further terrorist attacks back at lax he had wanted sarhan to tell him what he knew about that immediate attack now he wanted to know about everything else he figured the man wasnt going to be any more cooperative than he had been at lax when the plane leveled out harvath opened his eyes and nodded to the seal in charge he in turn signaled his men who all produced black balaclavas and rolled them down over their faces harvath opened the trunk and three of the seals shined bright flashlights into the faces of the two captives two other seals reached down and yanked out tariq sarhan after which harvath slammed the lid back down yatsko would get his turn but for the time being harvath wanted him as disoriented and as frightened as possible a heavy steel cable complete with a metal hook had been thrown over one of the cargo areas upper supports it ran to a winch covered with chipped yellow paint the two seals held sarhan upright under his arms as harvath removed his knife and cut through the tape and flexcuffs binding his wrists the sense of relief the terrorist felt at having his hands cut free was shortlived as one of the other seals forced his wrists together in front of his body and resecured them again with tape the hook was then slipped beneath the tape and the seal manning the winch was instructed to take up the slack the cable grew taut and sarhans arms were lifted above his head the winch kept cranking until the terrorist was forced to stand on tiptoe and harvath signaled for it to stop reaching up for the piece of duct tape he had placed across sarhans mouth harvath ripped it away along with the crust of dried blood that had formed around his badly burned and blistered upper lip his scream was so loud it could be heard well above the roar of the aircraft noise the man was cursing in arabic and harvath gave him an openhanded slap to the side of the face to get him to shut up tariq youre in a lot of trouble my friend said harvath do you know where were going sarhan didnt answer and harvath hadnt expected him to were on our way to visit some friends of mine in cairo he told his prisoner the mukhabarat are very interested in your visit the terrorist looked at him with contempt you lie he hissed there is no more mukhabarat the egyptian secret police were thrown out after the revolution unfortunately for you that isnt the case you see the new government needs the mukhabarat even more than the old government and lets face it what would egypt be without its secret police maybe the name will change but their methods will still be the same by the way they wanted me to ask you if you had any family members youd like them to contact for you actually dont bother answering that im sure theyre already busy tracking them down if sarhan was troubled by the threat he didnt show it heres the thing though tariq i dont want to go to cairo thats too long for me to wait to get the answers i need too many americans have died for me to risk a single life more so you and i are going to have a very intimate conversation right here and youre going to tell me every single thing no matter how small or unimportant you think it may be and youre going to tell me right now tariq sarhan had his answer ready once again he attempted to spit at harvath and missed bad choice said harvath as he nodded to the seal operating the winch to tighten the cable up even further for the next three hours harvath worked on sarhan after the third time the terrorist passed out harvath had him taken down sarhan knew very little beyond his own operation there were bits and pieces that harvath would include with his debrief but he doubted theyd be of much help this network had been very careful to keep things as compartmentalized as possible sarhan had no idea how many other attacks were planned who was involved when they would happen or how to stop them harvath was beginning to believe that it would take a major mistake by the terrorists before they could be completely taken down he hoped that mistake though had already been made and that it was robert ashford no sooner had harvath gotten yaroslav yatsko out of the trunk and prepped for his interrogation than one of the marines informed him that the crew who per orders had remained in the cockpit for the duration of the flight was ready to make their approach into dulles harvath and the seals quickly outfitted the two prisoners with black goggles sensory deprivation headsets surgical masks to prevent them from picking up olfactory cues and blackout hoods then shackled their wrists and ankles and covered their hands with heavy canvas mittens they were then laid back in the trunk of harvaths car on their stomachs and had their ankle shackles connected to their wrist shackles via a short chain when the l landed it taxied to the cargo services area of the airport where reed carlton had two teams waiting when the cargo ramp was lowered one of the teams boarded the plane and traded keys with harvath the car with the two trunked prisoners was backed down the ramp and was met on the tarmac by a heavily armored black suburban the carlton group kept a fortified safe house in maryland as the two vehicles disappeared from the airport harvath figured that was where they were most likely headed after thanking the seals he walked down the ramp and disappeared himself he found the car that had been left for him and climbed in he wanted to get yatskos hard drive to the office as quickly as possible so the it team could get to work on it he also wanted to go over his plans with the old man in person carlton had been friends with robert ashford for many years but harvath had to know if ashford had been the one who had compromised the yemen operation he needed to look the old man in the face and see for himself that he was all in and willing to do whatever needed to be done starting the car he rolled down the windows and shifted into drive america was reeling from yet another attack people across the nation were mad as hell but they were also terrified they had no idea where or when the next attack would come all they knew was that they wanted it stopped after it was stopped they would want revenge harvath was already one step ahead chapter across the country families friends and neighbors huddled around television sets they watched over and over the repeated horrors of the last two days many asked why many more asked could it have been prevented even more asked would it happen again for all its strength for all its greatness much of america was paralyzed much but not all as harvath passed through security and into the carlton group offices they were alive with an activity he had never seen before shifts and hours had been tossed out the window all hands were on deck the entire twentyfifth floor was teeming with activity harvath made his way to digital ops punched his code into the door that guarded nicholass domain and when the lock released slid the door open and stepped in his tiny friend looked like hell but before harvath could even comment he was preempted theres some body spray around here somewhere he said if i need it let me know other than that i dont want to hear about how i look okay i havent been out of the scif much in the last seventytwo hours carlton has had someone walking the dogs for me there were times when harvath was stunned by the mans ability to practically read his mind bending over to quickly scratch both of the dogs behind the ears he replied everyones stretched to the max true said nicholas who snapped his fingers and held out his hand drive harvath removed the device from his pocket and handed it to him nicholas studied it for several minutes and then connected one of the many hydraheaded cables near his work station to it what did the russian say the password was he asked harvath repeated it to him and nicholas rolled his chair over to another keyboard and punched it in do you mind asked harvath gesturing at the minifridge help yourself opening the door he reached inside and withdrew an energy drink popping the top he grabbed a chair and sat down how many other airport attacks were there based on lax they were able to prevent attacks at denver miami jfk dfw boston and san francisco the faa and the white house have shut down the entire commercial air system united delta southwest american none of the airlines will be flying tomorrow not until a new set of security procedures is developed harvath had long been worried about how vulnerable americans were in airports they were incredibly soft targets it was only a matter of time before the terrorists zeroed in on them in fact they already had and the one thing everyone in the antiterrorism communities knew was that todays terrorists learned from yesterdays mistakes no one responsible for airport security could claim they didnt see this coming there had been more than enough warnings the attack by the japanese red army at the airport in tel aviv had killed two dozen people and wounded seventyeight others that should have been the wakeup call the only people who woke up were the israelis the rest of the world stayed asleep then came the rome and vienna airport attacks by muslim terrorists in in an egyptianborn greencardcarrying gunman employed as a limousine driver and living in the united states for ten years opened fire at the el al ticket counter at lax in a muslim doctor and a muslim engineer tried to drive a bombladen jeep cherokee into one of the terminals at glasgow international airport would america wake up now harvath had no idea what he did know was that when muslim doctors muslim engineers as well as muslim green card holders in the most prosperous nation in the history of the world committed acts of terrorism it wasnt because of economics it was because of ideology what harvath also knew was that airline travel was going to become even more of an aggravation than it already was with each terrorist attack on us soil americans gave up more of their rights harvath was reminded of the line paraphrasing benjamin franklin that those who trade some of their liberty for a little temporary security deserve neither and will lose both the wisdom of the founders never ceased to amaze him nicholas pointed to a stack of reports on the foiled attacks and harvath wheeled himself over to them as he sifted through them he asked any progress with mansoor in iceland yet nicholas shook his head hes not bouncing back as fast as they would have liked rileys last report says theyre afraid that they may have to take him back into surgery or that he does have some lowlevel brain damage that they cant nail down its been very slow going were also going to need to look into james standing the hedge fund guy when youre done with the drive put him in that tip program along with ashford and see what you can find okay ill add it to my list the little man replied without looking up from what he was doing harvath could tell he was distracting his friend so he stopped talking and paged through the rest of the reports dhs tsa and law enforcement at every airport across the country had gone on high alert based on the information they had been supplied from the attack at lax they had known what to look for and had been able to move quickly to take the terrorists down it was a win for the united states one it desperately needed it had also saved thousands of lives setting aside the last report harvath leaned back and watched nicholas work regardless of how rapidly his fingers moved across his keyboard or how many times he clicked and doubleclicked his mouse the mans expression was tranquil in this he resembled the multitudes of counterterrorism operatives harvath had worked with over the years no matter how dangerous the situation they approached each mission with an icy resolve though they all felt strongly about what they were doing it was as if they were completely devoid of emotion which was probably true as things heated up they calmed down and became completely focused essentially each was in his or her own particular zone that was exactly what he saw in nicholas at the moment ten minutes passed then twenty half an hour after he had begun nicholas turned from his computer his expression reminded harvath of that of a doctor stepping out of a difficult surgery to update an awaiting family theres a lot here he said if youre talking about loan sharking and racketeering im not interested we can leave that for the feds is there anything damning on ashford or not the little man tilted his head to the side by name no everything so far is coded everyone appears to have a different designator its filled with random strings of letters and numbers harvath wasnt surprised yatsko had been a professional spy and some old habits died very hard so weve got nothing not exactly said nicholas theres one remaining file i think its a rosetta stone that might explain all the other data but its heavily encrypted can you crack it given enough time i can crack anything but all things considered why dont we just crack yatsko instead i think they took him to the house in maryland ill have the old man call the interrogators the old man is yatskos interrogator said nicholas reed really really i think the two of them have a history dont ask me what it is reed carlton has more secrets than anyone ive ever met harvath didnt know if he should like the sound of that from what ralston had said yatsko was a tough son of a bitch the old man though was the toughest son of a bitch harvath had ever met if the two men had a history it could result in a very successful interrogation there was also a flip side history could also result in an extremely regrettable interrogation did they take yatsko to the farm in maryland maryland replied nicholas why bother they wanted to get started right away so they brought him and sarhan here they brought them here yeah carlton has them downstairs on twentyfour there was a stairwell near nicholass scif that harvath knew led to the twentyfourth floor access was via a keypad next to the door harvath punched in his code and waited the tiny light above the pad remained red he tried it again nothing damn it he muttered finally harvath decided to try the code hed seen the old man use on multiple occasions he punched the numbers into the keypad and watched as the little light turned green and he heard the sound of the locks releasing pulling open the door he stepped into the stairwell and headed down to twentyfour it had always been characterized as empty office space to him it was a buffer between their offices and the rest of the building it had also been explained as future space that the carlton group could grow into as harvath descended the stairs though he wondered if maybe he hadnt been told the whole truth in fact as he neared the landing for twentyfour he was reminded of something robert ashford had told him the first time they had met the mi man had picked harvath up at the airport and after whisking him through customs and passport control he had inquired as to the old mans wellbeing of course as they were about the same age he hadnt referred to him as the old man that was what his employees referred to him as but ashford hadnt referred to him as reed or carlton either he had called him peaches when harvath had jokingly asked if it was because his boss was so sweet ashford had laughed and flatly stated no the two men had worked together many times over the years and ashford explained that carlton was anything but sweet no matter how unsavory a tactic the enemy employed carlton would always oneup them according to ashford the old man had never shied away from doing whatever needed to be done he was apparently a very aggressive interrogator bloody ruthless in ashfords words hence the nickname peachesthe antithesis of the mans operating style ashford was one of the few people harvath had met who had worked with the old man in the field he found his stories about carlton fascinating he also found some of them very disturbing allegedly he had pushed a handful of interrogations way too far prisoners had died or so the rumors went though the old man had never been charged some of the whispers cited his tactics as a prime reason he and the cia had parted company harvath knew not to put a lot of stock in rumors especially washington rumors but nevertheless as he plugged reed carltons code into the keypad at the door for twentyfour he couldnt help but wonder what he would find on the other side there was a particularly nasty rumor about the old mans beating a prisoner with an electrical cord harvath had overheard several staffers talking about it when he first came on board at the carlton group hed made the mistake of asking the old man about it and had been put firmly in his place harvath hadnt asked him again as he stepped onto twentyfour he didnt know what he would find but when it came to carlton and his reputation he figured nothing would surprise him harvaths mind though was about to be changed chapter harvath moved from one empty office and conference room to the next finally on the west side of the building he located reed carlton and his prisoner they were in a small suite of tastefully decorated rooms that looked as if they had been plucked right out of the four seasons propped up on a hospitalstyle bed was yaroslav yatsko his wounds had been cleaned and dressed and an iv had been started each of his legs was in a straightleg brace with a large ice pack atop each knee sitting in a chair next to him drinking a glass of wine was reed carlton the old man looked up when harvath stuck his head into the room what are you doing down here he asked i heard the housekeepers forgot the mints for the pillows replied harvath the old man set his glass on the table and stood up ill be right back he said to yatsko and motioned for harvath to follow him into the hall once they were in the hall and the door to the suite of rooms was closed harvath asked whats all of that in there extraextraordinary rendition yaroslav is an old acquaintance thats a pretty nice room youve got him in do we have a spa around here too that i dont know about relax said the old man we rented a hospital bed and put it in one of the old executive offices for him why because yatsko needs to be protected harvath looked at him from what i hear its everybody else that needs to be protected from yatsko how do you know this guy and why are we taking care of him first of all were not taking care of him were using him the same way he and the russians would use us and as to how i know him lets just say we crossed paths many times in the old days reed this guy sent a wet work team to smoke larry salomon yatskos spetsnaz guys killed two filmmakers two american filmmakers how the hell was he even able to sneak into the country in the first place he didnt sneak in said carlton harvath looked at his boss weve actually known all along that hes been here from what i hear hes been helpful helpful how asked harvath helpful thinning the ranks of hollywood producers the old man shook his head hes been a good source of intelligence for the cia in mexico facilitating the hit on salomon though crossed the line the agency should have yanked his leash a long time ago so why didnt they if i had to guess its because much of what hes been doing south of the border has been beneficial to the us in exchange langley has been looking the other way and that includes his criminal endeavors stateside murder for hire of american citizens though was a big mistake its unforgivable and he knows it he got too greedy whats going to happen to him then at best hell be persona non grata in the united states and at worst harvath asked hell stand trial for murder you think theyre actually going to give him a choice no replied carlton we are whats he going to do for us hes going to help us nail robert ashford and once weve taken care of ashford were going to settle americas account with james standing so you believe ashford and standing are connected to the terrorist attacks asked harvath you think they were the ones who stole the unrestricted warfare plans from the chinese the old man took a moment to gather his thoughts i think weve got a lot of questions that need answering well we should start with your pal yatsko the password he gave back in california didnt unlock his entire drive i know replied carlton as he removed a piece of paper from his pocket and handed it to harvath it was his insurance policy give this to nicholas it should unlock the remaining file harvath took the piece of paper the fact that hes cooperating doesnt mean we should trust him the old man smiled believe me i know its one of the hardest things about our business you always have to assume that everyone is running an angle even robert ashford even robert ashford the old man agreed so how are we going to get to him asked harvath were not were going to have him come to us why would he come to us because he doesnt know what he doesnt know and thats the sort of thing that bothers a man like robert ashford im not exactly following you said harvath theres a reason ashford hasnt retired he lives for the intelligence game and the intelligence game is all about gathering information the more you have the more powerful you are right now ashfords going nuts because he doesnt know how much or how little we know about the aleem network how can you be so sure asked harvath because shortly after uppsala he contacted me he said he had some information he thought might be helpful to us and wanted to compare notes wait a second he knew we were behind uppsala no he was fishing what did you tell him i told him said the old man that i was busy and would get back to him do you think you can lure him over here i think so in fact i think we have to itd be too difficult right now to launch an operation in his backyard id rather we do it in ours where hes out of his element and we have control in addition ashford has no idea that we know anything about yatsko much less that we have him in our custody the old man smiled and thats how were going to bring down robert ashford chapter london monday it was early monday morning and robert ashford was taking his breakfast at his tidy little row house at number portobello road in londons notting hill like many people around the world he had his television on and was watching scenes from the terrorist attacks that had taken place in america over the last couple of days spread out on the dining table in front of him was a crosssection of domestic and international newspapers along with reports from mi and mi when his phone rang he figured it was yet another call from his office he had come home only long enough to shower change and get something to eat but the calls had kept coming both mi and mi were desperate to make sure that what had happened in the united states didnt happen in britain of course ashford knew they didnt have anything to worry about at least not from the group pulling off all the attacks in the united states but he had to play along and appear distraught and quite concerned that the united kingdom could very well be next he was surprised when the voice on the other end of the phone didnt belong to someone from his office at all but to reed carlton back in the usa im very sorry for what has happened said ashford who then moved the receiver away from his mouth so he could take a bite of toast thank you robert the attacks have been devastating to our country im sure its all over the tvs there but you have no idea what its like over here ashford remembered the attacks in london and tried to recollect his feelings from that day to stir up some convincing sympathy for the americans terrible terrible business all of this he said i understand the prime minister has been in touch with your president and has given our condolences and pledge of support he has and im sure it was very much appreciated thats actually why im calling replied carlton ashford was about to take a sip of tea but his interest piqued he changed his mind and set the cup back down you know if theres anything at all we can do for you im hoping there is the only problem is that its kind of delicate delicate in what fashion the mi man asked warily we have some leads independent of the fbi and cia back here that were running down and it would help us tremendously if we could liaise with your office in a somewhat unofficial capacity that hasnt been a problem before we have a relationship with your organization and if there are any connections to what happened in america and british interests or british citizens then i can very much guarantee that any resources we have would be at your disposal thank you robert replied carlton thats good to hear especially right now between you and me things are in absolute turmoil here i can only imagine ashford waited a moment and then said were you calling just to put us on notice that some requests may be coming or was there something specific you needed both actually i know before the most recent attacks happened you said you had some information we might find useful and wanted to see what we had been able to compile particularly as it had to do with aazim aleem and that offer still stands carlton decided it was time to bait the hook were you aware that aazim had a nephew really i didnt know that but these people do often come from large families so it isnt too much of a shock to discover was the nephew a british citizen as well unfortunately he is why do i get the feeling im not going to like this asked ashford theres a good part and a bad part ill give you the bad news first said the old man the nephew ran all of his uncles it operations and he did so from london past tense noted the mi man does that mean hes no longer among the living no and thats my good news we have him really said ashford trying to sound calm you know its not going to play well if it gets out that you ran your own little operation and snatched a british citizen from british soil we didnt grab him in britain even though the mi man already knew that he asked where was he when you took him pakistan someplace a lot blonder but id rather not get into the details over the phone of course not our problem is that he had a preexisting heart condition and there was a complication when we began his interrogation what kind of complication said ashford he had a heart attack whats his prognosis carlton was honest with him we think hell be okay eventually but in the meantime our hands are somewhat tied as you can understandably appreciate as to how forceful we can be in our interrogation if were not careful the concern is we could cause him to have another heart attack and he could die you are in a bind arent you thats where we were hoping you could help im sure the security service has you busy but if they could see fit to part with you for a few days wed like to have you come assist us in the interrogation as well as making sense of some of the backgrounds of the terrorists involved in the recent attacks said carlton adding i have to be honest with you robert we are completely in the dark ashford smiled lifted his cup and took a sip of tea ill call the director general right now thank you robert i really appreciate this not at all peaches you know id do anything for you after all were allies arent we the men spoke for a few more minutes about the trip carlton explained that because commercial air travel had been suspended hed be glad to send a plane for ashford the mi man appreciated the gesture and thought it was a good idea as it would demonstrate to the director general how seriously the americans needed ashfords help after the rough details were hammered out they said goodbye and ashford hung up the phone walking to his study he removed the encrypted phone he used to contact james standing and dialed his number despite the very late hour back in the states the billionaire was wide awake i have good news said ashford it can only improve your situation what is it standing was still very upset that not only had the lax attack been nearly completely foiled none of the other airport attacks had succeeded either upon hearing the news he had called ashford and chewed him out reed carlton has asked me to come over and assist with the investigation in the attacks well you can pack light hell soon learn how useless you are and send you home ashford fought to keep his anger under control for your information i just learned that it was the carlton group who took down the rabbit hutch standing was silent for a moment finally youve produced something useful a little bit late but still useful youre welcome dont be a smartass with me ashford if you want attaboys join a cricket team im paying you for results so carlton is dumb enough to think you can somehow help with their investigations was there anything else you wanted to waste my time with they have oxfords nephew in custody why should we care because according to carlton oxford put his nephew in charge of his it operations who the fuck told that hookhanded simpleton that he could do that standing demanded aazims handicap should have concerned them from the beginning in hindsight it wasnt unthinkable that he would take someone into his confidence to help him with computerrelated things especially a young family member believing that the terrorist leader with nothing but time on his proverbial hands gladly sat around typing out messages hunting and pecking on his keyboard with the steel tips of his prosthetic hooks had been a mistake the good news is that so far they havent been able to get any information out of the nephew apparently he had some sort of heart attack shortly after they took him into custody and how the hell did they pull that off im assuming the nephew was a brit or was he some backwardsass relation living in a mud hut in some arab country said standing hes british replied ashford but to quote carlton they grabbed him someplace blond uppsala i think maybe now we know who was seen being laid down in the back of that car and driven away youd better make sure the nephew has another heart attack do you understand me i want him silenced ill take care of it said ashford dont worry fuck you dont worry i am worried do you have any idea how close we are ashford had no idea if the question was rhetorical but knowing standing it probably was so he didnt bother to reply were buying oranges tomorrow said the billionaire ashford couldnt believe it so soon im not waiting any longer i have everything i need in place and thats all that matters the mi man knew that the orange attacks were paired with another colorcoded attack and it reminded him of a nursery rhyme from his youth oranges and lemons say the bells of st clements bulls eyes and targets say the bells of st margrets here comes a candle to light you to bed and here comes a chopper to chop off your head well need lemons said ashford pausing according to the recipe thats the next ingredient should i contact our grocer no replied standing ill contact him you go handle things with the carlton people i will ill make sure everything is taken care of youd better said the billionaire and one other thing robert whats that when the next wedge of black swans sails into their pond try to look surprised before ashford could say anything in return standing had once again hung up on him chapter new york city technology amazed james standing setting his laptop on his livingroom table he marveled at what an incredible instrument it was with it he could move markets he could fund startup companies he could create political organizations he could change public perception he could sow peace he could bring war all of it could be done from anywhere he found himself on the planet and it all could be done clandestinely it was indeed a tool fit for a god yet what did most people do with their computers they played video games wasted themselves on socalled social media or consumed pornography his contempt for the intellectual lethargy of mankind ran as deep as his belief in mankinds boundless potential the planet and its inhabitants could be so much more than they were but they would never even come close if left to their own devices they would always choose their narrow selfinterest over everything else they would never realize how miserable they truly were and how they could transcend that misery you could paint the most glorious picture of what awaited but they wouldnt grasp it some might but the majority the masses truly were asses the only way they would become better people and society would be improved was through force they couldnt be led to a better life they had to be dragged there by the state like the dumb beasts they were there would be those whom even force would not be able to persuade there was only one solution for that problem the world would be a better place without people who wanted to cling to the status quo for mankind to survive for mankind to reach its brilliant potential not only must there be progress but all resistance to that progress must be stripped away and destroyed what awaited mankind was an earthly paradise of gleaming golden cities a perfect sociopoliticolegal system in harmony with nature what julia winston the young financial times reporter called socialism was actually opportunity though it was beaten back repeatedly by small minds it continued to outstretch its warm and generous hand waiting to take mankind and civilization forward attempts to take mankind into this land of promise had indeed failed in the past but now it would be different for one very specific reason this time those leading the world forward had an advantage those before them did notthey had technology technology was what would allow the enlightened to shift the paradigm and move human beings to the next stage in their evolution powering up his laptop standing engaged two more pieces of technology that amazed him skype and an absolutely fluid translation platform that made him appear the perfect arabic speaker as salam alaikum mustafa karami typed when he saw his benefactor had logged on to speak with him peace be upon you wa alaykumu ssalmu wa rahmatu llhi wa baraktuh standing replied using the formal response he thought befitting his sheikh from qatar persona may allahs blessings be upon you karami was quick to accentuate the positive of the past two days allahu akbar we rejoice for the brothers who have gone to paradise allahu akbar standing typed inna lillaahi wa inna ilayhi rajiun god is great to allah we belong and to allah we return robert ashford didnt like it that karami got his marching orders from two different sources standing didnt care what he thought sometimes he liked to delegate the job to ashford sometimes he liked to pull the figurative trigger himself he also liked to convey the impression to karami and the others that they were part of a very large organization which they were we stand ready to serve in allahs great and just cause wrote karami i bet you do thought standing why was i not told about the muftis nephew the mufti of jihad was the pen name aazim aleem had been known by throughout the muslim world for his sermons on jihad it took karami a moment to type his response to his credit he didnt lie you should have been told youre damn right i should have been was what standing wanted to say but instead he wrote where is the nephew now we do not know if the authorities have him how much of a danger will he be to our operation that we also do not know standing was further tempted to ask what the hell they did know but then karami added to his last transmission saying we must assume he knows everything the mufti himself knew so karami wasnt a complete fool after all i agree typed standing we stand ready the terrorist stated again standing typed the words orange and yellow then hit send when orange is to happen monday replied standing who had been wrestling with the timing for the followup he needed the orange attacks to get extensive deep coverage before the next attack it was a gamble though if aazims nephew knew everything the uncle did and the carlton group broke him hed be lucky to see any more attacks and yellow karami asked wait fortyeight hours after the orange events have been reported then you may launch yellow inshaallah we will be much more successful this time inshaallah standing agreed before ending the conversation and exiting skype the chinese seemed almost to have designed this next wave of attacks with him in mind not only would it help further push the united states into a state of incredibly disruptive chaos but he had even found a way to profit by it america was indeed an incredible country chapter northern virginia after leaving the carlton group offices harvath had driven straight home taken a quick shower shaved and fallen into bed he wasnt going to be any good to anyone if he didnt get some rest when his phone rang it drew him out of a very deep sleep fumbling blindly over the nightstand he felt around until he found his blackberry without opening his eyes he activated the call and brought the device to his ear scot its nicholas said the little man from up in reston i think i found something have you been to sleep at all no listen you asked me to look into connections between standing ashford and the attacks what did you find asked harvath remember the bomber in chicago the one who blew himself up several weeks ago before he could take down that building above the amtrak tracks one hundred north riverside plaza yeah i remember well i was looking at all of the dots on the map again trying to figure out what they all meant then i threw standing into the mix and thats where i think i found something harvath continued to lie there with his eyes closed keep going the unrestricted warfare plan calls for terrorist attacks that not only sow fear and cause massive loss of life and property damage but also do dramatic economic damage right right james standing has also called for economic damage to the united states in fact he has been quite vocal about it that got me thinking if hes the driving force behind all of this the guy who put up the money to finance hijacking the blueprint from the chinese would he be bold enough to try to turn a profit from all of this i dont think standing got rich by being stupid you obviously havent had much exposure to bankers said nicholas i have youre saying theyre stupid no not stupid theyre aggressive very aggressive and theyre smart as hell theyre risktakers to the nth degree and james standing is no different its wellinformed gambling in most cases and in some its counting cards and dealing from the bottom of the deck cheating mumbled harvath yes so what did you find i looked at all the colorcoded dots on our map again but this time from a financial perspective i asked myself how i would try to make money out of these attacks and thats when it hit i dont think the failed bomber in chicago was targeting north riverside plaza because it was built above the train tracks that might have been part of it but if so it was secondary what was the primary reason then it was home to boeings corporate headquarters said nicholas you think the bomber wanted to bring down the entire building just to get to boeing i do replied the little man and its not just boeing i think this is what the orange dots are all about the one thing they have in common is that theyre in cities from fairfield connecticut to palo alto california that are home to the corporate headquarters of all the companies that make up the dow jones industrial average can you imagine taking out all thirty headquarters at once do you have any idea the economic chaos that would cause especially if you timed it so that most if not all of the senior management was present when the buildings came down harvaths eyes were wide open now and he propped himself up in bed that would be huge it wouldnt just be huge it would be game over lets set aside for a moment that the dow is basically a bs indicator what do you mean the dow is the financial indicator everyone looks at no nicholas clarified its the indicator that retail investors look at since it has been on an upward trajectory the funny thing is that only one of the thirty companies that make up the dow has been there over the last hundred years and thats ge its a massive psychological operation if a company does poorly it gets yanked so the dow can keep climbing so if its all bs what difference does it make if it takes a hit regardless of what you think of the index the companies on it are currently some of the bestperforming in the united states a massive coordinated terrorist attack wiping out just the top twentyfive people in each company in effect their intellectual horsepower could absolutely devastate their stock and in turn the financial markets if your goal was to collapse the united states said harvath why not go right for the dow attack then to soften the battlefield id want to sow as much chaos and panic as possible i think its brilliant make people across the country feel that they arent physically safe anywhere and then take all their money away in a financial crisis and theyll beg for a return to normalcy start throwing in more attacks after that and theyll give up anything and stand behind anyone who promises to return things to the way they were at that point america as its citizens know it is over and is never coming back having studied history harvath knew that once people gave up their freedom in order to restore order that freedom was never returned he didnt even want to consider that this was possible but he knew that it was and he knew that they had to figure out a way to prevent it from happening youre sure thats what the orange dots represent as sure as i can be he replied but its not just because of the locations i found something else and its exactly what i would do if i were james standing and thought i was smarter than everyone else and wouldnt get caught what is it beginning six weeks ago significant bets were placed that all thirty companies making up the dow were going to drastically lose value over the subsequent three months you mean someone is shorting them thats the way it looks said nicholas very much in the same way options were purchased against united and american airlines stocks right before is it standing harvath asked i said people like standing were aggressive not stupid the shorts lead back to a series of holding companies most of them offshore im trying to use the tip to pierce them in the meantime though what should we do about my hypothesis if you were going to try to take out the senior management of all these companies when would you do it nicholas thought about it for a moment maybe at a corporate retreat or a shareholders or board of directors meeting im talking about all thirty companies at once and at a time when as many of those people would likely be at their corporate headquarters if youre speaking monday through friday then i would say definitely do it on a monday harvath looked at his watch it was technically already monday dupont chemical is up in wilmington delaware theyre still part of the dow right yes why what are you thinking i think we need to check out your hypothesis you only want to check out dupont asked nicholas why not warn all of them because in light of the attacks weve just suffered everything is already on edge if word got out that we thought these companies were targets it would create a panic that could be just as bad as if they were attacked harvath had a good point youre right agreed nicholas what do you want to do have you called the old man yet no i wanted to talk to you first anything out of iceland nothing yet harvath had already gotten out of bed okay he stated ill call reed you keep working on things there youre going up to dupont arent you i am well youre going to need help said nicholas im looking at pictures of the building their headquarters is in right now it takes up an entire city block and is thirteen stories tall you cant possibly search the entire thing by yourself i wont be going by myself replied harvath im going to bring a few friends with me chapter the massive eightbladed threeengine sikorsky ch sea stallion helicopter thundered over the atlantic ocean straight up the east coast inside harvath sat with members of the us navys explosive ordnance disposal eod group two out of naval amphibious base little creek virginia multiple rapiddeployment us army chemical biological nuclear radiological and highyield explosive enhanced response force package teams also known as cerfp teams were already en route to wilmington via blackhawk helicopters from fort meade and andrews air force base rodney square directly across the street from the dupont building was the designated landing zone and had already been secured by the wilmington police department the building was composed of a hotel theater bank retail shops duponts corporate headquarters and other generalpurpose office space the hotel was at percent occupancy and its guests were sleeping when the first of the helicopters landed the concrete corridors of wilmingtons downtown business district reverberated with earsplitting thunder as one after another the large birds flared then touched down and quickly disgorged their teams and equipment before lifting back off again and disappearing duponts executive director in charge of corporate security ron lamat was one of the most experienced executive protection specialists in the country a former baltimore county police major he had trained with the secret service and was a graduate of the fbis national executive institute when he wasnt keeping duponts hierarchy and their families safe he was teaching other executive protection specialists how to do the same for their clients in a crisis harvath couldnt have hoped to have liaised with a more competent or professional chief of security lamat met harvath and his team outside at the lz and led them into the building schematics had been laid on hastily erected tables in the lobby building engineers roused from their beds and rushed to the scene stood by ready to answer any questions or provide access to any of the common or private areas rows of radios stood in charging stations plugged into outlets along one wall in case the teams needed a uniform means of communication lined up near the radios were four of lamats best men ready to assist in any way they were needed harvath stood aside talking with the security chief while the eod and cerfp team leaders discussed how to divvy up the search as soon as they had come to an agreement they established a communications protocol and split up based on the failed chicago bombing of the boeing building they began their search focused on the dupont buildings structural supports even with the large amount of manpower and technology they had they moved excruciatingly slowly the first floor alone took more than a half hour to clear as they moved up to the second floor ron lamat pulled harvath aside do you mind if i make a suggestion he said im all ears replied harvath i know you wanted to keep this quiet but you kind of blew that with the helicopters and by using the local pd to secure your lz i think we need more searchers or were still going to be working our way through this building come lunchtime what do you have in mind i can make a couple of phone calls said lamat and have fifteen bombsniffing dogs here within half an hour we use one per floor and we can be done here real quick harvath had wanted to keep things as quiet as possible but lamat was right the dogs could move a lot faster okay do it he replied but tell them we need this kept as quiet as possible as the teams had deployed cguard rf manpack ied jammers around the perimeter of the building to prevent remote detonation lamats cell phone couldnt get a signal and he had to retreat upstairs to his office where he made the calls via his landline fortyfive minutes later the dogs and their handlers had joined the search and were sweeping throughout the offices on every floor when a belgian shepherd named gina stopped at a section of drywall in an office on the fourth floor sat down on her haunches and looked up at her handler word went out that they had a hit a nearby cerfp team rushed to the office and conducted its own methodical search ten minutes later the team confirmed what the dog had alerted them to a large amount of explosives had been secreted behind the drywall at a support column with harvaths approval ron lamat made the decision to evacuate the building starting with the hotel while the search continued gina ended up getting hits on every single support column on the fourth floor after the rest of the building was checked and no other explosives were found the dogs and handlers were released the eodcerfp teams then moved from support column to support column on the fourth floor using portable xray devices to see exactly what they were dealing with insulation had been removed and shape charges made of c had been affixed directly to the beams along with remote detonators and extra power packs there were enough explosives in place to bring the building down three times over harvath needed to let carlton know so the other dow jones corporations could be warned using the landline phone in lamats office harvath called the old man who was now in the toc in reston and gave him a full situation report do we have any idea how the explosives got in there or how long theyve been there carlton asked at this point we dont know replied harvath ron is putting an email together right now with a full list of tenants and anything else he thinks might be helpful have him send it directly to me will do anything else no said carlton youve done all you can do there let the teams handle the explosives i need you back here ashfords plane is going to be landing soon chapter by the time robert ashfords jet touched down at dulles harvath was already at the landmark aviation fbo waiting for him customs and immigration had been alerted to the mi operatives arrival and processed him quickly and professionally right at the plane harvath met him on the tarmac i dont suppose they have any bottled water inside ashford asked after the pair shook hands bloody caterer forgot to load any beverages for the flight harvath wanted to rip the guys face off right there but he kept his anger under control and tried to act as normal as possible given the situation i think i may have some water in my truck he replied as he steered the man toward the parking area after a quick search inside his armrest harvath apologized and asked if ashford could hold on for just a few minutes longer the brit nodded harvath put his car in gear and they drove out of the airport reed would have come out to meet you himself harvath said as he headed for the dulles toll road but as you can imagine things have been very chaotic back at the office of course in fact you didnt have to come all the way out to get me i could have taken a cab replied ashford despite flecks of spittle at the corners the brits mouth was bonedry he was obviously dehydrated and though he tried to hide it harvath could see that he was also on edge its ten minutes each way said harvath its not a big deal we appreciate your dropping everything to come help us hows your investigation going not good he stated as he got onto the toll road thats what i was told i hope that theres some way we can help the loss of life your country has suffered is nothing short of tragic harvath nodded and changed the subject weve got a room reserved for you at a hotel in reston but the boss was hoping you wouldnt mind coming straight into the office we want to get you up to speed and then someone can drive you back to the hotel would that be okay of course he replied then changing the subject back he asked any change in the status of aazim aleems nephew what was his name again mansoor aleem no change but were all hopeful you picked him up where somewhere in scandinavia im assuming sweden actually replied harvath so you all were behind that bit of unpleasantness in uppsala then you know the swedes think it was the french thats what the boss wanted them to think hes a very clever man that peaches said ashford he is indeed said harvath what was mansoor aleem getting up to in uppsala of all places from what we have been able to put together after aazim was killed in yemen a new commander in the network was promoted his name is mustafa karami and he was based in uppsala karami brought mansoor to sweden because he wanted to know more about someone they referred to as the sheikh from qatar ring any bells harvath tried to study the brits face but it was too dark in the suv i cant say im familiar with any sheikh from qatar but that doesnt mean we dont have something in our files when i get near a computer i can send a note back to my office and have them begin checking thank you youre welcome said ashford who then asked so mansoor aleem is the young arab that witnesses saw being taken out of that apartment building in uppsala and driven away no that was one of our guys we had managed to infiltrate their cell with harvath didnt need to see the brits face the surprise was evident in his voice when the mi man said really yes relied harvath he had infiltrated their chicago cell too that made a big difference in lessening the effect of the attacks they attempted to pull off there weve been able to learn a lot about the structure of the network anything that we might find helpful back in the uk tons ashford listened as harvath laid out everything they knew about the chinese site and the unrestrictedwarfare plan harvath was still talking when they pulled into the underground parking structure beneath the carlton groups offices in the first flash of overhead fluorescent lighting he was able to catch the look on the brits face it didnt last long but it lasted long enough the man was dumbfounded and it wasnt by the audacious scope of the unrestricted warfare plan it was by how much reed carlton and his group had been able to put together harvath parked his tahoe and he and ashford climbed out have you been to the office before he asked no i havent replied asford this is my first time he told me he had a devil of a time finding the right space he said he made a lot of modifications and that id be quite surprised with what he had done to it harvath waved a key fob in front of a reader and opened the glass doors for the main elevator bank he allowed the mi man to step in first and then followed reaching over he pushed the button for the twentyfourth floor so a key fob thats the extent of your security ashford said with a chuckle what am i missing harvath forced a smile you know what they say when it comes to security its not necessarily what you see but what you dont see that counts quite right the brit agreed on the twentyfourth floor harvath let his guest step into the hallway first and then exited the elevator car behind him he led him to a large door with gray lettering that read parsons charrington amp obrien law firm the mi man asked accounting firm said harvath as he withdrew a set of keys i suppose it has a bit more panache than universal exports now doesnt it opening the door harvath forced another smile and showed his guest in when the door had closed behind them he took a step away from ashford and gesturing at the small reception area asked so are you surprised the mi man looked around at the empty waiting room wondering if this was some sort of a joke how about now asked harvath as his fist came sailing forward and nailed the older man right in the stomach chapter harvath would have liked nothing more than to have beaten ashford to death but the old man had been very specific not only about where he could hit him but how hard in case they needed to use him operationally there were to be no blows to his head neck or face the punch had completely knocked the wind out of the mi operative and after removing everything from his pockets harvath dragged him down a narrow interior hallway to the room that had been set up for the interrogation it was important that they work fast they needed to keep him mentally offbalance the harder they came at him the harder it would be for him to concoct a story kicking open the door harvath dragged ashford inside reed carlton knew one very important thing about the mi operative it was the only pressure point he needed to conduct a successful interrogation harvath dropped ashford into a prisoner restraint chair that looked as if it had been designed for hannibal lecter what the hell are you doing the man wheezed as the air began to rush back into his lungs he struggled but harvath struck him again this time in the solar plexus almost knocking back out what little air he had recovered when he ceased struggling harvath worked quickly to strap him in when he was finished the mi operatives torso limbs and head were completely immobilized on a table in the corner was a large black bag harvath removed a small handful of what looked like pieces of candy dropped them in his pocket and walked back over to ashford why are you doing this the man demanded once more harvath removed one of the ammonia inhalant ampules from his pocket and placing it under ashfords nose cracked it open the brits eyes shot open wide and he tried to twist his head to get away from the smell but he couldnt harvath waited a moment and then did it again stop it ashford shouted but harvath kept going until he had used up all the ampules he had in his pocket i want reed here right now ashford demanded harvath ignored him as he retrieved three large strobe lights and placing them on stands positioned them about a foot away from the mi operatives face do you have any idea who youre fucking with ashford was now screaming do you know the kind of trouble youre in do you harvath smiled the brit was getting nice and worked up walking back over to the black duffel he removed a pair of stereo headphones with an extralong cord placing the headphones over ashfords ears harvath then ran the cord back to a large boom box sitting under the table and plugged it in it had been carltons idea to exacerbate ashfords propensity for migraines thats why the plane had taken off from london without beverages dehydration was a frequent migraine trigger harvath though had wanted the man to suffer stress strong odors bright strobing lights and loud music were also migraine triggers turning the boom box on and the volume all the way up harvath then walked over and activated the strobes when ashford began to scream again harvath pulled a roll of duct tape from his bag tore off a piece and placed it over the mans mouth fishing a power bar and a large bottle of water from the duffel he stepped outside for his interrogators local union sanctioned break when harvath stepped back into the room ten minutes later ashfords face was wet with tears harvath slowly turned off the strobes he then calmly turned off the music and removed the headphones next he removed the piece of tape from over the mans mouth and dismantled the strobes putting all of the equipment back near the table moments later reed carlton walked into the room carrying a red file folder in his left hand hello robert he quietly said as he approached his old friend why are you doing this the mi man stammered how do you feel robert how do you think i feel you bastard carlton motioned for harvath to bring him a chair which he placed several feet in front of ashford he doesnt need to have his head restrained like that said the old man harvath walked behind him and released the strap does that feel better robert carlton asked up yours the old man ignored the insult robert i believe you know how this works i have a series of questions that i will ask you once and only once if you lie to me its all over do we understand each other may i have some water answer my questions and ill be happy to give you some water ill also be happy to give you one of those he said pointing at the bottle of pills sitting on the table that harvath had removed when cleaning out the mans pockets and then what you hand me over to the authorities here or back in the uk the old man shook his head no thats not an option you and i go back a long time you know what im capable of both good and he paused less than good so im going to give you a choice if you cooperate youll have to leave mi and leave the uk but ill resettle you with a new identity you go into retirement and i never want to hear from you or see you ever again and if i dont cooperate then no one will ever see you or hear from you again im not leaving the security service im not here to bargain with you robert you know full well that i can make good on either of the two options i offered you ashford didnt respond his head was killing him it felt as if someone had split it wide open with an axe i dont know what you want from me carlton opened his folder why dont you start by telling me about the hit on larry salomon who the old man shook his head closed his file stood up and began walking away ashford looked at him where are you going im sorry it had to end like this robert i told you i dont know any larry salomon you cant do this you cant just kill me you wont kill me carlton walked back to his chair set his file folder down and sprang at the mi man grabbing a fistful of hair he torqued the mans head back thousands of americans are dead and you think im going to play games with you im not involved with the terrorist attacks why are you doing this reed i dont know what youre talking about who put you up to this the old man bent the brits head back even farther i know the routine robert deny deny deny and then launch counteraccusations it isnt going to work ive offered you an incredible deal you son of a bitch its better than you deserve dont be an idiot take it but you dont have a thing on me i dont know why youre doing this carlton looked at harvath and said go get him go get who asked ashford as harvath left the room shut up reed you and i are friends the old man wasnt listening to him what changed you robert was it money is that what this is all about i dont know what youre talking about show a little character robert show some dignity i have offered to let you disappear into retirement take the offer but i havent done anything the mi man insisted i dont know any larry salomon im not involved in these horrible terrorist attacks all i know is that if you had one shred of proof youd produce it as the man finished his sentence harvath wheeled yaroslav yatsko into the room in a wheelchair hello robert the russian said chapter you think mi would take his word a former kgb operatives against mine the word of a man who admits hes in the murderforhire business youre crazier than he is carlton opened the file and showed ashford what he had you two go way back he kept very meticulous records if i did communicate with trash like this said the brit do you honestly think id be stupid enough to do it with an email address that traced back to me we also have the banking information for the payments made to mr yatsko again how stupid do you think i am and then theres yemen said the old man suddenly ashfords mask slipped a flash of panic rippled across his face but was quickly suppressed thats right asshole weve got you dead to rights in yemen said harvath carlton closed the file and looked at the mi operative theres no way out robert theres also no more time left on the clock we know everything the only reason were having this conversation is that i wanted to give you a way out im closing the window though either you accept my offer or i have a van waiting downstairs with a team that will take you out to the country put a bullet in your head and plant you in a very cold and lonely piece of ground harvath had already taken yatsko back to his room and returned he was now watching ashford to see what he would do they didnt have him dead to rights on yemen that had been a bluff harvath had been adamant that ashford believe that the case against him was overwhelming he lived for his career and he needed to believe that it was over they needed to psychologically strip him naked and convince him that the only way out was through the old man and you give me your word that youll relocate me a new identity a new life all of it said ashford the economy being what it is you may end up recycling boxes at a walmart but i give you my word said the old man who gestured for harvath to give him some water harvath did as he was instructed i want the person pulling your strings replied carlton as he motioned for harvath to bring him the vial of pills from the table ashford was quiet for several moments finally he said i wont testify itd be a death sentence id never live to see any trial you let us worry about the trial i want money too if you want my help its going to cost i think we should just kill him said harvath carlton waved him off im not changing the terms of my offer robert it is a takeitorleaveit deal youre either going into the brandnew reed carlton witness protection program or youre going into a cornfield in rural new england its your call once again the mi operative took several moments before responding when he did speak he said give me two of my pain pills actually make it three and ill tell you anything you want to know ill consider giving you one said the old man nodding to harvath that it was okay to prep one when you start filling us in on what we want to know ashford looked at the two men the tears were flowing again he had given up he was broken they had him where do you want me to begin he asked harvath stepped in opened the bottle and shook out one of the pills ashford opened his mouth harvath placed the pill on his tongue and then gave him some more water to wash it down lets start with who youre working for you already know who it is said ashford i want to hear you say it james standing the terror attacks in europe and chicago that you helped us work on who was behind those james standing and the attacks on movie theaters across the united states that just happened james standing the airport attacks standing ashford repeated yet again tell me about the terror network itself said carlton the mi man looked at him it was built by the chinese as part of an asymmetric warfare plan called unrestricted warfare standing financed and helped arrange for the stealing of the plan from the chinese military he then had every person who had been involved in crafting the plan killed how many terror cells are in the united states the brit had to think for a moment but then replied hundreds easily hundreds your entire country is infested how do you communicate with the cells i want a guarantee in writing that i am honestly going to get immunity from prosecution harvath leaned forward how about instead we dump you outside the russian center of special operations with a sign around your neck saying you helped get three spetsnaz soldiers killed carlton motioned for harvath to back off were not negotiating anymore robert i gave you my word now tell me how you communicate with the cells there is a hierarchy of commanders ashford finally stated when aazim aleem was killed by you harvath clarified yes by me after i killed aazim a man named mustafa karami was promoted i then relayed commands to him or standing did he then contacted the appropriate cells through emails chat rooms coded telephone conversations and the like despite having been set up as a tool of the chinese for all intents and purposes it is a fully functioning islamic terror network why was aazim killed asked carlton isnt it obvious we couldnt have the cia interrogating him that would have been the end of all of it and what was your end game in all of this what was your goal yours and standings certainly this isnt just about terror for terrors sake ashford grinned sadly it was about making the world a better place by murdering people innocent men women and children demanded harvath all in pursuit of a greater good in other words the ends justify the means ashford nodded and harvath wanted to beat the brit to a pulp all in pursuit of a greater good but the old man could see he was getting worked up and signaled again for him to stand down how were these attacks supposed to make the world a better place carlton asked the only hope for the world is the collapse of the narrowly focused nationstate model the planet is too interconnected society too complex to be ruled by mob mentalities that only care about whats good for them and dont give a damn about anyone else so the attacks were meant to collapse the concept of the nation state they are meant to collapse the united states once the us is out of the way the rest of the world can be led into complete and utter darkness interjected harvath without america theres no peace without peace theres no prosperity the brit shook his head slowly without america there is justice carlton studied his former friend how did you go from fighting communists to becoming one i opened my eyes reed i saw the incredible suffering in the world then i opened my mind and went looking for answers you have no idea said harvath what the world would be like without america well see soon enough really and wholl govern this new world order some elite ruling class of intellectuals americans will never stand for the overthrow of their government ashford smiled again of course they will its already happening trust me your attacks will only bring the american people closer together im not talking about the terrorist attacks those are simply part of the final phase the overthrow of america has been going on for decades if someone tried to collapse the united states overnight of course the american people would revolt thats why it had to be done slowly quietly it has been aided from both the outside and the inside all of the massive problems besetting your nation all of the economic political and social turmoil hasnt suddenly picked up speed by accident its all by design and it all has a singular overriding purpose the man was insane and just so i dont miss this glorious new dawn of global governance when it happens what should i be on the lookout for asked harvath bluehelmeted united nations soldiers marching up main street usa or will it be more subtle than that you dont have to look for anything replied ashford its already here its all around you youve been looking right at it for years without knowing you still have your name you still have your flag you still believe you have your freedoms though in reality they have been slowly siphoned away you still believe you have a republic when daybyday what you are being left with is merely the illusion of a republic your entire house as it were has been rebuilt one brick at a time and no one has even noticed no one has done a single thing about it how do we stop it asked carlton i dont think you can replied ashford standing wants to push the nation over the edge he has some vision in mind of how to push us past the point of no return how does he do that how many more attacks are coming at this point i only know of two that have definitely been activated but theres literally thousands of options he can choose from the unrestricted warfare plan is as deep as it is broad what are the two said carlton eager to ascertain whether ashford was telling them the truth all of the attacks are colorcoded the next two attacks are orange and yellow orange will be attacks on the corporate headquarters of the companies listed on the dow industrial average some of the companies are in regular office buildings others are on campuses provisions have been made to collapse some buildings entirely and in other cases to have explosives detonate in the offices boardrooms and executive dining rooms of senior management so far it appeared to carlton that ashford was telling the truth and when are those attacks supposed to happen today what are the yellow attacks harvath asked the yellow attacks are a followon they target the major news outlets the idea being that if they can be taken out national news will essentially cease to exist local news will continue but there wont be anyone to truly connect and expose the dots on a national level thats it ashford shook his head not exactly standing is worried that the network has been compromised he rushed the dow attack forward because he wanted to create financial chaos he wanted to really hit people where theyd feel it in order to add to their panic if he can i think hell activate one additional attack hes particularly enamored of a final attack on the nations infrastructure what part standing has always been interested in taking down the internet and as much of the power grid as possible he wants everything to grind to a halt and to plunge the country into literal darkness its kind of the coup de grace for him when how soon when we discussed it he said the best timing would be before all of the crops could be harvested with no fuel being delivered to power tractors or trucks food would rot in the field and never make it to market millions would starve and millions more would freeze to death over the winter harvath looked at carlton and gestured toward the hallway they left ashford strapped to the chair and stepped out of the room closing the door behind them were going to need a complete map of that terror network names pictures telephone numbers addresses means of contact all of it said harvath then somebodys going to have to figure out how to take down all of the cell members all at the same time all across the country without any word leaking out thats going to mean an extremely wellcoordinated law enforcement effort replied carlton harvath nodded we also need to get our hands on that unrestricted warfare plan if ashford has a copy and we should assume he does we need to get it asap the more we know about whats in that playbook the better defense and offense we can mount which brings us to james standing harvath took a moment as he tried to be certain he had put all of the pieces together correctly if ashford and standing control the network and we have ashford then the only one left calling the shots is standing correct at some point though when hes unable to make contact with ashford hes going to know that something is up in fact when the dow attacks dont happen hell know hes been penetrated and could go for broke and activate all the remaining attacks which is why we need to get to the networks current commander this karami guy as well as standing right away said harvath if we can do that we might be able to shortcircuit the network and render it inert until all its members can be rounded up theres just one thing said carlton taking out some foreign terrorist like karami is one thing dealing with a politically connected billionaire american philanthropist like james standing is something totally different i agree replied harvath and i know exactly how we should handle it chapter manhattan robert ashford had provided harvath with the rough layout of james standings new york city apartment he had also provided an accurate picture of the billionaires personal security detail for the overnight shift only four men were kept on duty one was positioned in the lobby with the doorman while another was at the receiving entrance a third man remained in the apartment in a small security room located off the kitchen monitoring the buildings closedcircuit camera feed the fourth agent operated as a floater moving from position to position relieving the other men when it was time for their respective breaks and filling in as an impromptu driver when needed harvath had gained access to the building via the roof of an adjacent structure he made his way down the interior security stairs to the back door of standings apartment underneath which he slid a fiberoptic surveillance camera cupping the scope to his eye he slowly scanned the interior of the kitchen because of the angle he couldnt see into the security room but he had little doubt that the agent watching the cctv feeds was there retracting the camera harvath put it back in his pack and removed a short aluminum cylinder wrapped in clear tubing as well as a fullface respirator placing the respirator over his head he made sure the seal around his face was tight and then unwound the tubing from the cylinder and fed it beneath the door there was a barely perceptible hiss as he opened the valve and began to pump the contents of the cylinder into the kitchen threemethylfentanyl or mf as it was known was an opioid analgesic that ranged anywhere from four hundred to six thousand times more powerful than morphine depending upon what type of isomer it was combined with harvath was using a cis isomer which pushed the gas being emitted from the tube beneath the kitchen door to its most effective range it was the same substance used by the russians in the moscow theater hostage crisis in and was extremely tricky to work with minimum exposure could knock a person out for hours anything more than minimum exposure and the chances of overdose and death rose exponentially the common temptation to believe that if a little bit was good then a lot was better had to be avoided at all costs the russians had overadministered the substance in moscow and had ended up killing not only the hostagetakers but the hostages as well harvath kept a close eye on his watch and then reached down and shut off the gas he pulled the hose from under the door wrapped it around the cylinder and tucked the device back into his pack he then removed his lockpick gun and went to work opening the door a few clicks of the gun and a slight turn of the tensioning wrench later and he was in shouldering his pack he drew a suppressed glock and crept inside the door swung noiselessly on its welloiled hinges and harvath made sure to close and quietly lock it behind him the only illumination in the kitchen came from dim undercabinet lighting it took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the semidarkness around the corner he could see the glow of television monitors spilling into a narrow corridor cautiously harvath made his way forward he found standings agent slumped over a small desk in the tiny security room that had likely functioned as a maids quarters at some point reaching down with his latexgloved hand harvath felt for a pulse the security man was still alive glancing up he checked the monitors and located standings three other security men all of whom were still downstairs leaving the security room harvath passed through the kitchen pausing only long enough to open a window drop a piece of maroon foil from the top of an expensive bordeaux in the trash and locate a wineglass once he had taken care of those he headed for the master bedroom harvath estimated the apartment had to be at least ten thousand square feet once a safe distance from the kitchen he removed his respirator at the end of a long hallway carpeted with persian rugs its walls lined with silk tapestries was the door to james standings bedroom harvath slid his fiberoptic camera underneath the door and took another long slow look around satisfied that standing was in bed alone and still asleep harvath tucked the device into his pack and carefully opened the door his objective was approximately thirty feet away from standing on the other side of the billionaires enormous bed harvath had no doubt that somewhere near the bed there was a panic button so he crossed the room as quickly and as quietly as he could slipping into the master bathroom he set down his pack and organized his materials when he was ready he closed the drain and turned on the water in the tub james standing awoke to the sound of running water at first he thought it had been a dream but the longer the sound persisted the more he became convinced that it was in fact real and that it was coming from his bathroom but why would his bath be running still halfasleep he threw back his bedcovers and swung his feet out of bed sliding his feet into his stubbs amp woottons he ignored his robe and padded across the bedroom to figure out what the hell was going on as he got closer to the bathroom the sound of running water got louder and he picked up his pace pushing open the door he clicked on the lights and sure enough his bath was running how the hell was that possible walking across the polished marble floor he arrived at the tub and reached for the handle as he did he heard a voice from behind say let it fill up the voice so startled him that his heart nearly burst from his chest spinning around he saw a man completely dressed in black holding a suppressed pistol which was pointed right at him who are you the billionaire demanded what the hell are you doing in my apartment robert ashford sent me said harvath as he watched the fear etched on standings face deepen all i have to do is shout and my security team will be in who the three men downstairs or the one near the kitchen i already took care of the financier didnt reply you can shout if you want to but nobody is going to hear you standing looked as if he was thinking about doing just that but quickly decided not to what do you want are you here to arrest me harvath pulled a vial of pills from his pocket and tossed it to him eat eat what the hell are these laxatives why the hell would i want to take a bottle full of laxatives because youre about to go on a very long trip with no bathroom breaks said harvath what are you doing kidnapping me did that idiot ashford put you up to this im doing you a favor start chewing standing opened the bottle and dumped several of the pills into his hand he looked down and then threw the entire handful at harvath fuck you harvath smiled and tucked his pistol away at the small of his back reaching above the toilet he took down one of standings monogrammed bath towels and started walking forward instinctively the billionaire began backing away from him the moment he did harvath sprung twisting the towel tightly around standings head he used it to pull him offbalance as the older man fell harvath steered him toward the tub where he landed with a splash as soon as he hit the water harvath had him under it careful to do everything with even pressure across the towel so as not to leave any marks standing was strong for his age and struggled wildly after a few more seconds harvath let him up as his head broke the surface he sucked in huge gasps of air let me make this very clear said harvath youre going to take those pills understand me standing didnt respond but he was visibly shaken by the explosion of violence that had just occurred the tub was almost full and harvath turned off the water in his fall the billionaire had spilled the rest of the pills harvath scooped up a handful gave them to him and repeated his order eat this time standing did as he was told as the man sat soaking in his pajamas harvath removed an opened bottle of wine from his pack and pulled out the cork after filling the glass he walked over to the tub and handed it to standing drink he said red wine speeds up the process he hesitantly accepted the glass as if he was suddenly beginning to grasp that maybe he was being lied to drink harvath repeated all of it as the man tilted it back rivulets of wine ran down his chin and dripped into the water when the billionaire had drained the glass harvath refilled it the man didnt need to have the order repeated he knew he was supposed to drink he had consumed about half of the second glass when harvath told him to stop he could see the mans eyes were starting to have trouble focusing he needed to say what he was going to say now before the man could no longer grasp what was happening harvath sat down on the edge of the tub and leaned in so james standing could hear everything he was about to say listen to me very closely you son of a bitch those werent laxatives right now your heart is rapidly slowing down unable to pump blood through your body in about a minute youre going to find your lungs suddenly cant seem to get enough air and youre going to gasp for breaths that just wont come before you die i want you to know that everything you have spent your entire life working for has been completely undone every organization every company every foundation you have ever created all of it youre going to be known the world over for the monster you are your name will forever be synonymous with evil standing tried to speak to say something in response but he couldnt the words wouldnt come every family who lost someone in the attacks you financed will sue your estate and they will drain it of every last single penny people who once held you in high esteem will mock your memory or recoil in horror at the mention of your name all the money in the world cant prevent whats about to happen to you on behalf of every one of your victims i hope you rot in hell standing up harvath took the wineglass from standing and set it on the side of the tub along with the halfempty bottle he took the billionaires weakening fingers and pressed them against a straight razor which he dropped into the water along with the towel after mopping up the floor with a shammy hed brought in his pack harvath gathered up his belongings and exited the bathroom passing through the bedroom he stopped at a large flatscreen tv ejecting the tray of the dvd player beneath he inserted the disc nicholas had given him and turned everything on back in the kitchen the gas had dissipated closing the window he gave the security monitors one last check before leaving the apartment and the building the same way he had come in he could see the sun just beginning to come up as he crossed central park removing his cell phone he plugged in his earbuds and called carlton when the old man answered he simply said its done good carlton replied come home chapter one week later the story of james standings suicide made headlines around the world the question from hong kong to hartford though was why why would a man who had everything end his own life that question was answered days later when the new york post ran a frontpage story about documents and photos that had been sent to one of its page six gossip editors the story presumed to have been leaked by an nypd detective or forensics investigator detailed how standing had consumed a combination of wine and sleeping pills and climbed into his bathtub to slit his wrists before he could do so he succumbed to the overdose the razor was found after the tub had been drained the motivation for his death was said to be a dvd the police found in his bedroom it was a rough cut of a documentary entitled well endowed the film detailed how standing had funneled profits from several of his hedge fund clients into a grand plan designed to collapse the us government called project green ramp the film also included interrogation footage of two men both of whom had had their faces blurred one of the men whom the post claimed spoke english with a heavy russian accent could be seen admitting to having been hired to kill the films creative team executive producer larry salomon director chip marcus and associate producer jeremy andrews the mere suggestion that james standing might be connected to the multiple homicides in los angeles set the media on fire the real bombshell in the post story came from the interrogation of the second subject a british man who claimed that james standing had financed and planned the devastating wave of terrorist attacks that had killed so many innocent americans within hours of the new york post story the department of justice launched a formal investigation based on information provided by robert ashford and corroborated by mansoor aleem in iceland a detailed list of us cells within the unrestricted warfare terror network was developed and delivered to the fbi which in conjunction with the us marshals service and local law enforcement agencies orchestrated an amazing nationwide roundup of all of the terrorist suspects sean chase and pat murphy flew from iceland back to sweden and found mustafa karami and sabah right where ashford told them they would in a small apartment in stockholms redlight district chase was forced to use his left hand but dispatched karami with exceptional precision pat murphy on behalf of his teammates made sabah suffer he shot him in the knees and worked his way slowly upward until he decided to end it and put his last round in the giants forehead and the mans lifeless corpse slumped to the ground back in los angeles martin sevan accompanied larry salomon and luke ralston to a quiet meeting with lapd detectives and the los angeles county district attorney they were no longer active suspects in the murders that had taken place at larry salomons home martin sevan wanted the entire thing put to bed both of his clients wanted to get on with their lives with all of the buzz well endowed had received in the press larry salomon was eager to complete the films postproduction at first hed had no idea how james standing had gotten hold of a rough cut of the film but when he heard it included interrogation footage and that one of the men being interrogated was a russian he realized scot harvath must have been behind it though he wasnt officially asked to keep quiet about harvaths involvement he knew it was the right thing to do thanks to him everyone was clamoring to see well endowed several prestigious film festivals even offered to host sight unseen the premiere salomon though had a different idea if the communities would have him he wanted to screen the film in the cities and towns whose movie theaters had been attacked his plan was to show the film in outdoor venues it seemed only right that those who had been attacked get the first look at the documentary all the cities and towns had to say was yes salomon didnt want anything else from them he would cover all the screening costs he wanted to be part of helping people to heal and in a way maybe it would help him heal after the screening tour salomon planned to travel to israel he needed to make peace he needed to make peace with himself and with what had happened to rachael he no longer wanted to be the man he was he wanted to go back to being the man he had been before rachaels death to do that he needed to let go of a lot of things he hoped the screenings and time away would allow him to do that under martin sevans counsel they went through the formality of answering a final round of questions for the authorities and were then allowed to leave when luke ralston stepped outside he saw ali sevan waiting for him he exchanged a few words with larry and martin who walked off to their cars as he walked over to talk with ali case closed she asked case closed he replied he was surprised to see her and also surprised that her father hadnt even batted an eye when he saw her outside waiting for all of them what are you doing here i thought maybe we could have lunch lunch there are some things we should talk about ralston was unsure what to make of her offer does brent know youre here he asked referring to her husband thats one of the things i want to talk about she replied holding up her left hand he must have missed it on the beach but she wasnt wearing a wedding ring reading the look on his face she said weve been divorced for about six months when i asked you about him you said he was fine ali smiled i was telling you the truth as a lawyer im professionally forbidden to lie ralston smiled back well have to take your car he said mines going to be in the shop for a long time while the rest of the loose ends were being tied up the old man had sent harvath to paris for a meeting reed carlton had always had a good relationship with israeli intelligence harvaths assignment was to see that it continued he carried with him a file that detailed how james standing had intended to turn his sights on bringing down israel one of the worlds few other true democracies once the united states had been collapsed the billionaire had planned to draw israel into a war with its neighbors but on top of that he had developed a means to ensure that america would not come to her aid when israel most needed america standing planned to release documents that would make it appear that israel had created the aleem terror network a ruse to make americans believe that the israelis had ordered the terrorist attacks on the united states in order to manipulate public opinion and national policy the documents would allege that israel had dreamed up the elaborate plot in order to con america into rushing to israels aid because the same common enemy was attacking both nations the israeli intelligence officer harvath met with was grateful for the information as their meeting ended at the la closerie des lilas bar in montparnasse the israeli slid an envelope across the small table harvath was confused whats this he asked as the man stood up to leave i was told to give it to you when we were finished as the man walked out of the bar harvath opened the small envelope inside was a piece of paper with an address in the sixth arrondissement it was written in the old mans hand carlton had told him there was something else he wanted him to do in paris but he hadnt elaborated most likely the address was for the carlton groups new parisian safe house and thered be further instructions waiting for him there carlton could often be cryptic like that he compartmentalized everything revealing only as much as he felt you needed to know robert ashford could have had no clue about the nature of the new life and identity the old man had promised him in exchange for his cooperation the brit had made the mistake of referring to james standing as the worlds deadliest catch and that cemented his fate ashford was quite distraught once he learned that he was being relocated to alaska harvath could only imagine the look on the mi mans face once he discovered that his new career was nowhere near as pedestrian as recycling boxes at the fairbanks walmart rawhide was a ninetytwofoot crabfishing boat out of the aleutian islands port of dutch harbor in unalaska robert ashford was her newest deckhand the old man had kept his word but he had simultaneously sentenced ashford to a life of hard labor carlton had made it very clear that if ashford tried to run there was an open kill order for him and harvath would fill it personally the old man then turned yaroslav yatsko over to the cia though they might very well kick him out of the country and turn him loose the carlton group needed to purchase a modicum of goodwill with the agency harvath wanted to see the man tried for setting up the murders of the filmmakers and the attempted murder of larry salomon but the old man had his mind made up he did though make sure the cia intervened with the la county authorities on behalf of ralston and salomon and for that harvath was grateful stepping out of the bar he turned up the collar of his coat it was a chilly night but harvath decided to walk anyway and headed north unlike venice paris was a city that could be romantic and still not make you feel selfconscious about walking its streets alone as he walked he remembered the last time he had been in paris he had been sitting in a cafe ready to propose to a woman with whom he thought he could spend the rest of his life and leave his career behind when his career had reappeared and sucked him back in it hadnt been that long ago but it seemed like a lifetime so much had happened since so much had changed couples passed by on the sidewalk they seemed oblivious to his presence too wrapped up in each other to even notice him harvath shook his head and moved on he wondered where he was going and why the old man had transmitted the address through the israeli entering the sixth arrondissement he conducted another round of sdrs finally he arrived at the address he stood outside looking up at the limestone facade of the building with its black wroughtiron balconettes the ground floor consisted of a patisserie and a wine shop separated by a security door that likely provided entrance to the dwellings above harvath studied the note again there wasnt any name just the address as he removed his cell phone to call the old man it vibrated with a text message harvath clicked on it it was from carlton all it said was ring harvath approached the buzzers number was listed under the name bonduelle he pressed the button moments later the door clicked open harvath stepped into the eighteenthcentury lobby a gilded cagestyle elevator was surrounded by a stained marble staircase not a fan of tiny elevators harvath opted for the stairs and began climbing stepping onto the landing he found the light switch timer and depressed it to give him enough light to navigate the hallway as he walked past the old scarred doors he wondered what his next assignment would be the sounds of french programming could be heard from each apartment he passed until he reached number from behind the large wooden door he could hear music playing it sounded like pavarotti reaching out he twisted the brass handle which rang the bell inside and then he waited the music turned down there was the sound of footfalls approaching the door and then a pause as someone gazed out the peephole the metal clacking of an old lock sounded and the old door creaked as it was slowly pulled open inside stood a woman in jeans and a white buttondown shirt her reddishbrown hair fell past her shoulders even in the halflight of the hall her blue eyes shone harvath was taken completely by surprise her lips spread into a smile hello scot she said softly he was about to lean forward and kiss her when he noticed movement at the stairs gun he yelled and knocked riley turner back into the apartment just as a hail of bullets splintered the door frame
